I ran numbers and was surprised how much lower risk I found buying call and put options, more so call options, to be then I originally thought they would be. I realized that in the short term especially, a high success rate seems achievable. Of course they are very risky but I was surprised at how achievable it was.\n\nIn many ways, trading calls is very much like trading stocks, except that your initial capital outlay can either be a lot lower which lowers total risk of ruin, or you use the same capital as for trading stocks and gain leverage.\n\nHowever, in your what-if numbers, did you account for all the risks that are unique to options, like expiration risk and theta decay? Perhaps those are \"the catch\" over trading stocks.\n\n> I wanted to keep it realistic so I gave myself a max budget of $1000 on all of my trades. After 3 call options and 1 put throughout the day, I ended up with a profit of $600 realized by the end of the day.

I started trading when GME was all over the media. Recently, I got overexcited and bought some simple options for other stocks with real money, following external advice. I was convinced but, buying, it felt like I didn't know what I was doing.\n\nI have been using IBKR (great for Europeans wanting to access the US markets) and their desktop platform to make trades. My reasoning was: use a stock chart to try and guess what the price will likely go to in a given time period and buy options based on that estimate, with a matching strike price and expiry date.\n\nUnfortunately, that strategy (is it one?) still left many choices and I've had a hard time figuring out what a good trade and deal would be, knowing I would probably lose my money and should at least limit the amount invested.\n\nFor example, I researched AMD and bet that it would reach 95/100$ in a month and a half or less. So I looked for options around April 23. However, calls seemed to be weirdly priced. Sometimes, earlier calls (April 16) would be more expensive or calls with lower strike prices would be cheaper.\n\nThen, as I would try to get what I thought was a good deal, my orders wouldn't get filled. Trying to take advantage of the discrepancy in prices between various calls, I set up OCA calls with several strike prices. The whole process felt unecessarily cumbersome as I also had to manually raise the price tick by tick not to feel like I got scammed.\n\nEven as I put a limit price, if the order got filled it would be at the maximum price and not below. In the end, I paid 1.81 for an April 23 AMD call at 88.5$. But despite all of my efforts, I realized later on, looking at the time and sales, that I overpaid for the option, not knowing its reasonable price range. The T&S showed orders being filled at the bid price, which later fell at 0.14$ (for a 2$ ask). But my orders would not get filled unless I uped the price toward the ask.\n\nSo, I'm wondering if there is a way to:\n\n* Automate the painful work of having to find the best deal over several options in terms of ROI given a price estimate at a specific date\n* Time an entry on the short term to avoid overpaying for an option\n* Get a sense of the evolution of the price of a range of options to define levels, entry and exit points\n* Achieve, like some traders, a fill at the bid price\n\nThanks for taking the time to read and possibly answer my questions!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "There's a lot to discuss here, good post!

However, calls seemed to be weirdly priced. Sometimes, earlier calls (April 16) would be more expensive or calls with lower strike prices would be cheaper.\n\nFirst, this rule: Prioritize liquidity over everything else when it comes to option selection. The best strategy can't win if liquidity is bad. You can't expect a horse with a broken leg to win a race, the same thing applies to option chains with bad liquidity. Look for chains with high volume and narrow bid/ask spreads. You can usually find these on monthly expirations.\n\nApril 23 is a weekly expiration and, looking at the chain, the liquidity is significantly worse, like 10x worse, than the April monthly or May monthly expirations.\n\n> Even as I put a limit price, if the order got filled it would be at the maximum price and not below.\n\nWhat you experienced is exactly what bad liquidity looks like.\n\nIf you had used a chain with better liquidity, none of your bullet points would be necessary.

The fact that the option is deep ITM suggests that it should be trading closer to parity as expiration approaches. Further away from expiration, though, IV can have a dramatic impact on pricing. In October/November of 2019, QCOM saw a quick run up of about 20 points followed by a quick fall of about 10 points. These quick moves would have correlated with spikes in IV. It then traded relatively sideways for a period. This would have correlated with a reduction in IV. The loss of value he is describing is probably due to decreasing IV. This was likely due to “IV crush” around the Nov. 6, 2019 Q4 earnings call.\n\nAs to OP’s original question about selling, you would likely be able to sell the option, but after going through price discovery, you would likely find that you would need to lower your ask below the midpoint of the spread in order to get a fill.

When the bid/ask sizes are radically different in the ask's favor, it can mean more demand than supply. But it's not a certainty. For one thing, the sizes reported understate the actual market.

Whenever you hedge, you should compare your upside to the unhedged position to see what you are losing. In this case, you are in the hole by ($7 x 3) + ($2 x 3) = $27/share on the hedge alone.

(long comment) \n\nI've read online that naked calls are the riskiest option trade one can make because one risks unlimited loss (upside movement) for limited reward (premium received). I would like to know to what extent this generalisation is true. I present my own opinion on naked calls and I would appreciate your feedback / opinion. TL; DR at the end. \n\nThe Greeks:\n\nNaked calls are short delta, Gamma, Vega. While long theta. \n\nVega essentially acts as an hedge to delta by reducing the rate at which one makes a profit or loss.  This is due to the negative correlation Vega (generally) has with stock movement. If a stock rises in price (loss on delta), IV will go down (profit on Vega). The  opposite is true as well. This makes price movement of (long dated) naked calls less volatile (less risky) \n\nAnother inherent advantage of short options is time decay. Meaning that time works in favor of the call writer. This makes naked calls suitable to be held over a longer time period and increases the probability of profit. \n\nHistorical stock price movement:\n\nStocks generally take the stairs up, and the lift down. Although stocks generally increase in value over time, the magnitude in which the stock moves up in a given time period is on the smaller side. Significant upward crashes are less likely and of smaller magnitude than downward crashes. Both naked calls and CSP pose significant risk if the underlying moves significantly. However,  a true downward crash happens far more often and is of far bigger magnitude than an upward crash. Hence the put call skew. This makes it far more likely for an account to be close to wiped out due to CSP puts than due to naked calls. \n\nIn conclusion, i believe that naked calls are inherently  less volatile (short Vega), have high probability of profit (long theta) and have low risk of significant loss (upward crashes happen little and are of small magnitude compared to downward crashes). Therefore, I believe too simple to state that naked calls is the riskiest option strategy one can use. \n\nComparison to other strategies:\n\nRisk is relative. Therefore, I compared naked calls to  CSP that's are considered less risky. \n\n1. CSP: CSP are inherently more volatile than calls. CSP are short Vega. This effectively means that Vega is amplifying delta. Downward movement (loss delta) generally results in an increase in IV (loss Vega). The opposite is true as well. This means Vega amplifies both profit and loss. Therefore, CSP are  more volatile and thus pose more risk than naked calls. \n\nAn argument in favour of CSP compared to naked calls is that a stock can only go to zero. Therefore CSP are risk defined, while calls theoretically have unlimited loss potential. Thus naked call must be more risky. \n\nIn my opinion this reasoning is flawed. Besides the negligible chance of a stock more than doubling during the lifespan of the short call (thus losing more than money selling a put could would've lost if the stock went to zero). We can simply buy a very far otm (+80% strike price) call option for 0.01 to cap the max loss and have 'defined' risk. This would be a spread, but no one would make such a spread as that long call would realistically provide no protection. Thus making the long call / the risk beyond the long call redundant. \n\nAnother argument would be that by selling a CSP one comes to own the underlying stock if assigned. In comparison, a naked call would leave one with a cash loss / empty hands. \n\nHowever, the validity of this argument depends on what one considers value and depends on one's directional bias. Let's make an example:\n\nInitial capital (cash) = €900\n\nStock ABC trades for 10.00\nSold 9.00 put for 0.10 credit \nStock ABC drops to 8.00 and we're assigned. \n\nWe now own 100 shares. We effectively paid €890 and the current value is €800. Therefore our paper loss is €90 euro. Our total capital is €810  in stocks. \n\nWe have effectively taken a long position, in which we allocated our capital from cash into stocks. \n\nLet's now make the same trade using naked calls. \n\nInitial capital (cash) = €900\n\nStock ABC trades for 10.00\nSold 11.00 put for 0.10 credit\nStock ABC rises to 12.00 and we're assigned / pay the difference / buy back te call for 1.00\n\nWe bought 100 shares for €1190. And sold 100 shares for €1100. We effectively realised a €90 loss  and don't own any stocks. Our total capital is €810 in cash.\n\nWe have effectively no directional position on the stock. We kept our capital in cash. \n\nThus we can conclude that both positions would result in the same total loss (€90). Only the capital allocation is different (cash vs stock). If we consider the value of the stock to be the same as its value in cash, we can conclude that it's a circle reasoning to claim that selling a CSP at least leaves you with the underlying stock (= €890 in value) while a naked call would leave you with empty hands  (you still own €890 value in cash!) \n\nDirectionality is the key difference. By selling a CSP you effectively take direction (bullish) after aaaignment . By selling a naked call you call it a game after assignment. We could short the stock after a naked call assignment to keep the example symmetrical to the put assignment, but shorting stock is a whole different beast. \n\nIn conclusion I consider CSP to be more risky than naked calls because CSP inherently present more volatility and forces one to take a directional position after assignment. Their maximum risk profiles are effectively and realically the same. \n\nWhat is you opinion / what did I not address appropriately according to you? \n\nTL; DR: Naked call are not as risky as most claim because of the following: Calls are inherently less volatile as they're short Vega. Time decay / extrinsic value increases the probability of profit. When looking at historical price movement, we rarely see a crash upwards (stocks take the stairs up and lift down) meaning naked calls have a small chance of wiping your account (especially compared to CSP).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Vega essentially acts as an hedge to delta by reducing the rate at which one makes a profit or loss.  This is due to the negative correlation Vega (generally) has with stock movement. If a stock rises in price (loss on delta), IV will go down (profit on Vega). The  opposite is true as well. This makes price movement of (long dated) naked calls less volatile (less risky)\n\nThose statements are not always true. IV can move the same direction as underlying price. Even if they are usually true, calling vega a \"hedge\" of delta is mostly wrong.\n\n> Another inherent advantage of short options is time decay. Meaning that time works in favor of the call writer. This makes naked calls suitable to be held over a longer time period and increases the probability of profit.\n\nWhile true, all the theta in the world isn't going to help you if delta moves against you. Delta is usually an order of magnitude larger than theta so small moves in underlying price can wipe out any gains in theta, on a day by day basis.\n\n> In conclusion, i believe that naked calls are inherently less volatile (short Vega), have high probability of profit (long theta) and have low risk of significant loss (upward crashes happen little and are of small magnitude compared to downward crashes). Thus making the long call / the risk beyond the long call redundant.\n\nYour premise is faulty, which means so is your conclusion. \n\n> Let's now make the same trade using **naked calls**.\n> \n> Initial capital (cash) = €900\n> \n> Stock ABC trades for 10.00 **Sold 11.00 put** for 0.10 credit Stock ABC rises to 12.00 and we're assigned / pay the difference / buy back te call for 1.00\n> \n> We bought 100 shares for €1190. And sold 100 shares for €1100. We effectively realised a €90 loss and don't own any stocks. Our total capital is €810 in cash.\n\nYour example of naked calls says \"put\". And in any case, there is no point in making an example, because the original statement is false:\n\n>  a naked call would leave one with a cash loss / empty hands.\n\nNo. A short call delivers shares and receives cash. After assignment, you will have cash and a short position on shares. One call would make you short -100 shares.\n\n\n> In conclusion I consider CSP to be more risky than naked calls because CSP inherently present more volatility and forces one to take a directional position after assignment. Their maximum risk profiles are effectively and realically the same.\n\nFirst you say CSP is more risky, but then you say the risk profiles are the same. There's not point in trying to untangle this, because the premise that a CSP is more risky than a naked short call is absurd to begin with.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nThe sad thing is that a more convincing argument could have been made based on skewness and kurtosis in the distribution of outcomes. If kurtosis and skewness are both zero and the mean is far enough above $0 that a fall to $0 is several sigmas improbable, one could argue that naked calls are no more risky than naked puts. \n\nBut those are big ifs, since typical distribution of outcomes for stocks have positive skewness and some kurtosis. The upshot being, naked calls are usually more risky than naked puts.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "**How likely are options that become ITM to be exercised before expiration?**\n\nHello, I am somewhat new to options trading and I was wondering if anyone had any data on whether Option buyers tend to exercise early once an option becomes ITM or wait until expiration?

I found an interesting scenaio that just popped up on some of my options from shares I hold long term and was wondering if theres any validity to this strategy.\n\nScenario: \n\n1. Sold covered calls for RDSA (Shell) dated Sept 17th at a srtike of $55 for $1.03 to collect premium\n2. As price rose over the time period of holding the option, the premium cost increased to $1.25\n3. The Oct 15th at a strike $55 the same day was trading for $1.40\n4. I closed the Sept 17th position at a loss of $0.22/option and opened a Oct 15th at the same strike for $1.40. Rather than increase the total premium I would recieve, i changed the strike on a few of the options to $60 so that the total $$ is maintained and i hold more upside potential.\n\nIn all I harvested $22/option in losses and retained the same strike at a later date in the future at a higher premium. \n\nSo the strategy would be as such:\n\nIf the option value increases after opening the call positon, look to harvest that loss. Sell new options at a later date with same/higher strike to continue the position and reclaim the premium lost from closeing the original position.\n\nThis couldnt be considered a wash sale because the options are held under different strikes and dates right?\n\nUpsides: Reclaim more of the upside potential on longer dates options whilst maintaining the premium from the original option position. Tax loss harvesting against other options trades\n\nDownsides: Still retain all of the downside risk for the security and loss of upside potential for a longer time into the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs this a viable strategy? or am i missing some fatal flaw in this plan.

But that's just my opinion.\n\n> My general goal is to try out 'spreads' and turn $350 into 1000 dollars with no real time limit.\n\nAssuming an average 20% nominal annual return, that will take between 5 and 6 years.

It's good to run some what-if numbers to have reasonable expectations on time frame and rates of return.\n\n> I had been suggested to use debit spreads or \"poor man's covers\" as I have been told.\n\nThose are two different things. \"Debit spreads\" are probably meant to be vertical spreads and \"poor man's cover's\" are Poor Man's Covered Calls, which is just a nickname for a call diagonal where the back leg is a deep ITM LEAPS long call. Other nicknames are \"figleaf spread\" and \"leveraged covered calls\". \n\nhttps://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/long-call-spread/\n\nhttps://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/leveraged-covered-call/\n\n\n> Is this considered a decent strategy to use for someone starting out?\n\nVertical spreads, yes. Maybe not diagonals, as they can be more expensive up front.\n\n> If so, would it be better to close the contract a day or so before expiration?\n\nEverything about options is a trade-off, so before I can say what is better and what is worse, you have to tell me what you want to trade-off. Longer holding times give you more time to hit your targets, but  increases losses due to theta decay. Holding for shorter times increases losses due to incorrect or mistimed forecasts, but decreases theta decay. \n\nWhat I recommend in general is define an exit strategy *before* opening a trade. A minimal exit strategy is a profit target, a loss limit, and a maximum holding time. The exit strategy I use for debit vertical spreads is 10% gain on the initial debit, 20% loss on the initial debit, and exit before 12 days to expiration (DTE). The last criteria minimizes losses due to theta decay. Waiting until the day before expiration is maximum theta decay. I also make sure that my trade is entered (delta of strikes and expiration) so that I have at least a 70% chance to exit for a gain. That insures that my trade has positive expectation.\n\n> Is it better to have the calls closer to the strike price and if so, why is that?\n\nAgain, it's a trade-off.

That is why it is extremely important to write the strike **above** your cost basis. Otherwise you are locking in a loss.\n\n> Or if it goes up, but expires otm or goes down I keep the whole premium and keep the shares so that I can write more cc's?\n\nCorrect.\n\n> Basically if I wanted to close out before expiry right? \n\nClose or roll, yes.\n\n> If the stock shot to $50 a share, I would just be assigned right?

If you are assigned, you would keep all of the credit and the shares would be called away at the strike price. You would not have to buy back the call for a loss. That's why the recommended handling of an ITM CC is to hold until expiration and take assignment. Don't try to \"fix\" the call, the trade is winning, leave it alone.\n\nAs a consequence of that recommendation, don't pick expirations that are too far out. Some people have been writing 2 year CCs, which is crazy. Their stock price goes over their strike in a couple of weeks and they are stuck looking at a losing call for another 2 years. Not to mention their shares are locked up and they can't do anything with them.\n\n> Figured the gains or losses were negligible until the market opens and refreshes data. \n\nThat is entirely possible.

If the option stays ITM and I sell it at expiration for profit and then buy shares, which I still want to own, my cost basis would be at current market price.

Now the option will retain some extrinsic value before expiry. When you sell that option (sell to close in your case) you receive that extrinsic value present in the option premium at that point of time. If you instead exercise the option then you will get the stock at SP and the extrinsic value you paid when buying the option is lost/ can not be recovered. That is the loss.  In your ex let's say F is trading at 13 then your 10.5C will be going for a price more than $2.5 to account for remaining time and expectation of going up further. Let's say it is as small as $0.05 Now if you sell the option you will receive $255 per option. Instead if you exercise then your effective purchase price for the stock is 12.75 and you will sell at $13 to get $250 for 100 shares. The loss of $5 is same as the extrinsic value that did not get harvested because you chose to exercise the option. \n\nSo the advice is almost always to sell the option and not to exercise. \n\n> if thats the route I take and I own 100 shares,  I am going to sell a 13.50p 3/19 exp. \n\nI am a bit confused here. When you have cash in a/c you sell puts and take the obligation to buy shares at the SP. When you have the shares in your a/c then you sell call and take the obligation of delivering the shares. So selling a put after purchasing the shares is not clear.\n\n> Is my thinking correct that at the end of expiration I would profit $13 and still own my 100 shares of stock? \n\n If F closed below 13.5 and the PUT gets assigned then you will have to buy 100 more shares of Ford at 13.5 in addition to the 100 you already own. Your 13.5C will expire worthless so the premium you paid on it is lost. Net your cost basis for these later shares would be (13.5 - premium received on PUT + premium paid on the Call). If F closes above 13.5 then your P/L would be (current price of Ford - 13.5 - premium paid on Call + premium received on Put). Depending on how far above 13.5 F closes and those Call put premiums that number can be positive or negative. $13 profit is not guaranteed. \n\nAt the very beginning if you wanted to buy F the right trade was to sell a CSP (Cash secured Put) and collect either the premium or buy the stock cheaper.

Don't trade half-assed, though points for being aware that it was half-assed.\n\n\n> Is the argument that the profit from holding the call and selling at expiration will make up for the difference in the market value of stock - (strike+premium)?\n\nNo. For a given date before expiration, the profit from selling the call is usually higher than the unrealized profit of exercising. That's what we mean by \"throwing away extrinsic value.\"\n\nExample:\n\nYou bought the call for $2.25. Let's assume the current price of F is $13.50. Let's make the value of the call something like $3.05 at the time you decide to exercise (Friday's closing ask when F closed at $13.37 was $2.93, so that should be pretty close.)\n\nIf you exercise, your unrealized profit = ($13.50 - $10.50 - $2.25) = $0.75/share. Ignoring exercise fees.\n\nIf you sell to close the call instead of exercising, realized profit = $3.05 - $2.25 = $0.80/share. Ignoring transaction fees.\n\nSince $0.80 is $0.05 higher than the $0.75 unrealized profit you get from exercising, you throw away that $0.05/share by exercising.\n\nAnd of course, if the call is worth more than $3.05 for a $13.50 F price, you lose even more by exercising. But if the ITM call has no extrinsic value and is equal in value to the difference in strike and underlying price, this is less of a concern.\n\nWriting a put at the same strike while exercising the call should capture most of that extrinsic value and maybe more, if there is put/call skew in your favor.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Let's say that I'm undoubtedly sure that a stock is going to lose 50% of its value sometime in the next 10 to 30 days.

Vertical spreads on weekly RUT and monthly SPY contracts. Since the March '20 bottom, I have been trading pull put spreads on RUTW and SPY. I generally look for either the first fibonacci level or a support level around the 10% mark and sell my put there, then buy a put a couple of strikes lower. I have found the RUTW generates about $150 per week and the SPY can generate about $250 a month. Given the strikes are between 10% and 20% lower than current level, I consider this to be low risk. I have looked online though and it doesn't seem as popular as I would have expected - it is virtually (almost) free money.

{"title": "Long DD on NIO and why the dip has made it undervalued", "selftext": "\\- Original post by u/JustOnTheHorizon_ on r/DueDiligenceArchive. Obligatory none of this is financial advice. Keep in mind that pieces of info/data may have changed with time. Date of original post Mar. 7 2021.  -\n\n**Nio is the undervalued EV play to consider in this dip.**\n\n# Introduction\n\nLet's get started. If this looks too long for you, please know that half of it is literally pictures. Just gonna say right here that I'm not going to be detailing this down to the point of analyzing every car model the company sells, even though it's probably important. Mainly because I'm lazy and don't want to write that much, but I am for sure no expert in cars at all and I don't have the qualifications to lecture you on car models. Maybe some car genius in the comments will. Also, I'm not gonna be discussing sector rotation or whatever. Figure out how to play it if based on your market thesis. Alright enough chit chat let's get to business.\n\nKeep in mind the recent price range: $38-31\n\n**Company Biography:**\n\nNIO Limited designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The company offers five, six, and seven-seater electric SUVs. It is also involved in the provision of energy and service packages to its users; marketing, design, and technology development activities; manufacture of e-powertrains, battery packs, and components; and sales and after sales management activities. In addition, the company offers charging solutions, including Power Home, a home charging solution; Power Swap, a battery swapping service; Power Mobile, a mobile charging service through charging trucks; Public Charger, a public fast charging solution; and Power Express, a 24-hour on-demand pick-up and drop-off charging service. Further, it provides value-added services, such as statutory and third-party liability insurance, and vehicle damage insurance through third-party insurers; repair and routine maintenance services; courtesy car services during lengthy repairs and maintenance; and roadside assistance, as well as data packages. NIO Limited has a strategic collaboration with Mobileye N.V. for the development of automated and autonomous vehicles; and collaboration agreements with various manufacturers for the manufacture of ES8, a six or seven-seater high-performance electric SUV.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n\\- Sells and Manufactures a variety of luxury cars\n\n\\- Offers a multitude of charging solutions\n\n\\- Offers BaaS (Battery as a subscription service, meaning NIO owners subscribe and essentially rent out the battery for the car but we'll get to that later)\n\n\\- Provides vehicle damage insurance, statutory and third-party liability insurance (Statutory meaning its required by law to own)\n\n\\- Offers repair and routine maintenance services and roadside assistance, and data packages\n\nNow that's a handful and we don't have all day, so we'll primarily be focusing on the main event which is their car line and BaaS. This does not mean you should disregard the other packages when viewing it as an investment, it just means I'm too lazy to do research on the other things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Market and Competition\n\n**Market**\n\nHonestly pretty much everyone knows where the EV market is heading and how it's the future, but it's worth mentioning regardless.\n\nThe EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21%, and hit 30 Million Cars worldwide by 2030. By 2026, worldwide EV revenue is expected hit roughly half a trillion USD, or $500 Billion. (Also, for those who aren't sure what a CAGR is, it means that the market on average is expected to grow by 21%. Not overall, but 21% year by year; take a second to appreciate the compound growth effect that will occur.) What's more, is that the Asia Pacific market (Where NIO primarily is) is reported to have the fastest growth. Here's a graph that represents these projections.\n\nIf we take a more specific look to NIO's market, analysts have recently upgraded previous forecasts, now claiming that 20% of the vehicle fleet will be EV by 2025. Beyond that, the forecasts for 2035 and 2050 are 53% and 80% penetration, respectively.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nThe Chinese EV market has quite a few players on the board, so strategy is pretty important to differentiate and forge a unique business model. Nio's strategic goal is to have a consistent, stable order flow, rather than a fluctuating order backlog similar to Tesla. (Courtesy of J.P Morgan) By keeping pricing steady, Nio's focus lies on services and customer experience driving a positive reputation in the community and keeping engagement high; it also allows gross and vehicle margin to find stable ground as volumes rise.\n\nWe could also discuss their consumer relationship, and how their dealerships double as community grounds for owners to hang out. [Apparently](https://web.archive.org/web/20210110170556if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kucf6r/chinese_autist_here_gonna_share_you_western/) Nio has even more of a cult then Tesla, but I don't have the experience to confirm that. Regardless, between their own app for owners, special owner events, and communal spaces, it is clear that Nio strives to form a strong and loyal customer base.\n\nBaaS. Battery as a Service. Or rather, a subscription. Nio has chosen to distribute batteries in a non-traditional manner, electing to not include it with the sale of their vehicles and instead letting consumers chose and rent batteries depending on their personal needs. This shaves off roughly $10,000 off the price of their vehicles, which in turn boosts Nio's price competitiveness and demand. Also, BaaS acts as an additional revenue source for Nio that will continue to generate cash by nature even if sales take a hit. Nio has hit roughly 1 Million battery swaps thus far, and these swapping stations even support the EV's of other automakers. This flexibility of compatibility with other EV's makes Nio-power (The battery swapping stations) much easier to scale. You may be thinking, does this benefit the consumer in anyway? Sure it does. The custom battery solutions offer a chance for consumers to cater to their own needs. Some people aren't able to have their own home charging stations; many don't even have a consistent parking spot they can rely on daily. Also, consumers can customize depending on their own driving habits; if you can't afford to bleed money on certain battery solution, downgrade. Going on a large roadtrip? No problem, just rent a larger battery size. However, the most appealing benefit to consumers is the protection from battery degradation. Instead of being stuck with a dated or low-end battery, all Nio vehicles use the same size of battery. What does this mean? Well, basically you don't need to worry about the value of your battery depreciating as new advancements make it absolute. Consumers can upgrade to the latest and most powerful battery pack, and one size fits all. This improves resale value, and provides a future proof battery system. Overall the BaaS may attract a decent amount of controversy (it does have some drawbacks that I touch on later), but I'm personally a fan because it's very pro-consumer, improves brand visibility (There's hundreds of these things and other EV's can use them attracting more traffic), and offers Nio Inc. another revenue stream. To recap: Extra revenue stream, easy to scale, brand visibility, and very pro-consumer.\n\nAnother thing that's worth mentioning is that the Chinese government favors BaaS companies when it comes to benefits, so there's that too.\n\n**Catalysts**\n\nI don't actually have a lot of research in this area, so if anyone in the comments recalls a catalyst or two share it and I'll add it in.\n\n\\- European Market Expansion\n\n\\- Rapid Clean Tech Movement\n\n\\- New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors\n\n\\- NIO partnership with Chinese industrial park at Hefei, which will reportedly produce 300,000 clean energy vehicles a year\n\n\\- Speculation: Potential expansion to the American Market down the road. This is pure speculation, but here's an article written by [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-chinese-ev-maker-nio-might-be-coming-to-america-51612892800) claiming that Nio Inc. has been attempting to formulate an action plan to enter the U.S. Market.\n\n**Local environment**\n\nLet's take a quick peek at Nio's infrastructure. As previously mentioned, they've chosen to offer battery as a subscription service, or BaaS for short. Now, we've already talked about the strategy and benefits behind this choice, but how well are they executing? As of right now, NIO currently has roughly 143 battery changing stations in China, and they plan to almost double that number by adding 100 more. Additionally, they've partnered with the Chinese state's grid to help establish these new battery swapping stations.\n\nThis all sounds great, right? We've discussed the benefits of a BaaS system and looked over the infrastructure they've established. There is of course, a predictable drawback that I should mention. Because NIO has decided to manufacture and run their company this way, other markets that lack China's battery swapping infrastructure will be harder to crack into, because they will require heavy investment and development to create a Nio-power network that allows for battery swapping. Just something to keep in mind when considering European and North American markets, because there has been some buzz about NIO entering those areas. Anyway, let's move on.\n\nNow as you probably know, NIO is a China based EV company. Why is that a good thing exactly? Well, here's why. The Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025.  On top of that, China is the largest Wind and Solar energy producer in the world, and even further, they're the largest investor in renewable energies. OK, IDGAF where's the relation to cars? It's not super concrete, but there is one; these pieces of evidence prove China's firm and absolute take on clean tech and energy. They've been busting their butts and paying and arm and a leg in the cause of clean energy, so you know they'll do everything they can to implement it as much as possible. Also it should make you feel more confident in their goals, and how large the Chinese EV market is/How fast the Chinese EV market will grow. Actually, let's take a closer look at the Chinese environment with some numbers and facts.\n\n\\- China is the *largest* EV market in the world, representing roughly *50%* of worldwide sales.\n\n\\- From 2019 to 2020, Chinese EV sales increased *550%,* from 200,00 units to 1,300,000 units.\n\n\\- China expects sales to grow nearly *40%* this year despite the pandemic, growing from 1,300,000 units to over 1,800,000 units.\n\nBetween these statistics and China's firm stance on clean tech and the EV market, we can conclude that NIO's local environment is well suited for growth and stability.\n\n# Financials and Numbers\n\nNot gonna do much talking here, just sharing some numbers and you make with it what you will.\n\n**Q4 Positive Highlights and Outlook**\n\n* Q4 Revenues grew 46.7% Quarter over Quarter, reaching $1.02 Billion, while many expected $1.04 Billion.\n* Deliveries reached 17,000 Units for Q4. For reference they sold 40,000 units in 2020.\n* NIO projects 20,000+ Units for Q1 of 2021, which is 15% quarter over quarter. Again, for reference they sold 40,000 units for 2020. What's more is that in Q1 2020, they only sold 4k cars but in Q1 2021 they're projected to do **400%** that number a year later. This type of growth is probably the most appealing aspect to potential investors the way I see it.\n* Gross and Vehicle Margin grew to 17.2%\n* NIO generated positive cash-flow\n* Despite the tech restraints from battery/chip shortages, management says production levels will be able to remain 'normal'\n* Even with the production constraints through Q2, NIO's outright delivery and revenue growth are visible - the company is on track to deliver nearly the same amount of cars in Q1/Q2 as it had in 2020.\n* NIO trades at about 13.1x projected FY21 revenues\n\n**Q4 Negative Highlights**\n\n* Due to the Semiconductor/Chip Shortage, NIO is expecting a bit of a bump in the road in terms of deliveries in the early half of the year\n* With the combination of chip and battery constraints, NIO expects monthly production through Q2 to cap around \\~7,500 units,  a 25% decrease from Q1 projections.\n* Net Loss for Q4 clocked in at $1.3 Billion USD\n* Operating Losses weren't reduced a whole lot\n* Missed EPS estimates\n* No dividend\n\n# Investment Outlook\n\n**Analyst Consensus**\n\nNeed a third opinion? This is one of the **biggest green flags** IMO. These ratings really show how undervalued NIO truly is. Here's a compilation of some price targets from some of the biggest and most influential banks. Please keep in mind NIO's recent price activity: 31-38 (As of Mar. 5)\n\nPrice targets:\n\n\\- HSBC: $49\n\n\\- Morgan Stanley: $80\n\n\\- J.P. Morgan: $75\n\n\\- Deutsche: $70\n\n\\- Bank of America: $70\n\n\\- Goldman Sachs: $64\n\n\\- Daiwa: $100\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nObviously the EV market and the growth opportunity it presents is fantastic, especially the Asia Pacific market, but I'm also a big fan of their strategic approach. Feel free to debate me on that. I've also heard a lot of praise regarding their management, seen a lot of fans of [William Li](https://www.forbes.com/profile/william-li/?sh=894e17911a13), calling him a genius and the 'Elon Musk of China'. There's a couple things I've missed in this DD; I probably should've touched on the competition, their other services/packages, and done a thorough breakdown on their vehicles, but I'm really no expert in those fields so I'll leave that to others.\n\nFor this thesis, I think it's important to keep in mind how much the price has dipped recently. I mean within the past month it's been as high as 61, and as low as 31. EV's have taken a beating in these red days, and may even continue to decrease. I personally find any prices under 35 extremely appealing, but that general sub 40 area is pretty solid IMO. Hell, it almost went sub 30 on the 5th. I primarily like the growth opportunity Nio presents, especially when considering the discount its been at. It's also important to recognize that these dips may continue with tech/growth/EV stocks, so probably factor that into your opinion and remember to also consider the long term prospect.\n\nThis took hours, hope you enjoyed.\n\nMy positions: None, I'm absolutely broke, I just like to write analyses and research.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**-** Good growth opportunity\n\n\\- Good market (Local environment too)\n\n\\- Good strategic approach\n\n\\- The bigwig banks have price targets way higher above where it currently sits\n\n\\- Huge dip (50% at one point)", "id": "m0h5v5", "created_utc": 1615214775.0, "score": 341, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 239, "comments": [{"body": "Didn't read your DD but i agree at 37$ its a steal.

It sold 43,738 EVs in 2020, making it only the 8th largest EV manufacturer in China, trailing Tesla, Wuling, BYD, SAIC, GAC, Great Wall and Chery. Now that's not bad for a start-up. Dozens of new EV makers sprang up in China in recent years, most have gone bust. NIO is among the few serious contenders and I’m sure it will survive, its sales may even go up. I am just not convinced that it is well-positioned to maintain its edge in the segment:\n\n(1) NIO fills a particular niche: If you do not have a licence to buy petrol cars (e.g. in Beijing) but need a large SUV, then until recently NIO ES8 and ES6 were your only options. My high school mate bought an ES8 in 2018 for that reason, but he said he would either downgrade to Tesla Model Y or upgrade to Jaguar I-PACE/Mercedes EQC if he were in the market in 2021. \n\nNIO's appeal remains in the metropolitan upper middle class. Unlike Tesla, it does not have a budget offering. Tesla Model 3 retails for US$38,324 in China, the cheapest NIO, the EC6, starts at US$54,206, the ES8 is close to US$70,000. NIO also seems to be upholding the 'premium' image. They just released a BMW 7 series competitor (EP7), now seriously, how many people are going to buy it? As premium brands start to get serious with EV, competition in this segment is going to be brutal. Other Chinese carmakers are also going upmarket (e.g. Geely's Lynk & CO., Great Wall's WEY brand). NIO is going to feel the squeeze, from both above and below. It will have a hard time just to hold it's current position. If they continue their current strategy they are going to miss the budget segment, where most of the sales are. The premium market is just not big enough to warrant its current valuation.\n\n(2) A lot of hype is built on paid-marketing materials. I wish people had the chance to actually test-drive their cars. I test-drove my friend’s ES8, the handling is horrible, it feels like a hurried and unfinished product. How is it going to be competitive against, say Jaguar I-PACE or Mustang Mark E, if it were ever released in Western markets? Their AI assistant, with over a dozen in-car cameras and mics streaming everything back to NIO is going to a massive privacy concern.\n\n(3) Their ‘charging infrastructure’ remains a joke, even in big cities such as Beijing. They send a petrol-powered truck carrying batteries to charge your vehicle, seriously? Please tell me where I can replace the battery within a matter of minutes, because my school mate, a ES8 owner, really wants to know.\n\n(4) What is NIO's core competitiveness? They do not own factories, do not build batteries, and their technologies are nothing to write home about. Their autonomous driving is far behind Tesla and not that competitive even to other Chinese carmakers.\n\nIs NIO, which produced less than 50,000 cars last year, worth more than GM? Well, this is not even the biggest hype. Evergrande, another new Chinese EV maker, has a market cap of 68 billion USD (530 billion HK$) at the Hong Kong stock exchange, and guess what, they have sold 0, yes, ZERO cars so far.\n\nI can see why people are jumping on the bandwagon and the hype will probably keep going for a while. It’s just that NIO’s long term potential and valuation may not be as rosy as it seems.", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the comment. Firstly, I never once said that Nio was dominated the Chinese market or whatever like Tesla does. Everyone knows that. There’s other players in China for sure, it’s not like america at all. Yeah NIO’s appeal is in the upper middle class, that’s literally their target audience as a business? Sounds like they’re doing a decent job so far to me since that’s their goal. On your point about the ES8, you question it’s sales but you literally have no explanation why? If you’re saying consumers wouldn’t buy that over the BMW, I don’t see BMW penetrating the Chinese market really? I will concede that the premium market does need some growth, especially when NIO’s operating losses haven’t been slimmed down a whole lot. However, I think that NIO’s other ventures like BaaS and the packages stated at the beginning do fill some of that gap. As for the ES8’s handling, I can’t really comment on that because I don’t have first hand experience. But as for your point on privacy concern, welcome to China? Have you heard of Huawei? Pretty sure they’re doing alright. Also I would encourage your friend to retry the ‘joke and slow charging infrastructure’. It’s on record and verified to swap batteries in three minutes? Doesn’t seem slow to me. (4) What is NIO’s core competitiveness? Nio is trying to differentiate themselves from other Chinese EV’s and not just be the next Tesla or whatever. Tesla had very solid brand recognition and their own style, and Nio knows this. So instead of trying to dethrone musk like other EV companies waste money doing, Nio is trying to carve their own market with the BaaS and premium/upper middle class/ consumer relations. I would swing back around to the strategy part of the DD. Also again I have to concede because you make a really fair point about GM, the valuation there is a little fuzzy. But to get in this kind of EV market, there is undoubtedly a premium, that’s just how it’s turned out to be. You seem to be a fan of Tesla, they’d be an example of how the EV market has a premium. Thanks again for the comment, I appreciate hearing the other side.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with your first point. NIO is fairly successful at their target customers and they are not failing. My point is, one does not become the fifth largest carmaker in the world and the biggest in China (by market cap) selling just 50,000 cars a year to the US$50,000-70,000 segment in China. Even at today's reduced price, it is still over-valued. \n\nBMW, on the other hand, is penetrating China very well. They sold 777,000 cars last year (nearly 18 times NIO's number). In the premium segment, a luxury brand serves as a status symbol and the Germans (BMW, Mercedes, Audi) dominate the Chinese market. Sure they don't have competitive EVs yet, but I don't see an unsurmountable technological hurdle here (unlike NOKIA vs iPhone), in fact BMW built the i3 before NIO was even established. They have good EV tech, it is only a matter of time before German brands come up with competitive products, and by then they will eat into NIO's market.\n\nI guess I should explain my point on BaaS a bit more clearly: I am not saying there are no battery changing stations. The problem is, in Beijing, near where I and my ES8-owning friend live, the station is always full in normal hours, with at least 4 to 5 customers queuing. Each would take 8-10 minutes to swap, Furthermore, the stations usually don't have enough fully-charged batteries in stock, due to cost and space concerns. So what usually happens is that the battery from a previous customer hasn't finished re-charging, so you have to wait an extra 10-30 minutes.  All in all,  it takes about an hour on average to have battery replaced (this is my friend's experience), far from the 'get there and have everything done in 5 minutes' claim on paper. \n\nFor relatively small sales, the stations are still manageable. But as more people buy NIO cars, they will get more and more crowded. To maintain reasonable customer service NIO will need to build many more battery stations and keep a big inventory of batteries, plus all the human costs. Now that is much much more costly than building charging points/stations, and NIO is claiming to provide the service for free to early adopters and a minimal cost to new customers. You mentioned NIO's operating loss, well, the fact is that NIO recently span off BaaS as a separate business (called NIO Power), because it is massively unprofitable, with no prospect of turning green any time soon. Instead of trimming their operating loss, BaaS makes their financial report look even worse.\n\nI appreciate Tesla's contribution of spearheading the EV revolution, but I am not big fan of their products. I think Tesla too is over-valued, perhaps less so than NIO. But then the market doesn't really corroborate to fundamentals, so I must admit there are money to be made by speculating on their stocks, though that's just...speculation.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "No one is ever going to buy a Chinese premium car.

The improvements the FSD beta has been making are very impressive ([watch this video for example](https://publish.twitter.com/?query=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FWholeMarsBlog%2Fstatus%2F1370974296730824704&widget=Tweet) EDIT: Bit difficult to see perhaps, but this is with 0 interventions) and Dojo (the most powerful supercomputer in the world built to improve the neural network machine learning) isn't even up and running yet.\n\n> I don't think there's any case that the Tesla stock price isn't a massive overvaluation based on the present day. They're not unique in that respect at all, that's the case for much of the EV sector, and I think that the sector as a whole will cool off gradually, or stagnate despite the companies actually growing.\n\nThis is a very complex one, as there are a lot of factors. I'll just name a few:\n\n* First of all, I don't think it's relevant whether a company like Tesla is overvalued based on what it does today. It's an extreme growth company, so no investor is looking at what they're doing today. The stock price will always be forward looking by a few years, and the longer the company is expected to maintain that growth the more forward looking the stock price will be.\n* Tesla is a lot less richly valued than most other EV companies. This might sound surprising, but Nio for example is trading at the same valuation Tesla was 1,5 years ago despite being at the production Tesla was at 5 years ago. Nio also still has the most challenging milestones for an automotive company ahead of itself; getting to profitability and getting to mass production. On top of that, Nio doesn't have nearly as many (future) products outside of automotive as Tesla does and they're not vertically integrated like Tesla. So in comparison to other EV companies, Tesla is really not as highly valued as they might seem.\n* Legacy automotive companies will need to transition from their highly profitable ICE business to an EV/software business. This will be extremely expensive and will contain a period of 5-10 years where these companies will nowhere near as profitable as they are today and probably not even profitable at all. Especially with the balance sheet of some of these companies (Ford or GM for example), this will create a huge risk of bankruptcy and the stock price has that priced in. This in turn makes EVs look even more expensive, because they're valued so much more highly than legacy automakers, but for (partially) good reason.\n\n> Man, maybe I'm more bearish than you, but I feel like when you've got a \"can't lose\" situation it's always because you're overlooking something or just being blindly optimistic. 15% annual on top of the 600-800 range it's trading at now? Let's say, for the sake of argument, it settles at 700. That would just about double it in 5 years and see it trading at 1400 USD. Maybe it'll hit 1400 USD with the tidal wave of inflation that's bound to come when you increase the money supply by 30% in a year (unless the MMT folks are right after all), but that would see the value of a dollar plummet significantly so you wouldn't see much of a real return on each share. Tesla has been adding to the float pretty consistently for years now as well, that'll drive the price down if they continue to do so. I'll address full autonomy in a second.\n\nIt's really not that crazy to be honest. Without full autonomy but with a 50% annual growth and increasing margins, Tesla would grow into their current valuation extremely quickly (2-4 years), so even if they fall short of that growth rate a 2x over 10 years is not that unreasonable.\n\n> So this is why I don't see it catching on anytime soon. The risk would have to be lowered by 99.9%, any accident would be latched onto, and if Tesla rushed it out and there were even one glitch that systematically got people hurt or killed, they'd be sued into financial ruin, share price would plummet, FSD would be shelved for years. So that's why I think 2021 is dubious at best, and frankly my real opinion is that it's nonsense, because that's what Elon does, come out with insanely short timelines for revolutionary tech.\n\nAgreed. One aspect you didn't take into consideration however is how countries will not want to fall behind. If one country does successfully manage to get self-driving cars approved and robotaxis become the norm in that country, it will have a massively positive impact on that country's economy and others will want to follow suit. So while it's true that any negative news could mean huge delays, any positive news could also mean huge increases in adoption rate.\n\n> What's your Tesla position?

Tesla is still 50% of my portfolio and I intend to keep it that way for the next couple of years unless I find a company I'm equally confident in.\n\nBut yes, it's definitely easier for me to hold with the amount of gains I've made, even though it doesn't really matter if you lose money you've earned from a job or money you've gained from stocks. I'd definitely be more conservative if I would be starting investing now, and probably wouldn't put 50% of my portfolio into Tesla in that scenario. The way I see it, when I started investing Tesla had a huge chance to 10x or much more over a ten year timeframe with a small chance of bankruptcy. Today, Tesla has a reasonable chance to 10x, with very little chance to do more than that, but almost no chance of bankruptcy. The risk/reward is completely different.\n\n> I think the Tesla bulls online who don't actually provide proper reasoning (AngelaQQ and her lemonade stand analogy, for example) are very dangerous, because they're just doing \"to the moon rocket emoji\" type stuff, suckering people who think \"stonks only go up\" and will panic sell when they see a red day, let alone a red week or month. But of course, much of the crowd sees a wall of text and thinks \"wow this person wrote a lot, they must be 100% right!\"\n\nAbsolutely. I've also seen a lot of these people in stocks like Nio or some of the SPAC stocks. It's very important to filter those people out.\n\n> It's so nice to actually have an exchange of ideas! I have stupid arguments all the time whether it's stocks, politics, sports, whatever, where people don't engage in and just go to insulting me, dismissing valid points, and getting mad when they encounter information that proves them wrong or that they simply did not know. I'll check out Tesla Daily for sure, like I said you've definitely made me a little more bullish on Tesla.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree!

What I do know is that legacy automakers are most likely trading at a much lower multiple because transitioning from making ICE cars and being a manufacturing company to making EVs and being a software company is EXTREMELY difficult and EXTREMELY costly and creates a big risk of bankruptcy. A company like Tesla that's already managed to become profitable making only EVs doesn't have that risk and will naturally trade at a higher multiple.\n\nAt the same time Tesla is on a clear path to making lots of profits from software. They're already making $1,000 of almost pure profits per car on average while others make $0 and this will only increase as FSD becomes better and their appstore is introduced. No legacy automaker is able to compete with that from a valuation standpoint (or business for that matter).\n\n> Is AngelaQQ really on point?

Musk has always said that Tesla's only mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, and that the only way to achieve that is to build an affordable car for the masses. They want to maintain a quality standard, so they'll never release a car that's not among the safest cars in the world, doesn't have their software/autonomy capacity or below ~250 miles of range (although the Model Y standard range was slightly below that, but it got scrapped). Ultimately, both in terms of their mission and in terms of making money, what counts is getting as many cars on the road to reduce fossil fuel use and to allow them to create a massive robotaxi fleet.

Tesla's are a lot cheaper to produce than competitors because they've reduced the amount of parts required through massive casting and stamping machines. [Here's an example of how they're making their cars cheaper to build than other automakers](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/first-look-of-the-tesla-model-y-one-piece-rear-casting-underbody), by reducing the amount of parts for the underbody from 70 (which was already far lower than the competitors') to 1.

They are definitely NOT a car company first and foremost. They are a technology & manufacturing company first and foremost and they happen to put most of their products into cars. They make about as much profits from selling software per car sold as other car companies make from selling the car itself. On top of that they're doing stuff like developing their own batteries, making their own material alloys (regular car companies couldn't even dream of this) and they're building the world's most powerful supercomputer to train their AI. It's nothing like a car company.\n\nAlso, a lot people underestimate how expensive the transition from ICE cars to EVs will be for legacy automakers and how many of them will risk bankruptcy by doing so, but the market does have this priced in to a certain degree, which drags down their valuations.\n\n> These companies don't necessarily need to make software btw - they can outsource that.

If anything, I think maybe 10-20% of the market is bullish on Tesla and has crazy high price targets, while 80-90% is still massively underestimating how extremely profitable full autonomy will be.

As of right now, they've got a fairly niche demographic who are really into their stuff, most people driving cars want to get from point A to B and pick a car that matches their wallet. Their solar is good, but costly, it will only be bought by upper middle class homeowners who have the 30k to pay for it. Battery tech is still speculative last I'd heard, I read that they were exploring an innovation to radically change the way EV batteries function, making them more efficient.\n\n>Not at all.

That would require very, very low costs of production to make that profitable, or huge profit margins on the higher end stuff. I know Musk's got his stated mission, but I kinda see him as someone who has cultivated a sleek, futuristic, elite image for his brand and would like to maintain the mystique.\n\n> It doesn't.

Musk is a tremendous visionary, that's for sure. I didn't know they made their own alloys, that is pretty insane, but is it that they're much better than the rest or is it just that they're pushing the envelope whereas other companies were complacent? I did underestimate the costs of switching over to EVs, but these companies are going to have to do so. The ones who don't go bankrupt should hit the ground running. As far as the supercomputer, it isn't nearly ready yet and there are no guarantees, same as the FSD.

Whether it be by partnership or merger, these legacy automakers won't go down easily if they do go down. It absolutely would be more expensive, but it will be done one way or another. Also, Apple are huge, not because they are so much better than the competition, but because they branded themselves so much better. Apple's brand dominance is insane, they've made their phone a status symbol of sorts. That's much, much harder to do in an established industry.\n\n>Like I said at the start, this is where we fundamentally disagree.

I have been consistent in saying that they are a very good company, but also grossly overvalued. You're kind of admitting they are overvalued at the present time with that phrasing, and that also implies that everything you're talking about here has been priced in, no? That the 850 ATH from a month ago was essentially what it would be worth if everything you've laid out came to pass. \n\nYou've definitely moved me towards being more bullish on Tesla though, when I have some more money (unemployed student/aspiring footballer at the moment), I may very well buy a share if I see it plummet. It is back to trading around 700 after popping off yesterday, so I'll be keeping an eye on it for sure.\n\nI'll definitely check out that video, maybe I'm totally wrong on Tesla after all. You raised some excellent points here, stuff I didn't know about. I just think that there isn't much room for it to run, inflation aside, and that unless you are fine with losing half your investment, there are much, much safer trades to be made. \n\n> ps.

Yes, at the age of 12 I requested, and received, a copy of Apple's annual report which was also the first edition to be distributed electronically as well (via floppy disk).... and I'll come back to that because it's more relevant than it seems.\n\nApple is an interesting animal because it seems to follow the Bell Labs model of innovation and you'd probably at first glance think I was insane for comparing them to a dinosaur like AT&T... but the comparison is more apt than you think.\n\nStartups seeking Series n financing lay out a business plan and declare they're going to \"change the paradigm, \"disrupt the market\", or some such Valley buzz speak... and they talk about the end-state product because they have to.  Venture capitalists want to know what the company's bread and butter is going to be.\n\nApple, however, is a massive, old company with a giant pile of cash... they don't have to beg VC's for money so they don't have to tell you the best bits they're working on until they're really close to releasing them.  How close?  Well, while iPhone has its roots in Alan Kay's Dynabook concept from 1972, public interest started to materialize around a new generation of interfaces when in 2006 Jeff Han from MIT did a demonstration of the capabilities of multitouch capacitive interfaces.\n\nBut, here's the thing.... Apple was already using capacitive interfaces a year earlier.\n\nDubbed the \"Mighty Mouse\", model A1152, had no buttons, just a simple capacitive surface with zones so it could tell whether you were left clicking or right clicking.\n\nMost people derided the Mighty Mouse but four years later the Magic Mouse, using the same technology and ditching the tactile scroll-ball (or nub), became the de-facto Apple mouse and still is.\n\nApple has been laughed at for USB, Firewire, ethernet, CD-ROM drives, lots of technologies that it introduced to gather real world data on customer sentiment and adoption of various features that would end up making their way into something else and often became a standard...\n\nQuick show of hands... how many people think that the iPod changed the way we get our music?\n\nIf you raised your hand (virtually or actually), you'd be wrong.  Initial interest for the iPod were kind of fringe... it didn't really go anywhere until Apple made *getting* music more convenient for the enduser than piracy.  Limewire, Kazaa, Napster all had cluttered interfaces and a hodgepodge of peer-to-peer music without a good way to find what you wanted, or discover new music that you're likely to want.\n\nThe real technology that completely disrupted the then 50 year-old distribution model of the recording industry was quietly licensed by Apple from Amazon in 2001, when the iPod came out and three years before iTunes Music Store was released.  It was one-click purchasing.\n\nWhich brings us to wearables and AR, stuff that's been around for some time but really sucks in terms of long-term adoption and disruption of the market.  The difference between these wearables is that they don't really build on intuitive uses of technology or interfaces... the iPhone probably gets more use as an \"Internet Communicator\" than anything yet at the time of its introduction you could hear the lack of enthusiasm about that third wheel.\n\nWhat iPhone really did was accelerate adoption by acclimating a generation of affluent thirty and forty somethings to a device that was really a portable laptop, and they did it in less than a year, and it completely changes the way working professionals AND teens spend the majority of their time... Hell, it completely killed the PDA... all because it put your laptop in your phone.  They didn't drop \"Computer\" from their name because they \\*gasp\\* were going to stop selling Macs.  They did it because the term \"computer\" isn't sufficient to describe our relatioship with CPU-driven devices any more.\n\nSo I really think if they do release these products, they're really just real-world testbeds for particular features or attributes that will find their way into something else that builds upon existing tools and makes AR more than a toy but an indispensable technology.\n\nAbout that annual report... The disk had the entire annual report on a Hypercard stack.  John Sculley once remarked that among his biggest failures was not understanding what to do with Hypercard.  Hypercard was thought of as a presentation tool, like powerpoint.  But what it really was is the world's first browser... capable of displaying graphics, text, and interlinking different \"pages\" with hypertext... first released in 1985, eight years before NCSA Mosaic—the first web browser.\n\nImagine if Apple had in 1987 been helmed by someone with the vision to see more than just the sum of the parts.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "So thats a buy? :)", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "It's a \"put this on your watch list\"... not only because the tech market will likely continue to fall, but because AAPL in particular is still trading above fair value.\n\nI would be more inclined to buy them at a price below 102 if I did at all...

It was up +100% within 20 trading days.\n- During the 2020 September \"S&P snub crash\", when it fell from $500+ to below $350, it only spent **a single trading day** below $350, and corrected to $450 in 5 trading days. (+30%)\n\nI.e.

Check out Sandy Munro's interview with Elon Musk and his review of the 2021 Model 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But even given that, do the math. There is a valuation today for a company selling 11M cars. If you want to bump that up due to belief in eventual higher margins and fixing their quality and service issues, then do so. Just remember to discount all that based on expectations for a yearly return, and a risk adjustment rate.\n\nMinimuim $4 trillion marketcap once FSD is out and they sell 20 million / year.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "> Minimuim $4 trillion marketcap once FSD is out and they sell 20 million / year.\n\nHave you actually done the math?

How does that make sense to you? \n\nBy the time Tesla is at 20 million / year, the initial fixed costs for many gigafactory construction/ramp-up won't be there, so their expenses will only be much smaller fixed costs + variable costs such as components from suppliers. Even without FSD sales, their margins will be much higher than their current 6.4%. That 6.4% is while Tesla is in the beginning stages of ramp-up.\n\nAt ASP of $40k and OM of 12%, 20 million sales will give us an operating income of almost $100 billion. This is WITHOUT FSD, which is much higher margin.\n\n> That just means they have huge capital, operating costs and risks that need to be factored in and you can't assume that just because they built a factory that it will operate near capacity.

Selling a premium car in a premium market of course will have higher margins than selling mass market, so their margins now are probably representative of long term on average.\n\nBut even with all that, Toyota's operating income is 22B - and yet with only 4.2x higher operating income, you believe the market cap should be 16x higher.  \n\nThat math just doesn't work.\n\n> I wouldn't count on them failing expansion.\n\nI am not counting on that.  I am saying that just because they build factories doesn't mean the demand is there - Fremont and China demonstrates that.

Those 2 factories under construction aren't producing a single car right now, so they are not revenue generating currently. That means the construction costs for Giga Berlin and Giga Austin are being subsidized by the revenue from Fremont and Shanghai. Despite this, Tesla still has a 6.4% operating margin. How can you continue to deny how impressive this is? What would the operating margin be if the construction costs were removed? I'd say probably double or more.\n\n \n\n>I don't believe they will have an OM that is 50% higher than Toyota given their history and the margin pressure they are already under to sell 500k cars a year.  \n>  \n>Selling 20M will require cars at multiple price points (so on a weighted average ASP will be much lower) and they will have will have even more price pressure.\n\nWe will see how the consumer behaves, but I'm willing to bet people will pay higher to buy Tesla much like how they pay higher to buy Apple products.\n\nI do believe Tesla will offer a 25k car soon, which will drop their ASP, but their margin % will be higher. Tesla always drops their price when they're confident that margin % will not fall compared to last financial statement's. People think it's because there's a \"demand problem\" or whatever, but it's a strategic move to increase sales, so revenue and margin in $ goes up.\n\nI believe people will choose Tesla for the low-end, premium-end and luxury-end. Look at British Royalty choosing a Model S over a Jaguar. There just is no competition. Tesla is the obvious choice, especially for the middle-class once they come out with a 25k model.\n\n \n\n>But even with all that, Toyota's operating income is 22B - and yet with 4.2x higher operating income, you believe the market cap should be 16x higher.  \n>  \n>That math just doesn't work.\n\nYep. I actually think Tesla will sell more than 20 million. I actually think they're going to hit 50-90% marketshare just due to how superior they are. The PE multiple when they hit 20 million sales will still be higher than average because they're going to continue growing and they'll have higher margin FSD revenue.\n\nAlso, I appreciate you coming here and actually arguing instead of saying \"HURR-DURR DEMAND CLIFF!!!

If it drops more than portfollio average, they will keep buying.\n\n\nPrice target: Compliance still working on report, couple of weeks. Two things have happened since last projections - 1. TSLA has increased its marketshare. Originally planned on TSLA EV marketshare decreasing to 11%, it has not. It has increased. will be reflected in price. 2. Autonomy. Probability that tesla will get autonomy right has increased from 30% from original report.

Institutions have been forced to track benchmarks more closely, which is a losing proposition and backward looking. Surprised with how low redemptions have been.\n\n\nHow loyal do you think your investors are - never faced this kind of outflow? Cathie says we are here to educate. Buy low, opportunity is now. We are averaging into some of the most important companies of our lifetime.\n\n\nAsked about diversity of women at ARK. Cathie loves diverse points of view, diversity has surely helped ARK. Wishes more women would self-select into ARK. Invited women to apply for positions at ARK.\n\n\nNew investors, asks about whether ARK is competing with other \"shiny objects\" - Cathie says she is not worried, says no one does research like ARK. Welcomes any new investors. Allocating capital towards innovation is the right thing to do. How to we get out of COVID mess, ARK says to grow out of the problems via investing in innovation.

{"title": "DoorDash ($DASH) is going to be blood-red this week, and may never recover", "selftext": "The early lockup period on DASH ends on Tuesday, and DASH is going to fall like a stone. To understand why, first you have to understand (1) how massively over-valued DoorDash is, (2) the factors that have led to this valuation, and (3) why these factors are all going away this week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DASH is massively over-valued, even by meme stock standards**\n\nWe all know that many stocks are currently \"over-valued\" according to traditional value metrics. This is especially true of emerging technology stocks, and has been fueled by historically low interest rates and rampant speculation. However, you don't even have to believe that this bubble is going to burst in order to see that DoorDash will fall; ***DASH is massively over-valued even just comparing it to its peers.***\n\nLet's look at DASH's public peers, namely Uber, Lyft, and GrubHub. Now, ride-hailing services are a different business than food delivery, but the technology involved is similar so I believe we can expect similar revenue multiples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Uber:* [\\[1\\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=uber)\n\n*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $16.2B*\n\n*Current market cap: $103.21B*\n\n*Forward P/S forecast: 6.37*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Lyft:* [\\[2\\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=lyft)\n\n*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $3.1B*\n\n*Current market cap: $21.09B*\n\n*Forward P/S forecast: 6.8*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*GrubHub:* [\\[3\\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=grub)\n\n*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $2.2B*\n\n*Current market cap: $5.61B*\n\n*Forward P/S forecast: 2.25*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*DASH:* [\\[4\\]](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=dash)\n\n*2021 analyst revenue forecast: $3.7B*\n\n*Current market cap: $48.11B*\n\n*Forward P/S forecast:* ***13.01***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, DASH is trading at a **200% higher forward P/S compared to Uber and Lyft!** And a 600% higher forward P/S compared to GrubHub! This is in spite of the fact that Uber and Lyft will still be experiencing a Covid headwind for the first half of 2021, while DoorDash will no longer benefit from the Covid-driven demand surge in the second half of 2021. So 2022 should favor Uber and Lyft even more over DASH.\n\nFor DASH to simply come back down to valuation multiples similar to Uber and Lyft, it would need to drop from its current price of \\~$150, down to \\~**$75.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Covid, a small float, Covid, low interest rates, Covid, and IPO mania have led to this valuation**\n\nThe first factor is that DASH currently has a very small float, due to the lockup agreement from the IPO. DoorDash has a total of 286.34M shares outstanding, with only 97.61M currently available for trading [\\[6\\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dash). 114M more of those shares will be unlocked for trading on Tuesday, as the first of two lockup periods ends (the other lockup period ends in May).\n\nA small float makes it very easy for a stock to be moved up on small volume. DASH only has an average volume of 3.75M. This means that on Tuesday, ***30x the daily volume will be available for sale.***\n\nIn addition, DASH IPO'd at the exact right time to fetch an insane valuation. DoorDash raised $400 in a venture capital round in June 2020, at a value of $16B. This would give DASH a share price today of **\\~$50.** But Covid caused insane (and temporary) growth in DoorDash's revenue, which drove up excitement in the company. In addition, the IPO markets reached dot-com-bubble levels of froth (the last time IPOs would pop 100% on their first day of trading) this past year. That's why ***DoorDash rushed to IPO at the end of this year*** [\\[7\\]](https://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/the-rush-to-ipo-before-2020-ends/97862).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The bubble is ready to burst**\n\nLife will return to relative normalcy sometime this year. Demand for food delivery services will plummet. At the same time, interest rates are surging higher, which will continue to kill emerging tech growth stocks. The rampant speculation we've seen over the past year will die down soon. I believe DoorDash employees and insiders know (or at least fear) this, and will sell massive quantities of their shares this week as the lockup period expires. \n\nKeep in mind that this early lockup period only releases **40%** of employees' shares. If you joined DoorDash in 2018 when it was worth only **$1.4B(!)** [\\[8\\]](https://craft.co/doordash/funding-rounds) and became a multi-multi-millionaire as you saw the market cap of a company that pretty much everybody hates grow **30x** in 2 years, wouldn't you sell 40% of your shares the first time you got the chance?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\\*Disclosure: I currently have a variety of put spreads betting that DASH will fall.

The weekly high was ~149 Monday at 11am, the weekly low was ~130 at Tuesday at open. Over the same week, the Nasdaq rose 3.1%.\n\nWhat went right:\n\n- There were chances to make money. The Monday drop caused many puts to 2-3x over the course of the day. Tuesday open was red, and prices of 135 were seen on Wednesday.\n- Over the week, DASH underperformed the Nasdaq by 5.7%. This is a large weekly underperformance, although not enough for profitable weekly puts given the IV.\n\nWhat went wrong:\n\n- The timing of the drop. The biggest drop was on Monday, but I expected Tuesday to be an even bigger drop. By the time Tuesday came around, the sell off was priced in.\n- Not enough insiders sold. This is the biggest issue. We only saw 4M shares sold at open Tuesday. This is <4% of the eligible shares up for sale. Volume was higher than normal through the day, but it’s hard to say how much of that was insiders selling and how much was shorts covering. Insiders are clearly more bullish on DASH than I expected. \n- DASH was put on the Short Sale Restriction list after Monday’s fall. This limited the ability of traders to bet on a big intraday fall Tuesday, and likely exacerbated the rise we saw that day.\n- Nasdaq came back big this week. The Nasdaq had a +3% day on the day of the lockup expiry, and a +3% week overall. Interest rates (the main concern atm for growth stocks) fell dramatically the day of the lockup expiry.\n- Trading volume stayed low. After lockup, trading volume did not increase as much as I expected.\n\nOther factors that were not considered:\n\n- SoftBank and high-profile IPOs. SoftBank-backed Coupang IPO’d this week. There was therefore possible incentive to ensure SoftBank crown jewel DASH’s valuation remained steady.\n- Continued IPO mania. Roblox also IPO’d this week.

{"title": "GME Technical Analysis Part 2 (Again..)", "selftext": " \n\n\\**Obligatory Disclaimer:* I am not *your* financial advisor, nor am I anyone's for that matter. I use crayons to do technical analysis as you'll see in one second. This is just my opinion of the current information available to myself, regarding technical indicators.\n\n**tl,dr: Look at the graphs and Skim.** **The MACD divergence is increasing at a much quicker rate this time, adding into the theory from my last post** [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzvkhd/recent_technical_analysis_of_gme/) **about the KST SMA bottoming out at such a high level.** **It** ***Appears*** **this trend has been confirmed and is stronger than last time. Enjoy the post.. and the ride!**\n\n I ran some numbers on GME's MACD . Our current statistical timeframe is only 7 days, a very small sample size, I will keep tracking and provide updates. The current picture that has been painted gives me great hope fellow Apes, there is a Strong-ish correlation between our run up in Jan and the current one.\n\n**Good Evening Fellow Apes**. This is my (H3RB's) part 2 on **GME Technical Analysis- MACD**. For those who are not privy to technical indicators I will do my best to explain it in the simplest terms possible. The MACD stands for **Moving Average Convergence Divergence** which tracks a Securities underlying *Trend and Momentum* between **two Exponential Moving Average Time periods,** usually **26-day and 12-day** time periods.\n\nThe **MACD Graph** is comprised of **2 lines: MACD Line** which is calculated by subtracting the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA. When the MACD value is **positive** (MACD>0), this means the 12-day EMA is greater than the 26-day EMA. This is often represented on the stocks price by an upwards movement, *but is not always the case.* The opposite is also true, if the 26-day EMA is greater than the 12-day EMA then the MACD is **negative** (MACD<0). This is usually represented in price action the opposite way (downward action). For simplicity terms we will not get too much deeper into the opposite scenario (MACD Divergences from price action learn more [Here at Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp) ) The **Second** line is the **Signal Line**. **The histogram represents the divergence between the two.** Follow Investopedia link for more in depth explanation.\n\nAs per usual, I know *most* Apes like to learn via visuals... so here ya' go you filthy Apes.\n\n[Follow Investopedia link Above.. they made it their credit.](https://preview.redd.it/rnvt132kepl61.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=4634504bc6148d834160f6fbc2f5dd7f0dbb2e65)\n\nAnd here are our beautiful crayon drawings by yours truly.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmyed4knepl61.jpg?width=3117&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e3045479dc53845b011278f1a6228211888d013\n\nI'm a math guy.. so that's what I do (obviously not Crayon Art). I figured after seeing the KST SMA baseline levels off of my first Technical Analysis DD I'd dig a little deeper into the situation and make it a series (Next will be the ADX or Average Directional Index). I concluded on the last DD (that's linked above) that since the baseline is much higher this time, and the trends seem to be **confirmed that they have switched** this ***may*** be a ***much more violent squeeze than the previous one.***\n\nI compared our sample data from the days of positive MACD periods (the run ups) to see if there were any similarities, **and it seems like there are.** This date series is from *1/13/2021-02/01/2021 (original) and 02/25/2021-03/05/2021* (this past Friday). The data sample is *EXTREMELY SMALL* so don't let it hype you too much, but for practical purposes it's always something to monitor.\n\n\\*Coincidence?: RC tween on 2/24 of McDonalds icecream cone.. he's a smart Ape. 2/25 MACD crossover indicator triggered.\n\n\"**But the above date ranges differ on amount of days!\"** I know, I'll fill it in when I have more data, this is preliminary.\n\n**Currently the first 7 days of the run up are being compared using MACD Divergences:**\n\nCorrelation: .865216\n\nCovariance: 1.713939\n\nStandard Deviation: 2.367899\n\nPearson's Coefficient: .723823\n\nWhat is the Pearson's Coefficient you may ask? It attempts to measure the relationship between two data sets on the same time interval. Fine more info [Here at Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pearsoncoefficient.asp) . A positive relationship is a good thing in this case and *may reflect a relationship between the two data series.*\n\n**\"But what do all these numbers and graphs mean Ape with wrinkley brain** ?\" It ***may*** mean there is a relationship between the two run ups. Except this time around the **MACD divergence is increasing at a quicker rate** (I know there's another Stat guy out here putting out some great DD.. go find and read it)\n\nIn *my personal opinion* this adds on to my theory of this being **stronger and more violent than the first squeeze. The trends have switched and stayed consistent.**\n\n**To the moon my fellow Apes!**\n\nThanks for the read, I am always open to questions and critique.\n\n\\-H3RB\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu/zjz my last post was taken down.

{"title": "Forbes Article: WTF?? Am I a Predator??? NO. I'm a Momma Bear Who Just wants to Provide For Her Kids, and Splurge on herself once in a while. Is that too much to ask????", "selftext": " TL/DR: Forbes can suck it. This is my rant. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE\n\n   \n \n\nI've reconsidered the Forbes article that came out Friday. The more I think about it, the more pissed I've become about the subtle, manipulative, and just plain evil condescension.\n\n   \n \n\nThe writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting retail investors on our astute comprehension of the numbers. Basically said the little GME investors were NOT just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray.\n\n\nSOUNDS GOOD,  RIGHT?\n\n\n\nWell, it was just another headfake, y'all. The writer was framing US (retail investors) as the Goliath, not as the underdog, as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath.\n\n   \n \n\nIts disgusting. These media shills, including FORBES, are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda. And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls.\n\n   \n \n\nWhen corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law, and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars...when THEY actually collude to destroy companies, and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit.....guess what. Crickets.\n\n   \n \n\nNOBODY says or does anything about it. Not the media, not the SEC, not the FBI, not the DTCC, an definitely not Congress. The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it, is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors. They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable. But they aren't really going after the hedgies. They are going after YOU. ME. DFV. Anyone who dares pull back the curtain.\n\n   \n \n\nBut when regular people see a good opportunity, and want to invest, LEGALLY, they lose their shit.\n\n   \n \n\nI don't know ANY of you. I don't take advice from anyone here. I read and research and then make my own decisions.\n\n   \n \n\nBut dammit, I see a good opportunity, so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool. I've jumped on the proverbial train. And I will ride it to the end of the line.\n\n   \n \n\nI'm gonna be honest, I'm just tired. I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years.\n\nI just want to be able to finally get my kid braces. To buy myself my good vehicle, or at least fix the one we have. It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips. I dont even like to drive across Houston, just in case the engine light goes on again.\n\n   \n \n\nMy credit is not great, so I cant finance a car. (Don't say it. I've already tried. Twice in 18 months. Every time I try again, it tanks my credit further) And since I'm self employed, I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck. Therefore the \"Your job is your credit\" financing isnt an option either. So YA, Momma wants a car.\n\n   \n \n\nI want to take a family vacation. Hell I want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while.\n\n   \n \n\nI want to do fun things, and important things like help my kids go to college, IF they want to.\n\n   \n \n\nI want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server, or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need.\n\n   \n \n\nIf this makes me a greedy Bitch, I guess I'm a greedy bitch.\n\n   \n \n\nBut it DOESNT make me a criminal. It DOESNT mean I am 'scheming' to manipulate the stock market. OR that I am part of a \"premeditated, predatory take-down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty.\" as FORBES claims. ell, WE are the cornered, defenseless counterparty, NOT the multi BILLION DOLLAR Hedge funds!\n\n   \n \n\nAre you friggin' KIDDING ME??? My shares, and even ALL the shares we hold as retail investors do NOT have the power to MOVE the market. The BIG institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price.\n\n   \n \n\nWE, the reddit investors, are just little ants on a log; riding the roaring waters of the market, hanging on for dear life! And if we HANG ON, then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride, safe and DRY.\n\n   \n \n\nWe SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey. Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money, even maybe our lives, to arrive at the end of that beautiful run?\n\n   \n \n\nWho are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along, for playing THEIR game, the RIGHT way?\n\nTruth is, these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands. And THEY are the ones who have risked these people's fortunes, their very LIVES, playing a rigged game. THEIR greed and corruption has been revealed.\n\n   \n \n\nAnd I'm sorry if they are freaking out. But its just what happens when you GET CAUGHT.\n\n   \n \n\nTO BE CLEAR: My goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds, even tho I think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities.\n\n   \n \n\nI just want to ride the rapids. To take the risk and get the payout I know is coming. Not because I know I'm so deserving, but because I know the numbers don't lie. That's not criminal. Its not even shady. Its SMART.\n\n   \n \n\nI will end up in a calm, peaceful lake, surrounded by big beautiful mountains. I will finally be able to enjoy the view. I will send my kids to college, buy those braces, buy safe car, and even go on a beautiful vacation.\n\n   \n \n\nAnd hey Forbes, hey Cramer. Hey all you crooks investigating DFV.....listen up.\n\n   \n \n\nTHATS not greedy. Its INEVITABLE.\n\n   \n \n\n(NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANNA DO. I LIKE THE STOCK)\n\n   \n \n\n   \n \n\n   \n\n\nEDIT:\n\nSeriously tho. We are bonded together by a common goal and common struggles. No matter our color, gender, race, religion or political ideology, the real war is against evil and corruption. For the right to pursue our own destinies and our own version of happiness.\n\n\n\"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\" - Ephesians 6:12 KJV\n\nEDIT EDIT:\nHere is the link to the Forbes article\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/05/gamestopgamestonk-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-madness-of-crowds/\n\nThank you ALL for making a momma feel seen and heard and for all the support.\n\nI can't believe how this has blown up.🤪 I woke up to over 200 more notifications and am trying to catch up on all the comments.

If this is the same supercruise as in the Cadillac CT it's ok.\n\nThe reason is because it uses pre-mapped (LIDAR) data. It's great on main highways and interstates when there aren't major changes or constructions.\n\nWhich brings to another topic, range. 250 EPA rated on full charge. In real world or everyday you would charge it to 80% to maintain battery health. This would give the car 200 miles, you can charge to 100% when planning for longer road trips with no issues. In the winter time or extreme cold weather cut EV range in half. That real world range becomes 125 miles. This math applies to EV's in general.\n\nIn the summer it's ok for a short road trip vehicle, yea I guess the supercruise option is ok, but is it worth it? Tesla Autopilot comes standard on all their cars. Also charging infrastructure for CCS is, ok. Still not as fast and abundant as Tesla's Supercharging network for roadtrips.\n\nThe Bolt EUV is a great family daily driver.  Supercruise will be ok but it's not available to use if it doesn't have pre-mapped data available.\n\nI'm all for EV's, but GM fell behind and continue to not release their \"developments\" quick enough.

The Model 3 is a better carthan the first day I purchased it. I wouldn't be able to say the same for the Volt. The Volt is a great car, but not better than the first day I got it. I expect the same for the Bolt EUV, GM just made the Bolt bigger and slapped a driver assist to the car. Far from self-driving features.\n\nTesla recently removed their Standard Range Y (base price 40k). I think the reason they did this is due to competition in the price range, there is none.

Personally I highly doubt this will happen and will not count on it.\n\nBut now the clamor is up to 500k which would be a third of the market cap of the world. Not going to happen.\n\nSoon they will be calling for 1 million which would be 70 trillion almost as much as the market cap of ALL OTHER STOCKS COMBINED and about 40% more than all the stocks in the USA. That will not happen. The HFs won't physically be able to buy shares for that much.\n\nAnd I don't want to hear how Berskshire A is almost 400k.

There s a 99% chance that I get it wrong somehow either to the upside or downside.\n\n1k is likely.\n\n2k is very possible\n\n5k is possible as well but I think a bit of a reach, but it could happen for sure.\n\n10k is a bit of a reach but still possible.\n\n20k not likely\n\n50k very unlikely.

For my youngest boy sell 10 of his 50.\n\nAt 2k I sell 100 more shares keeping 20 and giving me 300k cash which I would be very happy with.\n\nI sell 60 of my oldest boys remaining giving him 10 left and 170k in his account and 10 more years for me to raise it (lets face it 170k would put him through college...).\n\nI sell 35 of my youngest boys giving him 5 left and 80k cash and 14 years to get him enough to go to college.\n\nAt 10k I sell all of my boys remaining shares. I sell 25 of my last 30. I hold the last 5 of my shares until I feel we are at the peak or just past the peak.\n\nAlso to note once I sell shares and have cash I will be selling puts to make some more cash. I will keep doing this until GME months from now goes back to the 50-60 range and the squeeze is over and a lot of people move on from GME. At some point I will get assigned in that range and pick up probably about 1000 shares for me and a couple of hundred for each of my boys to hold long term.

{"title": "Why you should buy Sonos (SONO) tomorrow", "selftext": "Listen up all you man babies.  If you're interested in making money the play tomorrow is to buy Sonos (SONO) before 3 PM EST.  Why is that time so specific?  Because tomorrow Sonos is having an investor day in the afternoon.  Where they will announce new products! Talking about the future! And (likely) raise their 2021 guidance! \n\nSonos is one of the more undervalued companies still on the market and below I talk about reasons you should get in now.  They are a well positioned company for both 'stay home' and 'reopen' trades and their CEO is a boss.  They will crush tomorrow and the weakness their stock showed today on low volume should be taken advantage of immediately. \n\nTL;DR?  Buy Sonos on its weakness today and get in tomorrow before 3 PM EST to get in on this moon mission. \n\n**What is a Sonos?**\n\n*From Yahoo: Sonos, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and sells multi-room audio products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. The company provides wireless speakers, home theater speakers, components, and accessories. It offers its products through approximately 10,000 third-party retail stores, including custom installers of home audio systems; and e-commerce retailers, as well as through its Website* [*sonos.com*](https://sonos.com)*. The company was formerly known as Rincon Audio, Inc. and changed its name to Sonos, Inc. in May 2004. Sonos, Inc. was founded in 2002 and is headquartered in Santa Barbara, California.* \n\nBasically Sonos makes incredible home speakers and audio related devices mostly for an at home setting.  They hold over 775 patents and are currently applying for over 500 more. Their speaker systems are so solid that Alphabet (google) and Amazon have tried to steal their technology. Sonos is currently in litigation against both of them and they've said they except to have the Alphabet litigation settled in their favor by the end of the year (GREAT FOR EARNINGS). \n\n**Reasons for buying them long term:**\n\nI could spend this whole post talking about how they saw the coming supply chain issues and quickly worked through them.  How their CEO is has partnered with IKEA to get Sonos' systems in front of eyeballs who are looking to buy new furniture and now can add a TV sound system on the way out, or how they are going to release up to 3 new products this year. No I'm only going to focus on TOMORROW. \n\n**Reason #1 for buying them TOMORROW:** \n\nNew product announced.  Go look at Sonos' stock twits, Seeking Alpha page, or even their Yahoo Finance new feed.  No one is talking about their new product they're going to announce.  It's already been leaked.  It's the Sonos Roam.  A lightweight wireless speaker where you can take anywhere.  A fantastic new addition to their stable as people want to spend more time outside this year. \n\n[Here's a link to the Verge talking about the details of it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22317082/sonos-roam-features-trueplay-sound-swap-leak-specs-price)\n\nBut here's why this is important. The average investor or algo hasn't picked up on this because it hasn't hit any of the media they cover.  It's going to be new information to them.  While you'll have the leg up on it. \n\nThe Roam is likely to be their main announcement tomorrow but since they leaked this people are expecting another announcement, like in the headphone space.  \n\nTo give you an idea of how big the headphone announcement might be Kingston just sold the HyperX headphone brand to HP, for nearly half a billion dollars.  If you give Sonos that same market cap increase, that's worth 12% upside from it's closing price today. 12%! Because of a product announcement. \n\n**Reason #2 management wants to talk 2021 guidance:** \n\nLet's imagine you're having an investor day a month after you last earnings call. Things are going just okay.  Do you want to make it a point to talk guidance during your new product presentation? NO, you don't.  You hope things get better and just reaffirm you current guidance.  \n\nNow let's pretend things are going great.  That your team is currently crushing the current Q's numbers.  You have an investor day coming up, what a perfect opportunity to tell everyone that you're going to raise guidance and likely crush those low numbers again with the new products. \n\nSituation number 2 is what is likely to happen. Management made it a point to let people know they'll be talking earnings and guidance during the meeting tomorrow. Management only does this if they're confident. \n\n**Reason #3 no supply chain issues:**\n\nI'm cheating a little, this is more of a long term investment reason but it's likely to get brought up tomorrow.  Sonos' management team has been open about their supply chain struggles last year, and vowed to fix them.  During their last conference call they talked about how with the latest shipping issues they were not caught flat footed and have a solid pipeline of materials to build their products. Which is likely why they might raise guidance tomorrow. \n\n**Reason #4 new partnerships for Sonos Radio:** \n\nI'll let others who have Beams talk about this, not just me, but Sonos radio is super solid and an amazing long term growth addition to Sonos' catalog of products. The streaming service is fantastic when you just want a mood or type of music but don't want to deal with Spotify or Pandora playlists. They've been getting bigger and bigger names to partner up with them and create a curated playlist.  They will likely announce a few new ones tomorrow, and talk in detail about the reoccurring revenue of Sonos Radio. \n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nSonos is one of the few companies I feel it worthwhile to take a risk on in this environment. Its got huge long term tailwinds that I'm happy to talk about in more detail, but tomorrow is going to be a big uppie day.  So feel free to be in on Sonos with a cheaper buy in price.  Than buy in on Wednesday for 10% more. \n\nPositions: 1500 shares, 3/19 35s, 4/16 40s, 7/16 45s. \n\nTL;DR?
