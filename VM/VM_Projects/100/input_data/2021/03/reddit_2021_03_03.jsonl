It’s also no secret that you missed the fucking rocket. Once again, you’re stuck bagholding dogshit while your friends are partying on the moon. I’m here to tell you that it’s all going to be okay. Do not FOMO into RKT while it's on its way back down to Earth. I’ve got another rocket lined up, fueled, and ready to rip. Enter $UWMC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Background\n\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage (UWMC) is a company who underwrites loans for independent mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers - Instead, borrowers mainly deal with the company's loan servicing department. They recently went public through the SPAC known as GHIV, and since then, their share price has unfortunately been on a steady decline, until today.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n\n\n#A Swing Play, a Value Play, and a Long Term Hold, All Rolled Into One\n\nAs /u/Winring86 eloquently stated, UWMC is a swing play, value play, and long term hold rolled into one. UWMC is in a very bullish position due to it being an ideal candidate for swing trading, value investing, and growth investing. This attracts people from a wide variety of investing backgrounds, ultimately giving it some insane exposure within the institutional, and retail spaces. Furthermore, there are a number of positive upcoming catalysts for UWMC, as well as positive analyst sentiment about long term prospects.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n\n\n#Swing Play\n\nCurrently, there are two swing-play catalysts in effect for UWMC. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Catalyst #1)** \n\nIt’s in the same sector as RKT. We all see what’s happening with that right now - It’s the entire reason I even thought of this play to begin with. As much as people try to deny it, certain “baskets” of stocks trade in relation to one another. This was most prominent during the GME squeeze. GME started ripping, and it started carrying other trash up with it, like AMC, NOK, BB, etc. The movement of these stocks seemed almost intertwined. GME ripped, and so did the other meme stocks. GME started drilling, and the rest followed suit. The exact same thing is happening in today's market environment. RKT is ripping, and it’s drawing attention to other mortgage and finance stocks, causing them to gap up as well. So long as RKT keeps ripping, the rest should follow suit, and since UWMC is so much closer to it’s floor (only up 20% compared to RKT’s 120%), it results in us being able to place a much safer bet. Luckily, this isn’t the only catalyst, which means that if RKT starts to go down, there may be a divergence among these equities, with UWMC continuing to trend upwards even after the RKT fiasco ends.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Catalyst #2)** \n\nOn the morning of March 1st, it was announced that UWMC will be added to the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 indices. These inclusions almost always result in a price increase, due to the indices and index funds having to purchase shares for exposure. Furthermore, this also results in the future potential for UWMC to be added to the S&P 500.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith the explosive growth of companies within the same sector, as well as index inclusion being right around the corner, UWMC seems like an extremely good candidate for a potential swing trade.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Deep Value Play\n\nFrom a strict fundamental perspective, UWMC is horribly undervalued. Many of the same principles /u/DeepFuckingValue uncovered in Gamestop are present in UWMC today. They have an incredible balance sheet, insane YoY growth, and fundamentally sound business prospects. These metrics include :\n\n- A P/E ratio of 3.8, compared to the sectors average of 14.0\n- Forward P/E of 6.11 compared to the sectors average of 11.0\n- **Q4 2020 Net Income of $1.37 billion and FY2020 net income of $3.38 billion - An 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively**\n- Q1 2021 expectations : 22.6% - 34.4% increase from Q1 2020\n- 5% Dividend, coming up on March 9th\n- High level of institutional ownership\n- Short Interest of around 35-45%\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUWMC absolutely brutalized their earnings, and are expected to continue dominating them well into the future. Smart money has loaded up on shares, and is waiting for liftoff. The current valuation of UWMC is criminal, and I can easily see this stock reaching into the high twenties over the course of the following year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Long Term Prospects\n\nOn top of the deep value play, UWMC is also poised for steady, long term growth. UWMC is projected to have a better 2021 than 2020, and see a steady increase in EPS. This is starkly different from its peers, who are expected to experience the opposite - Most companies within the same sector are expected to have significantly worse years going forward, following the inevitable hike in interest rates, which UWMC actually looks forward to. Since UWMC is a mortgage lender, a hike in interest rates will result in an insane jump in profits for them as a company, leading to explosive growth. The company is poised for success even after the swing trades and value plays have run their course, and to me, that’s extremely bullish.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Trading Strategies\n\nGiven that my thesis has convinced you, we arrive at the fun part of the article - the trading strategies. Overall, there are many ways to approach this trade, and I’ll lay them out in relation to the type of play one would want to make.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you’re looking for a short term swing play, your best bet would likely be the April contracts at the $10 or $12.5 strikes. These options are trading dirt cheap, and if you believe that RKT and UWMC will continue to run in tandem with one another, these would prove to be an awesome pickup. These will likely be best to buy on or after March 10th, after the ex-dividend date, as stocks tend to drop post dividend. These contracts will give you exposure to the bullish runs within the mortgage sector, as well as the pre Russel index inclusion runup.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you’re looking for a deep (fucking) value play, you could look to sell ATM cash secured puts on the underlying and pray for assignment. Alternatively, you could outright buy a boatload of shares and LEAPS (similar to what DFV did with GME back in June). Both would work just fine, and would let you capitalize on the value prospects of this play.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you’re just looking for a nice stock to buy and hold, grab some shares, wait for the inevitable runup post Russel inclusion, and sell some covered calls once the premiums start to get jacked to the tits. You’ll amplify your returns, while reaping the benefits of organic stock appreciation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Bear Thesis\n\nAlongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I’m no better than a pump-and-dumper. Below, you can find a list of potential negatives related to UWMC, with respect to the various investing timelines discussed above.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Swing**\n\n- RKT can grind to a halt, killing all momentum within the sector, similar to how GME took out the other meme stocks when it popped.\n- Russel inclusion doesn’t drive up the price nearly as much as anticipated, resulting in little change in the underlying's price.\n- Stock and option pricing sometimes drops post dividend - pay close attention to March 9th.\n- Although uncommon, the low float may result in potential manipulation from MMs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Deep Value**\n\n- Mortgage industry faces potential insecurity, as the promise of 0% interest rates may be extended all the way until the end of 2022\n- Mortgage companies are not “sexy”. In a market dominated by innovation and tech, investors may be reluctant to invest their money in a “boring mortgage company”.\n- Insiders are allowed to sell in 6 months time. Luckily, the CEO of UWMC owns 90% of the company, and has been adamant that company will prove itself to be worth analyst's valuation of at least $14.50 - Take this with a grain of salt.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Long Term Prospects**\n\n- An upcoming market or housing crash could potentially result in this sector being hit harder than the others. This is an extremely unlikely scenario, as we will likely have far bigger problems than UWMC dropping 2$ back down to 7$, but still one to consider nonetheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nAll in all, amidst the RKT madness, UWMC seems to provide us with an awesome trading opportunity. With different trades applicable to three distinct investing styles, UWMC offers the potential for everyone to make some coin. If you want to capitalize off of the RKT pump and index inclusion, you can look to swing trade with some cheap option contracts. If you’ve done your due diligence, and like what you see on UWMC’s balance sheet, you can take a deep value approach and mimic the methods of our king. Lastly, if you’re just a boring ass boomer, you can grab some shares and enjoy the gain train. If you enjoyed the DD, feel free to follow me on twitter, or join my investing discord.

Let me add to it. The mortgage industry has benefitted from historically low rates the past few years. These lower rates have led to a massive surge in refinances that have kept companies like UWMC and others struggling to handle the volume, leading to maxed out origination capacity and fat margins. \n\nRates are trending higher, with the 10yr going from 50bps to 150bps from June 2020 to now. If these rates remain high or go higher borrowers will have much less incentive to refinance because the rate they’re paying is lower than the prevailing rate they could get on a new loan. This would cause refinance originations to dry up. \n\nIf refinance volume drys up then originators will have excess capacity which would lead to them competing on price by compressing margins, negatively impacting performance. Also, they would have to rely on new purchase originations for volume. \n\nThe mortgage market has benefitted significantly from transient technical tailwinds over the past few years and I’m skeptical those years can be soon repeated. \n\nAlso, let’s not pretend RKT has any basis in fundamentals.

I do want to point out that the “threat of 0%” that you are referring to is just the Fed Funds rate that the treasury arbitrarily sets for banks and institutions to borrow from the treasury. They keep the fed funds rate low during economic downturns to encourage banks to keep lending to consumers. Mortgage rates are generally tied to the 10 year treasury rate, which has been rising. But even in the event that the 10 year stays low and subsequently mortgage rates do too, UWMC will continue to make money on the front end of the loan via increased origination and underwriting fees, as they have been for most of 2020.

RKT has great market share but realtors hate when clients consider using them because they frequently take way longer to close a loan than what is considered normal (3-4 weeks right now).  **Originators like the salespeople working through UWMC have a major competitive advantage against Rocket and others because they close deals fast!**  That is all that matters to realtors and realtors are often the person that is pointing people in the direction of the lending option.\n\nI have a large position in UWMC that I've happily been holding since it was GHIV (the SPAC it merged with) and at these prices I have added more shares.

I want to set up a put credit spread st@7.5 & st@6 for $0.6 and $0.18 and then also buy calls at st@15 for $0.88. The trade will cost a net of $0.46 or $460 for the 10 contract positions and tie up $500 in collateral to cover the PCS. \n\nEssentially, at any strike above $7.50, my losses are locked to -$460 until I decide to close my calls allowing me to leverage a higher profit when I do decide to take profit at the expense of a deeper potential for loss should UWMC plummet.\n\nScenario 1: stock falls to support of \\~$7.5 and my loss is -$460. Contrast this with the $880 that I would lose should it fall with naked calls. \n\nScenario 2: stock goes up to 15 and beyond and I can now exit my calls at $2.28. My 10 calls sell for $2280 and my PCS can be exited or left to go to expiration netting me $420 either way. My total is $2700. However, I spent $460 to enter the position so my profit is $2240.

{"title": "Good news from NIO; but there are some who want you to think otherwise.", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo we recently got NIO's 2020 Q4 and full year financial results. Some highlights include:\n\n1. $2.5 billion reached for annual revenue\n2. Gross margins grew to 17.2%\n3. Positive full year operating cash flow\n4. $6.5 billion in the war chest as of 31st of December 2020\n5. Q1 deliveries expected to be above 20,000 EVs\n\nOverall, NIO has shown amazing improvements; they've definitely come a long way, and to anyone who can look at the results honestly, it's evident that NIO will be much higher in the future. One of the reasons I say this is because of what we're seeing from the media trying to spin this situation negatively; and while it is true that anxiety regarding semiconductors and batteries can limit NIO's production, from the information we have, it doesn't appear it will have much of an effect.\n\nIn the earnings call, NIO's CEO Willie Li Bin (NIOgang's homeboy) said that NIO will be producing 7,500 EVs in the second quarter 2021 until July wherein the production capacity will increase to 12,500--meaning an annual 150,000 EV production; it's also knows that this will potentially double again to 300,000 in 2022--meaning 25,000 NIO EVs produced a month.\n\nIt should also be knows that yes NIO's deliveries were down in February, but this is due to the Lunar new year holiday; literally people were not at work. But interestingly, NIO delivered 5,578 in February, beatings Xpeng's 2,223.\n\nIf you go to some of the forums like Stocktwits or Twitter, there's bears/shorts deliberately trying to scare people to sell--as if what's written above is bad news. Here's the [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/chinese-tesla-rival-nio-chip-shortage-will-hit-electric-car-production.html) for the 'bad news' these fearmongers are dragging out.\n\nTake the supposed EPS miss by NIO: as the analyst Edison Yu points out, the EPS miss is misleading because it was actually due to the FX loss (the weak USD hurting NIO's cash balance). Basically not NIO's fault. Here's the [link](https://twitter.com/edison__yu/status/1366538414271660032) to his statement.\n\nThe fact that NIO is ramping up production (remember that even at 7,500 this is more than their monthly deliveries in 2020); the fact that NIO has openly said they're entering Europe in H2 ([link](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/03/19912404/nio-to-begin-exporting-evs-to-europe-in-second-half-of-2021-report)); the fact they have $6.5 billion now; the fact that production will be 12,500 from July, and 25,000 in 2022--all of these show how much of a winner NIO is, and why NIOgang will stay strong.\n\nBut watching all the negativity, it definitely reminds me of last year around this time, before NIO went up over 1,000%. I think it could happen again. I think about it while I'm at work; and I remember that it was Reddit where I first found NIO, and NIOgang\n\nWe've gotten fantastic news recently; don't let the haters drag us down.\n\nI like the stock.", "id": "lwjo2j", "created_utc": 1614740793.0, "score": 282, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "Double my position after reading that they are expanding to Europe ....

{"title": "Good news from NIO; but there are some who want you to think otherwise.", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo we recently got NIO's 2020 Q4 and full year financial results. Some highlights include:\n\n1) $2.5 billion reached for annual revenue \n\n2) Gross margins grew to 17.2%\n\n3) Positive full year operating cash flow \n\n4) $6.5 billion in the war chest as of 31st of December 2020\n\n5) Q1 deliveries expected to be above 20,000 EVs \n\nOverall, NIO has shown amazing improvements; they've definitely come a long way, and to anyone who can look at the results honestly, it's evident that NIO will be much higher in the future. One of the reasons I say this is because of what we're seeing from the media trying to spin this situation negatively; and while it is true that anxiety regarding semiconductors and batteries can limit NIO's production, from the information we have, it doesn't appear it will have much of an effect.\n\nIn the earnings call, NIO's CEO Willie Li Bin (NIOgang's homeboy) said that NIO will be producing 7,500 EVs in the second quarter 2021 until July wherein the production capacity will increase to 12,500--meaning an annual 150,000 EV production; it's also knows that this will potentially double again to 300,000 in 2022--meaning 25,000 NIO EVs produced a month.\n\nIt should also be knows that yes NIO's deliveries were down in February, but this is due to the Lunar new year holiday; literally people were not at work. But interestingly, NIO delivered 5,578 in February, beatings Xpeng's 2,223. \n\nIf you go to some of the forums like Stocktwits or Twitter, there's bears/shorts deliberately trying to scare people to sell--as if what's written above is bad news. Here's the [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/chinese-tesla-rival-nio-chip-shortage-will-hit-electric-car-production.html) for the 'bad news' these fearmongers are dragging out. \n\nTake the supposed EPS miss by NIO: as the analyst Edison Yu points out, the EPS miss is misleading because it was actually due to the FX loss (the weak USD hurting NIO's cash balance). Basically not NIO's fault.

This is a casino. \n\nSo let me educate you on when to sell. Now, imagine you are looking at a graph of exponential growth, https://cdn.corporatefinanceinstitute.com/assets/exponential-growth-1024x683.jpeg\n\nNow, as your PROFIT goes up so does both the RISK of losing your money, as well as the RARITY that it's gone this high. So what does that mean? That means you have a 90% chance of getting a 5% increase in the green, and a 5% chance of getting a 90% increase. \n\nSo, if you placed all your bets (stocks) most would go up 5%. Probably zero would go up 90%. If you had one that hit like RKT, I would have sold near the end of the day because after 4 it's probably out of your hands, and this morning the same. Now imagine you sold RKT last night at 4. You have then two options: Watch it go to 100 (less than 1% chance of that happening) or watch it fall. Of course it could go sideways, but after that volitility it was either going to go up or down. Likelyhood it kept going up is super rare. So you would either have $40/share with regrets of not leaving it in and hitting $100, or you would have nothing if it tanked. So somewhere in the middle, you sell. \n\nMy general rule is the more obscene the profit is, the more I should sell. GME (for me) went from $3500 to $10,000 and then 11k then back to 10k. I immediately panicked and sold at $9500 even though it was still going up and down.

We are paying back some of the crazy quick rises, especially with tech and some other recently expanding industries, that's it. Big Money is not leaving the US market for bonds, and I see very few \"pundits\" or high level investors even suggesting that (I know some are raising concerns, but they are the minority). If serious money's leaving for anything, it's leaving for cryptocurrency, definitely not for a 1.5% yield. At the most, this is only an annual or semi-annual re-organization of the portfolio while bond yields aren't complete shit.\n\nThey can raise interest rates, which they won't, and still be lower than they were a year ago... it makes sense that stocks were hitting all time highs based on this, and \"this\" has been confirmed by the feds as not going away anytime soon... i seriously think most investors know that stock entities are still where it's at in 2021, and at some point the floodgates will open again.\n\nI even think some of the big tech drop is FUD. Imagine doing research into Roku and thinking that stock is not a hell of a five year play just because we aren't going to be locked inside for 2021. Cable cutting is still expected to grow more than ever, smart TVs are going to continue to grow, and Roku has their market dominated. They get to use Netflix, HBO, Dixney+, while those services compete each other. I don't see how Roku dropping 100 dollars over the last 2-3 weeks is anything other than a seriously short-sighted reaction, for one of numerous examples out there right now, at least if you consider your stocks an investment beyond 3 months, as you should.\n\nIf anything concerns me, in the short term it is how quickly the market seems to panic and react to the bear pushers in what looks like the most obvious bull future possible.\n\nIn the longterm, it's global warming.

I expected them to go bankrupt.  So far, Tesla has been unable to make a profit solely manufacturing cars.   Tesla has been perpetually selling shares to raise cash.   New competition seems to come online every day.  Tesla is no longer the number one EV in China.\n\nTSLA’s global market share has been shrinking as Volkswagen along with numerous new Chinese EV makers come onto to the scene.  TSLA sold the most electric cars last year, but market share in Europe and China has been falling. Toyota, Ford, GM, BMW, Mercedes are not small players and will continue to grab more and more sales from TSLA as they bring their EV models online. JD Power ranked Tesla 30 out of 33 for reliability. And just recently an independent test showed TSLA failed to meet its EPA range numbers. Only one other company did that, Polestar. All of the others managed to meet or exceed their EPA numbers.\n\nWith serious quality issues, inability to make a profit solely from manufacturing, EPA standards misses, I expected TSLA to be out of business in five years.\n\nI have changed my opinion on TSLA simply due to their market cap as investors have bid the stock to ridiculous values.\n\n**Market Caps of Automakers**\n\nTSLA $821 billion\n\nFord $45 billion  GM $80 billion  Toyota $212 billion Volkswagen $110 billion\n\n**2020 Vehicle Production**\n\nTSLA 500,000\n\nFord 2 million  GM 2.5 million  Toyota 8.8 million  Volkswagen 10 million\n\nWhat do you do when you see your market share falling and companies that make many multiples of your output start crowding your markets? You buy them if you can. TSLA could make an offer to any of these companies with TSLA stock at significant premiums anytime Elon Musk wants to. \n\nOf these, Ford still has $1 billion in Federal tax credits as they haven’t produced any EV cars to speak of. The rest have already received theirs. Elon loves to get new cash in. He simply could offer one tenth of his market cap or $82 billion in TSLA stock for Ford’s $45 billion. \n\nFord also just reported they have $38 billion in cash with total liquidity of $45 Billion. I’ll repeat, Elon loves cash. For this cash, he could swap TSLA stock and receive $1 billion in future tax credits along with $45 Billion in liquidity. And get the rest of Ford for FREE including the well-reviewed E-Mustang. I want one and I bet Elon does too.\n\nFord generates four to five times the free cash flow that TSLA does. Ford has hundreds of manufacturing plants around the world. Ford has proven they can profitably build cars AT SCALE. TSLA is nowhere near building cars in quantities close to what Ford builds.\n\nFord suspended the dividend last year due to the Covid pandemic as did GM. Neither has reinstated it but expect both to do so this year. Ford would be eligible for institutional portfolios that require investments to pay dividends.\n\nTesla has certainly changed the automotive world from the outside looking in. To change it from the inside looking out, he needs Ford’s manufacturing abilities.\n\nThis is not my original idea as it has been floated more than once in the media.

{"title": "A message to all the TSLA and NIO and general investors that are selling out and panicking.", "selftext": "First off. Lmao. Cant tell you how many times I’ve been called a “boomer” for avoiding TSLA and NIO. For the people that are still holding on, good on you.....but the people panicked and selling at a loss, yikes. \n\nIt’s times like this where we learn the most about ourselves. \n\n- Ask yourself what you’ve learned about your risk tolerance. \n\n- Ask yourself what lessons you’ve learned about the reason why you are investing and buying companies. \n\nWhen the market goes down or one of my holdings tank. I am often reminded of Peter Lynch. He says that when you buy a company because the returns are good, when the stock goes down people don’t know what to do and sell. I feel like this is a lot of y’all. Y’all bought TSLA and NIO in hopes of 7xing your money...but now that TSLA is down 25% from its ATH, and NIO is down 33%; y’all don’t know what to do, so you panic and then sell. \n\nAbout a month ago, I found this article by Financial Samurai \n\nhttps://www.financialsamurai.com/risk-tolerance-is-difficult-to-measure/\n\nI think he shares an important lesson/warning about investing. Your perceived risk tolerance is an illusion. The truth is, most of y’all (including myself) have never experienced major crashes. I know a good chunk of y’all probably started in 2020 and only experienced 2020 style returns, let me tell you that isn’t normal. \n\nIt’s easy to say “buy and hold forever!!!” And I assume most, if not all of you say that because it’s common advice and common sense, however we all have a plan until SHTF as the saying goes. \n\nIt’s important to keep a level head when it comes to investing. Buffett always preaches that investing doesn’t take smarts, it takes guts. You can put all your money into VOO and have good returns, but if you can’t stomach crashes/corrections and sell, then you won’t make money. \n\nPersonal way of dealing with this: \n\nWhen it comes to volatility, I’ve experienced some large 20% plus drops in prices and have held on. It’s hard but I’ve held on and bought more during those dips because I believe in what I’m buying and know why I am buying it. I’ve done my DD over the companies I’m in and that gives me the confidence I need to keep going. What helps me, is not looking. I’ll delete the app or turn off my computer and make myself busy. This helped me the most last spring, I used to watch it like a hawk when things would dip and I’d start to panic and think about selling. When I turn it off, that impulse goes away some. What also helped me was, before I buy anything I write down on a Word Doc, why I’m buying it; and before I sell, I write down and explain what factors changed that makes me need to sell the stock, if nothing changed, I know I’m being irrational and I need to buy the dip. \n\nSo these are just my observations.

{"title": "Why the market is not crashing:", "selftext": "First off, let's go straight to the point. The last few weeks have been a bloodbath for most of the market. To many, especially new traders, this seems like a full blown market crash. Well, it's not... a market crash needs a catalyst. Think back to every single crash, whether it was the dot com bubble, the housing bubble in 08, and even the flash crash on black Monday in 87' they all had a catalyst, if not many catalysts.\n\nI keep reading over and over again in the media that the bond yeilds jumping is the reason for this market crash speculation. Let's think about this for a second though - besides the fed trying to hammer home the message to investors that the bond yeilds are absolutely no cause for concern, and actually it's not even close to reaching concerning territory yet, as well as the bond yeilds are actually signaling strength in the economy - how in the world do people come to conclusion that the market is about to crash because of this? Is there any real basis to this? Ask yourself this.\n\n Another narrative that i keep seeing the media push is \"the economy is overheating\". Seriously? What does that even mean? The economy is recovering so fast that the market is going to crash? This has to be the most insane thing I've read yet. I can also note that the same journalists who publish this FUD about overheating, are the same journalists who will also write that the market is crashing when there is BAD economic data (such as the job report this morning). So let's ask ourselves, how can both a booming recovery and a slow, painful recovery BOTH be ingredients for a crash? I cannot comprehend how ridiculous this is becoming. Good news = market crash, bad news = market crash. What do we need for the market not to crash? \n\nI can't talk about all of this without mentioning a wild phenomenon. My portfolio. A very well diversified array of etfs which hit almost all sectors of the market. The best thing to happen to it? A global pandemic/ lockdown. The worst thing? Economic strength indicators, covid cases plummeting and vaccines and stimulus getting pumped into the masses. Has the world gone mad?\n\nMy conclusion is only this. Plain and simple, fear. Fear is what's bringing this bloodbath upon us. Panic selling over irrational news articles. Just compare the VIX (fear gauge) chart with almost every single tech stock or major company's stock chart. It's literally an inverse. A mirror image.\n\nIf there is anything to take away from this is that I truly believe this is just mass hysteria and it the dust will settle. Stocks will rise again. Invest in what you believe in and avoid the FUD that's being pumped out for click bait by seemingly every news outlet.\n\nTl;dr: there is no crash. This is panic selling on a mass scale. Don't believe the media fud - the pandemic is ending and there is light at the end of this Corona virus tunnel. Buy the dip with money you can afford to potentially lose and all shall be good again on wallstreet. *Edit* I am not an expert, do not take this as financial advice. I was merely venting/ ranting during this paragraph. Only invest what you are willing to lose. \n\nEdit: I almost forgot to mention a big one: \n\nAnother theory that is floating around is the market being in a bubble. This is probably the most spread rumor. This one is pretty simple to shut down I think. Earnings season was insane. Comoanjes blew estimates out of the water left and right. Banks, big tech, e commerce, etc. These are the sectors that are being targeted heavily by fud in the media. These are also the companies doing the best they ever have. So how is this a bubble? Of course, companies like tesla and gamestop (lol) can be viewed and argued as in a bubble. But these companies are few and far between.\n\nEdit#2 as someone here pointed out, the current p/e ratio is at around 40 for the s&p500. Is this really a cause for concern?

It's important that all members of this sub act carefully when it comes to handling their investments.\n\nThis is going to be big blocks of text for those that have time/interest to read, but I may as well get all my thoughts down if anyone wants to discuss.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**<FED's DUAL MANDATE: FULL EMPLOYMENT, OPTIMAL INFLATION>**\nThe main concern I have is that presumably the broader market believes that the Fed will always come saving the market. The Fed's dual mandate is to keep a target on \"optimal\" inflation and full employment. That's it. That being said if there was a full-on crash scenario they will probably step in the banking sector to act as some last lender of resort and attempt to add stability in the market through more QE. Practically speaking, they do have limits of what they can do but I won't presume to tell others what these limits are because I honestly do not know.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**<YIELD TRENDS: HEADING HIGHER = BOND BUYER SENTIMENT CHANGING>**\nIn the near and medium term the media narrative will continue to mention \"yield curve control\" which means that if the Fed sees rising bond yields at the longer end as a threat to the recovery, they will intervene in the bond markets to try and tamp them down. The reason why these yields would increase is just because they are insanely low from a historical perspective since inflation is targeted typically in the 2% range and the 30-year yield has been as low as about 1.27% it's moving back towards 1.85%. The longer end yields going back up right now is basically just an expectation of increasing inflation to more normal measures and it would be difficult to \"control\" these yields since it's a very very large market and sentiment for these bond buyers will change if inflation indicators tick up substantially. My opinion is that the Fed has been able to control the market in this temporary period mainly because Fiscal policy has been tight for a long long time on the back of political pressures to lean heavily on central banks for easing market conditions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**<FISCAL STIMULUS = INFLATION>**\nSince we're now seeing one of the biggest stimulus bills in history, this is the start of fiscal policy that directly injects money into the hands of people that will spend it - instead of previously, where large corporations and banks were the main benefactors of the monetary and fiscal stimulus policies. This increased spending in the economy in a short period of time could actually spike inflation higher which basically means that the bond buyers will sell bonds and Fed would then have to increase rates at some point to calm down runaway inflation fears. Inflation surging is a big scary thing for them. Just as a context historically Federal Funds Rate has been about 5.0% we are at 0.25% and a year ago it was 1.75%. There is still a long way to go if we are heading back to a more \"normal\" fed funds rate.\n\nSo basically, if the Fed doesn't deem that threat of deflation to be near term, I would expect that they are more willing to allow interest rates to move up now that main street is going to fuel a significant amount of spending and money velocity.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**<THE CRASH? LIKELY NOT. MAYBE \"NORMAL\" BEAR MARKET>**\nCould this be the catalyst to crash the market? My personal opinion is that it probably won't be. Part of this is because we already see it coming. A catalyst for a bonafide crash won't normally be known. However, what could happen is that it could just trigger a more \"normal\" bear market in equities. This will be just gaps lower over time - lower lows and lower highs and then possible a saw tooth market for another few years. It might just be a long, painful reversion to the mean. If this causes employment measures to dip lower and jeopardize the long term economic recovery the Fed will step in with more accommodating measures once inflation is sufficiently pushed down. However, the Fed's mandate says nothing about the stock market. It could theoretically drop 5-10% over 6 months and if all employment measures and inflation look good and have positive outlook. They may not do anything other than say \"we're looking ahead and ready to deploy more liquidity in banking sector, if required - but right now we're not going to do anything since growth signals are in place\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**<WHY BEAR MARKET? HIGHER RATES, INSANE DEBTS = SENTIMENT CHANGE>**\nWe have to understand that the world has been addicted to low interest rates for a long time now and low growth has persisted. We now know that this QE/low interest rate experiment isn't generating growth. It's only prolonging dead companies from actually going bankrupt, causing asset inflation and enacting a high level of financial repression against the poor/savers. If fiscal policy continues to stabilize main street I would say that this is a big risk to continued Fed easing. That doesn't mean that broader markets can't go up due to growth prospects but I think the stock market has grown used to all these accommodative policies and traders have constantly been front running each round of stimulus and buying the dip without looking at debt measures that are greatly affected by rising rates. With bonds yields being abused a lot of traders are on sitting on one side of the boat.\n\nThe crappy companies will likely need to fall away before we get an efficient reallocation of capital & resources so that the indexes can be filled with actual innovative companies that are able to stand on their own and fuel their own growth. If the Fed does eventually remove themselves from markets, my strong belief is that we have to see this a positive thing for the longer run. Else, it's just going to be a harder landing as more of the economy is running on even bigger amounts of leverage. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**<WILL THERE EVER BE A CRASH? YUP, BUT YOU LIKELY WON'T SEE IT COMING>**\nIs a crash coming? Probably but by the time we hear about it will be too late for 99% of normal people. We have to remember that the Fed has caused a lot of weird, unprecedented things to happen capital markets due to leverage and at the same time past deregulation has made capital market a place for gambling den instead of what it's supposed to be - a place to efficiently allocate resources. Looking at the GME situation how is it that a hedge fund can expose themselves to risks associated with a 140% short position? There is no answer to this because there is no accountability or incentive to find out. These types of moves typically involve a lot of leverage and the precursor for any crash regardless of what other people say is LEVERAGE. Are we more leveraged than any time in history vs. incomes? Maybe. This is an area that will inform the next big one. With low interest rates we can always refinance debt but once the risk-free rate starts rising across the board we might see some institutions that have made the wrong bets with insane leverage that causes a cascading effect. This is basically what precipitated the '08 Crash on a global scale. As soon as accommodating policy ends and the party stops, we start discovering who is up shit creek without a paddle. Investors are too busy dancing, they don't see the build-up of risks until it's too late. This is the part of history that rhymes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTLDR; The Fed Put may be ending due to real near term inflation.

Do you believe this is actually going to happen and if so would it help in bringing down the inflation numbers? \n\nSure, but as I mentioned above I'm not a professional but I can try to explain my understanding as to how the fed funds rate works and why it would move up in the face of rising inflation.\n\nThe overnight lending rate aka overnight federal funds rate acts as lever in the Fed's tool kit to add additional easing into the banking sector. It allows counterparties to take advantage of \"cheap\" rates for short term funds that are required to shore up their balance sheets/capital requirements. Dropping this rate to near zero is far from normal since it should have a close relationship with the real cost of inflation (time + money = some inflation adjusted sum). If inflation is greater than 0.25% and the Fed is lending at a nominal 0.25% the real rate is going to be negative since real rate = nominal rate - inflation.\n\nI think we can all agree that anyone lending at a rate that does not account for inflation is illogical since you are basically losing money after inflation. However, the Fed is doing this so banks are more willing to lend and will experience less liquidity friction. This enables US banks to load up with short term money to push out borrowed funds into the economy and help growth.\n\nThe drop to the \"zero lower bound\" fed funds rate is a practice that encourages banks to lend more money and thereby increase the velocity of money into the economy - as long as there is appetite to borrow.\n\nIf the fed funds rate is super low, this sets interest rates on the shorter end of the curve for lending. So banks basically are able to keep their prime borrowing rates low. This will generally heat up the economy since banks are even more willing to lend due to low short term lending costs and at the same time the general population is able to take these low interest rates to buy goods & services. Due to our fractional banking system this is similar to the effect of printing money since for every liability created in a ledger (which is money), on the borrower's end you have cash to inject into the economy which creates more demand/jobs and thereby broader knock-on effects. If this low low rate continues when people are seeing inflation coming down the pipe they would borrow even more because they see that the cost to borrow would be much lower vs. the inflation rate so there is a positive feedback loop that could inject even crazier amounts of money into the system. This could cause a scary runaway inflation scenario. So in that way the fed funds rate has to \"keep up\" with inflation to make sure that not too much money is flooded into the economy.\n\nSo here's the funny thing, the virtuous cycle mentioned  where loaning money practically \"prints\" money into the economy through spending and generates broader effects? There is also an opposite effect when people start paying back their loans. So money is effectively destroyed once people pay back their loans since the money goes back into the bank (out of the hands of borrowers) and the liability is wiped out. If borrowing costs rise, via higher lending rates, the economy will lose a portion of that tailwind and it could actually reduce certain growth/inflation measures. It'll always be a balance for the fed to try to keep inflation to 2%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> What would be the key criteria for distinguishing the 'actual' innovative companies during the Federal systems' leave from the market, if such a thing occurs? \n\nMy strong belief is that the #1 criteria comes down to leadership quality, which should be a staple requirement for any company that's being invested in. But I suspect a lot of what's driven recent stock purchases is simply headline mania. If you find that the leadership of a company makes bold claims without actually supporting their growth thesis using solid reasoning that's already a huge red flag. There will also be a lot more focus on balance sheet debts as well. The potential regime change of ultra low rates should make debt actually matter now for a lot of firms. High debt loads will siphon funds away from innovation. This interest rate change also means that the timeline for product/service introductions and sales growth will actually matter more now and it will be less likely to be funded by going into deep debt. You have to make sure the company has a strong long term outlook for meeting actual growing market demands and has a considerable lead against other competitors. All these things point to really good leadership and being able to communicate underlying considerations to meet their goals. As a caveat, you also have to put in the work to make sure leadership stays on track though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Also, would you say the terms for bullish/bearish market states can actually differ widely across the globe? Depending on the country, era, balance of expenses for a regular person etc. \n\nIt's definitely possible to have varying market states across the world - especially when you're talking about more local markets that have less factors being affected by Macro conditions and has other growth-related tailwinds working for it. However, global economies are becoming ever more intertwined because of increased trade across borders. Also, a lot of worldwide funding is derived from USD hegemony. Meaning that if USD is driven higher due to tightening conditions a lot of borrowing that occurred in other countries' financial markets (taking advantage of low USD borrowing rates) will in effect cause tightening across the globe in certain regions.  USD loans have to paid back in USD currency, right? If the era was changing where the USD was no longer the global reserve currency that would be a different story but it'd just be another rabbit hole of implications.

Now the S&P500 has broken through its 50 day moving average I suspect it will fall a few percentage more at least. Plus the VIX is still fairly low right now and it's unusual for selling to stop without the VIX spiking significantly over 30.\n\nPeople in high PE stocks genuinely should be concerned here imo.

Because if you look at your recovering economy you'd see December and January industry and housing numbers are down, as is transportation, retail didn't grow so with just a small correction behind us it's only a matter of time until high valuations meet the perfect trigger to spoil the investors off and trigger automated selloffs in an iliquid market.\n\nAnd the fed knows it they just said they'll stop updating the M2 money supply, why because they know they can't let interest rates rise for long or it will crash tech stocks again, but if they overcorrect with QE then we'll see another March deflationary event within 6 months followed by long term inflation and currency wars.\n\nAnd it's not like the gold-bigmac index isn't at an all-time high already.\n\n That being said if you have the long term conviction in companies the way ARK invest has, then go for it, tech is at a discount atm, and if everything falls further this year you'll still have more money to double down by then.

{"title": "AMC Prediction: March 5-March 11 Huge Gains", "selftext": "# Let's start a little about AMC [Last Year Especially]\n\nAMC is an old American company made in 1920 and it has been around for over 100 years. This is not a company that only the older generation/younger generation can connect with. We all have had some kind of experience in movie theaters and most likely have run into an AMC at some point in our lives.\n\nNow over the past few years AMC has begun to drop in stock value \\[steadily\\]. Most of the drops is due to poor money management and over expansion, recently however it was due to Covid-19's forced closures and streaming services taking over.\n\nEarly last year, AMC bought more cinemas in Europe \\[now AMC has the **most theaters** of all companies\\] but instead of bringing it more revenue it gave AMC a blow due to the costs of property purchase and closures due to Covid and cutting of revenue. This has caused AMC to be a prime target for short sale attacks last year dropping the price significantly and at one point hitting **1.91$** which is an all time low.\n\nSo to sum up why it was low last year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Streaming services being used more\n* Cinemas closed due to Covid.\n* No vaccine in sight \\[uncertainty for its future\\]\n* Bankruptcy possibility\n* Free reign hedge fund short selling\n* No one buying the stock\n\n# Now this year is different\n\nWe all know what happens here. I wont go in and explain this to heavily, GME hype led to retail investors investing in other heavily shorted companies and AMC being one of them. AMC sold off shares to retain funds and rule out bankruptcy for the next 4 years.\n\n# Overvalued or Undervalued?\n\nFor the most part, the media has been completely bearish on AMC. The price many media outlets tossed out for AMC has been 1-3$. Now let me explain why I believe that number is completely idiotic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* ~~Streaming services being used more~~ This may be true for the most part, at the minimum pent up demand will have people skipping Netflix night and going out with friends to the cinema. It has already began with people renting out cinemas for personal use. If people are willing to pay 100$+ to rent out a cinema for their family, I doubt they wouldn't be willing to go and watch the next blockbuster hit with a crowded reactionary theater.\n* ~~Cinemas closed due to Covid.~~ New York announced 25% capacity theaters come early March. This alone made the stock shoot up. Imagine a 50%-75% or complete re-opening of AMC theaters? Cinemas are being open soon so this should be another reason to drive up bullishness.\n* ~~No vaccine in sight \\[uncertainty for its future\\]~~ Multiple vaccines have been approved by FDA. Recently Johnson & Johnsons single dose vaccine. Dr Fauci has told reporters recently that vaccines will be made available to **all Americans** by April of this year.\n* ~~Bankruptcy possibility~~ Completely ruled out for the next 4 years due to funds acquired during January rise in prices and stocks being sold off.\n* ~~Free reign hedge fund short selling~~  Unlike last year, this year AMC is the most held stock on Robinhood and Webull. For a hedge fund to bet against AMC when it is the most held stock imo is just moronic. Hedge funds had free reign last year with no one holding it and could barely get AMC to drop to 1.91$ before it began to rise past 2$ again. Now that it is one of the most \\[if not most\\] held stock in existence right now, I could not see a legitimate reason to short the stock or at minimum expect it to be valued at below 5$ which many media outlets have been doing.\n* ~~No one buying the stock~~  Not only are people buying it, they are also holding it. All of AMCs rivals are smaller companies with little to no retail investor interest compared to AMC. They are all above 20$, how AMC is not valued at 10$ minimum by analysis completely proves my point that this stock is just being forced low and is only being held back now by hedge funds.\n\nNow I understand hedge funds who shorted AMC last year had valid reasons. I am not disagreeing here but what they failed to do is adapt to a change in stock market culture. A 2$ stock could be worth 1,000s of dollars if enough people believe it to be that much. Tesla stock right now has higher value  then every single auto-maker stock in existence combined. If enough people hold a stock, the stock wont fail and hedge funds should have closed their positions on AMC a long time ago.\n\n# Now Lets Talk About March\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* March in general has always been a good month for AMC. If you noticed that many of the peaks began in mid March, in some instances a continued rise with new blockbusters being released in the summer time. The best thing you can get from this chart is understanding that winter is bad but March and beyond is good.\n\n[Notice March is at a peak or leads to peak in every year except Covid year 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/na1tpsauepk61.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fe18aa7de5242b29f9393bc332d6c58b8d24f56)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Another reason pointing to a possible spike in price is Vanguard purchasing more shares, Wanda Group still 50% ownership of shares\n\n[Wanda Group converts stock in order to sell, preparing for a rise in price to sell off?](https://preview.redd.it/0fuvle80gpk61.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d1e6f32c67b9ef97febcb47764085f8744c6d33)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# March 5th-11th? Yeah. I believe so.\n\nA lot of people come up with dates and when the date fails expectations drop and people get annoyed when nothing happens. This one is different.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* March 5th \\[this Friday\\] theaters will reopen in NY \\[ over 25% of AMC revenue comes from NY and California\\]. The volume of people entering AMC theaters Friday-Tuesday could drive prices up leading to Thursday, especially with posts on social media showing packed theaters.\n\n[https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* March 9th short interest report will be released. In my opinion the stock had been shorted all of February but that is just my opinion. We will see come next Tuesday but if AMC is heavily shorted \\[my belief it is\\] this will drive the price up farther.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ecj12fvpjpk61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e7d0fd12cedcab1659dbd3dc1ca69210adad2d\n\n* AMC earning are confirmed to be released on **March 10th AFTER HOURS.**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html)\n\nNot only are they confirmed to be March 10th but they are expected to **beat expectations**\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4)\n\n*Speculative but: Not only are they expected to beat expectations but earnings tend to be followed up with good news. I am speculating that Amazon or Netflix may buy AMC and this day could be the announcement date. It is entirely possible AMC would come up with some good news even if this were not the case for its investors to bring its value up. They made a fortune in January and I see no reason for them not to try and drive the price up farther come March 10.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Texas will lift all Covid restrictions March 10th, farther reason for price to possibly go up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* So this leads to me believing from the re-opening this Friday \\[March 5th\\] to Short interest report \\[March 9th\\] and Earning report \\[March 10th after hours into 11th\\] we will see a large price spike in AMC. Can I be wrong? Yes. Will I be wrong? I don't know. What do I think? I like the stock and I will hold the stock.

(Just remember that people started to stockpiling toilet paper a year ago...)\n\nGreed is what put the HF in this situation. Fear is what we lost when the stock went from almost $500 all the way down to $40’s range.\n\nIn this game, when people lose fear all that is left is greed, and it can be really powerful if we use it correctly (we can EASILY surpass the 100K) but it can be our demise as well. \n\nDon’t forget **it’s not the same a HF having a “civilized” fight trying to get out of this mess or passing the hot potato to someone else when the stock is worth only $120+ and they are losing billions than when they are cornered and the stock is passing the 1,000…5,000….10,000.**\n\n**In that moment is when they are going to take the gloves off and the real fight is going to start.**\n\nSo, be prepared that everything and anything can happen; and when hell broke loose all camaderry might stop and it might be every man for himself. \n\nAnd I'm not telling you to let's stay together until the end, fuck no, we are here to become rich and if we make some friends along the way, great, but if not I'll cry alone on top of my pile of money.\n\nHowever, what I'm really trying to tell you is to keep emotions in check, don't be a fool thinking it's going to be a smooth ride, be as greedy as fuck (translation: hold like your life depends on it, cause it does) and please.... \n\n **tl;dr:** **DON’T PANIC AND CARRY A TOWEL.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.

{"title": "General Motors $GM - PT $500 coming soon, DD inside", "selftext": "Hi fellow WSB,\n\n$GM has some real potential to bring me some generational wealth. $500 PT. Yes, you heard that right. \n\n1.\tGM is insanely undervalued, trading at only 12.5 P/E currently and $75bn market cap. GM is the largest automaker in the USA selling over 8,000,000 cars per year. In comparison, Tesla is trading at over 1,500 P/E and $750bn+ MC. Tesla only sells 500,000 cars a year. They make tons of money on their existing ICE lineup through popular brands like Chevy, GMC, Cadillac, Corvette and reinvesting it into Autonomous Vehicles, Electric Vehicles and Flying Vehicles. \n\n2.\tGM currently has many government contracts and will continue to win more contracts. Government agencies use Chevy's SUVs and President Biden's limo is a modified Cadillac Limo. Biden has committed to turning the entire government fleet of 650,000+ vehicles (light trucks, SUVs, semi-trucks, etc...) into fully electric. and built in America, I expect an announcement soon and GM to be awarded some, if not a majority of the contract. Other startup EV companies simply do not have the scale to produce the government contract. Ford has EV production in Germany which is not made in America. Tesla recently purchased $1.5bn in cryptocurrency which the Treasury Secretary Yellen is against. I think $GM is the best bet to win a majority of the government's work.\n\n3.\tGM has committed to selling 30 new EV by 2025, selling ONLY EV by 2035, and being fully carbon neutral by 2040.\n\n4.\tGM owns Cruise Automation. Initially, bought the startup for only $1bn and most recent funding round of $2bn by Microsoft/ Honda has valued the startup at $30bn. Currently in the lead of Autonomous vehicle technology and continuing to grow massively in the technology hub of the world, SF Bay Area. This technology is being massively discounted.\n\n5.\tGM has Utium Battery technology and a $2.3bn factory in Lordstown, Ohio churning out their proprietary battery technology. 50-200kWh battery packs that will push the cost per Kwh under $100 (current cost for Tesla is over $230) in the next few years. These batteries will power the new Cadillac Lyriq and Hummer EV coming out later this year. The  cars are not weak, truly cutting edge! \n\n6.\tApple has rejected Hyundai, Kia, Tesla, Nissan in their bid to find a manufacturer for building an EV. $GM is still in the running and could be a nice surprise. They are cutting edge, mature with manufacturing capability, and made in America.\n\n7.\tFamous investors like Warren Buffett, Leon Cooperman, Joel Greenblatt all piling into $GM in the billions.\n\n8.\tPresident Joe Biden will likely renew the EV tax credit in his upcoming stimulus bills which will cut the price of $GMs EVs by $7,500 and spur sales significantly.\n\n9.\tChip Shortage Fear will be over soon and is only temporary. $TSMC has is in the process of building a huge factory in Arizona which will keep chip manufacturing in the US. Biden will sign executive orders to ease this issue through defense production act.\n\n10.\tNewly released Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV is the hands down most affordable and best value EV on the market today. Bolt starts at $31,995 - Bolt EUV starts at $33,995. Both more range than Tesla Model Y and EUV has $GM's version of Tesla Autopilot, SuperCruise already installed (versus Musk's $10,000 for this upgrade).\n\nMegabullish on this to double or triple once the media/ mainstream investors discover what $GM can really do!

{"title": "COSTCO, no really. When you need a profitable place to land after jumping from the tech train.", "selftext": "Alright so let me start off by mentioning that i'm a long time lurker, first time poster in WSB, and thought it time to make my first contribution. I know, I know, I didn't think my first contribution would be about a Jim Cramer Boomer Stock... but yea, it really is. But just follow along with me here.\n\nI first began the day planning out my next moves for when I start jumping off the tech train (like right about now), and begin embracing the market for post pandemic retail/life (and once the CPI begins to bump, the moves for making money in the market during inflation). This led me to look at commodities and companies which deals with commodities.\n\n**ENTER COSTCO**\n\nI then pull up COST and wonder what the heck am I looking at. Why is there such a dip!?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs582ukeerk61.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd299c206740f45dbfec2923e2483ee9e4fd46cd\n\nThere must have been some terrible news right? Being an avid costco shopper to feed my family of 5, I begin researching what terrible thing happened to Costco to cause such a rapid selloff. But the more I looked the more I realized that this selloff is really just weird...and it could be an opportunity to get some tendies...(or rotisserie chickens...see what I did there?)\n\n**Researching Possible Causes**\n\nCould it be massive shorting like we all see with other stocks? No, its only running 0.98% of shares shorted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6jtyoyferk61.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=52d06efbe13966d7ee2d559e5a7c4fd0d7f6a106\n\nWas there any news of accidents or management issues? None that I could find on google.\n\nThen I come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things\n\n**Warren Buffet Sells his shares of Costco**\n\nhttps://www dot yahoo dot com/lifestyle/warren-buffett-dumps-all-his-costco-stock-3-reasons-why-that-is-a-big-surprise-235600486.html\n\nWell, considering that he sold it off prior to November 16th 2020 (could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 9-10th?) shouldn't the stock have begun to drop from there? It should have, but it didn't. So I looked some more and found that Costco announced a special $10 dividend (which is pretty high...I mean RKT announced a $1.11 div and thought that was amazing). My first thought was that damn, Costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend, and second, that this drop isn't justified if Costco is making a ton of money.\n\nhttps://finance dot yahoo dot com/news/supermarket-chain-costco-declares-special-222312149.html\n\nHere's a chart with the dividend marked (you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nnd0trherk61.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=063271b9d3c38f3b13c8d7296a83c7e1171f5f18\n\nAs you can see, right after the dividend has passed, the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end, and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head, im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason.\n\nSo I do some due diligence and look at the financials, earning calls, etc. I then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price. They seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9hpvqcjerk61.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=830afac11cd00a1ba28c1822105e29a3b5ae78c3\n\nEach blue vertical line marks an earnings call, where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards. Each call is followed by a swing of about 10 points up or 10 points down. Typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds. This confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of Costco, there really isn't any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further (or remain the same).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztl2qhukerk61.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5c4a01bd3fa1ea890684719df463cccf602b57a\n\nAs you can see, the stock is just completely oversold, trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife (you know, buy the dip)...but what could slow the downfall and even reverse it?\n\n**Enter the earnings call March 4th and why I am Bullish**\n\nLooking through the financials, Costco has continuously beat its earnings.\n\n>This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.04%.  \n>  \n>For the most recent quarter, Costco was expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, but it reported $2.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.85 per share, while it actually produced $3.13 per share, a surprise of 9.82%.\n\nhttps://news dot yahoo dot com/costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-171005710.html\n\nAnd looking at its previous 2 years of March earnings, it has always beat its December earnings (for all you call options people). I didn't do a screen capture as its a long scroll. But the data is on the link below. Just look at all the March earnings vs the one reported before it.\n\nhttps://www dot marketbeat dot com/stocks/NASDAQ/COST/earnings/\n\nThe most recent price target estimate I could easily google (ALL above where its trading now)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4obvitmerk61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=5196871a95da03e36cea4ad3f807545f3397fb50\n\n**Fundamentals (if they matter anymore) have not changed, AND WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.**\n\n**They make a ton of money (selling tendies):**\n\n>In FY 2020, ended August 30, 2020, Costco posted year-over-year (YOY) gains in revenue, net income, and other metrics. Total revenue increased by 9.2% YOY while net income attributable to Costco climbed by 9.4% YOY.3﻿ The company said that its e-commerce business saw a 50% YOY increase in sales for FY 2020 as a result of gains in grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.4﻿  \n>  \n>Costco posted revenue of $43.2 billion and net income attributable to Costco of $1.2 billion in its Q1 FY 2021, ended November 22, 2020. Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.\n\n**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**\n\nContinuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.\n\n**They are international (also making tendies):**\n\n>Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.\n\nhttps://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774\n\n**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**\n\n>Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.\n\nhttps://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx\n\nCostco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nI like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?)

The same thing happened with RKT, it takes MMs a while to create a set of option strikes, and say for example the set of March 19th strikes that they released only went up to $30 because at the time, that was 100% (example) out of the money. But now we are reaching the top of the March 19th strikes with 16 days left... so a delta ramp can happen where the majority of strikes in the chain are ITM, and they approach 1 delta the closer they get to expiration.\n\nDelta of 1 means for every 1 share you buy MMs must hedge 1 share. So for example, one call contract with a delta of 0.5 (the 3/19 $25c) would force MMs to buy 50 (0.5 \\* 100) shares of the underlying... yes, you read that right - for $200 (cost of the contract premium) you apply $1250 ($25 \\* 50 shares) worth of upward pressure on the stock.\n\nBecause market makers are constantly buying shares to hedge against your calls, this drives the price up even further, which brings more strikes ITM and makes their delta values start increasing as well, hence the 'ramp'. I will also add that shorts get royally owned in this scenario as their puts are reduced to ashes when the entire chain goes OTM - they risk losing their entire position if they don't capitulate and sell.\n\nThe second RKT broke the top of the chain at $36, it was lift off time. When this happens, that call is the cheapest call anyone can possibly buy and there's a massive increase in price because of basic supply and demand in the options market. Then, you will see that market makers update the options chain in a day or two and the price settles back down. The pent up demand is wiped out when you can suddenly buy and sell $65 calls. That's why RKT went up and that's why RKT is going down (and probably won't come back up again - they updated the options chains for every expiration because of this debacle). It's also why ASO could be the next RKT, it meets all of the same conditions.\n\n!!Bear case alert!!\n\nFloat is 100M shares, open interest is roughly 1M shares in calls, or less than 1% of the float. Theoretically a big institutional investor could crush any upward movement by selling tons of shares.

This is my 1st new play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$NOK got a LOT of love when the first $GME spike happened. It got so much love that it popped to nearly 10$/share before RH blocked trading.\n\nSince then, volume's come down, attention has gone away from the stock, this has made options quite appealing.\n\nIV's down significantly and calls are REALLY cheap.\n\nMy DD:\n\n* They delivered SOLID Q4 and 2020 earnings, even though it was a tough year in general.\n* The company owns the **most** pattents in the 5G space of all it's peers.\n* Huauei is being blacklisted in most of the western world, there are only 2 players remaining in the space, Ericcson and Nokia.\n* The company is sitting on nearly $8 billion in cash and generates over a billion a year in free cash flow.\n* The stock is trading at only 1.5x book value\n* They have been increasing the profit margins significantly for the last 3 years and are working towards improving them even more.\n* Nokia has announced several solid deals over the past few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The company is small enough that it could be an M&A target** \n   * The US Attorney General William Barr [said](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-keynote-address-department-justices-china) the US -- either directly or through a consortium of private American and allied companies -- should purchase a controlling stake in either Nokia or Ericsson for access to secure 5G equipment. He said such a move could blunt the rise of China and Huawei in the space. \n   * AT&T / Tmobile / another carrier could buy them to lower their own costs of updating to 5/6G.\n   * Intel and Microsoft are both focusing heavily on the space and Microsoft already bought part of Nokia in the past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* There's also the potential for them to reinstate their dividend payment policy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Average analyst price target is 5.75$\n* Over the last 10 years, it's been rangebound between 4 and 8$, it's pretty much at the bottom of the range.\n* I'm confident it'll be back to 5 or 6$ by the summer, especially if they keep announcing these solid deals.\n\nPositions: 20 000 shares and 100x 6$ calls sold against them for april 16th.\n\nTLDR: Nokia's a great medium-long term play, IV's down significantly, shares and calls are cheap. This will probably bounce from 4$ back towards 6-8$ over the medium term, or be bought out as a strategic play, likely for over 6$.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prfjxg55xuk61.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=65485e5de2245bf858bd2da9dcfd36f7d428c5c5", "id": "lx13kf", "created_utc": 1614796907.0, "score": 144, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "Sorry OP, we have harsh bots and stuff, probably was automatic.", "score": 79, "replies": [{"body": "You tried helping me once, but you never reply to messages :(\n\nI know you're busy, but it is what it is.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the post.

{"title": "DRAINING THE SWAMP - GME NOTABLE HIRES", "selftext": "Necessary disclosure: I'm not a financial advisor and I have no idea what I'm talking about, I just like the stock 🚀🚀🚀 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong ago when DFV started preaching the GME bull case, he saw it as a value buy. He did hours and hours of due diligence and saw ample growth potential for the struggling retail store. When people compared Gamestop to Blockbuster, he laughed.\n\nSince Gamestop skyrocketed and drew international attention, he has been under a microscope. Billions of dollars see him as the leader, and eagerly await for any slip up that they can pin him with market manipulation for. Everybody knows that his actions were perfectly legal, but the information he puts out is now severely restricted for the aforementioned reasons. Given the wave of new hires, I thought now would be a good time to formally discuss the company's mid to long term potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ryan Cohen Vision**\n\nIf you have any money in Gamestop, you better already know this part. That being said, you degenerates amaze and disappoint me every day so here we go again.\n\nRyan Cohen founded Chewy in 2011 and served as the CEO until 2018 when he sold the company for over $3B. This marked the largest-ever acquisition of an e-commerce company and speaks to RC's expertise in e-commerce. This man is the messiah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn 11/16/20, Cohen formally wrote a letter to the Gamestop board of directions, detailing his concerns with the company as well as the potential that he saw in it. Within it, he discussed:\n\n\\- The growth and potential that the gaming industry has to offer\n\n\\- The large customer base with over 55 million members registered to their rewards program\n\n\\- Gamestop's unwillingness to change with the times\n\n\\- Gamestop's hardships amid the 'gaming boom'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis letter made it clear that he has a vision for what Gamestop could be, and that he has a plan to get it there. He recently upped his stake from 9-12.91% on 1/12/21, which was immediately followed by a rise in the stock price as investors embraced the potential turnaround. If we have any chance of making it to valhalla, Ryan Cohen will lead us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Draining the swamp**\n\nAs Cohen expressed in his letter, one of the main reasons for Gamestop's fall was its lack of competent leadership. The ship has been sinking for years, and its crew has been suspiciously negligent. While conspiracy theories exist that Gamestop execs tanked the company in an effort to insider trade with hedge funds, we'll keep the tinfoil hats off today.\n\n*Jim Bell- Former CFO*\n\nOn February 23rd, 2021, it was announced that Jim Bell, CFO, would be 'resigning'. Myself and many others believe that he was forced out by the new wave, which is supported by [this article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-is-surging-again-and-no-one-can-say-why-51614208357). His background shows he worked primarily with brick and mortar establishments which won't be relevant for the RC vision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*New board nominees -* [source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html)\n\nOn January 11th, 2021, it was announced that Alan Attal, Ryan Cohen, and Jim Grube are new nominees for the board of directors. They stand up for election at the \"annual meeting of stockholders\" which is expected to take place in June 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Alan Attal - Former Chewy CMO and COO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-attal)\n\nOne of Cohen's Chewy buddies, Attal will serve a valuable role in Gamestop's transformation to the digital age. He specializes in e-commerce, marketing, and could help tapping into Gamestop's 55 million customers registered to their rewards program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRyan Cohen - The Messiah\n\nEnough said\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Jim Grube Former Chewy CFO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-grube-7141931)\n\nGrube specializes in e-commerce which is especially crucial for Gamestop's current situation. While has not yet been appointed CFO of Gamestop, I find him to be the most likely candidate. If so, he will be tasked with the trainwreck that is Gamestop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Board nominees likely not up for re-election*\n\nLizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez, James K. Symancyk and Kathy Vrabeck. I'm too lazy to get into detail here but these people are dead weight and do not seem to align with the Cohen vision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other notable hires**\n\n*Matt Francis - CTO*\n\nFrancis began working for GameStop on 2/15/21. He has worked in the e-commerce industry for more than two decades and recently worked with Amazon Web Services. He could play a big role in the modernization of Gamestop's business model. [source](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer) \\- [his linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattfrancis)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Kelli Durkin - Senior VP of Customer Care*\n\nDurkin began working for Gamestop on 3/1/21 and was part of the RC Chewy cohort. She will bring her world-class customer service operation to Gamestop and could help to tap into the large customer base that was mentioned earlier. - [her linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelli-durkin-4552229)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Josh Kreuger- Vice President of Fulfillment*\n\nKrueger previously worked for Amazon and Walmart, and began working on 3/1/21. His job is especially critical as Gamestop's ability to fulfill orders in a timely fashion will ultimately determine their ability to compete with competitors. - [his linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-krueger-b80ba03a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Notable differences**\n\nAs many of you have pointed out, Gamestop has already made a few concrete changes which is quite impressive. They now offer same-day delivery to many locations by utilizing doordash. They were able to tap into a stable network and instantly made themselves a competitor. They have also added many pc parts such as gfx cards to their website. While it may be too soon for these new hires to have caused these changes, they are first-steps in making Gamestop the powerhouse that it once was. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Lots of good new hires, and bad people being let down.

{"title": "$SKT to $200? Might be rarted, might be genius- I'm doing it either way. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "Like a lot of my fellow smooth-brained 🦍, I view $SKT as not just the next short squeeze, but primed for a gamma squeeze that *will look insane* and just might resuscitate the engulfed bricks-and-mortar retail industry. There are a lot of heavily shorted names out there, and while I expect most of them to reap massive tendies, $SKT is the one that stands out.\n\nLet's start with the elephant in the room: **short-interest** and **% float**. $SKT is currently the most shorted stock out there, with 31.76% of total shares short as of this morning. This beats any of the names we know, GME, AMC, BB, RKT, etc. Interestingly enough, $SKT's \\*% short float is at 47.25%!!\\*Compared to every other \"meme stock,\" (other than GME with 60% +), $SKT is easily one of the most, ***if not THE most*** shorted names in the market right now. ([https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)).\n\nNot to mention, *the shares float* provides incredible insights into $SKT's future tendies. Similarly to GME, SKT only has about 90M shares outstanding, while GME has roughly 69M (lol). BBBY has about 121M shares outstanding, which explains why it got somewhat closer to GME than others. But these other names- RKT (1.98B shares), AMC (339M shares), NOK (5.7B shares), BB (563M shares), all have simply *too many shares outstanding*. That's not to say it's impossible to squeeze 'em, but it would require far less capital to squeeze GME, BBBY, or say, **$SKT**.\n\nThe trend in short-interest also seems to be going down, with $SKT and the broader market in general. The WSJ wrote something last week about hedge funds starting to close shorts (or at least being more cautious), and after being the 4th largest put decrease overall in Q4, SKT short interest is off another 19% since February.\n\nOver the past 6 months, we have also seen ever-increasing volume on $SKT. A previous DD mentioned average trading volume on $SKT from the Dec-Feb period was roughly 3M shares, this has increased to roughly $5M shares in the last few months. Today, $SKT appeared to breach the seal with over 17.5M, topping the 10M high we saw in Jan (coincided w/ GME). *This is incredibly important b/c heavy volume when a stock moves up puts massive pressure on long shorts*. *Essentially, if I am right, Chapter 1 began today.* (we should keep an eye on the volume this week, more volume is a *great* sign).\n\nAll of the technical trends bode well for $SKT. But what's got me stiffer than a rock are the broader macro forces guiding both the market and the economy. First, $SKT reinstated their dividend for 2021 Q1, indicating they have ample cash not only to weather this storm, but to continue raising payouts to shareholders, which is quite attractive since 🌈🐻 are getting concerned about rising rates. No problem- SKT has stable, fixed payments, and will award investors for holding- *these will also increase as the economy improves, attracting more investors*. **✅**\n\nNext, we heard from Biden earlier in the week that they expect vaccine distribution to be ramped up by May, not July. This is a *huge WIN* for battered-down bricks-and-mortar retailers who have caved b/c of public health restrictions. As investors race to pick up these forgotten family spots, the \"value\" or really just oversold names will start to fly. **✅**\n\nNot to mention, Tanger Mall Outlets' whole premise is their malls are ***OUTDOORS***, perfect for a post-Covid world that is more mindful of social distancing/sanitation. **✅**\n\nWhere do I think this could go? This is where market cap/valuation comes into play. For all you dipshits who look at the share price and ask \"wHy It DoNt Go Up,\" *market cap is the true determinant*. $SKT currently has a $1.7B market cap, far less than competitors MAC ($2.1B), SPG ($40B) or other highly shorted names like RKT ($56B) or AMC ($2.9B).\n\nSo is a $200 price target a little fluffy and optimistic? Sure. But tldr, when you factor in **how shorted $SKT has been** (heavily shorted by Melvin Capital among others; most shorted stock right now- overall/float), the **attractive fundamentals** (outdoors/social distancing friendly), the **improving economic landscape** (vaccine ramp-up by May/$2T stimulus that will really help small companies), **rising rates** (the shift towards value/dividend-paying stocks)- I have to say, I like the stock, quite a lot.\n\nSo help me God, $SKT is going to fucking *skrt-skrt* to the moon!\n\n\\*UPDATE: A lot of people have been saying Melvin Capital owns SKT. This is **FALSE**. Melvin owns SKT convertible debt- likely b/c they are grubbing for yield (who can blame them on something as fruitful as SKT)?
