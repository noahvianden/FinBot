{"title": "Expected moves for the week. SPY, Tesla, Docu, AMC, Oracle and more", "selftext": "**Market Volatility**\n\nAt the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **2%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $376 to the downside and $392 on the upside. The Nasdaq and Russell saw wild swings last week and options are pricing larger moves for this week than SPY:\n\n**QQQ 2.9%**  \n**IWM 3.3%**\n\nThe VIX got near 32 on Thursday and closed below 25 on Friday after that monster rally back. Implied volatility in the big ETFs can sometimes have a hard time pricing two-way movement like last week. The indices were practically unchanged on the week but were seeing intraday moves larger than what options were pricing for the entire week. The VIX collapsed on Friday on that rally but it certainly wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. In other words, if one is trading pure IV out a month or more those changes in VIX are tradeable. If one is trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... where the VIX or individual stock IV is at entry is less important.\n\n**Tesla** is an interesting name right now as it's sort of representative of the selling going on in recent high flyers. Even with the rally Friday afternoon in the major indices TSLA closed down on the day by 4%. Here's a look at TSLA's expected move over the next few weeks via Options AI:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/scv0hs3hlol61.gif\n\nOptions are pricing about a $50 move in either direction for this week, and about a $90 move for the rest of March. \n\n**Earnings this Week**\n\nEarnings season isn't as active this week but a few names of interest do report. Here are a few of them, their expected moves for this week and how they moved in prior earnings. For a full searchable database you can use the Options AI Calendar (which is free to use). The links in the symbols are to the calendar, the prior earnings moves start with most recent and go back in time:\n\n[PRTS](http://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/NIO) / expected move **20%** / prior moves: -23%, +3%\n\n[DKS](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/DKS) / expected move **8% /** prior moves: +0%, +16%, +4%\n\n[AMC](http://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/WKHS) / expected move **17%** / prior moves +9%, +15%, +5%\n\n[CLDR](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/NVAX) / expected move 12% / prior moves +7%, -12%, -13%\n\n[ORCL](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/SHOP) / expected move 4.5% / prior moves +2%, -1%, -6%\n\n[JD](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/TLRY) / expected move 7% / prior moves -7%, +8%, +4%\n\n[DOCU](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/BIDU) / expected move 9% / prior moves +5%, -11%, -0%\n\n[ULTA](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FSLY) / expected move 7% / prior moves -3%, +6%, +0%\n\nA note on expected moves. Options need to price in both the overall market volatility and the earnings event itself. So a company reporting on Monday still has a few days for the stock to move after earnings and before expiration, while companies reporting on Thursday can move with the market before they report. The percentage moves will be roughly the same barring huge moves in market IV, but obviously what the percentage moves correspond to in the stock will change depending on where the stock is into its event.\n\nThe expected move is extremely useful not only to get a sense of how the crowd is pricing moves but also on strike selection in any option strategy. An oversimplified way to think of it is that if you own premium with a breakeven beyond the stock's expected move you need the options market to have underpriced the move, even if you get the direction correct. And if you are a net seller of premium you want the options market to be overpricing these moves, especially if you get the direction wrong.", "id": "m01o7v", "created_utc": 1615157200.0, "score": 446, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "Super helpful.

AAPL is cheap for the same reason? I've held AAPL almost straight for 10 years now. (The first time I sold it since I bought it in 2011 was when the split happened in August. I've since bought and sold it back a few times since and currently own it.) This isn't \"cheap\" unless you think the COVID-fueled growth is somehow going to continue post-COVID.

Costco is in a similar spot, but I'm not sure I want to own both. \n\nMy idea of \"bargains\" are the companies that will return to \"normal\" based off of \"moderate\" COVID recovery.

An even smaller portion is what I deem my “Vegas money”. This is money in which I pick the stock and is very speculative and essentially gambling. My plan with this money is to, if I “win”, move 50% into my life cycle fund and re-invest the rest. This section of my money contains some value stocks such as AAPL, but is almost half gambles. \n\nHow you invest your money is entirely up to you, but I strongly suggest thinking long and hard about your investment goals. Is it to have the possibility of making a lot of money quickly with the chance of loosing most of it? Sure, pick stocks. Or is it to reasonably grow the money for a future large purchase/retirement? \n\nOf note, in my overall investment strategy my retirement fund I don’t actively manage or even consider on a monthly basis.

It’s a unique program that allows even small sellers to leverage the efficiency of their warehouses. There were 2 month delays at one point getting stuff checked in so most sellers started building out their own capacity to fill orders. Once you’re shipping your own stuff it gives you more freedom to cross list to other platforms. Amazon is where all the traffic is, but I’ve seen a lot more people moving into Walmart Marketplace because competition is less which means higher prices or Shopify to minimize the amount of fees and commissions. eBay saw a resurgence too.\n\nPayPal- one thing I’d be concerned about is for decades all eBay payments went through PayPal and they took a cut on top of EBay. Just in December EBay finally started processing its own payments and cut PayPal out entirely. PayPal has grown its business a ton beyond EBay but I’m sure it’s always been a big part of their revenue. \n\nIn terms of credit cards I think Amex has done the best job of responding to the pandemic.

{"title": "GME SQUEZZE DD MOON SOON (possibly)", "selftext": "Good morning, good afternoon and good evening my fellow retards around the world.\n\nI know many of you are more like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k77i69/wsb_reading_citron_reports/) if it comes to reading DDs. But I wanted to explain a few things with the ultimate aim, that you dont need to do read any more DD but rather can do your own DD. As most of you cant read anyways, Ill put a TLDR with symbols at the bottom. So here we go.\n\n# General squezze theory (I know a lot of words but reading will make you a big brain 🦍)\n\nThere are two types of squezzes:\n\n* short squezze\n* gamma squezze\n\n**Short squezzes:**\n\nEvil Hedgefunds and MMs sell a stock, which they dont have, in hope they can buy it back cheaper. Now price goes up --> Hedgefunds have to cover to cut their losses. Otherwise there is the risk of unlimited loss, as stock price can go up infinitely. If they wait to long they get margin called, because their broker is in fear that they cant cover anymore. And no one wants to get [margin called](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9v5e9/that_margin_call_notification_at_3am/).\n\n**Gamma squezzes:**\n\nEvil MMs (and others) sell far OTM call options. Now price goes up and suddenly those options are ITM. MMs now have to buy the stock to cover their sold options making the price surge once again bringing new formely OTM options ITM, which then again leads to the price surging. This feedback loop is called a gamma squezze. For this to happen you need to have high numbers of OTM option sold at certain strike prices. Just enough, that the next strike price is reached. It is more likely that lower strike prices are reached. MMs know that, hence they have already hedged some of there sold OTM options with these lower strike prices. This is called Delta Hedging. That means you need higher number of OTM options with lower strike prices then of those with higher strike prices to keep the Squezze going.\n\nIf you want to go even deeper I suggest you look at u/Natural_Profession_8 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz8mgr/a_deepdive_on_the_actual_math_behind_gamma/). He also did a formula, which you can use to calculate how to have the biggest leverage with option buying, meaning forcing MMs to buy the most shares with the purchase of option with a certain strike price.\n\nWhat you always need to keep in mind for both kinds of squezze that the price run up to trigger the squezze has to be rather fast. Otherwise, there is more time to cover shorts or hedge options and hence having less effect on the price.\n\n# Applying this to the current GME situation\n\n**Short squezze:**\n\nIm sorry to say that, but I dont think a squezze solely because of shorts covering will be happening any time soon. You have all seen how the short interest has dropped tremendously from the previous legendary 226%^(1) within the last to reporting dates to now 60%^(2).\n\n^(1: 01/14/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)\n\n^(2: 02/11/21,) [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) ^(with Morningstar data, which suggests a Float of roughly 27M shares)\n\n*\"But there was no volume?\".* Just look at the numbers. GME had a average Volume of 40.49M per day over the last three months. As a stock with roughly 70M shares outstanding thats a lot.^(3) AMZN had a 3 months average volume of 3.73M per day with roughly 7x the shares outstanding of GME.^(4) There was enough volume.\n\n^(3:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)\n\n^(4:)  [^(Yahoo Finance)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/key-statistics?p=AMZN)\n\n*\"But what is with the institutional ownership?\"* You all probably all seen these posts, where its said \"Institutions solely hold xTimes Outstanding shares of GME. So there has to be massive short interest.\" (e. g. see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz77ix/gme_total_shares_owned_is_145m_according_to_finra/)). But what most of these Posts are missing, that there often reporting delays in between ownership filing, which is causing these high numbers. If you compare it again to AMZN, you also have institutions owning 1.5x of shares outstanding. With a company called Russell Investments Group, LLC owning over 80% of AMZN shares.^(5) That should show you, that these FINRA numbers arent correct all the time. Especially with high volumes like in GME, there are a lot of Duplicates because of reporting delays.\n\n^(5:) [^(Finra)](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000000B7)^(, Tab: Shareholders)\n\nWith that being said, the amount of GME shares hold by Institutions still seems suspiciously high to me. And there are other things like the reported 111% Short interest in XRT^(6) or the still abnormally high Short interest in GME. That means remaining shorts could still be a nice catalyst for a possible gamma squezze.\n\n^(6:) [^(Etf channel)](https://etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)\n\n**Gamma squezze:**\n\nA gamma squezze, often underestimated compared to his brother the short squezze. But I think this was the main reason for the surge in January and the surge last week. Especially last week was probably a well set up and executed option chain by big whales.\n\n*So how can 🦍🦍🦍 profit from a gamma squezze?* Just take a look at the current option chains. u/indonesian_activist did a great [excel sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxkeg0/repost_gme_squeeze_calculator/), where you can see how many shares MMs have to buy if GME reaches a certain price. Just type in the current price and the projected price.\n\n^(Note: I did update his excel sheet with the new data, which you can find) [^(here)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZYGIff3Iq7UNyo88SVevj32rcYs0oqlS/view?usp=sharing)^(. Also I added, an option on the cover, so that you can decide which Option expiring dates you want to include.)\n\n*But how many shares are enough to cause a gamma squeeze?* This is really hard to say, but according to u/CoastalHotDog835 [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lycj6f/gme_dd_part_2_taking_a_look_at_the_0603_calls/). Last weeks surge had the following option volumes:\n\n>*1.86M shares at $55 = $102.3Million*  \n>  \n>*2.90M shares at $120 = $348Million*\n\nSo these are probably numbers we need to see again.\n\n^(Note: These are just two Strike prices. I can not say how much other options with other strike prices e. g. 100$ played a role nor do I know how high their volume was. Unluckily most sites dont have data for the past.)\n\n*So whats the current situation with GME options?*\n\nFor the options expiring the coming week, we need to have at least a doubling of the price to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls.\n\n^(Note: It is not fully sufficient compare these two numbers. On the one hand in the excel there are shares already hedged deducted, which decreases the numbers of shares. On the other hand there are not only options included with the projected strike price but all options. I hope, in the absense of better numbers for the option volumes of last week as already stated above, that these two effects could equalize each other.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 300$ for options expiring 03\\/12](https://preview.redd.it/jm8qjkjveml61.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=541ebeaac563fad9fa536ba770d98f0566acc967)\n\nBut for the week after that it looks a lot better. Only a price of 190$ would be needed to see the same amount of shares having to be bought by MMs compared with last weeks 55$ calls. This is only a value increase of roughly 40%, which is very well possible. Especially if we really have some big whales on our side like, what is seeming to be the case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shares need to be bought by MMs if GME hits 190$ for options expiring 03\\/19](https://preview.redd.it/0rtacqi7fml61.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=da36500a6dc4406d36a091a687b722d22b40cccb)\n\nI may be adding some more analysis thoughts later. But I will wait with that until I know people are actually reading this.\n\nAnd of course no financial advice!\n\nEDIT: Someone in the comments has pointed out that I actually misspelled Squeeze. Sorry for that. So you see Im also just an 🦍, who cant write.\n\n**TLDR: If GME 190$ until 03/19-->🦍🦍🦍 on 🌕 🚀🚀🚀** **^((possibly))**", "id": "lzsnlk", "created_utc": 1615130420.0, "score": 2947, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 447, "comments": [{"body": "WSB repackages DD like its a CDO and we’re bear sterns", "score": 1702, "replies": [{"body": "“Mortgage bonds are dog shit.

{"title": "Why you should miss the peak and what to do with your tendies", "selftext": " Ok listen up fuckbags, I spent some time in the weekend sniffing the green crayons I found and chewed the black ones. But I also did some research on what to do when you get a huge influx of money like you retarded ape are about to get when you sell each share for 500k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would like to state that fuck you Kenny G, and that the SEC can suck my trail mix. But I am not a financial advisor and you should not listen to me. We are not a group, and there is no we. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, I would like to address why you should miss the peak and sell on the way down. If you ape sell a share before the peak, you limit your upside of selling that share at a higher price AND you limit how high the peak can go, by adding liquidity to the market you help shorts leave their positions for a bargain and at the same time you screw other apes by limiting how high the peak can go. If you wait out and sell AFTER the peak, you allow the price to go its full way and you alongside other apes can sell their shares for a higher price even if you don’t sell at the peak I believe it is better to hold, miss the 1M per share peak and start selling at 700k instead of selling at 100k missing a possible 600k profit PER SHARE. But that is just me, do whatever the fuck you want. I don’t give a fuck. Again I remind you this shouldn´t be considered a coordinated sell because well, it is illegal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, once you stupid uneducated ape gets a hand on millions and for some even billions of dollars, you are going to have to start growing wrinkles in that brain of yours because if you don´t the money will leave your hands just as fast as it came and the world will not become a better place turning the greatest transfer of wealth in human history to a massive lotto winner curse that just bankrupts us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should spend some time at least watching YouTube videos and figure out what to do with those humongous amounts of money. I will leave you some tips I found in my research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Do not tell anyone\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep it to yourself, process it, don’t go around telling people you are rich, you will only put yourself at risk or just compromise yourself to fake friends or people asking you for money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Get financial advice (real one)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is worth going to a credible institution and get help from them, you should get a lawyer, accountant, and a team to help you and assist you with all the problems and difficulties that moving, investing, and spending all that money come with. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Pay your taxes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSave some money for taxes, advisors help with this but make sure your money is clean and free of any legal or federal compromise so you can use it freely without having to hide or risk going to jail for any funny business. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Pay off your debt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLiquidate your credit card, your mortgage if it has a high-interest rate, and any other debt you are in, learn how to use debt to your advantage in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Hold the money for at least 6 months in your bank account\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will have all kinds of crazy ideas of what you will be able to do with the money, let those ideas settle and mature, by not touching the money for some time you will filter out the crazy stupid ideas and keep the valuable ones, be smart and make a plan on how and what to spend the money on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Don’t quit your job (yet)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are humans and we need productivity, I don’t mean to keep your 9-5 job forever, but a huge amount of change in a small period of time will make you lose your ground. Start making a plan from today and make the changes bit by bit, let some time pass, make sure you are going in the right direction and you are doing what you want, and what is best for you. I will probably dedicate myself to start a foundation and maybe some businesses but make a plan, start slow and make the changes over time after a good amount of thought. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Invest in yourself, get healthy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLearn, grow, become wealthy in your head, change your mindset, learn how money works and how to use it, this will allow you to grow your money further, and most importantly, stay wealthy. Learn all of this so you don’t get scammed or stolen from excessive fees in the financial business. Also, work out and stay healthy, I want you to enjoy your money for a long long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8. Do not invest in friends businesses or start a business alone right away\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is a tempting idea but doesn’t go around giving money or investing in any idea your friends have, stay smart, and go little by little, learn about how business works, and don’t spend a huge amount of money investing or starting a business by yourself, read the book “Lean Startup”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. Prepare for change\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean, everything, from friends to lifestyle, to wellbeing, to opportunities but also prepare to be the target of greedy or evil people who will want to take money off you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10. 5% rule\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRead about it, but basically, you live off what your money produces, you don’t live off your tendies directly instead you live off what your tendies produce.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n11. Play it safe\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are already rich, don’t risk it buying weekly tesla calls. Don’t be stupid, stay rich and use your money to grow your wealth, to improve your own life, your family´s life, and the life of those around you. Start a foundation or become a Patreon of one but don’t donate huge amounts of money all at once, diversify, become a monthly contributor that way you can learn about the real needs of each nonprofit and you can help more of them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuggest additional things you think are important in the comments and I will update the post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGodspeed retards, see you all on Alpha Centauri. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: Fuck you, the floor is 100k, ceiling  Infinity and will average sell at 500k because fuck you Kenny G 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nEdit: Many have asked “How do I know the peak has passed, there will be huge swings in price and how do I know it wont go up again” I believe there will be better DD about this in the next few days but one thing I can say is that there will be momentum, when the momentum is upwards, there will definitely be dips but this dips and highs will be higher each time, the low and high of the day will have an uptrend, the opposite happens when the momentum is downward, we will see spikes and dips but they will be lower and lower, hope this helps your polished brains out!", "id": "lzw75u", "created_utc": 1615140850.0, "score": 2758, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 465, "comments": [{"body": "I hope we all have these money problems one day", "score": 906, "replies": [{"body": "We will", "score": 385, "replies": [{"body": "I like your optimism", "score": 179, "replies": [{"body": "Ken Griffin can pay me out 500k/share.\n\nDunno about the rest of you retards.", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "Mine are for sale for 10k, but when it approaches that, I'll adjust it.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "SCAB...\n\nI MEAN RETARD.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Put them for sale so they can't be loaned or borrowed against....heh.", "score": 17, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "This is the way", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Excellent advice!

Would 1k really compensate for all this sh!t???\n\nYou know what? F&ck 1k per share! They can wipe the wet sh!t Off my wife’s boyfriend with 1k per share. Anyone who sells below 100k per share has literally no understanding of finance or economics. \n\nWhat is the price for a glass of water when you’re in the desert and are literally dying because you didn’t have one drop of water the past 3 days?

{"title": "UNFI DD - Why a food supplier will supply you with tendis.", "selftext": "**This is not meant to work as a diversification to make people not invest in $GME or jump ship. If you wan't to buy gamestop or hold gamestop you should.**\n\nFeel free to chime in and correct me or give feedback. Since this is going to be a long read and the collection of data took forever i will copy paste some things.\n\n**Obligatory:** *I am not a professional investor and this is not investing advice. Every trade you make, you make at your own risk. This is just me, a regular dude telling you about a stock I found and why I believe in it.*\n\n**So, what is $UNFI and what do they do?**\n\nUNFI is North America's largest publicly traded wholesale distributor. UNFI engages in the distribution of natural, organic, and specialty foods and non-food products. The firm operates through the following segments: Wholesale and Retail. The Wholesale segment is engaged in the national distribution of natural, organic, specialty, produce, and conventional grocery and non-food products, and providing retail services in the United States and Canada. The Retail segment derives revenues from the sale of groceries and other products at retail locations operated by companies. It offers food and non food, frozen, perishables, bulk, body care products and supplements. The company is the leading distributor and retailer services with 55 food distribution centers all located within 85% of the US/Canadian population. UNFI's close proximity to its customers drives significant cost advantages, as product transportation expenses (the costliest aspect of the food delivery business) are minimized, helping streamline operations and drive bottom line revenue growth. This provides UNFI with a competitive pricing advantage, as the company is able to deliver wholesale food items more quickly and at a better price than competitors.\n\nWith annual revenues exceeding $27 billion, UNFI is one of the [largest North American and Canadian food wholesalers](https://s22.q4cdn.com/589001886/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/UNITED-NATURAL-FOODS-INC._10K_2020_webready_V1.pdf) distributing more than 275,000 products to over 30,000 customer locations distributed across two continents. It displays distinct business advantages, including tremendous scale, operational efficiency, and substantial revenue diversification. UNFI's revenues are highly resistant to erosion or disruption. The company derives revenues from a vast array of customers across both wholesale and retail operating segments, helping to mitigate negative effects associated with losing any single customer. UNFI has been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Markets for more than 20 years and has developed entrenched competition-resistant relationships with quite a number of widely recognized food retailers ranging from Whole Foods ([AMZN](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN)), Kroger ([KR](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KR)), Sprouts ([SFM](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFM)), Wegmans, Harris Teeter, Cash and Carry Stores, The Fresh Market, Coborn’s, Natural Grocers, and Jerry’s Foods, among others. UNFI only has one main competitor, SpartanNash Other preeminent food distribution companies Sysco ([SYY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SYY?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) and US Foods ([USFD](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USFD?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) service a different demographic targeting restaurants, schools, businesses, hospitals, etc., whereas UNFI focuses on supermarkets and food retailers in both the wholesale and retail operating segments.\n\n**Wait?**\n\nSo am I really pushing a grocery stock when there are sexier investment opportunities like PLTR? That’s right, I am. And it sure is an unsexy boomer stock, but it’s also a huuuuuge value investment right now and with the market being as saturated as it is when a lot of companies seem to have world domination priced in it sure feels nice parking my money in a stock that’s both undervalued and defensive against a market crash or inflation. We all gotta eat right?\n\n**COVID-19 AND UNFI**\n\nAmidst lockdowns and a national pandemic, UNFI demonstrated strong performance in 2020. It reported sales growth across all channels; chains sales increased 21% to $10.7 billion, independent retailers' sales increased 21% to $6.7 billion, supernatural sales increased 7.4% to $4.7 billion, and retail sales increased 41.0% to $1.7 million. The company has witnessed consistent revenue expansion for more than 20 years, experiencing high mid-single digit growth for many years. Its underlying food business is highly recession-resistant with stable revenue prospects over the long term. Money traditionally spent in restaurants, at schools, near workplaces, at bars, etc. is being redirected toward grocery spending. [Some estimates](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/consumer-trends/restaurants-down-200-billion-already-prepare-election-fallout) indicate that the restaurant industry has lost upwards of $200 billion as a result of the pandemic. Although devastating to restaurant businesses, the money lost will be redirected toward the retail grocery segment.\n\n**Some boring financial oversight**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ag5m6zzatl61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=d903680d629c55b7d157df6c0785155648da8fbe\n\nAccording to its [latest quarterly earnings release](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/18115573-united-natural-foods-inc-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2021-results?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link), UNFI expects to reduce net debt to $2.44 billion by the end of FY 07/2021, excluding any proceeds from potential divestitures. During the last earnings call, management said they expect to achieve net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage of approximately 3.5 times by July 2021. In comparison, the leverage ratio was 5.5x at the end of October 2019. An examination of UNFI's financials reveals very strong performance on the company's income statement, steady revenue expansion, net sales up nearly 20% from last year alone, and that revenues have increased for 20 years. What could happen after the company has managed to achieve a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 2.0 to 2.5? Firstly, the board could distribute dividends or launch a share buyback program.\n\nGoing forward, UNFI as a pure-play distributor should be able to throw off free cash of $300 million on a yearly basis. Taking into account management's self-declared ongoing focus on reducing costs, expanding margins and increasing free cash flows, as well as lower interest payments resulting from debt reductions, the number of $300 million could eventually evolve into $350 million over the long term if everything goes well.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $895 million, future free cash flows of $330 million a year as estimated by analysts, management's expectation of net debt falling to $2.4 billion by the end of FY 07/2021 and a short interest of 23 percent, the S&P SmallCap 600 member may be an excellent value play.\n\n* **Highlights (comparisons to first quarter fiscal 2020):**\n\n• Net Sales increased 6.0% to $6.67 billion\n\n• Net loss of $1 million, including $43 million in pre-tax charges and costs\n\n• Adjusted EBITDA increased 30.6% to $159 million\n\n• Loss per diluted share of $0.02, reflective of charges and costs\n\n• Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased by $0.47 to $0.51\n\n• Prior guidance affirmed for net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS\n\n**Recent deals:**\n\nAs of March 04 UNFI have extended it’s deal on being Whole Foods supplier until 2027. Amazon's online grocery sales are increasing at a rapid rate with a CAGR of 9%, with 2021 grocery sales expected to reach $23 billion. UNFI will benefit from enduring tailwinds originating from the Amazon and Whole Foods operating segments long into the future. This deal serves as a huge catalyst and has long been a big “beware sign” for investors, now when the deal is inked we will probably see more investors coming in when the big will they won't they question have been answered. The stock saw a rise of 6% on thursday when the deal was announced and a volume of about 3.3, about 2x average which seems… low considering how large of a deal it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ku5tfsj2btl61.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=3797c01d10f4f26467d90d68f51967a85a8e5fbb\n\n**The OMG is Whole foods leaving UNFI scare 2018:**\n\nStrategically it wouldn't make financial sense for Amazon to invest tens of billions of dollars to set up another 40+ distribution facilities especially for food items and acquire fleets of delivery vehicles, all in order to generate a low-single digit return on investment. But it was a big concern for investors. While many shareholders have been criticizing management for paying $2.9 billion to take control of competitor Supervalu back in 2018. Strategically, the acquisition was a very smart move. The deal was simply necessary to lessen UNFI's reliance on customer Whole Foods Market. Before the acquisition, Whole Foods Market [accounted for 37 percent](https://s22.q4cdn.com/589001886/files/doc_financials/quaterly_reports/2018/UNFI-Supervalu-Acquisition-Update-Final-09.20.18-Updated-09.27.18.pdf) of UNFI's revenues. Now the customer's share of sales is [down to 18 percent](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4376752-united-natural-foods-inc-2020-q4-results-earnings-call-presentation?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link). In fact, during the [last quarterly earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393912-united-natural-foods-inc-unfi-ceo-steven-spinner-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) we learned that UNFI exceeded its four-year target of $185 million in synergies in just two years. On top of that, free cash flow reached [a record of $284 million](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/18022422-united-natural-foods-inc-reports-record-fourth-quarter-and-strong-full-year-fiscal-2020?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) in FY 07/2020. It just seems that management has more possibilities to optimize the economics and fundamentals of the business, thanks to the acquisition of Supervalu.\n\n**Key Food:**\n\nUNFI recently signed a deal with Key Food and now serves as the primary grocery wholesaler to Key Food with expected sales to UNFI of approximately $10 billion over 10 years. Key Food, whose members operate more than 315 stores, is a rapidly growing organization with a large market share in the New York market\n\n**Some strong financials to take notice of:**\n\n* The stock carries a very low forward P/FCF ratio of just 2.7, providing ample upside potential.\n* According to SharePad there are currently 1192 publicly traded companies on a US stock exchange that generates revenues of $1.5B and have a market capitalization of at least $100m. Banks, insurers, and real estate companies are excluded from this custom screen. FCF estimates are not available for 145 on that list. ***Interestingly, out of the 1,047 stocks, only 23 carry a forward P/FCF multiple of between 0 and 3. United Natural Foods is one of them.***\n* unless UNFI needs a huge capital increase or goes bankrupt, it's hard to imagine the stock will continue to hover at unusually low valuation levels.\n* Return vs Industry: UNFI exceeded the US Consumer Retailing industry which returned 9.1% over the past year.\n* Return vs Market: UNFI exceeded the US Market which returned 36.3% over the past year.\n* PB vs Industry: UNFI is good value based on its PB Ratio (1.3x) compared to the US Consumer Retailing industry average (2.8x).\n* Under the hood there's retail that should sell for \\~$700m and another \\~$2B of real estate,\n* United Natural Foods continues to benefit from the pandemic, providing excess cash flows in the near term which allows for a modest reduction in debt.\n* current PE ratio of about 13 and expected to go even lower as they keep reporting pandemic earnings.\n* Using those earnings to pay off debt way ahead of schedule and strengthening their financial position further.\n* Benefits from a low intrest rate from the federal reserve in regards to their debt\n* Benefits from COVID-19\n\n**First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Highlights (comparisons to first quarter fiscal 2020):**\n\n**•** Net Sales increased 6.0% to $6.67 billion\n\n**•** Net loss of $1 million, including $43 million in pre-tax charges and costs\n\n**•** Adjusted EBITDA increased 30.6% to $159 million\n\n**•** Loss per diluted share of $0.02, reflective of charges and costs\n\n**•** Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased by $0.47 to $0.51\n\n**•** Prior guidance affirmed for net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ivnswj6btl61.jpg?width=592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=193a4e68c9409767166eb9f16ae9ff129e9db27a\n\n**DEBT**\n\nThere is always some inherent risk involved in every trade and I feel like only presenting the bull case is very misleading. The biggest bear argument for UNFI is their debt for sure, so let’s go through it.\n\nUNFI does exhibit some vulnerabilities in its balance sheet - the company has a debt load of $2.6 billion and a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 2:1, and debt is covered by operating cash flow at roughly 20% coverage; however, UNFI does lack substantial liquidity reserves, displaying just $49 million in available liquidity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/96esw3l9btl61.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=000357584583fbedc3dd2f5e886a299e271be7a6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p31jp0lfbtl61.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=33d5fdf222322b13c75ac70db6ae51a39ac130e0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7su6c9uebtl61.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fb78717bd48aa2ac4749fcf9c157cebcfa4a552\n\nAlthough: (***NOTE: This segment is from a calculation made in jaunary and it's only purpose is to give you an impression of the legroom UNFI has, I'm a lazy fuck so i won't update this to reflect todays values***) From a valuation standpoint, UNFI is undervalued by any means of analysis: P/E, PEG, PB, or discounted cash flow; the stock is trading at a P/E ratio of 6.7x earnings and is drastically undervalued. Based on a [discounted cash flow analysis](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-ms/morgan-stanley#dividend), the current share price of $15.58 is way below the future cash flow value of $86.01, implying that the stock is undervalued by 82%.\n\nUnited Natural Foods continues to benefit from the pandemic, providing excess cash flows in the near term which allows for a modest reduction in debt At the end of 2019, UNFI's long-term debt stood at $3.05 billion while net income was negative by a very slim margin relative to their massive revenue. By the end of 2020, the long-term debt had been reduced to $2.6 billion- a reduction of 17.3% across only 4 quarters. Quickly paying down this debt has been drastically reducing interest payments on it, and combined with macro-level tailwinds, this has seen Y/Y net income more than triple, from $101 million in 2019 to $306 million in 2020. In early 2021, UNFI announced that the interest on their senior debt moving forward had been reduced from 4.25% to 3.5%. This debt has also allowed UNFI to increase total revenue from $8.47 billion in 2016 to $26 billion in 2020, while at the same time improving both gross and net margin. Looking at UNFI's balance sheet, you could understand how this company could be undervalued, but by digging a little deeper, you can see that this debt is not dead weight, but has been put to work effectively. Debt has been a problem for UNFI ever since the Supervalu acquisition. However, UNFI is beginning to turn a corner as the company is generating healthier profits and margins amid the pandemic, which allows them to accelerate debt payments. UNFI also has a substantial amount of real estate (between $1B to $2B) that it could sell within the next few years and pay off even more debt. Recently UNFI repriced senior secured term loan facility, which reduced its interest rate by 50 to 75 basis points on $1.8B due in 2026. Which saves the company 9-13 mil and shows the debt profile is improving with lenders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utv5k30ibtl61.jpg?width=841&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=214d65692d08e01f6a4ae485ee333b8e4be8988b\n\nA bear case for UNFI’s debt situation is that when this pandemic is over people are going to visit restaurants a lot which will decrease their revenue. UNFI is not a player in supplies to restaurants.\n\n**Hires:**\n\nCurrently hiring staff through this pandemic while other businesses lay people off and chasing talent to the board with recent hires such as:\n\nGloria Boyland to its Board of Directors\n\nMs. Boyland currently serves as a strategic advisor of Aurora Technologies, LLC, a position she has held since June 2020.

He most recently served as Vice President Perishables for Walmart Mexico where he was responsible for sourcing, buying, and product development of the fresh departments for 2,400 stores in the region as well as Walmart’s owned meat processing plants.

His unique experiences - from integrating emerging technologies to effectively utilizing data analytics - will enhance UNFI's long-term operating model and help accelerate our innovation. Jim is an engaging leader and we're excited to welcome him to UNFI.\"\n\nJack Clare Chief Information Officer\n\nClare brings to UNFI more than 20 years of experience in IT and strategic leadership roles for prominent consumer packaged goods and restaurant retailers. He most recently served as Chief Information and Strategy Officer at Dunkin' Brands, where he was responsible for directing all information technology resources with an intense focus on supporting franchisees and driving restaurant profitability through technology. Prior to joining Dunkin' Brands, Clare served as Vice President, IT and Chief Information Officer for Yum! Restaurants International, and spent seven years with Constellation Brands, most recently as its Vice President, Technical Services.\n\n**Short Interest:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jnzqg5gkbtl61.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca51b42e586c5c7906a3e3f2accac9b59eaf5032\n\nNow this is probably where a lot of you guys lose interest and a lot of you guys gain interest. UNFI has a significant of it’s shares shorted about 12,4 mil out of it’s outstanding 56,14 mil. It’s by no means even close to $GME’s amount of shorted shares, but it’s a lot still. Even more so when you consider that the public float is around 5-6mil and daily volume about 1,6m. Now there is no shortage of shares to borrow according to iborrowdesk and the fee is low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09qda8smbtl61.png?width=522&format=png&auto=webp&s=170e5a3c6f93bba21a3eb00fced5ba5b7669363a\n\nIf shorts were to be trapped however it would take them about 7 days to close their position based on daily volume. There probably won’t be a short squeeze, but there is a chance. What makes a high short interest attractive is that when they are wrong it creates a lot of upwards momentum and boy are they wrong about this one lol. Short sellers are at significant risk of blowing-up with \\~22% of the float short and with the total dollars short up an extraordinary 444% since February of 2020. To put this into perspective, the total dollars short (a figure that Ihors Dusaniwsky of S3 typically cites as the most important in determining the risk to short sellers) was $332M compared to $61M in February of 2020. Basically they are bleeding. They can easily short the stock more to suppress the price but the writing have been on the wall for some time and while it might just be a slow rush they are only delaying the inevitable.\n\nThe biggest risk to UNFI was previously a failure to extend the Whole Foods contract. But since it isn’t anymore and earnings will be boom-diggitey shorts are probably weighing their options now.\n\n**Who is shorting this stock?**\n\nSeems like a stupid stock to short at this day and age. The shorts are due to a dispute between UNFI and Goldman Sachs and seems petty to me, UNFI lost on a technicality. Here’s an old headline.\n\n“United Natural Foods, Inc. Files Lawsuit Against Goldman Sachs and Related Parties. Lawsuit Details How Goldman Sachs Systematically Deceived, Exploited and Threatened UNFI While Advising the Company on its Acquisition of SUPERVALU”\n\n**Catalysts**\n\nBecause every dynamite needs a fuse:\n\n* New CEO Replacement – last year confirmed that current CEO will be retiring in July 2021 and a new CEO will be announced early 2021\n* March 10 earnings\n* Share buyback (highly unlikely in the near term)\n* the sale of the retail grocery business (Cubs and Shoppers) as well as the sale of other assets that were acquired through the Supervalu acquisition.\n* Hook another big customer/Being bought up by Amazon or acquire the business of amazon fresh (this is highly speculative and basically an x factor)\n* New contract with Whole Foods. (Which just happend, Heres a quote from domo capital: “DOMO Capital believes that shares of UNFI will be valued at over $100 per share within the next 3 years. We believe that the bulk of these gains will be realized upon the finalization of the Whole Foods contract extension and the sale of the retail operations and other assets”\n\n**Short term bull signs**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vgrri0yobtl61.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=57623ecc0a292a68a84c709decfcb4c62e281321\n\nCurious rise in options activity on wednesday march 3.

If the lower trend floor at $29.91 is broken, it will firstly indicate a slower rate of rising, but may also be an early warning for a trend shift. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 73.11% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $51.77 and $66.92 at the end of this 3-month period.\n\nThat’s pretty much it.

I don’t mean to crap in your analysis or anyone else’s.  I hope you’re right. There’s some solid thinking here but I have concerns.\n\n1. Good is the enemy of great at UNFI. They can’t execute well. They take on too much and then are frustrated when they aren’t successful. Most recently it was closing, opening and remodeling locations on the west coast.  It was disastrous.\n\n2. They have a turnover/retention issue. Constantly shorthanded and this pandemic hasn’t helped. Employees work very long hours in all roles. They are leaving because of it. As a result, they don’t have nearly the tenured veterans they used to have. There has been a lot of leadership turnover in the last few years and it’s hard to execute with green crews.  Don’t think all that hiring is good. What’s causing the turnover? Long hours, lean execution. I’d rather pay straight time than all the OT they are paying.\n\nIt’s also hard hiring in the pandemic. People don’t want to work that hard when they can could get similar pay through unemployment. when the extra $600 a week was being paid, it was very tough finding people. \n\n3. The stock always goes up before earnings and then dips afterwards.  I’m still in, but have been holding my shares for years.\n\nThe company is a good company but they can’t get out of their own way.

{"title": "$CLF (Cleveland Cliffs) - Rocket Fuel Can't Melt These Steel Beams!", "selftext": "$CLF is an American steel company currently trading at $14.12 but had reached a high of $111.32 in July of 2008 as part of that commodity supercycle. I'm going to show why logic indicates history is going to repeat itself. Additionally, I'm making this post as while this ticker has been mentioned in other supercycle posts, the information within them often miss what makes this company stand out from other steel companies. **NOTE: None of this is financial advice and I just really like this stock.**\n\n# A Setup For Record Revenue and Earnings\n\n**Part 1: Record Steel Prices**\n\n[ Current Steel Futures As Of This Post ](https://preview.redd.it/v8qv27jzaol61.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=b266aa379e89967723bd77092752c01db7554c60)\n\nThe price of steel has been increasing at a rapid rate for the past few months with $1,000 steel pricing now all the way out to October of 2021. The current month continually reaches new highs as companies become desperate to buy the product this company makes. But one needs a reference for what that means, right? Let's look at Steel Futures from prior to the pandemic on April 6, 2019 to compare with:\n\n[ April 6th steel futures ](https://preview.redd.it/7apycuf1bol61.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=23dd1b4ad5884fac319439f958c898e0e2bab29b)\n\nThe difference should be obvious - the cost of steel in the USA has almost doubled as we head into full reopening! This has been a relatively recent event as we can look at the historical weekly pricing to see how this has ramped up as it continues to reach ever new highs:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Weekly historic data from October 2020 to January 2021 ](https://preview.redd.it/suzp5wi3bol61.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=eefbe198e0e5e8d3c497090b1ce5d653feabedc3)\n\nThis should show the first major point: the price customers are paying for $CLF's end product has basically doubled. While there was some small impact in Q4 2020 earning, these prices will first start to show up in Q1 2021 earnings as prices spiked up and their customer contracts start to reflect the new price reality.\n\n**Part 2: Vertical Integration and Acquisition**\n\nDid you know Iron Ore that is used to make steel is reaching record prices? Here is the one year chart showing the uptick in the cost of this material:\n\n[ 1 year Iron Ore pricing as of today ](https://preview.redd.it/r2vmk377bol61.png?width=819&format=png&auto=webp&s=3edb571f259940a07e30f3a60e4d332206d3a4d8)\n\nFor many steel companies, this increase to their input materials will eat into the profits they can realize from the record steel prices. It is a good thing that $CLF had historically been primarily an iron ore mining company and therefore *mines all the ore they need.* The increase to the price of this material that is contributing to the rise of steel prices doesn't affect this company! They are the largest supplier of iron ore pellets in North America and thus this increase only helps their bottom line.\n\nYou may have noticed that I said \"historically\" on their company focus as $CLF was busy in the last few years acquiring other companies. In December of 2019, $CLF announced the [acquisition of AK Steel](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/04/why-the-cleveland-cliffs-ak-steel-merger-makes-ton.aspx) and in September of 2020, $CLF announced the purchase of all of [$MT's USA operations](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Cleveland-Cliffs+%28CLF%29+to+Acquire+ArcelorMittal+USA+%28MT%29+for+%241.4B/17401400.html). These just started to come online recently and have made $CLF the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America.\n\n**Part 3: Conclusion**\n\nTo recap to this point: you have a company that expanded greatly with its new acquisitions just coming online just as we have record prices of their product occurring! For a reference of this, the revenue of the company of December of 2018 was $695 Million. In December of 2019, it was $534 Million. In December of 2020... we hit $2.256 BILLION which is a YoY increase of 322% with limited steel price improvements and with one of their major acquisitions only online for December of that quarter.\n\nAnalysts have started to pick up on this new reality for the company that it isn't what it was just last year. One [analyst has an updated price target of $25 with a 2021 EPS estimate of $3.18](https://pub.webull.com/us/news-html/417f31ecdb104c28951687562221fd19.html). Another [analyst increased its price target to $22.09](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/iron-ore-miner-cleveland-cliffs-jumps-on-upgrade-to-buy). Revenue for the year looks to reach around $18 Billion with an EBITA of around $2.5 Billion.\n\nAnd all of the above doesn't include the next catalyst of...\n\n# Biden's Infrastructure Effort For The USA\n\n**Part 1: Timing**\n\nThe focus of the USA news cycle has been on the COVID stimulus and this has been an intentional plan. Back on [February 11th, it was stated that Biden would delay his State of the Union address](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-prepares-move-next-phase-his-agenda-infrastructure-push-n1257567) until the COVID relief had passed. Once that bill was signed, he would then be formally invited by the House to give that address to the nation. The focus of that address? Expected to be his infrastructure push.\n\nWhat is set to be signed on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week? The COVID stimulus. What is reported to happen right after? The switch to focusing on infrastructure spending. What is used in many infrastructure projects? Steel.\n\nWe are a very short time away from a news focus on infrastructure. Should the bill eventually pass, that will only increase demand further which could only increase steel prices further.\n\n**Part 2: Why Would CLF in particular benefit from this?**\n\n* Bills in the USA are often sold as creating jobs and thus often have a \"buy local if possible\" provision within it. This gives domestic steel producers an advantage until it is known that provision won't exist. $CLF is the largest producer of US steel but it would indeed benefit other USA producers like $X.\n* $CLF has a focus on [\"green steel\"](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005322/en/Cleveland-Cliffs-Announces-Commitment-to-Reduce-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-by-25-Percent-by-2030) and their environmental efforts might make them more appealing for contracts with the infrastructure focus reportedly having a carbon reduction aspect.\n* The [tariffs on steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_tariffs#Steel_and_aluminum) are still in effect that make importing to the USA costly even if the \"buy local\" provision doesn't exist. Biden's commerce chief has stated she feels the steel tariffs are \"[effective](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-04/u-s-to-hold-china-to-account-on-rights-abuses-raimondo-says)\". In a [recent suspension of tariffs between the US and EU a few days ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/business/economy/airbus-boeing-tariffs.html), the steel tariffs were left in place.\n\n# Insider Buying\n\nOn the last Friday, March 5th, the CEO (Director) of $CLF decided to spend his own money to purchase [100,000 shares of the company](http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/summary/?id=9009081). The CFO (EVP) of $CLF spent his own money to pick up [15,000 shares of the company](http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/summary/?id=9009108). It is a clear sign that those at the top view their stock as a bargain based on what they see coming up with them buying additional shares in the open market rather than selling shares they currently own.\n\n# Perfect Storm Brings Stock Down From Recent Highs\n\nThis is why I consider this stock the best bargain compared to other American based stocks. No one likes to \"buy high\" and this stock is an opportunity to \"buy low\". On February 22nd, the stock traded at $17.39 but has dropped down to the $14.12 of present. Why did this happen?\n\n**Part 1: Changing of the Index**\n\nOn February 23rd, it was [announced that $CLF would be leaving the S&P SmallCap 600 to join the S$P MidCap 400](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cleveland-cliffs-set-to-join-sp-midcap-400-wsfs-financial-to-join-sp-smallcap-600-301234083.html). Unknown to most of us following the stock at the time, this is a temporary gut punch to a stock's price. Why? $CLF would be weighted much less in the MidCap ETF funds. This wasn't a small change... as comments on the [following post show](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/ltd1ka/dd_small_cap_etfs_own_945_million_shares_of_clf/), an estimated loss of around 50M ETF owned shares that had to be sold. I did [an analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/ltgud1/dd_historical_effect_of_moving_from_smallcap_to/) that all companies in the last year I could find doing this move had sudden drops in stock price from this change as well. This change has been completed... but the damage remains due to...\n\n**Part 2: A bearish stock market from treasury yield concerns**\n\nThe past couple of weeks have been a rough market which I don't need to link to sources for as everyone on this board has experienced it. Recovery is difficult when most stocks are taking a pounding and $CLF has been no exception. The bearish market has contributed to the decline in this stock's value and its inability to recover thus far.\n\n**Part 3: Q4 of 2020 Earnings announced February 25th**\n\n$CLF [announced](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cleveland-cliffs-stock-soars-after-upbeat-revenue-outlook-2021-01-25) earlier this year they expected revenue between $2.2 and $2.3 Billion. They hit this and, as shown above, that was an impressive amount considering it was on limited acquisition output at that time and on almost normal steel prices. Analysts had raised their targets to $2.31 Billion and had an EPS based on that despite it being above the guidance range and without the higher steel prices. This lead to a [slight earnings miss](https://www.earningswhispers.com/epsdetails/clf) compared to analyst expectations and, as we all know, even impressive earnings can cause a stock to fall in the current market. Combined with the other two events above, it created a perfect storm for a stock price drop despite the amazing outlook that 2021 has going for the company.\n\n# My Positions\n\nI don't see this as a stock one plays with short term options. Much like GME, this is a shares or leaps opportunity. The majority of my positions reflect this - but I do have a few shorter term calls either from not predicting the recent drop or picked up cheaply to play the recent drop. Note that I am slowly moving to Fidelity but do have the majority in Robinhood yet. (Money to be transferred out when I'm not playing a position on there... as screw Robinhood). I do also own positions in $MT for my international steel play and am considering picking up a few $X calls if it drops to the 16's before Biden's State of the Union address.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Fidelity IRA](https://preview.redd.it/6a62fykxbol61.png?width=1473&format=png&auto=webp&s=606b75eaefe6043b2af22961429f635a86075663)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Fidelity Individual](https://preview.redd.it/isjkbywybol61.png?width=1473&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c17ad916cf568c7635ded88e6cd50807dcce565)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Robin You Hood ](https://preview.redd.it/rok241y0col61.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=97adece9c9ee7c92b94b0c37ddb451f2aab5f546)\n\n# Did I Miss Anything?

The American Petroleum Institute is [on the brink of advocating for a carbon tax](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-trade-group-considers-endorsing-carbon-pricing-11614640681).

Increase of hot metal production can be achieved without addi-\ntional investment.\n• Coke production capacity is limited and capital expenditure on coke ovens is not viable.\nTherefore, the plant needs to reduce specific coke consumption.\n• Purchased coke is used, but the price is sufficiently high to enable a reduced coke consump-\ntion to offset higher cost when adding HBI to the BF burden.\n• Out of several BF’s, one BF must be relined, so increased hot metal production is required\nfrom the remaining BF’s to minimize downstream production losses.\n• There is an imbalance between the required tonnage of hot metal and BF capacity: the\nplant operates three BF’s when the hot metal output of somewhere between two and three\nBF’s would be sufficient. Therefore, it can be economical to operate two BF’s at slightly\nhigher hot metal cost in order to optimize production of downstream facilities.\nUnder these circumstances, some increase in hot metal feedstock cost due to addition of HBI to \nthe BF burden can be justified on the basis of increased steel production, higher BF productivity, \nreduced coke consumption, etc. HBI specifications for BF use can be less stringent than for EAF \nsteelmaking since higher levels of silica, iron oxides and sulphur and lower metallization can be \ntolerated in the BF.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "The 10k specifically mentions 150million in possible savings just from running everything in house. \n\nTo add to your DD, $CLF does own coal mines as well as the facilities to produce coke.
