Morgan gave him a tour of the giant buildings, pointing out the Singer Building, the Woolworth Building across from City Hall, the famous three-sided Flatiron Building, and the recently completed Met Life Tower, rising 50 stories high, the tallest skyscraper in the world at the time.\nHis friend was duly impressed,.

{"title": "Roblox is insanely overpriced", "selftext": "I know that no one likes a bear and furthermore people feel connected to this stock since their kids play the game or because it's a video game and it's fun to invest in that stuff but facts over feelings when dealing with money because it has no feelings. So first we have to base our value, the company raised 528 million$ from private sources last year at a valuation of 28 billion dollars. It later went public via direct listing at a base valuation of 32 billion with 40$ stock price only to rise to 77$ and a market cap of 40.56 billion. The problem with this is Microsoft bought Mojang (so essentially the Minecraft IP) for 2.5 billion  in late 2014 when they had 38 million in revenue which is relatively nothing compared to RBLX now but when we go back in time to just 2017 it (Rblx) had relatively only 45 million in revenue vs Minecraft's 350 million. Now let's go to last year when Minecraft had a monthly active user base of 130 million players vs Rblx's 150 million. It also had 953 million dollars in revenue but with 253 million in net losses. Now compare that to Minecraft who had a revenue of 415 million which is up significantly from  the previous years 375 million and it becomes clear that Roblox is very overvalued. Furthermore to show the point we have another Microsoft purchase, this time of Zenimax  Media inc for 7.5 billion $ for properties like TES, DOOM, Fallout, Dishonored, Starfield and many more with a wide variety of studios included like Bethesda, Zenimax, Tango, Arkane (Deathloop), Id and Machine Games . Just in that bundle Doom Eternal (1 game) had revenue of 350 million dollars and Skyrim with lifetime revue of over 620 million. The last showing of this is Sony's purchase of Insomniac in 2018 for 229 million dollars and since then have created 2 games that have raked in more than the initial investment with Spiderman 2018 and Spiderman MM having brought in approximately 250-270 million $ and with another game in the pipeline with Ratchet and Clank A rift in Time. Final note: EA's entire market cap which consists of Madden, Battlefield, Fifa ( yearly releases with micro transactions) and many other titles is at 30 billion, Take Two which owns GTA, Red Dead,  NBA 2K and many others and is valued at 20 billion, the thought that Roblox is worth almost more than both these titans combined is insane and nonsensical.\n\nEdit: **This is my opinion not advice.** To play devils advocate since a lot of people like the stock here you go: Roblox has doubled it's earnings every year since 2017 and had record revenue of almost 950 million this past year. It's player base is also massive and almost doubling every year just like it's revenue. It also has 830 million in the bank right now and can easily grow by going to Asia and or incorporating more adult themes.

It later Ipo'd at a base valuation of 32 billion with 40$ stock price only to rise to 77$ and a market cap of 40.56 billion. \n> \n> The problem with this is Microsoft bought Mojang (so essentially the Minecraft IP) for 2.5 billion in late 2014 when they had 38 million in revenue which is relatively nothing compared to RBLX now but when we go back in time to just 2017 it (Rblx) had relatively only 45 million in revenue vs Minecraft's 350 million. \n> \n> Now let's go to last year when Minecraft had a monthly active user base of 130 million players vs Rblx's 150 million. It also had 953 million dollars in profit but with 253 million in net losses. Now compare that to Minecraft who had a revenue of 415 million which is up significantly from the previous years 375 million and it becomes clear that Roblox is very overvalued. \n> \n> Furthermore to show the point we have another Microsoft purchase, this time of Zenimax Media inc for 7.5 billion $ for properties like TES, DOOM, Fallout, Dishonored, Starfield and many more with a wide variety of studios included like Bethesda, Zenimax, Tango, Arkane (Deathloop), Id and Machine Games . Just in that bundle Doom Eternal (1 game) had revenue of 350 million dollars and Skyrim with lifetime revue of over 620 million. \n> \n> The last showing of this is Sony's purchase of Insomniac in 2018 for 229 million dollars and since then have created 2 games that have raked in more than the initial investment with Spiderman 2018 and Spiderman MM having brought in approximately 250-270 million $ and with another game in the pipeline with Ratchet and Clank A rift in Time. \n> \n> Final note: EA's entire market cap which consists of Madden, Battlefield, Fifa ( yearly releases with micro transactions) and many other titles is at 30 billion, Take Two which owns GTA, Red Dead, NBA 2K and many others and is valued at 20 billion, the thought that Roblox is worth almost more than both these titans combined is insane and nonsensical.\n> \n> Edit: This is my opinion not advice.

Roblox has over 150 million monthly users. As the OP pointed out, Microsoft and these other companies absolutely skull-fuck RBLX on revenue and they are doing it with fewer users. Their games also don't require the massive server costs that'd be required to maintain 150 million monthly users meaning they would be far more profitable.\n\nTheir model also relies on user generated content which creates a lot of issues with the Chinese market. Beyond that, the Asian market is extremely different from the American market in terms of what works. I worked on titles back in the day that were grossing over 100 million a year in America that couldn't break a million in Japan/China. They are very different markets and typically people will gravitate toward locally produced games.\n\nFinally, let's assume that the number of users is correct...what's the age range on those users? My niece and nephew played Roblox and both of them aged out of it in less than a year. Roblox is a stepping stone to more interesting games since the games become boring almost immediately. The appeal of the game is that it's free and offers a wide variety of content which saves parents money. It's not Minecraft where you spend 50 dollars up front. You give it away and hope they convert. But, about 10% of people on free to play games ever convert and the vast majority of those conversions are the $5-10 range.\n\nIt's really not worth even a fraction of what they are claiming it is. First, it has grown as large as it can in this market and to maintain their size they'll need to spend absurd amounts of money on user acquisition to continually replace their users. The costs of user acquisition are also continually increasing so they will be perpetually spending more every year just to maintain their numbers.\n\nI would bet money that last year their cost to acquire a user was higher than the lifetime revenue of the user. They juiced their monthly user counts (which really don't mean dick compared to DAU mind you) by spending a fortune on UA. They use monthly users because then they don't need to explain that 90% of their users hopped on due to their advertisement and then uninstalled 30 minutes later. That is why DAU and retention metrics are used instead of things like monthly users. In fact, back when I was doing analytics on mobile games my CEO never once asked how many monthly users we had...it's not a real fucking metric that measures anything meaningful! Especially in a game that revolves around microtransactions.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I'd pay $20 for this stock and I actually invest in gaming stocks. It's so fucking stupid.

Open platform game development will most likely become a large part of the gaming future but I don‚Äôt see Roblox being the leader of it in the long term.  What‚Äôs to stop major tech and gaming companies with server infrastructure already in place from doing the same thing?  They already have a huge loyal customer base and have the research and development behind public sentiment.   \n\nThe Asian market thing makes me laugh.  I love it when I see people in the US think that what is popular here is going to be highly adopted in Asia.  Their cultures are so different, and incredibly difficult to break into, especially in the gaming world.  Besides they have massive networks of developers already feeding the needs of their gaming markets.  \n\nI could definitely be wrong and I‚Äôll bite my tongue if I am, but right now it‚Äôs a pump and dump for me.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It's so much worse than that. I'm seeing people say things like, \"They did something nobody else did!\" and \"They have 150 million people!\" and \"They had nearly a billion in revenue!\" \n\nThey're the only ones doing this because the model doesn't work and nobody is trying. They've been at this for fourteen years and have burnt investor money nonstop and are currently burning retail investor's money. \n\nI got my start in gaming and the model doesn't work. There's a reason they had a billion in revenue but still lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Most game developers never plan to IPO but instead intend to own their company OR sell it to another company outright. The reason for that in order to IPO you have to do what Roblox did and burn money for a decade hoping that you can continually raise money to make it to IPO. Or, you can build a good studio that operates on a few million a year and gain a base before selling out for 50-100 million. Most people choose that route. Few quick millions in their pocket versus a decade of risk in hopes of making a billion.\n\nPeople want to quote 150 million monthly active users on this shit but they aren't talking about their DAU, Retention, LTR, or any other meaningful metric. Their LTR and retention are absolute garbage if they aren't making a profit after 14 years.\n\nThey've also reached saturation and the fact you people still think there's room to grow is insane. Fortnite at its peak was around 350 million worldwide and appeals to a much larger age range. Roblox is going to have issues with China they rely on user generated content and China does not like that.\n\nRoblox is a free game which means that only about 10% of their audience will ever spend money. Because of this the average lifetime revenue of a free to play user is typically under $5 once you count non-spenders. Let's say they spend the entire $5 which is generous...we are now at 750 million dollars (5 dollar per user average LTR). That's 750 million PER 150 million people you burn through. You cycle new users in as old users leave for more revenue or attempt to increase the average LTR of users.\n\nDoes anybody have any idea what the cost of acquisition is on a free to play user is? Right now you can probably acquire users for about $2-5 but it's extremely volatile. Let's assume you can start by acquiring users for $1 each though. The costs increase exponentially the more users you need. If I need 10,000 people...I can get them with 10,000 in ad spend easily. If I need 20,000 people, I need to spend 30,000. If I need 40,000 people I need to spend 80,000. This is because once you acquire the 'easy converts' you have to spend more and more on 'hard selling' the remaining users.\n\nThat means on that 750 million dollars you're immediately losing 150 million in user acquisition costs on that batch of 150 million users. The next batch of 150 million users is going to cost you 300 million. The next batch of 150 million users is going to cost you 450 million. This is why most free to play games just stop advertising after 2-3 years and simply milk their established base for the rest of their shelf life.\n\nBut, let's ignore the fact that user acquisition prices are going to continue to climb on them. They have operational costs and the more users they have the higher those costs are going to be. Fortunately, the more users you have the cheaper it gets per user so that's nice. But, it also means if they start dropping users for any reason their costs start to increase. This is why a lot of MMOs shut down when they start losing users.\n\nThey also have 30% Apple/Google cut that gets taken off the top for any purchases on their services. Finally, after that, they have 70% going to the creatures.\n\nSo, on 150 million users that generate 750 million in LTR, assuming 2/3rds of their users are on phones/tablets, they are losing 150 million to Apple/Google fees. That leaves them with 600 million, 70% of which goes to creators leaving them with 180 million...a MINIMUM of 150 million of which goes to user acquisition leaving them with 30 million for server/operations. That is on the first rotation...on the second rotation where user acquisition is more expensive they are going to be upside down.\n\nBy the way, they're already at that point which is why on nearly a billion dollars they still ended up losing 250 million. Being around 14 years means they've already burnt through millions of users who'll never come back.\n\nRoblox is not some amazing company that managed to do something nobody else could like some of the people here believe. This concept was being shopped to massive companies back when Roblox started and none of them wanted it. There's a reason that EA, Activision, Tencent and every other company interested in generating a profit doesn't touch this shit with a ten foot pole...it doesn't earn out. EA isn't going to spend a decade burning hundreds of millions of dollars when they can simply push out another Battlefield game.\n\nAnd, if this were that profitable, EA could just license their various game engines to everybody to do shit. Which is basically what Roblox does. They are licensing a game engine and creating a storefront for games created with that engine and offering users money to create content for that store. EA could get that shit up and running in a year. In fact, DOTA was created using Blizzard's tech with Warcraft III and Blizzard 'learned their lesson' because now League of Legends/Dota2 have made billions from something birthed using their technology. That is why game companies like EA aren't interested in this shit.\n\nEA could license their engines to users and have dozens of games out next year...or they could keep it proprietary and make hundreds of millions in pure fucking profit every year making clones of their own games. Hmmm.....hmmmmmmmmm....hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\nA game that is losing money cannot be profitable because retention is much lower on a game than it is for something like Uber which is a service people will perpetually need. It needs to make fucking money.\n\nI can tell that none of the fucking investors here have ever worked in games at all. I can only assume this sub is filled with boomers that think this is some hip stock or that the concept of a game engine is novel...like they haven't heard of Unity...or that a game engine store front that only shows games made with the engine is some unique idea that cannot be duplicated in a fucking year by the creators of Fall Guys for better results.\n\nIt blows my fucking mind how people don't realize how the Uber/Amazon strategy doesn't work with games. Uber/Amazon acquiring customers works because they offer a service that you perpetually need and doesn't get old. The average LTR per user is so FUCKING MASSIVE that you can burn thousands to acquire them and still profit. With games the retention is always going to be an issue along with the ever-increasing user acquisition costs.\n\nJust fucking crazy.

According to current projections, this equates to 19x EV / 2021 Revenue (consensus projection 2021E: $2.1 bn).  This somewhat compares to subscription software peers \\[I am not discussing whether the current broader market valuations make sense or not\\].\n\nLooking at the projections, Roblox is projected to reach $3.5 bn revenue by 2023E (29% revenue CAGR).  Let's assume they continue growing at this rate, they would reach $5.8 bn revenue by 2025E \\[tall assumption\\].  Assuming that the \"equilibrium EBITDA margin\" for a subscription software company is c. 30% (taking Adobe as a benchmark), this would imply $1.7 bn EBITDA in 2025E \\[four years from now\\].  The current EV consequently implies a **four-year forward** valuation of 24x EV / EBITDA 2025E.\n\nIn order to see a $40 bn EV as reasonable, you need to therefore simply believe in these points:\n\n* Roblox will continue to grow at current rates and not slow down in 2-3 years;\n* Roblox will continue to scale to a top-of-the-range margin in the next few years while continuing to invest into growth and product development;\n* Market valuation multiples will indefinitely stay as high as they are currently or increase further;\n* There is no execution or other downside risk that justifies taking a discount on a four-year forward valuation.\n\nSo, if you are happy with these four points, Roblox is probably \"fairly\" valued at this moment. üôÉ\n\n*(not financial advice, just personal opinion)*", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's definitely good to have a bearish perspective - provides a bit of a reality check sometimes.\n\nI think it is definitely overvalued but I wouldn't compare Minecraft to it because it is fundamentally a different game (server monetization, free to play, sandbox-style).

Basically a game but also a platform to make your own games and run your own servers. Meaning there's more incentive for non-gamers to make servers for cash. This also massively exponentiates potential for micro-transactions. As opposed to buying one skin that works in any PUBG match players would be paying for server packages to gain advantage on their favorite server. As time goes on and server popularity shifts those players will generally buy a new package on the new server and try to get back to top tier status. Roblox however is the first game to throw a net over this type of server transaction. Imagine Minecrafts revenue if they had adopted this technique.  \n\n\nAnother thing about Roblox is they aren't hated by their user base (yet). The user base is also mainly kids.

As long as they are able to make content that is attractive to this demo, they will continue to attract people who develop these kids game on their platform and make their living. Kids have a huge market in social media (as evidenced by all the junk kids videos on youtube) as well as in video games. It's like their two biggest hobbies... the money is there.\n\nComparing it to EA and take-two is not a fair comparison. Are the games as good as Take-Two (rockstar)? Hell no they aren't, but you don't need to make an amazing game to make money as evidenced by mobile games or the fact EA shits out the same sports games every year. You just have to have an addictive business model that works and a reason for constant updates which they have.\n\nThe amount of money vs the amount of work you have to put in for basically a purely microtransactional model is insane, way more than going out to just \"buy the game\" like EA or Take-two. Take a company like Blizzard who spends so little time developing HS and yet it's their cash cow, even moreso than WoW. Microtransaction games are the most efficient way to make cash and increase profit to the maximum, even if revenue is less. Now whether it's ethical to make games like this or fun to the consumer is a totally different issue but we're just trying to make a buck here.\n\nRoblox is gonna print money in the future.

In the same time frame, US household saving rate is at record high at over 20%, that amount translates to a whopping $4000 extra saving per person.

First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                \n \nNext is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about \"other \" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  \n\nNext is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           \n\nNext is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           \n\nNext is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. \n\nNext is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. \n\nNow I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               \n \nNext is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. \n\nLastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask.

So first is investor.gov, which has a great getting started section, aswell as being all round a great website for investing \"safe\", next is investopedia, which is like the Wikipedia for investing, but also as a great education section full of great articles. Finally the one I recommend the most is khan academy, which has some really spectacular videos on all things related to the stock market. Ok so now for my strategy, what I would do is split your money (not necessarily evenly) between three different stocks/ETFs, so the first one would be your stable stock/ETF, (example VOO)where you just set it and forget it. Next is your dividend one, where it should be sort of stable but with high dividends (example VYM), and now with your new found dividends I'd reinvest back into your stable and the following. The following is what usually is a individual stock, but could be an etf. So the following would be something that you really believe in, something that you think is undervalued and will grow. This doesn't necessarily have to be 100% safe, as you have your stable stock and to a extent your dividend stock to rely on. So an example would be Sony, which is a company I feel really passionate about on which I  made a DD that I can share with you if you would like. So , in summary, my strategy would be a very low risk etf, low risk dividend stock/etf and sort of risky stock/etf which you believe will grow faster than your stable and the market in general.

I am an investor since in TSLA 2018. I have followed the story intensely almost every day since then. Maybe my memory is faulty, but I cannot for the life of me remember when ever before we thought that the valuation of TSLA depends on bond yields. I mean, I get the concept, but why would a yield change of 5% over 10 years be at all relevant to TSLA? Tesla will for the foreseeable future have a production growth of at least 50% per year. It will likely get close to 100% this year. If capital would be flowing out because some other investment is suddenly 5% better is beyond me. The actual value of Tesla, the company, will rise about 50% per year on its vehicle business alone! Thats 10x more than 5% increase in bond rates! The two effects are so far removed from other, I cant wrap my head around that! And if you look at the absolute numbers is even more absurd. Bond rates around 1.5%+-0.05% over 10 years vs. 50% growth per year.\n\nWhat I think happened was bond yields are just a new \"reason\" to kick around because people need to have a reason for everything. Once it started getting attention, algos or traders suddenly trade based on that new pig in town and blew its importance way out of proportion.\n\nHere is the explanation that I heard for this:\nPeople say \"Tesla will be valued $1.5T in 2030 and at a discount rate of 10% per year, it should be valued such and such this year\" Then suddenly yield rates change which changes the discount rate, which changes todays valuation. But that completely neglects the fact that the initial $1.5T valuation for Tesla in 2030 is complete garbage and the assumed 10% discount rate is garbage too. The model is just garbage in garbage out and it is used to justify TSLA share price movements today. Its complete and utter BS.\n\nI bet TSLA is set up for at least 2x this year. Bond yields are irrelevant when FSD goes to wide beta. Or when TSLA Berlin production starts way ahead of anybodies expectations. Or when Giga Texas starts to spit out Cybertruck prototypes. Or when the Semi starts production. Or when the new battery \"pilot plant\" reaches volume production. Or when China starts a M2 factory. Or when solar roof and powerwall get crazy demand due to a snow storm and production starts accelerating.. ohh wait that last bit happened already.\n\nJust my 2 cents.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Great post. Just want to share some of my thoughts as I‚Äôve been thinking about this over the last few days and doing some reading. \n\nWhen interest rates and treasury yields are low, investors typically become more interested in riskier high-return investments. Rightly or wrongly, Tesla is lumped in with that category of investments, as it has a high P/E ratio, and compared to an Apple, still has a very long way to grow and execute on its targets. \n\nThe reaction we‚Äôre seeing isn‚Äôt a reaction based on everybody‚Äôs DCF models adjusting by small %, it‚Äôs due to a shift in general sentiment away from the high growth space, now that investors and markets expect rates/treasury yields to be moving upwards in the short-medium term. This is compounded by the fact that many industries heavily battered by the pandemic are going to begin reopening and see earnings rapidly increase in the near term, fund managers and institutions will be looking to ‚Äòchase alpha‚Äô short-medium term in these value sectors. \n\nMy point really is that this is more about overall sentiment. When expectations are continued rises and rates in risk-free assets, people move away from riskier high growth investments. We also need to be mindful that some of the growth Tesla and ARK funds saw in 2020 was due to this sentiment working in our favour, so naturally it will deflate as that same sentiment changes.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think in the long run TSLA will not be able to stay detached from fundamentals for ever. $1.5Tr in 2030 really is the conservative approach and in a sense the realistic one because it has the highest propability of achievement.

{"title": "Canoo was algo attacked today probably to cover shorts", "selftext": "https://ibb.co/r7YhN6N\n\nI am posting in WSB as I honestly believe it meets the criteria in terms of market cap and retail interest. This post may get auto-deleted or mod-deleted. If it disappears just know that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not of my fact. I‚Äôve been covering Canoo for a few months so check my post history if you need. \n\n**Context:** Canoo released the presentation of its new truck on March 11th (YouTube, Instagram etc.). A great new catalyst which was covered by multiple media. Price action went rapidly up after the stock been hammered below $10 on the recent tech growth correction. \n\n**Options context:** For the last couple of weeks I have noticed that put/call ratio was **massively** skewed towards calls volume i.e. I‚Äôm talking near 10 to 1 every single day. Option interest also much bigger on calls side. Although the price of the IV was relatively ‚Äúcheap‚Äù around 100% (for a new public company with long duration growth). \n\n**Weekly price increase:** The stock went from $11 on Monday until exactly $16.00 today... until something funny happened... [weekly graph](https://ibb.co/Wfhtwm9)\n\n**What I believe happened:** Some big money was too short on the stock that started running way too fast for a mispriced implied volatility of just 100%. The heat intensified and people were more than ever buying calls (like 90% 95% of options volume were calls again). Also these calls are concentrated onto March expiry as there are no weeklies on this name. \n\n**What I believe they did:** They had to cover their shorts as money was bleeding fast with no sign of any slow down (Canoo was even up 5% PM when all tech growth was in the red). Massive sell wall at 16.00 with more than 100K on the offer. But even after it dropped the stock wanted to moon again and people were still buying calls relentlessly. **They activated the ultra algo** in order to drop the share price as fast and as low as possible in order to trigger stop losses on calls. Specifically on MAR 15CALLS. \n\n**Evidence:** Look again at the [screenshot.](https://ibb.co/r7YhN6N)\n\nAt time 12:59:50 and 12:59:51 you will see that within **one second** big quantities were bought at the lowest prices of the day (0.35 to 0.45) then 3 seconds later it went back up to regular prices and quantities. This is the evidence that someone has triggered a sell off on Canoo stock to trigger stop losses on MAR 15C for the algo to buy absolutely everything it could within 1 second. It happened so fast that you couldn‚Äôt even feel it. Only an algo was capable to perform this. I had to dig into time/sales to decipher what happened.\n\n**ELI5** Why buy calls if they are short? HF was about to lose too much money on shorting Canoo a retail darling that wants to moon hard. They couldn‚Äôt control the price action anymore. They had to hedge their short by getting long calls and mitigate their potential loss. They scooped more than 1K MAR 15C at around 0.42 average price and within the next few seconds it went back to 0.80 and then minutes later to 1.00. All this happened at plain sight before you had time to blink. Now don‚Äôt expect media talking about this kind of stuff. They too busy witch hunting retail. This post may also get censored anyway.\n\nI‚Äôve tried my best to make this a quick and simple post. I‚Äôve explained it at the best of my understanding. Obviously not a recommendation to buy sell hold any security. I shared public data. My interpretations could be erroneous. \n\n**Bonus S3 short data** on Canoo: \nshort interest is $152M\n10.33M shares shorted\n10.33% of Float\n9.37% S3 SI% Float\n47.82% fee.\nShares shorted up +1.6 million shares, worth $23 million, +13.3%, last week.\n\n**TLDR** HF got caught asleep at the wheel shorting Canoo. Retail likes it too much and wanna moon. They had to buy next week calls ASAP and as cheap as possible. Used algo ultra fast. One second later: thank you very much for cheap calls.", "id": "m3tpkt", "created_utc": 1615590699.0, "score": 428, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "Should probably add $GOEV ticker to the title so more people can see this.", "score": 45, "replies": []}, {"body": "Very bullish in goev.
