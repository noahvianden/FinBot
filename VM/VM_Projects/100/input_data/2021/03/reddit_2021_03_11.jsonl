{"title": "$NIO: The Chosen One", "selftext": "TL;DR: Lengthy post with my thoughts and insight into the stock $NIO as well as some trade recommendations. You can read the full article here as well: [https://maxxprofits.com/](https://maxxprofits.com/)  \n\n\nFor full disclosure I have been purchasing NIO since it was in the low $7 range. I have averaged up twice bringing my total share average to $9.01. I’m not saying this to brag or flaunt my diamond hands. I’m sharing this information because it’s important to know why a smart investor (at least I’d like to think I’m smart) would hold onto a position well beyond 500% and feel comfortable continuing to hold that position with the recent price fluctuations. \n\nNIO is being touted as China’s own Tesla Motors. This may or may not be true. One thing that NIO has done exceptionally well where Tesla failed is their battery-swapping tech. So as a buyer of a NIO fleet vehicle you have the option to purchase with our without a battery. If you choose not to purchase a battery you can sign up for a battery subscription service by paying a monthly fee and use one of NIO’s battery swap-stations to exchange your run down battery for a fully charged one. Think of it like a gas station but with batteries instead. \n\nThis is smart of NIO to pursue this type of program especially in China where most individuals aren’t living in large houses with the ability to install a charging station directly into their garage wall. For that reason alone NIO seems like a better choice for an EV vehicle if you are living in densely populated areas with little to no space. Looking at you China! \n\nNIO also understands that while people are paying for the subscription service - sometimes they just don’t drive. How many times have you gone a full month barely pulling up your Netflix account? Yet you’re still paying for Netflix. NIO’s subscription service keeps customers paying month to month even after that initial sale. This is great! \n\nChina’s market share on a global scale is massive and one thing China does often is promote and back their own companies over US. While Tesla has entered into the Chinese market it doesn’t mean they are going to overtake the Chinese EV companies. China is very competitive and loves to win and get out on top. Leaving all politics aside we can’t deny this to be true. In my opinion China wants to produce EV companies that not only compare with Tesla but overall outperform and take a bigger piece of the EV-pie. \n\nIn my dumb monkey brain I’m thinking **China isn’t going to let their precious EV companies fail.** Li, Xpeng & Nio are their EV babies right now. While this article is about NIO I also have strong positions in both LI and XPENG and I believe these are also great buys as well.\n\nChina has stated that they want 25% of all new vehicles sold in the country to be electric by 2025. Currently EV sales are only contributing to about 5%. So in the next four years we’re going to see an EV boom all across China. That means the government would likely be installing more charging stations across the country and possibly kickbacks for citizens who purchase EV.\n\nIt’s no secret that the emissions in China are insane. It sure would be nice for China to be able to come out in a few years and say, “Hey look at how much we improved.” I believe this is exactly what’s going to happen especially when you really look at the policies the Chinese government has put in place for electric vehicles vs. combustion engine vehicles.\n\nSo, now that we have the fundamentals out of the way let’s take a look at NIO’s chart and you all can see why I’m even more excited about NIO:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulrahzhd0hm61.png?width=2734&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a05d3f344750a2b33bbbbcf14d2ce7fda749aad\n\nThe recent market correction has brought NIO into oversold conditions that haven’t been since since October 2019 when the price was $1.23. Sure, the stock has had sell offs and it has encroached on oversold areas in the past but recently it got hit harder than ever before.This tells me a couple of things:\n\n1. A lot of profits were taken.\n2. The big boys upstairs unloaded and naturally are waiting for the little minnows to offload their profits before boarding this train for the second come up.\n\nWhen I first started writing this article a couple of days ago the price of NIO was $32 and that’s when I started averaging up. The last three trading sessions have been good for NIO and it has seen a 40% increase in price. Absolutely bananas! You might be thinking, well if it has gone up that much why would I want to get into this off technicals? The answer is simple: MFI Don’t Lie! \n\nThe MFI(Money Flow Index) operates like clockwork. Don’t believe me? Do your own research and go add the MFI to any stock. Look at the daily chart. Hell, look at the hourly chart. MFI provides insanely accurate entry and exit areas. Hindsight is 20-20 though. It’s easy to look at a stock and see how MFI played out. Does it work every time? No. Of course not. If it did then we’d all be retired on the beach sippin silly drinks with little umbrellas in them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/robj73ch0hm61.png?width=2738&format=png&auto=webp&s=30c942de199cbefdf0ba9c3a67c5c052dbf8f158\n\nThere is still so much more room for the MFI to run in NIO. In my personal opinion we’re going to see a new high coming for NIO soon. \n\n**Standard Risk:** Buy NIO $40-$50\n\n**Riskier:** Buy NIO LEAP’s for Dec 17 2021 or Feb 18, 2022 or do a Vertical Spread to limit the risk a tad. An example: Buy Oct 15th $45 Call Sell Oct 15th $55 Call\n\n**Balls to the Wall Risk:** May 21 $45 Call (Currently priced $6.33)\n\n**Are you Fucking Insane:** APR 1 $45 Call (Currently priced $3.45)\n\n**Jesus Take the Wheel:** MAR 19 $45 Call (Currently priced $2.11)\n\nHope you enjoyed this read and my take on NIO.

For most stocks that's nuts. \n\nI didn't want to sell my $400 shares so I used margin to buy 100 @65. Figured I'd likely pick up $500 in 2 weeks unless something went nuts. Do it again in 2 weeks and I made $1000 a month until somebody buys my shares. The stock took off. It went over $800 so 100 shares got called away. My account is first in first out, so that night I edited my lots and told Etrade to give them my newest shares not my oldest.\n\nSo they paid me $80,000 for 100 shares of Tesla.

That day gets closer -- and the price of the underlying stock is going down. This makes it less likely the person who bought your contract will get anything. It's farther and farther away from having any value to the buyer. At this point, the value of the call you sold has decreased -- which means, if you were to want to close out your position by \"buying to close\", you'd be buying a much cheaper contract. You made money! \n\nBut let's say you don't do that. A little more time ticks by, and suddenly the stock price jumps upward. It's still below the strike, but it moved strongly upward. Now the likelihood of that contract getting in the money has gone up -- it's closer to the strike. Maybe you panic a bit because you don't want to have your shares called away. You check the price of the contract you'd need to buy to close out your position -- and it's now much more expensive. Maybe it's higher than the amount you made when you sold the earlier one initially. You may again decide you don't want to lose the underlying stock (maybe tax reasons), and you fear the price will continue to rise. So you grit your teeth and buy-to-close -- and you've spent more than the premium you earned when you sold the first call. You lost money, but no underlying stock had to move.\n\nMaybe you wonder why the price of buying back that option jumped so much -- more than some other options on other stocks you own. This is Delta -- how much the option price moves when the stock price moves. Length of the lever. Gamma is just the derivative of Delta. How fast Delta is changing.\n\nBack to the original scenario. Let's say you sell that option a few weeks out, and the stock price just doesn't move. At all. It's a miracle. So the stock price remains below the strike of the calls you sell, and time goes by. The closer you get to expiration, the less likely it is that the option is going to print for the buyer. Price just isn't moving -- tick tock, and the buyer is getting no closer to a win. Now it's ten days out. No movement. Now six. Nothing. Now three. There's less and less time remaining for the stock to rise to the point where the option prints, so the price of that option is falling. It has less and less value, and eventually it will expire worthless. This is the value decaying with time -- Theta. \n\nSo to your original question -- if the call is rising toward the strike, yes, it gets more expensive for you to buy out the position to close it. If the price is falling, it gets less expensive.

{"title": "What we experienced today with GME & AMC is confirmation: WE HAVEN'T EVEN LICKED THE FUSE TO START THE MOASS", "selftext": "GOOD EVENING to all of my favorite little Crayon eating, piss martini drinking, diamond handed big NUTTED ape buddies,\n\nNow I know that all of you little shit throwing apes that haven't been on this ride before were dropping fat donkey kongs in your Huggies this afternoon during the brief GME/AMC nosebleed. If you survived the slaughter, congratu-fucking-lations. If you bought the dip, you know the way, and are truly, one big fat diamond loving retard. If you paper handed or had stop-losses set, you're a bitch and the rest of us diamond hands thank you for exiting our rocket before we make our first landing on planet **$69,420.69**. The Tendieman is coming way faster than you think.\n\n**The Hedgefunds**\n\nToday, these stupid little shit fuckers really decided to show us their entire hand. They used the same short attack that they used previously, but not only did they do it so blatantly obvious, they did it across our beloved GME and AMC (THESE ARE THE ONLY PLAYS THAT MATTER, THEY DID IT ELSEWHERE TOO). This was the most obvious share-shake attempt that I've ever seen, and it was done more outwardly than the previous attempt. **THEY'RE SCARED, WE HAVE TO BE CLOSE TO INITIATING PHASE 1 OF THE MOASS.** As GME and AMC keep rising, they have to keep buying more and more shares to lose less money on the options that are ITM or will be ITM by the end of the week. They extra fucked themselves today with their bullshit attack. **They triggered the short sale restriction** meaning that tomorrow (for GME), they won't be able to orchestrate such a massive attack because they'll only be able to short shares during upticks; *but ape say \"if big back fat crying down his back Melvin just short on uptick won't it crash?\"* **NO, BECAUSE GME UPTICKS EVERY .6969696996420 MILLISECONDS.** ***Tomorrow we will be able to BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY*** and these chicken shits won't be able to shake the shares out of the paper handed bitches as easily as they had today. I'd include pretty little pictures with colors for all of you crayon eating shits, but I know they mean nothing to any of us, **HODL.**\n\n**The Media**\n\nThe media is so fucking crooked and tied in with these hedgies that they literally only speak when GME and AMC downticks 10-20%. All day long they were silent until the short attack, then all of the sudden our \"MEME STOCKS\" were worthy of mentioning. I think this is clear indication that they're being paid and gagged by these chode dicked chicken shit hedgies. In conclusion, don't listen to the media, don't listen to the articles, the analysts, or even your mother. **TRUST THE RETARD INSIDE YOUR HEAD.**\n\n**The Crayon Eaters**\n\nForemost, I love you ape brothers. Many of you have been here from the start, and some of you may have even just joined today, but it doesn't matter so long as you HODL. **Together ape strong.** Remember that you are holding diamonds, everyday that you hold these diamonds you're costing Wallstreet and the egotistical bastards that stole from your families in 2008 billions and billions of dollars, but its nothing in comparison to what we will achieve when we take back *TENS of billions* of dollars from them. Getting rich is cool, but sticking it to the man and getting back what is rightfully ours is even sweeter. I've gained a sense of true happiness from these gorgeous little stonks, and I've already decided that IF these stocks go to zer-**HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA FUCK THAT THESE BITCHES AINT GOIN' NOWHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE GO FUCKING PARABOLIC AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET FILTHY RICH; THE RED PRICE NEXT TO YOUR SHARES IS THE DISCOUNT TO BUY MORE. HANG IN THERE, NO RETARDS LEFT BEHIND. WE ARE COMING BACK FOR YOU ALL ON THE WAY TO $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nFuck the hedgefunds, their bitchass tricks didn't work today, it made things worse, and made us apes stronger. The media is as F.O.S as they've ever been and are doing anything they can to help their hedgefund sugar daddies out. **Apes together strong, HODL till $69,420,696,696,696,420.696.**\n\n***Obligatory legal pardon:*** **Don't listen to me I never passed 3rd grade, I am not a cat, but I am a thoroughly convinced diamond handed ape who loves the stonk. Plainly, I am not a financial advisor.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 1 :  \n\nhere to report that am love ape stepsisters too, but no want media know we have ape stepsisters stuck on rocketship because know then media would that we've infiltrated the smoothest brained of apes. the wohmans.\n\n edit 2: \nTHANK YOU FOR THE AWARDS AND UPVOTES.

{"title": "Why the price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k", "selftext": "While reading through comments on WSB this week, I've seen a fair amount of skepticism regarding some popular price targets for GME. This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets. \n\nConsider the fact that, even if GameStop's market capitalization briefly reaches $2T, it still will not be the most valuable company in the world (that title will remain with Apple). **At a market cap of $2T, shares of GME will be worth $28,680.** At a share price of $10k, GameStop's market capitalization will be  \\~$700B, less than those of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.\n\nNow, from the perspective of fundamentals, it doesn't make sense to compare GameStop's market cap to those of the companies just mentioned. However, in the context of a short squeeze, it seems like a reasonable comparison, especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world. And that possibility is quite plausible. \n\nRemember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008. You might say, \"Well, maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008, so the bar for VW was lower.\" Ok, fair point. But at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW attained a market cap of \\~$420B. According to The World Bank (see [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)), the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $32.27T in 2008, and $68.65T in 2018. So at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW accounted for roughly 0.42/32.27 = 1.3% of total market cap. In 2018, 1.3% of total market cap was $0.013\\*68.65T = $893B. **At a market cap of $893B, GME shares will be worth $12,806.** And this is a conservative estimate, since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018.\n\nTL;DR: The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k.

This digging in of the heels shows the power of the gamma ramp magnetism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|SP|\\# Shares Delta Hedged|\n|:-|:-|\n|12|1.84 Million|\n|12.5|2.437 Million|\n|12.89 - Today's Close /u/pennyether is smart|2.92 Million|\n|13|3.065 Million|\n|13.5 - Today's AM close|3.718 Million|\n|14|4.3 Million|\n|14.5|5.07 Million|\n|15|5.7 Million|\n\n# These are the recent /u/pennyether statistics (if you haven't thanked him you should)\n\n# There is Some X Files Level Shit Going On\n\n[GoevWhale Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoevWhale) found this Dark pool Order by [Dark Pool Melstone](https://twitter.com/MelStone31/status/1369353690566524934?s=20)\n\n(Dark pools allow massive transactions of shares to occur without affecting the share price)\n\nI consulted the **Godfather (AKA Cartesian Ghost AKA Hal Squarerootofnegative1)** about the fact that 2 Days ago someone purchased 5000 4/16 25$p  which this dark pool order perfectly matches. Someone is probably taking up a synthetic short position to hedge their bets against the share price increasing.  As the share price goes psycho the IV spikes so do the prices of Puts.     This is big time shit.. Retail is just along for the ride.   The Godfather advises that this is to essentially retain the freedom to maneuver and stay net neutral to ride the SP.  This is a bet that the SP will skyrocket in March and dip in April and then Continue to move up... Or April gave them the best vantage point to play the field... its probably /u/deepfuckingvalue\n\nWhat is encouraging is that the pattern over the last few days has been gap openings met with  price capping and bullish long pressure to stabilize and push it.  (I actually think that monday we saw a recent short cover as we ran around the mountain and AVG age of shorts increased) We can see from the above chart what gap openings do to the price.  (A: MM have to buy more shares.)  Check the last few days we have seen an immediate spike in price on open with it settling down and then slowly rising as a long continues to push shorts, its actually straight warfare if you watch the L2 (and of course normal profit taking, day trading or retail or whatever its not all about short squeezing is it now).\n\n**This makes me believe that Shorts are opening new positions lower but aren't willing to go hard in the paint...**  They are essentially just digging their heels in as they are being slowly shoved towards a cliff..\n\nSI increasing slightly with SP increasing is confirmatory of this thesis.

(**I can't confirm this directly but reports from the front state the article originally just said truck leak yadda yadda cool story bro.)**  Then they went to go talk to the Chairman (Who cares about the CEO these days) who didn't answer them until the market closed and said, yeah **GigaChad Tesla Killer** will be made in a microfactory...

As always, read the warrant agreement, but there's usually a clause where they can redeem them once the stock has been over $18 for 20 out of the last 30 trading days. \n\nIf you have a stock that's been depressed below $18 for a long time and suddenly spikes this is great - this is what I was looking for in goev - but it's significantly different than typical LEAPS where you're betting on the long term future of the company and can ride it out for a couple years.  It's very likely the company redeems the warrants within the first 6 months if they're doing well. This isn't a cheap 2025 LEAP.\n\nDon't be scared of redemption - you get a 30 day warning email from your broker and can exercise your warrants during that period or sell them. Just be aware that it can happen so you don't miss it and get a few pennies for them by ignoring the redemption notice!\n\nThe reason I typically don't buy over $4 is because redemption intrinsic value is around $6.50, so that gives a nice profit margin even if the underlying stock doesn't skyrocket, and just lazily sits slightly above $18 for a while. Feel free to use a different strategy, that's just my conservative approach.\n\nAlso be aware that warrants will generally trade at a discount until they're exercisable. In this case goev warrants ***are*** exercisable so they aren't trading at a discount, but if you see other spacs that have warrants don't be surprised at a gap in the pricing.  Warrants typically become exercisable 30 days after merger or 1 year after the spac launches, whichever comes ***later***.  There are a few high profile spacs merging 6 months after launch, and their warrants won't become exercisable for another 6 months so they'll continue to trade at a risk discount.  \n\nTypically they have to become exercisable before the company can call redemption but this is not always the case, I've seen some with clauses that allow for early redemption that also triggers your ability to exercise early.

When looking at the 1 day charts, you can see the pattern emerge that resembles the sockeye salmon AT FIRST GLANCE. However, if you get real close and use extra green colored crayons, you'll actually see that the pattern more closely replicates A CHINOOK SALMON PATTERN. The fundamentals are the same, but I am unsure if the detailed analysis will still work mathematically, so I'd appreciate some feedback and insight.\n\nFurthermore, there are a few variables that may need to be taken into consideration. First, we must consider the concept of seasonality. If the salmon were in season, it may be likely that they are traveling upstream naturally as opposed to downstream. In addition, we would see a significant increase in impregnated salmon, thus our roe index would drastically increase. The roe index is INDIRECTLY related to the stock's MACD.\n\nLastly, I'd like to point out a potential fallacy in your logic, as we end up in an impasse. You see, following the classic bear-trap stockeye salmon trend, there's a fatal flaw. Stockeye salmon also attract the eyes of another feral beast. The cat. And who do we know is not a cat? DFV. So logically, this type of movement would attract a cat as well as a bear. Given that DFV is, in fact, not a cat, following this logic, he should not be attracted to this stock movement. BUT HE IS! His Twitter activity within the past few days has increased far more since the emergence of this nautical trend. Moving forward from here, I think you bring up many valid points, but it may be risky to incorporate the fish ladder attack in the off chance that the the F in DFV actually stands for feline.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "I cant wait to spawn so hard at the top I literally die", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is the most informative dd in this sub", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "That's the most science I've seen all day.

I am doing my best to summarize the key points.\n\n# Key Takeaways: Links for videos are at Bottom if you want to watch.\n\n**Just as a wakeup call for the idiots that say \"It's a mattress company.\" This company is printing money.**\n\n**in 2016 they did 65M in revenue- in 4 years their revenue is now 10X higher.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kq5khzttpbm61.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=2089111795beb213a43d4c38b1c1f7e081fd9f28\n\n# There is no stopping Purple's Domestic Plans \n\n***PURPE IS OPENING A STORE every \\~12 DAYS for the rest of the year.***\n\n* PRPL is anticipating becoming the #2 Player in the industry and is targeting \\~1.5B\\~2B in revenue- this Move is expected to take 3-5 years.\n* PRPL is looking at tons of Merger and Acquisitions and this could potentially be a strategy but this is not their focus.\n* PRPL anticipates 30-36% Growth for this year (2021) to 840-880M\n   * PRPL Capacity at the end of 2021 will exceed 1B on a capacity standpoint\n* PRPL is nearly doubling their brick and mortar presence in 2021 alone\n   * 1500 stores\n* PRPL anticipates 20-30% for the 2022+ years----- 3 to 5 years worth of continued growth domestically.\n* PRPL anticipates Foreign Expansion won't be their focus until late 2022/2023\n* PRPL is in 1800 stores and commands on 3% market share but they believe they will continue to take market share even in a downturn.\n   * Tempur-Pedic is in about \\~8000 stores.\n* PRPL expects that they will have \\~1.3B to \\~1.5B before expanding internationally\n* PRPL has tons of opportunity for higher price points in bedding\n* PRPL believes 50% of the market opportunity is outside of the USA.\n   * PRPL is so confident that they aren't focusing on overseas expansion until 2022 with the real effort anticipated to be in 2023\n* Expansion is looking to be omni-channel\n   * There is headroom for tons of Mattress firms\n   * \"All Premium\" retailers have reached out to purple\n* There is enough door expansion that they wouldn't be able to support them\n   * PRPL is pacing expansion to ensure they can service their customers\n\nESTIMATING EBITDA for next 3 to 5 years- I am using 12.5% as midpoint Purple indicated it could be as high as 15% in 3-5 years.\n\n# THE REASON FOR THE DROP AFTER EARNINGS\n\n* Purple indicated the miss was not due to competition it was due to soft guidance for Q1 as a momentum quarter\n* Soft guidance for Q1 is due to the quarter being focused on getting ready for Q2 onward\n* Q3 will witness most of the growth that bleeds into Q4\n* There are supply constraints that have pushed some of the growth out- they are working through this.\n   * The only constraint affecting purple is coils.\n   * They are hand to mouth on coils and will need more coils\n   * Purple is not worried about competition at this point as they are no where near close to saturation.\n\n# Where could the Stock Price GO\n\nI have provided 2 P/E ratios and I have used the 25% growth scenario to calculate EBITDA. Based on these numbers, we could see a price from 30-96. If they exceed this then it wouldn't be unrealistic to see 45-120 as the range in the next 5 years. 2021 is a little over estimated as compared to their guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My rough estimates assuming EBITDA multiples of 20 and 25 and EBITDA Margin of 12.5&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/0ee72023rbm61.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce469b42deaefe1744a9d51be7df53e2d8abaf7a)\n\n# Comparing to Tempur Sealy using a higher EV/Sales ratio\n\nTempur sealy has about 1.5B in debt ,so their Enterprise value is much higher than purple. Using EV/Sales as an indicator for PRPL, we could assume that 3x Ev/Sales due to PRPLS superior growth and it would put the stock price @ 37.00 based on 2021 revenue estimates, 46.00 based on 2022 estimates, 57.00 based on 2023 estimates, 72 based on 2024 estimates and 90 based on 2025 estimates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Chart below is TPX (Tempur Sealy's current Metrics). Purple is growing much quicker and will likely command significantly better multiples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Tempur Sealy Metrics](https://preview.redd.it/jiv9b7asrbm61.png?width=1808&format=png&auto=webp&s=f03a0e3709b3649777414a3314c7f74067ab3c75)\n\n# The analyst we need to follow- This guy is a savant and he covers tons of big names and is the 3rd most accurate analyst out of more than 7,000.\n\nI am going to talk briefly about Brian Nagel because a lot of people don't understand how significant his coverage is.

Some of you are spending hundreds of dollars, some thousands! These stock boards are suddenly full of parents coming to the realization that they're ALL spending money AT THE SAME PLACE. The same realization hit people on message boards when Netflix went full-streaming with \"Watch Now.\" But Netflix only has a thousand titles and some DVDs?! Why would anyone subscribe to that? Some older folks here will remember these convos.\n\nNow we have a powerful gaming platform played by youngsters that parents everywhere are paying for. But all I hears is $45 overvalues the company. A company nearly every parent is already paying for...a company that's just partnered with TENCENT to operate a \"localized version of its platform\" in CHINA. Plus, it has the added benefit of starting out a meme stock, which is just free advertising for its products.\n\nStay out if you want to, but this sucker is climbing with or without you. I never understand why people are so reluctant to invest in things they actually use daily. You're not special--if you use the product, millions of others likely do too.\n\nAs for the haters--my best guess? Bears looking for a lower point of entry. Push the market down, buy in at $45 or less, watch it go up over time, profit both ways. It's literally what they do for survival. Don't buy into it.

{"title": "The Squeeze Trap", "selftext": "This is not a DD. This is not financial advice. This is a borderline tin-foil hat opinion piece, but it is my honest opinion to explain what I am seeing.\n\nIm too fuckin lazy to back this by any data, but it's my attempt to raise awareness to what may really be going on.\n\nTL;DR: The 🌈🐻 are scalping retail on this Gee Em Eee squeeze. Its a squeeze trap.\n\n\nHFs (and the rest of the world) have discovered that people want to squeeze them and are willing to take huge bets on options and buy meme stonks at outrageous prices. They know that people feed on hype even at the expense of their live savings, with desire to get rich and stick it to the man.\n\nSo, knowing this, how can they protect themselves and scalp retail out of millions?\n\nStep 1: Buy meme stonks at low cost basis\n- this causes a huge price uptick and draws attention from  retailers, sucking them in on FOMO and greed.\n- this also allows them to cover a heavy amount of short positions at the price they bought it at if necessary. Not at $100,420.69\n\nStep 2: Buy more meme stonks. Start a new hype craze by the rapid upward price.\n- they are still buying it for less than retailers because they know retailers will FOMO in.\n\nStep 3: Once the IV is through the fuckin roof, sell tons of options.\n\nStep 4: Establish a new high short position. They control the peak because they were the whales largely responsible for driving it up.\n\nStep 5: Dump a ton of shares and tank the price. We saw this on Wednesday. Once sold down to a sizeable delta, they then close out on short positions established at their peak. We have data showing 900,000 shares become available to short right after the price \"recovery\". Which means someone covered a fuckton of short shares.\n\nStep 6: Control price til option expiry. They want the price to go sideways until all of their written options expire OTM.\n\nStep 7: Repeat.\n\nThey are in no short squeeze danger because they own a ton of the float. There is no one driving the price up but themselves and the weak collective of retail hooked in.\n\n The real threats to them would be the following:\n1) The rest of the world jumping in and actually throwing in enough capital to squeeze them to a margin call\n2) Retail selling EVERYTHING before they do.\n3) a whale bigger than them wanting to get into this game.\n\nThey know the first two likely won't happen. They influence the media to help ensure the first one. They count on retail fomo and diamond handing to not worry about the second option. The third option likely hasn't happened because most institutions with billions of capital probably don't want to risk it going to war with other MAJOR HFs. Keep in mind Citadel is backing Melvin and has a retarded amount of capital. Who wants to risky their own ass to support retail and F with those other big players? And also risk SEC investigations. No, those whales are staying away.\n\nSo. Ask yourself, is diamond handing and FDing options the right play? Or is retail just being dragged through the mud and diamond handing actually their downfall?\n\nSome lucky individuals will cash out some profits, but likely at the expense of other retailers.\n\nThis is what I believe is happening. And my guess to confirm my suspicions is that we see this price continue to go sideways through tomorrow so all the 3/12 expirys can fall OTM.\n\nThey may repeat the process next week, or dump everything they own right before QW, either way I don't see them leaving themselves wide open to be F'd by retailers.\n\nGood luck bros.", "id": "m2zxdn", "created_utc": 1615494488.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "Ya ass is ‘bout to get stimulated", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "lmao I hope so, but I feel for everyone who bought OTM options for tomorrow", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "I wrote this but you might have a point.
