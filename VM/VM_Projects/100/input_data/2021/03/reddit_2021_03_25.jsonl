Do you not think battery swapping stations are useful for solving the issue of battery degradation? Or the ability to upgrade to batteries with longer ranges as they are developed?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think it's great for both uses. But that's not the issue. It's being marketed as a better alternative to charging. There's also some other issues that come along with it. The first and most important one in my opinion is scale. The reason NIO gets away with it is cause they don't actually have that many cars on the road compared to TSLA. Imagine for a moment the amount of batteries a companies like TSLA would have to have on standby to pull off something like that. I'm not referring to all the stations or anything else, just the amount of batteries needed. Now, if you look up what Elon has stated several times about possible battery shortages and their need to get as many built as possible, you'll quickly see why that type of business is not practical. I can't remember it off hand, but if you want I'll look up what I'm referring to here and link it. Just being lazy right now. It's something about panasonic or LG or something.   \n\n\nBut again, I want to be very clear about this. I LIKE battery swapping stations, just having a couple of them around is great as this makes things more convenient for the consumer. But it is in no feasible way a replacement for charging.   \n\n\nOn a side note too, it's also a bit of a double edged sword. Now this is just my opinion, but when you ''solve'' the issue of battery degradation by simply swapping out the battery, it's more like a workaround than a solution. By having a problem like that, it pushes RnD to develop more rapidly. Swapping the battery out to beat degradation is like putting duct tape on a sinking ship. Tesla has already announced a possible million mile battery in the future. In this situation, having a couple battery swapping stations around is useful as existing customers can just drive into one and get it swapped out as opposed to having to book their car in at a Tesla service workshop ( i actually don't know the process Tesla users have to go through, I'm just assuming that is how they'd have to do it ).   \n   \nThe issue I have is that it's simply better to build better batteries, but I suppose the Chinese have always had the mindset of building cheaper disposable products. In the short run, battery swapping wins. Long run, not so much.

If you got a $10k margin call, that means your account probably had $35k in cash when you made the purchase? Let's think about what happens if TSLA drops $100. Your account value drops by $10,000, and so you will get another margin call. Are you prepared to make good on that? You can't sell another call against the shares because they are already committed.

To me, taking on insane risk to try to \"solve\" previous risky plays (that by your account, are losing), is the incorrect path. But I am not you, and only you can decide that for yourself.\n\nYour Fidelity rep is almost certainly not giving you financial advice, unless you have an agreement with them to be your financial adviser. And I don't know of any responsible financial adviser that would recommend what you are doing. The Fidelity person you are talking to is likely just answering technical questions about your account. Just because something is possible, doesn't make it the right course of action.\n\nCovered calls are not \"magic\", they are not \"safe\". They are a leveraged play that can result in losing money like any other trade or investment. The only \"safe\" aspect is that the most you can lose if assigned, is the difference between the share price and the strike on expiry, assuming you have the stock in your account to cover the assignment. Obviously if the underlying drops below your cost basis you lose that amount, but that's normal investment risk.\n\nI have a hard time believing that if you have only 100 shares of TSLA that you are able to sell any of it while you hold the short end of that call contract.

DOWN - (@50 it loses $2750; total value: $5,550) Buy 1 more share for 111 total\n   3. FLAT - No change! total value: $8300\n2. Base cash case - hold all $8300 as cash\n   1. UP - (@100 you buy 83 shares for $8300; total value $8,300)\n   2. DOWN - (@50 you buy 166 shares for $8300; total value $8,300)\n   3. FLAT - you buy 110 shares for $8300; total value $8,300\n3. Insurance case- buy AMD 75c Jul 21st for $800, hold $7500 cash; at expiration buy AMD\n   1. UP - (@100 you exercise 75c to buy 100 shares for $7500; total value $10,000)\n   2.

However that’s dividend investing to most people. They don’t care about anything besides dividend income. \n\n\nThis is the problem I have with dividend growth investing. People will often say “dividend growth stocks out preform the market, that’s why I do dividend investing.” Which is true, dividend growth stocks do tend to outperform the market. Well the issue I have is often these dividend growth stocks have other factors that explain their growth in value, it’s not due to the dividend. If you take a profitable company, with a growing revenue...like duh the share price will appreciate. It’s no different than investing in good solid growing companies for capital appreciation, however they contribute their returns to dividends. Which imho is the wrong way to think, but at least they aren’t advocating the loss of capital as a viable strategy for long term returns....so I’m fine with it. \n\n\nIma pick on Joseph Carlson because he’s popular on YouTube and I actually like some of his videos. You can see his shift from dividends to growth. Yet he claims he only cares about dividend income. Well, when Disney cut their dividend, he bought more because he wants capital appreciation lmao, which goes against his entire investment strategy that he preaches. You can also see where he forgets dividend income when it comes to bonds, he claims that “bonds yields are just too low.” Well....AGG has a yield of 2.68%, and his largest holding is Apple which has a yield of 0.68%. So he refuses to buy bonds because they don’t pay enough in dividends, yet his largest holding pays significantly less. I understand he expects growth in AAPL’s dividend, but his justification is rather inadequate. I emailed him to explain further on why bonds don’t pay enough but Apple does and he has never replied or responded to my email. Imo it’s because he’s starting to realize capital appreciation is king. \n\n\n\nWhen it comes to Dividend Irrelevancy. I used to be a denier too. It wasn’t until I sat down and read academic research and really sought understanding of it that I realized it’s real.

For these, you need to do DD to determine what you believe the company is worth.  That way even if the stock price fall, you just keep holding it because it's worth more than what people are willing to pay you for.

You should be happy to bet and have everyone fold so you can take the profit right there instead of trying to maximize your winning but risk losing the hand.  The same apply to gambling stocks.  Oftentimes it's better to just take a guaranteed profit than trying to squeeze out more gains.\n\nWhen you buy a stock, you need to decide which strategy you're using for that stock to help you decide in what condition you'd sell it.

These can haunt you if not taken care of. \n\nThen from there I would really ask yourself what you’re investing for. Is it for a nice home? To do right with your mother’s policy?

Over time though, you will amass a nice balance if you’re diversified, ride the waves of the market, and hold.\n\nI think your best options are Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are individual shares you can buy that are already extremely diversified across a given sector of the market and managed by firms who charge very tiny fees for you to own them. There’s some that mimic the Dow, the S&P 500, Nasdaq, etc. The returns of safe ETFs that mimic the market are very low risk and offer a decent return (10%+ per year). These are your best bet in my opinion. Your portfolio should be made up of mostly (75%) safe, broader market based ETFs. I would invest 20% in riskier ETFs that have historically been positive, but on a bigger return basis, so maybe 25%+ a year. The remaining 5% or less I would treat yourself to whatever you see fit. \n\nLosing a loved one can be rough and you deserve a nice vacation, new TV, etc. to help you take care of yourself mentally and physically.

No one is forcing anyone to buy anything - especially in a market that has tons of alternatives and availability.\n\nSee previous answer. In most of the US, it’s not a choice to buy a car. You need it to exist in our society as a functioning participant. It’s true though that we vote with our dollars and should reward those who go with a fixed price in order to incentivize change.\n\n>First, there is nothing painful nor arduous about accepting the price someone gives you, whether that is Tesla or a dealer.  If it is so painful for someone to ask for a discount, then they shouldn't, or they should have someone with higher emotional IQ to handle their money for them.\n\nYour lack of empathy here is concerning. Regular people should be able to buy things they need to buy without getting taken advantage of.\n\n>You have 100% transparency on the price.  It is on the sticker.  You can accept it or ask for a discount and if you don't get it, walk away or decide to buy it.\n\nNo you don’t. First, the price changes from person to person, meaning that you don’t know what the price actually is until you ask. Then, since most people are unable to buy cars in cash, you deal with their in-house lenders, who move the numbers around and bury the total cost in different interest rates and loan structures. Finally, they try and tack on their services, which they will tell you that you need, but are largely unnecessary and are basically pure profit to the dealer. Again, you shouldn’t need to be an expert in all these areas just to be a consumer. It’s a predatory environment. \n\n>If you bought it, it was, by definition, an okay price for you.  Otherwise why did you buy something for a bad price?\n\nI bought at the price I did because it was the best price I had received thus far, wasn’t sure how much more I’d get by continuing my search, and frankly didn’t want to continue wasting my time. Most people don’t have huge amounts of time to car shop, and shouldn’t need to spend 6-10hrs just trying to not get screwed.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> Your lack of empathy here is concerning. Regular people should be able to buy things they need to buy without getting taken advantage of.\n\nYour lack of understanding is far more concerning.  What you say is nonsense.  If someone is paying what they are willing to pay for a product, they are not being taken advantage of. \n\nLast I checked, people have lots of alternatives and they clearly exercise them as there were 14M new light vehicles sold and another 40M used vehicles sold in the US last year.  No one is being denied the ability to buy them by people taking advantage of them.  This is not selling a life preserver to a drowning man.\n\n> just trying to not get screwed.\n\nIf you paid what you are willing to pay for a car, you aren't getting screwed.  Stop being a victim.

Absolutely not.\n\nThat being said, I’m currently planning to relocate to Asia - more for quality of life and early retirement but the tax situation does improve as well being an expat.

I know there’s a societal good and quality of life improvement for all by funding public programs and what not but for me, the governments in the US are incredibly wasteful and ineffective.  Think of the coronavirus relief packages - did they do anything meaningful?  Maybe.  Haphazard and untargeted? Definitely.  I was in Thailand for the past few months and they had very targeted stimulus programs for citizens to boost domestic tourism and small business.  One program paid 40% of domestic travel expenses (up to $100 per day).  Another very popular program was extremely ingenious- it’s called 50/50.  Basically you get 1/2 of your food expenses paid by the government at small business and street food places.  This serves to help the buyer by cutting their costs in half.  It also boosts income to local sellers.  Very smart.  They used an app with QR code payment to track everything.  Side benefit?  They now have real sales data for millions of micro businesses that can be used to tax them in the future.\n\nHow about the US?  Nah just send people money to YOLO GME, spend on trips to Mexico, and whatever else.  While I agree it’s important to send out stimulus, it could have been way better designed and targeted.\n\nPPP was another example.  It took forever to get money out to failing business the first round and then a lot of thr money went to hedge funds and other businesses that definitely did not need it (ours did need it and got it eventually).\n\nIn the end, the various levels of government have fundamentally face-planted over and over again this past year.

Or maybe you just want to sell the shares. Or if you are more risk averse you may get spooked and buy it back if it gets close to being ITM not wanting to risk having to pay even more to buy it back.

Morgan/James Hill and E. H. Harriman for control over Northern Pacific Railways. Trying to take control of the company, both parties combined bought over 94% of the float. At the same time, other investors were heavily shorting the stock (to sell to one of the parties), until at one point everyone realized that they won't be able to cover their short position because Morgan/Hill and Harriman won't sell their shares. The shorts were squeezed as they fought for the remaining 6% of the shares and drove NP from $20 to $240. To pay for the high covering share prices, the shorts liquidated their other positions, causing mass panic that rippled through the whole stock market. Overwhelming cries of \"sell! sell! sell!\" were heard at the NYSE trading floor. Temporary relief were provided when rumors of Morgan's broker's death were spread, but quickly dissipated and the panic resumed. The whole ordeal concluded only when the two parties reached a truce and the shorts were finally able to cover their position.\n\nEdit: [someone corrected me and NP actually went to an intraday high of $1000/share](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcs5v4/til_the_first_market_crash_at_the_nyse_was_caused/gs6jxro?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), corresponding to over $31K in today's dollars.

To infinity and beyond! \n\n \n\nI warn you, I will use some biggish words and confusing concepts here, but if you have grit you can trudge through and hopefully come to an understanding. I will try my utmost best to explain.\n\n \n\n# The Prequal. Condensed, Caramelized, and hopefully thoroughly informative. \n\n \n\n*Stock market speculation, which adds nothing to the wealth of any nation, is the inflationary activity preeminent, and it was the craze of America in the 1960's as it had been of Germany in 1921. A buoyantly rising stock market marks the opening stages of every monetary inflation. A sharply rising stock market proves to be an unfailing indicator of monetary inflation happening now, price inflation coming later, and a cheap boom probably occurring in the meantime. The stock market boom like the prosperity is founded on nothing but the inflation, and it collapses whenever the inflation stops either temporarily or permanently.* ***American investment in the 1960's****, with its* ***instant fortunes****, its* ***swamping volumes of turnover,*** *and its* ***absurdly high prices for incredibly useless ventures,*** *underwent a species of* ***insanity that was quite typical of inflationary booms****. In 1968, the last year of full bloom of the inflationary prosperity, the volume of trading on registered stock exchanges alone was $200 billion,* ***or more than four times what it had been in 1960****. The income of the securities industry increased from $1.2 billion to $4 billion. The exchanges were compelled by the overwhelming volume of trading to close for part of the week, as the German Bourse had done in 1921. Capital gains of individuals reached $36 billion, more than three times the levels prior to 1962, and more than the income generated by the entire American gas and electric utility industry and agricultural industry combined.*   \n\n \n\n\\-Dying of Money: Lessons of the Great German and American Inflations by Jens O. Parsson   -Chapter: The great prosperity of 1962-1968.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Can you guess how they acheieved this great prosperity? Well they definitely didn’t work for it, they printed it! Ring any bells? haha just kidding enjoy your stimmy check while its worth something.\n\n \n\n1 )  Swamping volumes of turnover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Retail trade activity](https://preview.redd.it/6ojtl3oxh5p61.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=1283864291130c429c84d66481197c10937bfad5)\n\n \n\n2) Asurdly high prices for incredibly useless ventures- RIDE (lordstone MOTORLESS motors). All the SPACS basically - (SPACS are blank check companies that list without any real income. It’s basically a quick ponzi scheme, and not a real investment).\n\n3) ***insanity that was quite typical of inflationary booms -*** please, what has NOT been insane about the last few years?\n\n4) instant fortunes - just look at all the meme stock millionaires (not hating- good DD went into some of them).\n\n \n\nSO. Father Burry, was now followed by Daddy Dalio (Ray Dalio) who basically just said (holding cash is a DUMB investment) -BTW this guy also called the crash in ‘08, albiet using a different method - see his book (template for big debt crises).\n\n \n\nSo Dalio just said that holding cash is dumb, and recommended getting diversified into different currencies, different stocks blah blah blah. *I kind of disagree.*\n\nProbably one of the best hedges for inflation would be to take out a fixed rate loan and buy a REALLY stable company’s stock that can cover the loan interest payments with its dividends that is also in a inflation hedged (consumer durable-like) business. #notinvestingadvice\n\nUnfortunately some of us are not lucky enough to have access to fixed rate loans. What do we do? \\*CRY\\*\n\nI did a bit (a lot- probably not enough) of research and when inflation ticks up, yields follow and everything pretty much suffers. Looking at the period from 1968 which is when “They great prosperity” ended and the “Great inflation” started it seems that even great inflation-hedged sectors suffer. These companies fair a bit better but they still hold cash from their sales, which inflation quickly burns away.\n\nSo what? - Gold? During the inflation from 1968 to 1980 gold performed pretty well. But during the ‘08 crisis gold and silver both first PLUMETTED and only then took off. *Why!?*  Because banks had to do some weird collateral gold lending to get more liquidity, so they sell gold in the market which pushes the price down. \n\nI think that the American financial sector is a lot more secure than it was compared to the 08 crisis, and the Fed is much more eager to step in and stop any sort of liquidity shortage so gold may not plunge as it did in ‘08, BUT if it does you know why. And you can HODL those gold bullions of yours.\n\n*Am I saying buy gold?* I am saying that it is pretty hard to hedge properly against inflation. I don’t believe in gold fundamentally, -I would rather do the fixed rate loan thing. But if its my only option, I will hold it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#  Inflation in February was low? Fasten your seatbelts inflation is going to rocket in April.\n\n \n\nLook here. Not here, down at this image.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Base inflation](https://preview.redd.it/g7ur070bi5p61.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ee3f57098089c2f10fa312e0fea653cb25b4a38)\n\nThat little yellow box says 256.389 this is the inflation “Index”. That’s April 2020. When we were in the midst of the shit with Corona. Inflation didn’t really budge because well, everything in the world was pretty fucked.\n\nMARCH and next month APRIL is when “new” inflation data comes out, and it will be based on this number.\n\n \n\nHere’s a quick example:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f123mpvji5p61.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a6f04a9a5878d64df612551f10cad7402c229bd\n\n \n\nSo this 1.676% is February’s ‘inflation rate’. They take the base - 2020 Feb inflation index (258.678) and then they take 2021 February inflation index (263.014) and they calculate they change in percent: (263.014/258.678 -1)\\*100 = CPI% = 1.7%\n\nOh wow, what’s March gonna look like? notice that the base (2020 march is very low \\~258.115) if inflation moves at the same rate from 2021 Jan to Feb 2021 (263.014-261.582 =1.432) we can get 263.0.14+1.432 = 264.432.\n\nThe inflation on that from last year March low base? (264.432/258.115 -1)\\*100 = 2.453% - Basically ALSO where the 10 year inflation expecations are. Do this to April, and shit gets real. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*This might be a bit difficult to understand, so to summarise -* Inflation is calculated based on previous years ‘base’. Last year (2020) the base was very low due to Covid crisis. This year, coupled with a bunch of stimmy checks, oil price increasing, and the opening of economies…Inflation may come out a LOT higher than expected. \n\nMarch won’t be too bad, but April’s data could hurt. \n\n# Mostly all stocks get hurt in inflation\n\nHow can you protect yourself against this POSSIBLE outcome? \n\n\\#notinvestingadvice\n\nThe fed currently says inflation will be ‘transient’ which means they understand we could see a big uptick in inflation, but they think it will go back down. The problem is that inflation is also very psychological, it can gain momentum just like a stock market rally.\n\nThere is also still the huge inflation potential gap (see last post on reddit) that needs to be equilibriumalised- not a word.\n\nAfter all this digging it seems like the best historical investment during these times is literally just gold. not even gold companies, just plain gold. It saddens me because I don’t neccesarily believe in gold as an investment in the long term-but hey, if it can save my money I don’t care.\n\nI guess we’ll see won’t we?\n\nTL: DR Gold probably best inflation hedged asset. April inflation data gonna be big!\n\nI write more here https://cookiesforbrainscd1.substack.com/subscribe?coupon=0237b307\n\nAlso here’s the book for those asking\n\nhttps://recision.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/jens-parsson-dying-of-money-24.pdf", "id": "mcv3w8", "created_utc": 1616668106.0, "score": 129, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 133, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "GME is immune to this during its short debacle.

The price of the ETF and the underlying shares only move in tandem *because someone is making it that way,* through the process called arbitrage. OP is suggesting that firms are engaging in operational short selling, which is specifically the suspension of the mechanism that ties the two prices.\n\nMaybe I should explain in very clear terms how the two are tied. I'm a firm that is managing IWM. As people buy IWM, the price of IWM goes up. In order to keep the price of IWM tracking the Russell 2000, I must create then sell more shares of IWM to the general public - this offers selling pressure and drives IWM prices down. I also use the proceeds of those sales to purchase companies that belong in the Russell 2000 - this gives buying pressure and drives those company prices up. So through this mechanism I bring IWM share prices down, Russell 2000 company prices up, until the two match again. I do the same in reverse when IWM drops too low in price compared to the Russell 2000 index - I buy shares of IWM back, and then sell shares of the underlying Russell 2000 companies that I own. **This is the mechanism by which the two prices are tied**. It requires active intervention by me, because I'm bound by my promise to the shareholders of the ETFs that I aim to track the index, and I do that by owning the shares of the underlying (otherwise I'll just take your money and run!)\n\nWhat OP is suggesting is that ***I sell shares without buying shares of the underlying company nor creating shares of the ETF***. This is operational shorting. This deflates IWM prices without doing anything to the underlying share prices. Why would you think the shares will drop in price at all? I'm not buying ***nor*** selling any shares of the underlying stock.\n\n>I might have to respectfully disagree. A firm that is on the verge of collapse may take on exactly this risk to stay solvent, if it means it can temporarily buy themselves out of the real issue, which is GME.\n\nI don't think anyone outside of WSB's conspiracy echo chamber actually believes Citadel, the HF or the clearing house, is on the verge of collapse.

I'm saying it's ridiculous, but that doesn't make it impossible, albeit improbable.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">By your exact logic, if one party, again by some crazy effort, manages to artificially suppress the price of IVM, wouldn't it cause other ETF market makers to sell shares as you describe, thus making that \"artificial\" price real?\n\nOperational shorting is also the very same mechanism by which you smooth out volatility. In other words, other firms can and do engage in the very same practice - they see volume flooding the market, they can buy the ETF without selling the underlying. In this manner it's actually much harder to short ETFs in order to disrupt the underlying, compared to straight shorting shares of the stock. You now have to fight two layers of market makers instead of just one to get the directional movement you want. It's a very inefficient manner to try to manipulate one stock.\n\n>You're claiming that it's impossible that a company would take on such risk, and I look at 2008 and don't understand why you have such confidence in that assumption.\n\n2008 wasn't caused by companies willingly taking on risk. It was caused by firms *drastically misjudging the level of risk they have incurred*. Just like hedgefunds shorting a stock to high levels was them incurring risks they did not consider before - you bet they've included that in their risk models now.\n\n>Again, why is this correlation the one that disproves the argument above? Why do they have to be so tightly tied? This entire thing is suggesting market manipulation, obviously it's not gonna be like OH LOOK IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THE TICKER GUYS.\n\nBecause OP literally circled on the ticker as evidence to support their thesis, so I'm refuting that specific piece of evidence they used lol.\n\n>You seem to be saying this is ridiculous, and therefore impossible. I'm saying it's ridiculous, but that doesn't make it impossible, albeit improbable.\n\nPerhaps we're just arguing semantics. It's possible for Citadel to give up its market-making role effective tomorrow. It doesn't mean it's not ridiculous. Likewise, it's possible for a firm to short ETF to try to affect movement, but it is so inefficient that it is basically guaranteed no one is doing it. It's like trying to claim that market makers are sending interns to buy consoles from other retailers, fabricating receipts and trying to return them to physical Gamestop locations in order to fuck with sales numbers.
