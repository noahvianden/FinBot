{"title": "List of books to read if you want to actually become knowledgeable about stocks and not stay a normie who doesn't know what they're doing", "selftext": "I'm about to hit you all with some knowledge, so get your big kid pants on! You should read these books in the order they are listed, because they stack up on top of each other and the lessons learned in one are needed to understand the lessons in the next.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor or registered securities analyst.*\n\n*Another disclaimer: If you do not know what exactly a stock is, how to buy or sell a stock or what dividends and earnings are, please look up some crash courses on YouTube or something before starting this list.*\n\n**Let's begin:**\n\n1. **The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle** \\- For those of you who don't know, John Bogle is one of the most important people to ever walk this planet when it comes to stocks and investing for the average person. He founded a little company called Vanguard (ever heard of it?) and he also invented the first index fund. In this book, Bogle gives us a primer on the classical approach to passive, conservative and long-haul investing. He goes into the statistics on how around 90% of mutual funds and most people can not beat the market. He makes it clear and simple that if you want to benefit from stock yields over time, you should deploy your money into index funds and sit back while earnings and dividends carry you to wealth. Many people (probably most people to be honest) can stop here and honestly do perfectly fine. The info in this book is all you need to build serious wealth. You will also understand the theory that picking individual stocks is usually a *losers game*. One of the reasons I believe you should read this book first is because the lessons you learn inside of it may show you that the rest of the books on this list may not even be worth reading! If you aren't content with boring old index fund investing though, you can read on..\n2. **One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch** \\- This book is dated but the principles written in its pages ring true to this day. Peter Lynch is considered one of the most successful mutual fund managers of all time. He achieved returns that beat the S&P 500 for over a decade straight for his investors in the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 70's and 80's. Yes I know I said most people can't beat the market by picking stocks, which is why those who can do it consistently are very special. In this book he teaches you about the tools and strategies he used to achieve those results. It's a great book because it doesn't get too crazy in terms of math and logic, and it's easy to understand.\n3. **Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman -** Now it's time to take a break and get into the *psychology* behind stock investing. Let's be honest, we're all pretty stupid and we all have internal biases. These two facts can be serious roadblocks to investing success. The sooner you admit that the better off you'll be. This book will help you understand how to separate your irrational mind from your rational mind when investing and it will make you better at objective decision making.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nOk, now at this point you have two paths you can take. After these three books you'll have a good grasp on the *theory* and *mindset* to making money in stocks, but you will be lacking the knowledge to actually ***pick individual stocks***. I mean how are you supposed to do that? Just buy whatever is trending on Reddit or what that idiot Jim Cramer on CNBC is talking about? Well as long as you still understand (from book #1) that the odds are against you when picking stocks, you can continue on one of two paths:\n\n**- The Value Investing Path** (Finding, analyzing and buying stocks that are \"undervalued\" and waiting for them to rise back to their fair market value, thus making a ton of money. This is what Warren Buffett does. It's also extremely difficult, boring and requires *rock-solid* emotional stability to ignore the ups and downs of the market.)\n\n\\-OR-\n\n**- The Traders Path** (Following market trends and sentiment to find opportunities that can make you money. I personally would not consider this path to be an \"investors\" path. This is a \"speculators\" path, and they are very different. However, you can make money speculating. This could involve shorting stocks or doing a bit of technical analysis, or maybe even playing with some derivatives like options. This path is also extremely difficult and will cause most people to lose *hours* of sleep each night sweating as they panic about their positions)\n\n\\--\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you chose **The Value Investing Path**, continue here:\n\n1. **All of the accounting books you can find** \\- You NEED to understand the fundamentals of accounting in order to value businesses. There is no getting around it. Yes, it's boring but if you find yourself enjoying it, you may have an inclination for this. Read everything you can on accounting. Learn to read balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. Learn about assets and liabilities. Do the practice assignments in the books and all of that!\n2. **The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham -** This is probably the most famous book on this list, and guess what, you're not going to understand ANY of it. This is the book that Warren Buffett swears by. In fact, Buffett studied with the author of this book when he was a lad. This book is the bible of value investing. Every successful investor knows this book. Within its pages you will learn about what to look for in the stock market, how to understand market behavior, what a good business looks like, how to find the *intrinsic value* of a company, and much much more. I recommend reading this book at least twice and researching everything inside it that you don't understand.\n3. **Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman -** Physical copies of this book are extremely expensive, so you're better off finding an online copy (shh don't tell). It's a bit more modern than the title above and it was written by a very successful value investor!\n4. **The Dhando Investor by Mohnish Pabrai** **-** Fantastic value investing book that offers some fresh ideas and new things to think about that are built on top of the previous books. Also written by a very successful investor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you chose **The Traders Path**, continue here:\n\n1. **Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre** \\- A classic that most traders are told to read at some point in their lives. It teaches so many valuable lessons of reflecting on your wins/losses, psychology of trading, knowing yourself and your weaknesses and more fun stuff. It's an old book but definitely worth reading.\n2. **Getting Started in Technical Analysis by Jack Schwager**  \\- If you don't know, technical analysis (TA) is the process of finding opportunity by analyzing the market indicators such as price, volume and trends. It ignores company fundamentals and is often seen as a type of voodoo that you either believe in or you don't. I personally am not a fan, however I do recognize the importance TA plays in understanding some stocks at certain times. I do believe that in combination with other metrics, TA can provide valuable insight. This book will teach you the basics.\n3. **Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb -** It is not possible to predict the stock market. This book will help you reconcile with that. It will help with understanding how randomness and a bit of luck ties into not only your trading, but your whole life. You will learn about risks and the consequences of taking them.\n4. **Market Wizards by Jack Schwager** \\- Another great book by the same author as #2 above. This is written in a sort of conversation-like format where the author interviews some of the most successfully traders of the time. There is tons of information in this book on all of the topics we've discussed since it's like you're reading a conversation between two people.\n\nI hope this post will help some of you.\n\n**Honorable mentions:**\n\n\\- The Snowball - Alice Schroeder\n\n\\- Security Analysis - Benjamin Graham and David Dodd\n\n\\- A Random Walk Down Wall Street - Burton Malkiel\n\n\\- The Alchemy of Finance - George Soros\n\n\\- The Big Short - Michael Lewis\n\n\\- Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits - Philip Fisher\n\n\\- Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond - Bruce Greenwald", "id": "m85sp6", "created_utc": 1616116387.0, "score": 9578, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 510, "comments": [{"body": "Hmmm did not see investing for dummies on this list...", "score": 238, "replies": [{"body": "r/wallstreetbets has that covered", "score": 155, "replies": [{"body": "You’re thinking of investing by dummies.", "score": 28, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Maybe there are a few versions of it but mine in german isnt really good.

They can definitely help with getting into right mindset but is not a “Golden Egg” when it comes to profitability. If anything stick to 2-3 books and master them. \n\nIt’s also important to understand that the foundation of investing or trading isn’t even profits, it’s risk management, you need to keep it before you can grow it. \n\nLearn how to apply what’s known as “second-order thinking” and build a habit of thinking in probabilities is also key. \n\nOther than that, experience and trial and error is all you really need. \n\nSource: MBA in Finance, work as a junior equity research analyst valuing stocks all day. \n\nMost of my our investment strategies come from experience asides from the basic applications learned during my core classes in school and from pursuing the CFA which teaches you concepts relative to portfolio management, investment analysis and asset allocation.\n\nI don’t think anyone at my work, has ever read a stock book. Because again, strategies and investment styles are all relative to ones investment objectives, financial situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon etc. which is different for each individual. \n\nThe author maybe risk seeking but you’re risk averse. They may have large amounts of capital to take on added risk while you only have $1k to invest. \n\nOther knowledge from classes were pretty much not applied unless you wanted to go into Corporate Finance or Investment Banking. \n\nI also swing trade as a hobby on the side, primarily in FX (currencies) as well as options (only long positions) and commodities; Crude oil CFD’s and Gold ETF’s. \n\nI make a pretty decent compensation from my full time job + performance bonuses, but ironically, there are some months when I make more from swing-trading. \n\nSuccess rate: 52%. \n\nMost hedge fund managers are usually 60 - 65% and that’s really really good. Don’t believe in the 80% stock picking  guru hype. \n\nIt’s all about having bigger winners that offset losses (4 trades, 2 $500 losses, but 2 1k gains) still means you’re still net ‘Green’ at the end of the month/year. \n\nand not placing ‘crap trades’ and again risk management, (ex. Taking the month off to rest when you hit 20% losses and apply diff strategies, DCA, DRIPS, scaling in and scaling out, pyramiding , sector rotation or market timing etc.) \n\nRemember, don’t get caught up with FOMO, being flat is also a position. If you don’t know why you’re investing and don’t have a clear game plan, wait until you do before entering positions. \n\nOther then that, it’s a gamble play. \n\nLastly, Fundamentals.. learn how political, economical and social catalysts affect the economy, the market and most importantly, your investment.\n\nFor example, the inter-relationship of how stocks, bond prices, commodities and currencies affect each other and ultimately the market and economy.", "score": 238, "replies": [{"body": "Everyone learns differently.

For reference, the Vanguard S&P 500 index debuted in 1976. \n\nArthur Lipper petitioned the SEC to start an index tracking the DJIA way back in 1968 or '69, but it never got off the ground. The idea of index funds had been floating around for a few years at this point based on Eugene Fama's research from the University of Chicago, and had been boosted by Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson (among others) who said the typical mutual fund in the 1960s was a ripoff and people would be better served with passive management tracking an average market return. \n\nJeremy Grantham started an index fund for the public a few years later (1971) but it was such a radical idea he didn't have any customers for a while, not until 1973 or '74. Also starting in 1971, John McQuown managed part of a pension with an index fund while he worked at a Wells Fargo branch in San Fransisco. \n\nRex Sinquefield tracked the S&P 500 at a Chicago bank starting in 1973, open to the general public, and had billions of dollars under management after a few years. Sinquefild and McQuown both went on to work at Dimenaional Fund Advisors, started by U of Chicago alumni, whose oldest fund dates to 1981. \n\nSo while Boggle certainly desrves a lot of credit for promoting index funds, he simply did not invent them nor was he the first to sell them. the last time I checked, Dimensional Funds was still a top-10 American firm by assets under management. but they're not as well know as other firms, always done little or no advertising/promotion, preferring to let like-minded clients find them rather than seek them out. \n\nFor sources see Justin Fox's The Myth of the Rational Market, and this: https://www.stlmag.com/The-Return-of-the-King/\n\ngreat list, BTW.

{"title": "I put $500 into the market for the first time yesterday. Tell me how garbage my positions/logic are.", "selftext": "EDIT: While I truly appreciate the Reddit awards, I hope that award and any which may follow came from free Reddit coins, and I would encourage anyone who wants to spend real money on an award for this post to instead either spend it on yourself or give it to someone who needs it in a manner in which they would be able to use it.   \n\n**Thank you** to all of you, today and in past days, who have given me advice on this subreddit. I truly feel as though I've found a home in terms of where I need to go for advice/community information/input. You can't learn if you don't put yourself out there, and I've done just that today, and the information I've gained is invaluable. Thanks again.  \n\nEDIT2: Yes, I am aware now that I'm too far spread out. We're fixing that.  \n\n__________  \n\nHey y'all. So I'm basically brand new to investing - I've dicked around on Robinhood before years ago, but never anything serious. I grew up in poverty and am only just finding my way out, so investment is still quite new but incredibly exciting to me.  \n\nYesterday, I took $500 and put it into the market. Here's what I bought. I plan on holding all pretty much until it's either time to retire or until daddy's gotta make a purchase. My logic behind choosing tickers was as follows:  \n\n1) The index is too important to miss, and as I've said elsewhere, a 14% annual return over a lifetime feels much better than jumping off a cliff. **The indexes I chose are FTEC, QQQ, SCHA, SPY, VOO, VGT, and VUG.**   \n\n2)Dividends are probably the most important aspect of a long term single stock hold IMO, closely followed by overall stability/growth projections. You don't need much inherent growth with dividend stocks, they just can't dip too far or else you're breaking even. Even if the stock itself stays even, you'll still compound your way ahead. **The dividend paying stocks I chose are AMCR, HBAN, HPE, KEY, PEP, T, and TM.** PEP and TM could arguably fall under other categories, but they both pay respectable dividends and are staple companies which will likely exist until the end of the current world, so they're on the list.    \n\n-And finally, I chose one stock that I consider to be a knock off version of a growth stock. It has the growth potential, but it also has the dividend to boot, and really I'm looking at **TROW** and trying to find something wrong with the stock, but I can't. So TROW it is.  \n\nTo preemptively answer some questions:  \n\n-I diversified within ETFs for two reasons; first, because it means more money overall within the indexes, and second because they'll all perform decently enough, but it's likely one or two might outperform the others, and I want in on those.  \n\n-I chose AMCR because it's been rock steady for as long as the Earth has been round, and the dividend is unreal. I chose T for similar reasons, although T also falls under \"buy what you use\" in my case.  \n\n-To me, HPE was the biggest \"risk\" in this portfolio, just because there's not a whole lot of evidence to suggest that it will grow drastically from its current status. However, again, HPE isn't going anywhere any time soon, it's recovering somewhat decently from the pandemic crash, and the dividend is still there. As long as I don't lose ~15% or more on price over the long term, I should still be in good shape.  \n\nSo yeah. I sure feel like a monkey making and describing these decisions, but I wonder how bad or good these decisions actually are. Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED talk.  \n\nEDIT: In the brief time this has been up I've learned quite a bit more, which is honestly typical /r/stocks (thanks). What I'm learning is that I need to pay a little closer attention to what exactly each ETF follows, and that I possibly over-diversified. Apparently I'm still trading with technically unsettled funds, so once everything settles I'll look at making some corrective decisions.

There were over 110,000 such call option contracts open yesterday - and only a small percentage was closed (sold) in the past few days. If we close around $670-$680 then a net ~10 million TSLA shares will be distributed from MMs to the winners (~5 million of which at very low strikes) - not bad. Congratulations to the LEAP HODLers who bought in 2019 and 2020.\n- There's 533,000 call options (!) and 945,000 put options (!!) expiring this week.\n- \"Delta balance\" is $680-$690 - interestingly it has not dropped significantly yesterday.\n- Options writers (MMs mostly) would strongly prefer TSLA close below $700 today, which appears to be a likely outcome given yesterday's close.\n- There's likely going to be bigger resistance against dropping below $650, or going above $700.\n- Large delta-hedging forces are not expected until $750-$800 or below $600 levels - both of which seem unlikely today.\n- I.e. all other things equal (which they rarely are ...) I'd expect relatively low volume 'pinning' today, somewhere around $680.\n- During the past 3 days of TSLA volatility IV was elevated and neither calls nor puts were increased in sufficient numbers to really change the forces IMO.

To be honest, I never really keep cars outside of their warranty periods and normally upgrade right around that time. Knowing battery issues outside of warranty (as rare as they seem to be) would be very expensive, it's likely I will do the same with my model 3\n\nI have a fairly early build model 3 so I've had some of the notorious rattles and such that you'd see mentioned on these forums.. most of which have been addressed in new builds to my knowledge. Comparing interior materials I would say the Lexus (this was fairly entry level - IS300 FSport), I'd say the interior appeared nicer with the red leather seats versus the tesla \"vegan\" leather. You can tell the synthetic \"leather\" that tesla uses is just that, synthetic. That being said, I find it comfier than my Lexus..\n\nFor the rest of the interior id say it's difficult to compare. The Lexus had a ton of buttons and switches, the model 3 is entirely opposite. Being a minimalist myself, I love the model 3 interior. Fits my lifestyle perfectly. That being said, there is clearly a group on the other side of the fence that would prefer more buttons and less touch screen controls\n\nMy overall review between the two that I had (and again, this is an early model 3) would be if you want great \"build quality\" and something considered more \"luxury\", but don't care about fuel costs then the Lexus wins. If you want something more fun to drive, cheaper in the long run, certainly more advanced on the tech side, absolutely the tesla.

It feels a little bit like Señor Powell is telling everyone to stay calm but some people see the inflation asteroid coming and are panicking. \n\nFor those that don’t know why this matters, let me explain. There are two types of securities that get absolutely fucked in these scenarios. High growth securities (courtesy of the DCF calculation of share price) and high P/E multiple securities. If yield rates shoot up in the next few days (and they very well might) there will be massive reallocation of the big fundies to more secure and stable securities (so as to not spook their clients by massive losses). There are a few strategies that you can take to bet on this market behavior. \n\n1. Take the approach of OP and purchase puts of the given securities they listed\n\n2. Position yourself in safer, low P/E multiple, securities or indices. By doing so you will essentially get the first in line benefit before everyone else shows up.\n\nEither way, the funds will do their best to keep their clients capital safe and for us retail investors, it is not unreasonable to make bets to obtain some fat gains off of this market behavior. \n\nCaveat: I am not a financial advisor.

{"title": "NrdRage's Friday DD: The absolute shittiest company I'll review. And if you aren't a rapper, an athlete, or a Duke brother, you never even think of their product. But you can still make money. ($RYCEY)", "selftext": "Hi all, NrdRage  here. Just FYI, today's DD was going to be $RKUNY, but they had a  massive pop earlier this week, and the trade is no longer interesting in  the short term.  Then I thought $VWAGY, but the same thing happened on Wednesday. So instead, I give you this flaming bag of dogshit  instead.\n\nWhat if I told you that you had the opportunity to invest in a company that has been around since 1906.  And what if I told you that this company, which has been around for 115  years, loses spectacularly large amounts of money - in fact, only  having positive earnings in two quarters since 2018? Oh, and they make  amazingly bad products which are shockingly unreliable, to boot?  Products that you can't afford and will never own? And that they've  diluted themselves to 8.37 BILLION shares of stock, absolutely none of  which is really held by company insiders who have an opportunity to bet  on themselves? Pretty amazing, right?\n\nLet's talk about Rolls-Royce ($RYCEY), cause you're probably gonna buy some by the time this is over.\n\n# Let's get this shitshow started, shall we?\n\nSo  all of you know them from their ridiculously expensive vehicles, which I  wouldn't take over a Honda if the trip mattered because they break down  so often. But consumer automotives  isn't really where they \"make\" their money - to use the term very  loosely. As a matter of fact, this company doesn't even make those  pieces of shit anymore - BMW does. No, these fucktards have 4 different  divisions: Civil aeronautics (50% of their revenue), Defense systems  (25%), marine and aeronautic power systems (20%), and IT-pee aeronautics  (uhhhh, math for smoothbrain).  In short, they're a defense contractor who also bolts on pretty  unreliable engines onto passenger jets to try and get you to Vegas as  you try to spend 2 days pretending  you're not some basic bitch who's gone from raging against the machine  to raging against the washing machine. Except you're not nearly as hot  as Stacy's mom.\n\n# Pretend  I'm saying shit about their story and any unique aspects about them or  that anything they do is remotely interesting here. They don't, so I'm  not going to try to make it happen, but usually this is where I put  that. Moving on....\n\n# Looking under the hood...or inside the cowling, as it were.\n\nThe  financials of this company are, frankly, abominably bad. They lost over  7 billion dollars last year. They operate at a negative-40% profit  margin. They have less than 5 billion dollars in the bank. In the immortal words of Spose, this company has the swagger of a cripple.  Demand for  jet engines completely dried up by the time Nancy Pelosi was trying to  get you to go to Chinatown to celebrate Chairman Mao during CNY last  year, and it only got worse the longer this whole virus thing dragged  on. No flights not only means  no planes and no demand for engines but, more importantly, no demand  for expensive maintenance contracts to keep those engines from blowing  up. 50% of their revenue comes from consumer air travel. Their forward guidance was some of the worst damp-handed beta cuckery I've heard in a long time.  They've already  come out and said they'll be LUCKY if they generate 50% of the revenue  they generated pre pandemic even after we get back to normal because of  the obliteration of business travel. They've diluted themselves into  oblivion, so they have to borrow money rather than raise it. And  countries not named United States of America have largely decided to  make up for their deficits in revenue as a result of completely  obliterating their economies by reducing spend in the military space, so  the Royal Navy ain't  exactly buying a bunch of their engines, either. The only thing less  sexy about this company is your wife in a negligee. Seriously, I get  that even ugly girls need love, but can't you put a bag over her head or  something? And one for your whole body too, you fat fuck. Oh, and did I  mention that they make mostly widebody engines in a world in which most  airplanes are going narrow body? So there's that.\n\nMore  importantly, even though the vast majority of the industry of the world  has kind of recovered their stock prices, RYCEY is presently at a  whopping $1.76, down from their pre-virus highs of about 12.50\n\n# This is a joke, right? You're fucking clowning us to see how much you can get away with, aren't you you sick fuck?\n\nNot  even remotely a joke. I mean, you are a clown, but I'm not clowning  you. I'm dead serious. Buying this company is a good idea.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause  the saving grace their shitty products have is that their competition  ($GE, Pratt & Whitney - aka $RTX) make an even SHITTIER product.  P&W, in particular, has gotten under the microscope recently because  the 4077 engines they slapped on UAL's 777's started falling apart.  Remember this?\n\n[Look out below!](https://preview.redd.it/7m9slpqjwzn61.jpg?width=301&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca799f0bbb649cf9c5b4448e52fe935994d35292)\n\n$RYCEY  might be able to start putting their products on those beasts. $GE  slaps a GE90 on that same plane and, though thankfully none of those  have exploded yet (well, I mean, except for that one that got shot with a  rocket near Russia...but I digress...well, and I'm sure that Malaysian one that is chilling with Amelia Earhart probably exploded on impact), they're a maintenance headache.  On and on down the line we go, they've all got their quirks. Rolls, for  their credit, hangs its hat on their Trent 1000 engine, which is what  keeps the Dreamliners  in the air. Course, they're famous for fatigue cracking and have to be  inspected every 80 flights (down from an average of about 200 for the  industry) because they're so unreliable. Their one home run engine got  slapped on the A380, and then that whole plane got canceled like it had made an at-the-time milquetoast insensitive Tweet 15 years ago even though  it's the best bird in the sky.\n\nThis  is all a long way of saying they all have issues, but RR has slightly  fewer issues. Thankfully for them, airlines, not wanting to be sued, are  willing to pay up lots of money for service agreements, and that makes  up an insane amount of their revenue. You know, when the planes are  flying. One positive thing they have going for them is the A350 is going  to exclusively be using their engines, so they've got that going for  them. Matter of fact, they just recently locked down an exclusive  agreement to be the provider of that bird's engines until 2030 at the  earliest, which is a huge win. Plus it gives them time to figure out why their Ultrafan engines (which are supposed to replace the Trents) are such miserable piles of garbage.\n\n# So why are they a good investment (and price targets)?\n\nWell,  in practicality, they're not really, but in a market that is strongly  indicating it's way overbought, this is one of the very few companies  that hasn't had its turn at the recovery wheel on the stonk markets. With a 52 week  low of 1.31, they're presently only sitting about 40 cents off that  mark, and most of that has happened in the last couple of weeks. We've  seen the airline stocks start to fly recently, and $BA has been on an  absolute tear, so logically speaking, $RYCEY is kind of next soyboy up. Quick, name 5 stocks trading anywhere near their 52 week lows? Do I think they're going to get back to their pre-virus valuation of 12-16 a share? Fuuuuuck  no. They're really badly managed and air travel is forever changed,  which is going to really put a dent in their forward revenues\n\nBUT....there's  not a doubt in my mind that they're going to see $3.40 in the VERY near future, $4 in the slightly near future and I would be positively shocked if they aren't at 8 by the end  of the year, which means you can catch a 4-bagger on these guys while  you laugh about how the absolute worst company in your portfolio is, on a  share basis, one of your best performers. Because laughing about that  is easier than crying about how your wife's boyfriend recently informed  you that he was upgrading to a 3.\n\nStupidly, my price targets are actually below that of most analysts, and those guys always undersell.\n\n# Technical analysis:\n\nThere  is none! All my charts were for $RKUNY, and I'm not going to spend 20  minutes creating charts showing this thing's price action, especially  since the charts are ugly as fuck due to the fact that the stock only  moves in increments of fractional pennies in spite of having a 14 billion dollar market cap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK ok, ONE chart.  This is a daily going back to last July.  Teal is the XMA and the dark blue line is the SMA. The nude line is a 200 SMA and not relevant to this discussion.  You can see it recovered a little (off chart) and then when \"wave 2\" hit, fell off a cliff again, and then gapped down hard at the end of November.  Since that point, it has largely been consolidating, but has tested the 1.31 low no fewer than 10 times, holding that support each time.  Since mid February, it's been on a slow but steady climb to fill that gap created in November at 3.40.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ba4ts33xwzn61.jpg?width=1461&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d376790877057d56fd2b0e97380d3acd39083a6\n\n# How do you play it?\n\nSimple: SHARES! It's the only way you CAN play it, because there's no options chain for this dog.\n\nYa  know, the longer I write this, the more it seems like I'm kind of  phoning this one in, but given the subject matter, I think that's  entirely appropriate. If you're asking yourself why, well, this one is  about to start making its climb upwards as more people start packing  into planes. Plus, until this whole Gamestop thing is over with, those fucking apes keep downvoting anything that's not Gamestop.\n\n# So, to summarize:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Shitty company....\n* with even shittier competitors\n* Didn't get to take part in the economic recovery in the markets; still trading a lot closer to 52 week lows than highs\n* Has some guaranteed gubmint money, and is doing Playstation-like exclusives with certain planes for their engines\n* Shares only\n* Gives you the bragging rights of saying you're such a good investor that you made money on the dollar general of the Aerospace world\n\n# Position Disclaimers:\n\n\\-500,000  shares at $1.72. Up until very recently, I was actually underwater on  this one (Edit:  As of this morning, I'm flat on it again). It dropped 11 cents yesterday and that was actually  significant enough to where it put a huge dent in the price. I have  absolutely no intention of buying more. This position represents less  than 1% of my fun money portfolio, so I'm not terribly interested in it,  but I know it's going to make me money, and that's all I care about.\n\nAll my love\n\n\\-Chad Dickens", "id": "m8inij", "created_utc": 1616164699.0, "score": 490, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "Your \"fun money\" is $86m?", "score": 118, "replies": [{"body": "Lol yeah we’re lucky to get his insights.

At the peak we were a deeply problematic company, the market figured that out, and stock started tanking well before COVID.\n\nMy personal price target is $10, 3-5 years out depending on several factors. Recovery of the civil aerospace market is a big one. If people start flying in 2019 numbers sooner than expected, that could give the stock a pretty nice bump, but we would still have to prove to the market that we've fixed the problems that tanked the stock in the first place (profit margin too low, bad free cash flow, big chunk of revenue coming from older products reaching end of life). There are two big DOD contract awards coming up this year and next that could easily do that for us. Looking at it from the inside, we've fixed those issues. Warren East's turnaround isn't fluff, we're an infinitely better company than we ever were at any point in the last 13 years I've worked directly or indirectly for RR.\n\n2022 is a make or break year, though. If a slow civil aero recovery or any other issue prevents us from recovering enough to restructure our debt, the stock could easily tank even farther. On the other hand, if we can restructure, and the 2021 contact awards go well, I could see $4 happening in 2022. In an ideal scenario where there's fast recovery, 2021 and 2022 contract wins, and we start hitting our pre covid free cash flow goals, we vould spike even higher.

Portfolio rebalancing goes into next week meaning no decision or play is safe, and you’re going to wild swings like this into early April. \nL\n\n4) **Chew on this over the weekend**: DOWs couple flashes of green this week were largely because of the Suez shit , and oil held the index afloat.

Portfolio rebalancing this go round (end of each quarter) also includes momentum quants readjusting gains from last year. Massive tech profit dumping, inflow into bonds now that they’re rising and value which is obvious. This is not a blip or a cute dip, this is the volatility of a year of running stocks being unwound and the aftermath. \n\n**What is NOT OBVIOUS is this sorta crazy thing I discovered last night that will greatly affect energy holdings**. I’ve emailed a couple corporate offices and am placing some phone calls today to get some last details.

F is closing factories and even if they don’t GM is taking on sympathy. Averaging down with FB profits (FB WAS A BEAST) makes me feel better but I’m not too confident in AH action. \n\nWill see if GM makes a statement or something \n\n****\n\n**Pre-close/ AH 3/22**\n\nTake a look [shit happening tomorrow](https://www.spotrambo.com/), a lot of events. I’m intrigued by INTC even though my chip prediction already ran heavy. \n\nMy faith in GM may pay off. Looks like the culprit was chip shortage issues this morning— could’ve been smooth without that wrench. \n\nDOCU FINALLY waking up heading into their Wednesday RAMBO, I want more though from them considering NASDAQ’s roaring today\n\n****\n\n**3/22 GM event update**\n\nI liked it and the market is warming up— lots of talk about partnership and even battery customization. With the event on Thursday and intraday action slowly turning around, I’m still bullish and will hold. Particularly because my average down paid off well. \n\n**3/22 9 am update**\n\nTaking some of my considerable FB profits to average down (more) on GM\n\n**3/22 AM UPDATE**\n\nFine and pleased with everything else, but seeing no real reason for the GM dump no matter what I search. \n\nIf they don’t announce a partnership with TSLA or something in the next hour my gf is gonna fucking kill me when she wakes up...as we pack for the shelter. 😭 \n\n**3/21 Weekend Update**\n\n1) **Noticed**: a lot of activity on PTON I noticed while reviewing Friday (wrote this week on Thursday)\n\n2) **GM**: they added two more events in the next like 8 days to their investor relations page. These and other events for the week have been thrown up on the new look spotrambo.com\n\n3) **don’t just dive in to stuff** at open tomorrow if you’re not feeling it, could be a weird week. An hour wait rule. \n\n**One more 3/19 Update:**\n\nPeople are asking what I mean when I say RAMBO. I created www.spotrambo.com (with the help of my new BFF 🧠) which has a decent explainer and I’ll be putting some more up over the weekend, and a big batch Sunday. \n\n**Update 3/19 mid day:**\n\nForgot I keep seeing crazy OTM calls for PENN. [This one just came through today in fact](https://i.imgur.com/tTtzJNh.jpg) \n\n****\n\nI realized the entire problem with last week's edition was that I forgot the fucking rocket emojis.  Never again. 🚀 🚀 🚀 \n\nDoing this one early because your boy is heated.  To be fair, I **was pretty explicit about having low confidence in plays this week due to FOMC flukiness**--and that this was probably the closest I come to sitting shit out without sitting shit out--but still disappointed.  I don't like to let the people down!\n\n**Word of caution**🐻 : Next week is **post-quad witching**, a historically volatile week for stocks.  For that reason I am still bagholding some VXX, choosing entries with caution, and keeping plenty of dry powder.  I don't care what Jerome says about inflation, this is not face-first YOLO time.\n\n****\n\n**Last week’s baggers:** Although the Tier 1 beating got most of the attention, **GPRO CS DB AAPL** all printed.  **VXX** on a ventilator but still (barely) in the game as of this writing.\n\n**Last week’s lessons:** VIX is too unpredictable--SPY puts are the way if you have a bearish sentiment.  Also, **if you have as little confidence as I said I had last week, just sit it out**--there's no shame in kicking back. \n\n****\n\n**Plays with RAMBO**\n\n[GM](https://i.imgur.com/pLLrckZ.jpg) & 3/22 [Conference Event](https://i.imgur.com/Y8i7aE7.jpg) 🚀 🚀 \n\nSUPER consistent OTM call buying over the past two weeks.  Unsure if this RAMBO on Monday is necessarily THE catalyst but it's worth finding out.  Either way, you're rolling with a ticker that has seen some of the most frenzied UOA for a boomer stock this quarter.  It couldn't hold above 60 after the first run, so anything lower than that may be worth getting in to see if it crosses and if 60 becomes support after the event Monday.\n\nBUT WAIT! [There’s more....](https://i.imgur.com/zTXu6MU.jpg)\n\n[DOCU](https://i.imgur.com/SWtoqGP.jpg) 🚀 🚀 \n\nDOCU has an investor day coming up with that peculiar post-ER timing that screams \"pump\".  They've really slid since ER, and are floating around that nice, easy benchmark 200 number.  Look to grab if it touches or dips below, and hold through the RAMBO.  This got me on board:\n\n>Consider this: 18 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies, 10 of the top 15 global financial services companies and seven of the top 10 global tech companies all utilize DocuSign’s technology. In addition, 800 federal, state and local government agencies utilize the company’s platform.\n\nImagine them talking about that kinda shit for hours on end during an INVESTOR DAY.  Yum.\n\n🐻: there is put buying around DOCU right now, could be hedging, could likely be during this week’s sell offs people dropped, but it’s there and subject to interpretation \n\n****\n\n**Play, non-RAMBO**\n\n[FB](https://i.imgur.com/Yn7IHJh.jpg) 🚀 🚀 \nThese two intriguing FB bets stood out to me as more than coincidental or tech flow.  Short dated, significantly outside the money, and one of them on the ask-side (a bullish sign).  I'm going to keep an eye on tech flow to ensure I like it, then probably test out a 4/9 290.  [Also, Zuckerberg is talking shit now like iOS priacy updates won't be the death of him.](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/18/zuckerberg-facebook-may-be-in-stronger-position-after-apple-ios-14.html)\n\n****\n\n**Repeated call buying on both Unusual Whales and Unusual Options Activity that mean something to me but aren’t quite Tier 1:**\n\n[VIAC](https://i.imgur.com/6Qw7H1r.jpg) 🚀 \n[CCJ](https://i.imgur.com/cRfL0e8.jpg) 🚀 \n\nLots of bearish hedge activity on each of these too, which can be a good sign, but also may mean the expected catalyst is fragile. \n\n****\n\n**Sector trends in whale bets/UOA I’ve picked up that mean something to me:**\n\n1) **Chips**: It could be SEMICON, but all chip manufacturers are beginning to have more and more otm bets placed on them.

I'd venture that infrastructure is about to become a crucial frontier in the post-stimmy administration and now is the time to hop in.

{"title": "SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON BORROW AVAILABILITY IN GME", "selftext": "There has been a lot of very inaccurate and false information being posted about the borrow availability in GME shares. The most common one is that IBorrowdesk (IBKR) is reflective of the total availability of borrow in the marketplace. THIS IS FALSE!!!  iBorrowdesk as well as most other offerings of the same sort from Fido, Schwab etc mostly just show the availability of shares on their platform at that moment in time. Ironically this means the more their clients buy GME on margin the more borrow availability there will be. \n\nTHE REAL BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. \n\nIn its most basic form, the largest holders of securities are also the largest lenders of securities. Hate to break it to y’all but there are a ton of institutional holders of this stock. When an institution such as pension fund, mutual fund insurance company buys GME ( or any other stock for that matter) those shares are held at their custodian. A Custody bank such as JPM, Citi, State Street, BONY aggregates these assets and if the pension fund is in their lending program (most are) those shares are lent to broker dealers. The large broker dealers all have Prime Brokerage groups that custody assets for Hedge Funds. One of the main functions of a Prime Broker is to lend stock to Hedge Funds to short. BDs act as the middle man between the Custody bank and the hedge fund. How does a PB know where to borrow GME you ask?  Easy, the Custody banks broadcast ALL of their stocks available for lending to Broker Dealers. The PBs aggregate this borrow availability from all of the Custody banks and broadcast this information to Hedge Funds. Included in this aggregation would be any positions that are available at the PB from their long clients who purchases those securities on margin. So each day every PB in the market aggregates all of the borrow availability they have access to and broadcasts it to HFS to short. Here’s the rub. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE  GENERAL PUBLIC!!!!!  Securities lending or stock loan is a purposely OPAQUE market. This allows the PBs to keep control over who gets borrow and at what cost.  On that topic of Cost, given that the general public does not have the same access to this information, the COST to  borrow a security can often be a more accurate reflection on borrow availability. Case in point: When GME first squeezed in late January there was ZERO borrow available to short. As such the cost to borrow the security went as high as 200%. Think about that. That high cost is untenable and impossible for a HF to stay short for very long. Obviously they covered a load of stock and the borrow cost came in and availability went back up. \n\nEVERY BD(PB)’s ABILITY TO BORROW STOCK IS DIFFERENT \n\nThink of hard to borrow securities like GME as an allocation of shares in IPO process. Not anyone can rock up and get an allocation of an IPO. The same is true of an allocation of stock borrow on a hard to borrow or “special” security like GME. The Custody bank will allocate limited shares of a hard to borrow to those borrowers (BD&PBs) that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. It stands to reason that the largest clients of the custody banks are the largest PBS that have enormous borrow demand. Thus BONY will lend GME to a GS or JPM before lending it to IBKR or Fido (both with very small PB groups). You with me so far???  So let’s look at the loan side of that transaction. BONY lends GME to GS. Now GS will lend that scarce resource of GME borrow to HF clients that pay them the most revenue throughout the year. Thus GS is more likely to lend GME in this scenario to a Citadel(I know I know), Bridgewater or DE Shaw vs a small 50mmAUM hedge fund. \n\nCONTROL AND AGGREGATION OF BORROW MARKET AVAILABILITY. \n\nAlthough the transparency into stock borrow availability is non existent for individual investors it is vastly different and very transparent to stock borrow participants (CUSTODY BANKS, BD/PBs). The largest stock loan participants have created an industry utility they control that aggregates each participants borrow availability. They submit total shares available for borrow by firm aggregate it all and distribute back to its participants ONLY!!!  So a stock loan trader at one of these firms can simply type in a ticker and see pretty much the entirety of the stock borrow availability as well as the cost!!! Because the BD/PBs & Custidy banks control this information they reveal only a subset to non participants such as the actual long holder (Pension plan, Mutual fund) and Hedge Funds. This is a main reason why large HFs have multiple PBs. Because everyone’s stock borrow capability is different, they want access to as many avenues to borrow stock as possible. \n\nThe only way for an individual to anywhere close to an accurate number of borrow availability would be to call each of the large PBs and ask for the info. Obviously this is not going to happen. I happen to know several stock loan participants very well and can tell you that there are MILLIONS OF SHARES OF GME TO BORROW RIGHT NOW AND FOR THE PAST MONTH!!!!!  \n\nGiven that, the best indicator of whether or not there is a lot of borrow is the COST to borrow which is more readily available through your BD. Even if they aren’t showing you availability they probably still show the cost to borrow. Generally speaking, any cost to borrow below 10% implies there is borrow available. At .5% it is virtually a LIQUID or “GC” (general collateral) borrow. A further reference point would be RKT which squeezed several weeks ago. There was Very little to no borrow availability as evidenced by its 30% borrow cost at the time. \n\nDon’t even get me started on the availability of shares for retail to short. I generally DO NOT recommend retail investors going short. It is a sure fire way to go broke. That said even though your broker may show you ZERO borrow to go short, I GUARANTEE they are giving availability to their HF clients.   \n\nHope that helps. It does feel fairly rigged at times given the lack of borrow market transparency. I just hate to think individuals are drawing the wrong conclusions because iBorrow or their BD is showing no borrow. In the case of GME this has been the case all day today.

When a bulk of these $200 call options were written, GME wasn't believed to hit/maintain levels that would put them ITM, and delta hedging was within their budget. Has that changed now that the price skyrocketed beyond their expectations?\n\nFor example, a 4/16 $300 call has a delta now of 0.44. If I were to short that, I'd wanna buy 44 shares to be delta neutral, right? But if two weeks from now, that delta jumps to 0.88, I'd have to buy another 44 shares to stay delta neutral. At normal GME prices, this would be doable for MM, but it's more of a stretch when the price is exorbitantly higher than their expectations. At what point do they skip delta hedging and instead try to keep the price down so that those options don't go ITM? Instead of hedging based around the delta, they try to keep the delta down itself? \n\nWhat if instead of dumping a ton of cash into GME that they may not need (cash they'd get from closing other positions, as seen by negative beta), they hedge by keeping price low? \n\nThat all aside, I'm assuming they do delta hedging differently than the simple math I did? Cuz if so, 3/19 $200c closed with a delta of 0.5195 and OI of 3593. Even if they were delta neutral, they'd only have 51.95 shares/option. Assume every call option contract writer did that, and they'd have to buy ~173k shares to make up their shortfall.\n\nPlz help me grow a wrinkle here", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "So they hedge the whole time. Literally their computers are using models to “dynamically hedge” with almost ever penny move in the stock. \nYou buy a $300 4/16 call, dealer buys 44 shares. Monday the stock goes up to $210, they buy another share. Tuesday it goes up to $240 they’re buying more shares. \nThey’re *losing* money on their short call but they’re *making money* on their long shares. That’s delta neutral. \n\nIf this sounds like the dealers always lose money... remember for GME they are “charging”exorbitant prices. That $300 call has an implied volatility of 278% which is really expensive in option land. The “only way” they lose money is if realized volatility is higher than 278%. If it’s lower they’ll make money (Ie even if stock goes to $350 they won’t necessarily lose money)\n\nThey are short *volatility* they aren’t short or long the stock price. \n\nAs for the $200 call... I wrote an addendum to the post but yes, right before 4 PM the ATM options have a delta of just around 50%. A lot of times when you see that kind of sharp movement right before the close it’s dealers capitulating and getting 100% hedged because at 4 pM the delta actually goes to 100% for that $200 call.

Other than the intuitive logic we/you worked through, do we have some tangible way of knowing whether they did? Negative beta seems to suggest it, right? A more calculated version of \"Oh fuck, GME went up again. Sell off another couple AAPL!\" \n\nIf all this is true (and I'd believe that to be the case) then Monday we should see them maybe sell off some of their shares that they don't need for hedging?
