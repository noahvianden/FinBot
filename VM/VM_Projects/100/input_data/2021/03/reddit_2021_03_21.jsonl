When doing research, it seems that the overall sentiment is that selling options and doing spreads is a better strategy than buying puts and calls. However, I only have $2000 in my Ameritrade account that allows level 2 options (buy puts and calls, sell covered calls, sell cash-secured puts and married puts).

Is this correct or am I missing something? I wrote up an example below just to make sure i am understanding the process correctly.\n\nUsing $BB as an example because they have an earnings report this week; I could sell a 9.5P for $61 and buy a 8.5P for $24 which would provide a max profit of $37 and max loss of $100. However, this would essentially hold $963 of my $2000 unusable for a week all for a potential gain of $37. Covered calls are even worse because I would have to hold 100 shares of a company even if their value fell, so I would have to enter an OTM married put at the same time to protect my investment and essentially render the premium worthless.

It would be totally irresponsible of me to give any suggestions. However I can point you to some resources that I think could be useful. \n\nBest to talk to someone like Dave Ramsey on his radio show about this. I am quite serious. I watch his youtube videos and I do like what he says. If it is not possible or awkward then you can check his book \"The total money makeover\". He outlines a path to be taken to move from high debt to financial freedom in several \"baby steps\". You can see where you fit in and take the next step as given in the book using the 80K$.  \n\nPersonally my entire education starting 7th standard was through scholarships so I never had any loan. The house was already paid for by parents.  I was not interested in money - like ever. I was always interested in research. So, I invested all my resources towards that goal. So I ended up being \"poor dad\" (without debt though) from Kiyosaki's famous book. I have read the book very late in my life. Though I understand his basis I would not follow his path. I am more like Dave Ramsey types person. Overall I could have done much better if I had learned the wisdom from the likes of Kiyosaki, Dave Ramsey earlier. As I said I had a good paying job and my interest was research so I did not really bother about money. \n\nPersonally I would not put 80K$ (approx 5.6Mn INR) in stock markets (leave alone options trading) as it will be a substantial portion of my total networth. Also, I believe markets are in hyper bubble. Unfortunately that is true for almost all assets except precious metals - silver in particular which is half the price of its 1980 price. So overall I would clear debt - student loan, mortgage, car loans, credit cards as per Dave Ramsey plan then put remaining towards something much more robust like a home and precious metals - Gold, Silver etc. I have had a hard time to find suitable investments for quite some time. I do not believe in (Indian) mutual funds, banking, insurance or such financial sector instruments. I am sitting on cash and not comfortable with that either as Indians banks are on borrowed capital and time. In hindsight I should have invested in last March but i did not expect markets to move so hard and fast to reach all time high so soon. I invested some and  exited in Feb this year. If the markets crash again I am planning to start investing according to a DCA ( [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) )  or Value averaging ( [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value\\_averaging.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/value_averaging.asp) ) plan. Dollar cost averaging is simple and effective. Sometimes in a value averaging plan you may need to put much larger chunk in a given month but since we have invesatable surplus we can go for the value averaging too. But all of that only if markets correct at least 33% from here. \n\nAlso, take a breather. Do not rush to make any decision. Particularly if the loss is recent (guessing as it is inheritance). I had lost all taste in life after I lost my father to cancer. I let certain no brainer opportunities slip off my hands. But it is much better than doing the reverse - making dubious investments under emotional stress. Let the 80K$ sit in your bank a/c while you recover emotionally, read those (and other) books on personal finance, search Ramsey (and other) channels for \"inheritance\", talk to experts (and more importantly avoid non-experts who pose as experts) and/ or wait for a crash in all assets - real estate, stock markets in particular.  \n\nThat's all I can come up with.

So I get basic options fundamentals (I thought) and have watched a lot of videos and tutorials about advanced options trading strategies. So on my simulated money account in ToS I've been just messing around to learn the interface and try more advanced trades.\n\nI setup the highlighted IronCondor trade with 10 contracts in GME in the screenshot and used ToS's 1st trg seq advanced order, trying to setup the order to automatically take about 50% profit. I had left the Close Order working around mid day and just came back to see that it had triggered. I thought I did something wrong but lo and behold ToS says I actually made $1,700 P/L for the day, which would definitely be more than the 50% profit I was expecting.\n\nBut how is that possible on an iron condor? I thought they take a lot more time to reach profitability than just 3 hours? is this an artifact of GME doing something weird today? Or ToS simulated money account doing something weird that would not occur in the real world? Did I do something really wrong (or right??).\n\nI am really stumped, being new to this, and trying to learn more. By the way if anyone has some good ToS tutorials I'd really appreciate it, I am trying to learn more and while I wait for my real money investments to mature I need some exercises I can do with Paper Money to learn more about ToS and options strategy.\n\nEDIT: My initial thought was I had setup the 1st trg seq advanced order in ToS wrong, but as I'm researching, did I just get the advantage of severe IV Crush on GME today due to earnings being released this afternoon?

Right now, underlying is way down, around $611.  I could \"capture\" profit of about $11 (Buy 640 @ 43, sell 615 @ 54), which represents cash of $1,100.  \n\nAn exercise in this case would (eventually) mean a cash influx of $61,500 instead of $64,000, a difference of $2,500.  So I captured $1,100 for the guarantee of \"losing\" (opportunity cost) $2,500.\n\nA better decision would be to wait and see if the stock is still way down (the ones expiring a week from now @ 640 are only $11, expiring today are $0.16, for example) and use that opportunity to buy my way out, perhaps of the whole position, perhaps to roll them out a couple / few weeks and make another $4,300 selling them a month out at a higher strike price.  This is all using today's prices.  Total guesses about what things will be.\n\nSo on my April 30, what I need to do is wait.  \n\nGenerally speaking, if you get exercised, you want it to be at the HIGHEST price possible, so buying your strike downward in price, trying to get exercised, is a fool's errand.

I'm learning about option strategies, and I have a couple of plays in mind that I would like to get feedback on to gain a more nuanced understanding of considerations.  Wasn't sure if this was worthy of its own post, so thought I'd try here. \n\nI am wanting to execute a diagonal spread strategy in order to have a lower cost of entry for selling calls, develop a more passive income strategy, and, basically, learn more about options.  I have two plays in mind: RKT and AAL. I am bullish on both longterm, I'm familiar with both of the companies, and they fall into an acceptable price range for me. \n\nRKT: I thought this might be a good pick to capitalize on potential future IV.  Meme stocks tends to recycle, and while the options are pretty affordable right now, I'm thinking a future pump cycle might increase the revenue of selling weeklies.  In the meantime, this stock seems to have a habit of trading relatively sideways which would increase my chances of collecting premium on OTM calls.  My set up would be to enter a LEAP position: 20 Jan 23 18.89C.  This comes at a price of 10.45.  My goal would be to sell weeklies against this position.  My understanding is that  my LEAP should be close to or above .8 delta to protect the value of this position should the price turns towards the front month position.  My current understanding is also that I should seek to sell weeklies that are above my strike price + premium of my LEAP, which in this case would mean I'm selling calls at about a $29 strike.  This would not bring in much income, but I'm hoping I can sell calls closer ITM as my premium collected compound.  \n\nAAL:  I thought this might be a good potential pick as a more stable stock that I'm longterm bullish in.  Set up would be similar, without the potential for a huge increase in IV.  Ultimately, this is a stock I don't mind owning and thought this might be a strategy to take a long position without as much capital and generate an income on the side.  \n\nInterested here to what I'm missing, what other considerations I should make, if I'm a complete idiot, etc.  As I said, I'm relatively new to options and interested in making a somewhat straightforward play as a means to begin using these strategies and learning more.

She got it despite the company never making an actual profit (one that doesn't depend on the sale of carbon credits) because the Teslarati bought up TSLA in droves on the basis of nothing but Elon Musk's cult of personality. Now, Tesla doesn't enjoy the same exclusivity in the EV market (of any type) and their sales are shrinking around the world. By the time the Cybertruck or the Semi come out (if they ever actually do) there will be other, less expensive and more conventional (in terms of the Cybertruck's appearance) competitors on the market.

Square functions as a Point of Service/Sale (POS) for businesses and offers both software on the cloud as well as hardware for said businesses like card swipers, smart tills, and screens - physical check out terminals at shops. Many small businesses choose Square as their POS as it is scalable and easy to use. There are percentage as well as usage fees for credit card payments, none for cash - so long as your business stays under a certain amount of income. Paypal I believe is specifically a digital checkout terminal that is more readily utilized for digital/online check out - card or account transactions only, an always a fee. Venmo is the 'free' person-to-person version of PayPal but even now it's becoming restrictive and monetized as many people have embraced it as a payment platform for their small businesses and side hustles during the pandemic. I'm sure I'm missing something important that defines these services further. I'm also new to investing. I'm a small business owner and have been using Square since 2019. Square and Shopify were the first companies that caught my eye at the beginning of the year where I thought 'if I only had the foresight to invest in these at the start of the pandemic' - as someone who uses and understands the value of these companies and why they're hot. But they're burnin a little too hot and with very high P/Es. If the market tanks again I expect there's a lot more room for them to drop. I currently own four shares of Square with an avg of 237.16. Do I wish I got in at 20? Sure. Do I think it will go up 10x between now and next year? No, not at all. Still, time in the market is better than timing the market. If you have some $ to put in, I'd consider it as your entry point would still be lower than my average but maybe invest a little at a time and aim for dollar cost averaging over time. No idea what your budget and goals are. I know I am going to continue to use Square as I scale my business and believe they're worth investing in long term.

This would be kind of similar to the xbox gamepass, except they would actually have good games (take that xbox gamepass) and the library would be significantly larger.

This run up is not a squeeze (nor is it a pre-squeeze, delta, or gamma squeeze). This is just the denial phase of grief. The idea of bagholding has been fetishized, and the only people still playing this now completely lack any shred of sense or market knowledge. It’s confirmation bias to the extreme and I’m really tired of seeing it everywhere. There isn’t some crazy conspiracy to hide the shorts — we just lost and the hedgies won.

The stock that already cost them hundreds of millions on the first ride of the ol’ squeeze train?\n\nHell no. Anyone who answers yes to those questions are lying to themselves and you. If any one of us were in their position right now, we would report even the thought of shorting GME because of the potential cost of getting caught lying about it. And as if that wasn’t enough, why would they continue to short this extremely dangerous stock for almost two months after being handed a once-in-a-lifetime get-out-of-jail-free pass?\n\nThe painful truth is that shorts have had not only plenty of time to cover (two months since the initial run up), but plenty of reasons to not even utter the letters GME. The risk management headache alone makes it not worth shorting, but after that, there’s still ~10 million people actively looking to fuck your short position over. Then you should also consider the fact that anyone dumb enough to still be short GME is likely shorting from its current price point (lower ones were probably margin called), meaning they are making money off this second unfounded buying euphoria. The only upward-driving forces at play for this recent run up are the CFO replacement (not worth a 400% increase) and WSBers buying from other, more paper-handed WSBers.

I said to justify the CURRENT P/E then either the price would have to go down or the earnings would have to go up a ton. I never said that earnings and price BOTH couldn't go up 10 years from now. However, in that scenario 10 years from now it's still logical where something has to give. There would still have to be extreme earnings growth unless you are still willing to pay a premium P/E in the triple and quadruple digits 10 years from now.\n\nI'll spell this out using rounded numbers. If the stock price is $700 and has a P/E of 1000 today. In 10 years it's highly unlikely a company with a current market cap of 700B will still have that high of a P/E because people will expect results over 10 years. So the more likely scenario is a P/E around 50-75 (GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL are 25-35, AMZN is around 70). In order to have a P/E in the double digits then earnings will have to go up 1000/50 = 20x. The stock price would be unchanged in that scenario. So in order to have the stock price go up and get its investors real growth, then the earnings will have to also go up that much more. So if you want 20% gains since it's a growth company then earnings would in theory need to go up 20x + an additional 20%/year. This scenario DOES NOT have to be true. The price could go up a lot, and keep the P/E very high, but that's a very risky assumption that TSLA won't act like 99% of the rest of the market for an additional 10 years.\n\nWhat already happened the last 2-3 years already happened. No one, including me, is saying TSLA will fail. But past gains don't imply future gains.

Ark comes out with new projections, people who have thoroughly investigated Tesla are not surprised, others call it insane because it's never been done before. Guess what? Tons of things have never been done before, and almost everything Elon Musk's companies do have never been done before. If you keep looking at what was possible in the past and not what's being done in the present, you're gonna keep missing these opportunities.\n\nIn 5-10 years time you're all gonna be wondering how you missed it when others didn't. This is how you missed it.\n\nJust to give you an example how easy it is to make false assumptions if you haven't done the homework:\n\n>  42B for a human ride hailing network: Double Uber/Lyft combined on a service that they don’t even have a business model for? Using on Tesla’s vs all cars on the road in the case of Uber and Lyft? Doubling the size of the ride sharing network while driving Uber and Lyft to 0 in 4 years?\n\nYou're missing the fact that anyone using full autonomy will also be paying Tesla anywhere between $400 and $1000 a month. That's how you easily double Uber and Lyft's businesses.\n\n> Nobody in insurance has 40% margins for a reason.\n\nThat's because nobody has the amount of data on all of their customers like Tesla does. If you so much as fart at the wrong time in a Tesla, they can know and put you on a higher premium. Their insurance will be much cheaper for the user while having higher margins simply because they'll have fewer accidents and more data on their users.\n\n> Growth: 80% revenue growth compounding. On a company that grew 14% in 2019 and 28% in 2020 despite still being a small company where larger growth rates are possible? Elon himself hopes for 50% growth, which in itself is pretty unrealistic as the company scales.\n\nThis is just a bunch of incorrect or irrelevant statements thrown together.\n\nFirst, it's not relevant how much their revenue grew in the past when 60-90% of their automotive net income is going to come from ride hailing and software sales in the future. Every car they sell now will be able to generate massive amounts of recurring income in the future if they solve full autonomy. That's how you reach 80% revenue growth (and to be honest, if they indeed solve full autonomy it's going to be much more than that).\n\nSecond, Elon never mentioned 50% annual growth in revenue. Tesla's targeting 50% annual PRODUCTION growth where 2021 and 2022 will be significantly higher and later it might be lower, but the average will be 50% throughout this decade. Obviously if you are already growing production by 50% per year, and then throw in the addition of recurring software sales of 10-20% of the average car price per year, including on cars sold in the past, 80% is easily possible.\n\n> Autonomy: Did anyone watch that Oakland video? This software is years out. Assuming by some miracle it was achieved by the end of 2022 (unlikely at best), that would give them roughly 2-3 years to scale from nothing to over 300 BILLION in revenue. You know, bigger than Apple and around Amazons size.\n\nThis is the crux of the matter. If you believe full autonomy is feasible within 3 years, Ark's targets make perfect sense. If you don't, they're bonkers. It's got nothing to do with the research itself, purely with when you believe robotaxis are possible. Personally, if I see how well the FSD beta is performing when considering they don't even have the most powerful supercomputer in the world up and running yet, which should be ready this summer, I think it's at least 50-50.

Not to mention occlusion constraints as well. I can't imagine the effort required to HDmap the world every week in order to fulfill this lvl 5 definition.

Tesla's lvl 2 official status can jump to lvl 5 as soon as regulations approve (subject to FSD improvements as well).

It's also just a 4MB model. \n\nThey're driving policy network looks like it takes input\\_imgs, desire, traffic\\_convention, initial\\_state. The input layer is  \n\ninput\\_imgs (InputLayer)         (None, 12, 128, 256)\n\nSo that looks like 12 frames of two 128 x 128 images it looks at.\n\nThere's a bunch of convolutional layers with ELU activation, which is then reshaped to a 1024 feature vector. 2 dimensional traffic\\_convention and 512 vector initial\\_state is added, followed by linear layers. For the output it looks like they just concatenate the outputs of a bunch of different layers, one is 3 dimensional, another 4 dimensional which is probably driving policy. However others are 9905 dimensional, which could be some pixel depth estimations, probably also some state vectors (which is fed back into the model for next update).\n\nIn total it spits out 11327 values, and it's a 16 million parameter model, the file is 62MB. \n\nIt's really not that impressive, seems to work pretty much just like this, [https://miro.medium.com/max/2510/1\\*vkQ0hXDaQv57sALXAJquxA.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/2510/1*vkQ0hXDaQv57sALXAJquxA.jpeg)\n\nWhat Tesla does is really on another level. It's barely comparable. comma ai use a modified OnePlus 3 phone in a 3D printed case hotwired into the CAN-bus of pretty much any modern car. It uses the cars built in adaptive cruise control and lane assist API to just send commands as if it was the stock cruise control.\n\nThe Oneplus 3 has a snapdragon 820, fabbed on same Samsung 14 nm (same as Tesla is using for HW3, but just has a 500 GFLOPS GPU with a 4 core CPU, 64-bit LPDDR4 channel.\n\nThe FSD chip runs a 600 GFLOPS GPU, 74,000 GOPS AI processor, 3x 4 core CPUs, 128 bit LPDDR4 bus. Based on the 8 GB memory, maybe they can run something like 100 - 500 million parameter model?\n\nStill, I think comma ai actually has a pretty good product. In good road conditions it handles boring highway driving just fine. It doesn't do lane changes and can barely stick to the lane in snow, but for driving straight on a highway for 8 hours it great. I think many people have realized that self driving with no interventions is still far away (1-3 years), most people would be very happy with something that drives the car for 7 hours without any input, with you the driver handling the difficult parts, that's still a huge step up. The Tesla beta is still the same really, only it's 7 hours 50 minutes without any input.\n\nIf you look at that as,\n\n* comma ai: 90% of drive autonomous, $15k 4 year old used Honda + $1k comma two\n* Tesla: 98% of drive autonomous, $36k Model 3 + $10k FSD software.\n\nFor most people they'll really just go with the budget option. Tesla does have a bit of a hard sell until they get regulatory approval and you don't get fined for looking at your phone in a self driving Tesla.\n\nQuickly about Waymo, I mean they got level 4 city driving in mapped areas solved.

The setup is similar to the put ratio spread: buy one ATM / OTM call, sell two further OTM calls for a net credit. This way, I profit a little if the stock drops or stays neutral. I profit the most if the stock makes a moderate move to the upside, and I lose if the stock rallies past my short call strike.\n\nI set up the following call front ratio trade:\n\nTicker: [ASM.AS](https://ASMI.AS) (semi conductor producer); options traded at EuroNext.\n\nCurrent price: 218.60\n\nBought one 16APRIL 225.00 call for 5.94 debit.\n\nSold two 16 APRIL 235.00 call for 6.97 credit.\n\nReceived 100 euro net credit after commissions.\n\nIf [ASM.AS](https://ASMI.AS) closes below 225.00 at expiration date, all options expire worthless and I keep the 100 euro credit. If ASMI.AS closes exactly at 235.00, the short calls expire worthless and my long call collects me 1000 euro, thus a total profit of 1100 euro. If ASM.AS closes at 246.00, I won't make a profit or loss (long call results in 2100 euro profit, short call results in 2200 euro loss, I also collected 100 euro credit upon entering the trade). Thus if [ASM.AS](https://ASMI.AS) trades above 246.00 euro at expiration, I lose money.\n\nMy BEP is 246.00. [ASM.AS](https://ASMI.AS) is trading at 218.60. This means the stock has to increase over 12.53% in a timespan of 28 days for me to lose money. The POP of this trade is very high.\n\nThe trade is (temporarily) short delta, (temporarily) short gamma, short vega and long theta. I initiated this trade at about 40% IV (30 day historical volatility was about 28%). At the time, OTM call premiums were expensive as there was a short period of inverse skew, thereby allowing me to widen the strikes (which improved my BEP).\n\nThe risk I'm taking is undefined, as I'm essentially running a naked call. Therefore, some degree of risk tolerance is needed. The margin maintenance is 40% = 8700 euro. Therefore, my ROC would be \\~1% if [ASM.AS](https://ASMI.AS) closed below 225 at expiration. My ROC would be anywhere between 1 to 13% if [ASM.AS](https://ASMI.AS) closes between 225.00 and 245.00 at expiration.\n\nMy plan is to close the position if [ASM.AS](https://ASMI.AS) / tech winds up tanking early (>21DTE), thus collecting the upfront credit I received. If [ASM.AS](https://ASMI.AS) stays flat / slowly moves upwards, I'll close the position at around 50% max profit. If [ASMI.AS](https://ASMI.AS) blows past my short calls within a very short period (>21 DTE) I'll close the position for a loss. If [ASM.AS](https://ASMI.AS) is above my short strike or BEP with less than 21DTE, I'll just take profit on the embedded debit call spread and defend my naked call.\n\nIf you've made it this far, you've probably come to understand the power and flexibility of ratios spreads when used during favourable market conditions.

They are not willing to sit back and watch naked short sellers, funded by big banks, manipulate stocks, harm companies, and fleece shareholders.\n\n> The battle that launched this week over GameStop between retail investors and Wall Street-backed naked short sellers is the beginning of a war that could change everything.\n\n> It’s a global problem, but **it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets**, where naked short selling—the process of selling shares you don’t own, thereby creating counterfeit or ‘phantom’ shares—survives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.\n\n> This is an egregious act against capital markets, and it’s caused billions of dollars in damage.\n\n> Make no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies.\n\nAlso:\n\n> And big banks and financial institutions are turning a blind eye to some of the accounts that routinely participate in these illegal transactions because of the large fees they collect from them. These institutions are actively facilitating the destruction of shareholder value in return for short term windfalls in the form of trading fees. They are a major part of the problem and are complicit in aiding these accounts to create counterfeit shares.\n\nFocus:\n\n> Their MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible. This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. **After cratering the shorted company’s share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment** as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left. Rinse and Repeat.\n\nThis predatory short activity by hedge funds did, in fact, happen to Canadian pot stocks before the COVID crash last year.\n\nWhich other Canadian stocks are being attacked like this?\n\nMoving on:\n\n> McMillan also noted that “the number of short campaigns in Canada is utterly disproportionate to the size of our capital markets when compared to the United States, the European Union, and Australia”.", "id": "m9lkim", "created_utc": 1616291269.0, "score": 1555, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 359, "comments": [{"body": "Ouch.

This is beneficial to the maple trees as their roots don't get a solid freeze. This enhances their sap production in the early springtime when you're making your golden amber syrup which is softer in taste and the typically choosen flavor around the world (you pussies don't have the stomach for dark VT syrup). Product line this year will include old and new favorites: maple candy, maple ice cream (several flavors), maple popcorn, maple cotton candy, maple glazed donuts, maple hot dogs and the age old sugar on snow. The new reverse osmosis machine enhances the purity of the syrup and efficiency of the system. The natural gas evaporator allows for consistent syrup production at a lesser cost. Getting about 24 inches of mercury on the vacuum system right now and sap is coming in like a bastard.\n\nAdd all that in with the fact that last year's season got cut short due to covid and with the vaccine distribution, people are ready to get out and about again.

Too many people get sold a bag of goods with a claim in the product name that it's real syrup or real Vermont syrup when in fact it couldn't be any more fake. More and more people learn the truth every day.\n\nProduct development has allowed for year round syrup demand. While true production only lasts a few weeks in the early spring time, product sales are year round. In fact, some of the most profitable months have come in the summer during maple ice cream demand time. International shipping for syrup at a flat rate cost through USPS. National 2-day shipping for ice cream with a guarantee. Maple candies are always in season. Maple cream can go on toast or donuts any day of the year.\n\nImproving forestry techniques allow for the healthy growth of maple trees and production. By definition, production will increase on a per tree basis as the trees grow in diameter and total root system and can accommodate more taps. Meaning tap counts on a per acre basis should improve year over year with proper forestry efforts until maximum capacity per acre yield is achieved. This would be the point at which your mature trees have a max tap count (3-4) and you have a healthy population of younger trees (1-2 tap count) to take the mature trees place when they die out as an on-going cycle that will outlast the sugar maker and hopefully be past down through the family or company. At the point of max capacity production, one should be making enough gains as to purchase more sugaring lands and rinse and repeat.\n\nYou're not wrong in your bearish assessment that total syrup production would not be able to meet a sudden mass increase in demand as things stand now. To this end, real syrup is not advertised around the country, despite shipping availability. I'm saying go long in this position. Look for above expected earnings reports around sugaring season as an indication that sugaring technology (vacuum efficiency, evaporator efficiency, RO efficiency, ect) is continuing to advance. The annual diminishing population base in the far north of the US also will contribute towards a lesser demand there and a high supply point going forwards.\n\nCheck out CDL and Dominion and Grimm products as they are the two maple product development leaders and any big news or a product release from them should be reflected in the following year's sugar production.\n\n(For those who don't know, the entire process of getting sap and making it into maple syrup is called sugaring. Those who make maple syrup are sugar makers. This comes from a large increase in the production of maple syrup in the 1940s when the US government imposed the sugar ration to help with the war effort. To make up for this, people began making their own sugar products such as maple syrup to try to create equilibrium with supply and demand)\n\nThis is not investment advice, I'm literally talking BS on the internet 🥴.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "This whole thing made me wish I was high.

{"title": "Palantir: There and Back Again - PT $45 EOFY", "selftext": "Hi everyone, this is my take on Palantir. I've been writing this for a couple weeks now and decide that I need to get this done today so hopefully it reads well. This post is my personal opinion and analysis. Welcome any questions and constructive feedback. For full disclosure I invest in PLTR and nothing beats doing your own research in addition to reading other people's DDs.\n\n**Deep value investment for the most important software company, PT $45 EOFY:**\n\nI believe Palantir has been and will continue to disrupt not just the software industry but how dozens of sectors and industries operate. What we’re seeing here might be the next Amazon with a company that does not mind short-term losses and invests aggressively to achieve long-term hyper and exponential growth. If you look at companies that shy away from making such a level of investments into technology to please their shareholders in the short-term, such short-sighted actions do no justice for those wanting to hold onto their investments over the medium- to long-term. I am incredibly excited about the recent Titan release with 4 new modules that includes an AI assistant and an automatic reporting tool. My target price for PLTR is $45 EOFY, key modelling assumptions include:\n\n* Palantir will be a +$20bn revenue business by 2030, driven by significant growth in number of customers and revenue per customer, partially offset by 1-2% churn each year. Growth rate +30% over the long-term is consistent with what we've seen with Amazon / AWS and Salesforce. There will be increasing demand for data analytics solutions and full stack operating systems like Palantir as corporate/governments undergo transformations and identify new use cases for the data that they have.\n* Gross margin around 74%, in line with most other software companies.\n* Exponential growth and margin support by Apollo's automation of the implementation and post-implementation support would enable massive implementation across thousands of large-to-medium-size customers that would otherwise not be possible with the current headcount at Palantir. Like Alex Karp said, software allows small companies to compete against rivals 10x their size.\n* EBIT margin will expand to 27% (including stock-based compensation) by 2030. This is conservative when we compare to MSFT which is operating at +35%. I also assume a normalised 18% on sales & marketing which is on the low side if you compare to CRM at 40-45%, but given Palantir's current partnership model I think this is justifiable. 17% R&D and 5% General & admin.\n* Significant shareholder dilution going forward. I use a share base of 2.2-2.3B for my per share calculation to factor in the dilution. Assume no share buyback.\n* Normalisation of interest rates to 3% and lower beta (basically lower volatility) over the next 10 years.\n\nNote that while my PT is definitely lower than other moonshots on this sub (I'm talking 60/100/150/500), this is based on readily available datapoints, moderately conservative assumptions and assuming investors will not be willing to pay crazy multiples for the stock.\n\n**Management is sandbagging revenue guidance, are we doing the same?** Management has been overly-conservative and this was one of the main factors causing the share price to tank following what I would consider a very positive Q4 and FY20. With 45% revenue growth for Q1 and 30% for FY21, this implies that Palantir has to really mess up a lot of things in one or two of the remaining quarters (y/y growth below 20-30%) to miss or even to just achieve their guidance. Below is an analysis I've done to show if their guidance is true they will grow at \\~19% y/y in one of the quarters which isn't great. So it is more likely than not these guys will outperform their revenue guidance by a significant margin this year. With their 2025 revenue guidance of $4bn, I believe this is also very conservative and it is not difficult to believe the annual growth rate can be 35-40% y/y instead of the guided 30% CAGR. By 2030, at the current rate of growth plus a bit of uplift this business can get to $20bn in revenue or even $30bn – such growth is not unheard of if you’ve been following Amazon / AWS and see what they’ve achieved. Also, the TAM for PLTR might be a lot larger than what management has guided (I note from [C3.AI](http://c3.ai/) filing that they estimate their market opportunities to be in the range of $240bn and growing) but of course penetration of that TAM will prove challenging for Palantir.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FY21 revenue scenario, Assume Q2 and Q3 both grow at 30&#37; y\\/y, this means Q4 grows at 19&#37; y\\/y](https://preview.redd.it/4nu7jwnynao61.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef8bd9288faf885fca364e9e837ee28946216231)\n\nOn another note, in FY21-22, we might see a significant number of customers entering the Expand and Scale phases. In 2020, Palantir had been able to acquire 400+ new Acquire customers on top of the existing \\~125, making their customer pool 500+ at the lower end. If they manage to convert all of these new Acquire to Expand/Scale that would add +$4bn to their top line, assuming each customer roughly pays $10m a year to Palantir for the software.\n\n**This business can become extremely profitable.** While both Alex and Cathie have focused their attention on investing more into the business by forgoing profitability now, in the long-term all businesses need to be profitable so I don't suggest we ignore profitability completely. The case might be that Palantir can become a lot more profitable than what we currently see with the level of automation Apollo and future add-ons can handle. Operating leverage will also enable PLTR to expand their margins. In a bull case, gross margin and operating margin may expand to +75% and 30-35% respectively as stock-based compensation further normalises in the future. R&D, sales & marketing and other expenses will still grow in absolute terms but will eventually become smaller portions of revenue.\n\n**Future stock-based compensation will improve.** From PLTR’s SEC filing, I was able to get a sense of what the stock-based compensation will be over the next 3-4 years. I forecast stock-based compensation will reduce from $1.1bn in FY20 to \\~$414m per year over FY21-23. I also looked at the stock-based compensation expense of other software companies to make sure that there is nothing odd going on with Palantir (see figure below). For my modelling I assume that over the long-term, stock-based compensation will stabilise around 8% of revenue (which is a lot lower than companies like ServiceNow but still above average for well established software companies). Besides the financial, it is noted that stock-based compensation allows Palantir to attract the best people as well as providing their people with incentives to further their contributions to the business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Arithmetic mean for FY10-21 stock-based compensation &#37; of revenue for selected software companies. Source: manual data entry from 10K\\/S1 filings](https://preview.redd.it/591tejo3oao61.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=c52b0a4f04b6ac00f65610ff44bd34f7348def57)\n\n**How long is long-term?** With a stock like Palantir, it seems to be the case that Alex Karp's horizon is beyond 5 years, possibly 6-7 years. The trajectory of the stock will likely be sideway for long and moon/mars long into the future. The point when they reach profitability will be key to the moon phenomenon, which I'd say they can be profitable earliest 2023, base case 2025. So just to reiterate the same thing that Alex Karp has said but cater to our short-termism a bit better, if you're a short-term investor with possibly less than 2 years investment horizon in this stock (2 years is at the very least) then I'd go for SPACs or follow meetkevin investments....\n\n**Key challenges to Palantir:**\n\nWe know Palantir has a very good product, but there is much to prove with its business model. Below I note some key challenges:\n\n* **Relationship with IBM and Amazon:** It is great that Palantir has been able to secure two very good partnerships with two juggernauts. However, the level of leverage that Palantir can pull in these partnerships is weak imo as Palantir is still very small and has limited capacity to push through sales. Over time, I'd expect Palantir to become increasingly independent from IBM and Amazon, with the two only providing the hardware and cloud infrastructure for Palantir and Palantir to substantially upscale its direct salesforce to capture more share of the market.\n* **Competition:** Though we may say the TAM is $120bn, $500bn, $1T or even $2T, it is clear Palantir won't capture the entire TAM. Organisations may continue to use their existing systems or choose another vendor. Palantir's potential customers may not have the same horizon as Alex Karp's and they may opt for quick one-off solutions rather than a long-term commitment to Gotham/Foundry/etc. Such level of inertia will slow down adoption of Palantir's products. There might be other companies jumping into this space. I do note however that it will also be challenging for other companies to compete against Palantir, especially the bigger players as their large structure prevents them from investing sufficiently for what is still viewed as a niche market.\n* **Shareholder dilution:** Part of the reason why it seems PLTR share price does not go up as much on green days is the market pricing in the dilution. While we may think the share base to calculate the per share valuation is 1.83B, there's 500-700m more shares that will eventually dilute the stock, lowering the per share valuation (assuming no share buyback). This factor is also the main driver of the discrepancy in the PT that people have for PLTR, not really revenue and operating income by themselves alone. I note that this dilution is common for many companies but it is however very significant for Palantir. Valuation needs to consider dilution.\n* **Transparency into financial disclosures:** Palantir currently does not have the best disclosures in their 10K/10Q/S1 if one has spent time looking at other software companies' SEC filings. For one, there is no breakdown between software and services in their revenue which makes it hard to understand how much of their revenue is coming from the actual software. The stock-based compensation structure is difficult for investors to grasp that somewhat have hidden the significant level of dilution that we're going to see in the future (that compounds with the investor base dominated by retail). The Acquire/Expand/Scale disclosure does not exactly show how many customers have moved from Acquire into Expand and so on. Overall, Palantir can do a lot better in their financial reporting.\n* **Public relations:** In my opinion Palantir has not exactly done its best in terms of communications to its investors and obviously maintaining good relationships with the media and Wall Street. While Alex Karp may like the fact that retail investors are dominating the base, I think a more balanced investor base with growing interest from institutional investors will be healthy for the stock (which is actually what we're seeing more of). Good relationships with Wall Street will be key in balancing the investor base. This is not saying PLTR to forgo all of its long-term values but rather they should engage with Wall Street in more regular and healthy debates that will benefit both Palantir and the St, and giving the St more opportunities to understand the company better. This is also not saying Wall St should all put BUY ratings on PLTR because they have the right to have their own view, but a good relationship will give any PT and rating a more objective touch. In terms of communications, I envision Palantir to somewhat move in the direction of Salesforce which has done very well in this regards by developing free online courses and low-code/no-code chill-out conversations that investors/layman can jump in. This would further Palantir along the adoption curve and make Palantir a household name. Recently, the Titan release is not known unless someone goes through multiple loops to find the link so such release should have been announced publicly either via the News section or on Twitter.\n\n**Palantir is still trading cheap compared to some of the recently listed software companies**\n\nPrice/Sales or P/S is the key metric for a company like Palantir. Anyway, you can see that Palantir is trading cheaper than 6 other companies at 41x (Snowflake, Crowdstrike, Roblox, Zscaler, C3 AI and Datadog), 4 of which have an average BUY rating from analysts. One thing to bear in mind though is that the whole tech sector has been trading rich for a while now so it is uncertain at this stage to know whether there will be a correction/normalization of multiples in a rising interest rates / inflationary environment. In other words, will 20x P/S be the new normal? Or +40x P/S will be here to stay, let's hope for the latter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Software comparables Price\\/Sales ratio.

Althought airline industry only uses like 8 million barrels of oil per day (out of total pre-COVID of 101) it is still significant.\n\nPretty chart below shows number of flights per day (thousands).

{"title": "EV Industry: a SPAC fueled & fraud filled bubble", "selftext": "So right now the **EV space** is starting to look **very similar** to what **weedstocks** were **in late 2018**. Incredible hype, unprofitable companies, zero sales, fraud and mismanagement of investor funds.\n\nRelated to this, a week ago another EV stonk ($RIDE) was being **alleged of fraud** so I think it's time we briefly go through the EV turds you guys have been throwing money at for the past year.\n\n**Disclaimer: This is fanfiction I write at night after I drop off my wife at her boyfriends place. Not financial advice.**\n\nSome  background for the kids who weren't gambling FDs in 2018. Roughly three  years ago, back when your biggest goal in life was to see your middle  school teacher Ms. Wilson's **bare tits**,  the retards here were already YOLOing their Wendy's paychecks and  sending them over the border into Canada. Why Canada? Turns out the **maple syrup sipping beavers**  up there were about to legalize marijuana. Some of the more business  oriented folks tired of freezing their balls off decided to quit their  jobs at Tim Hortons and buy **barns in the middle of nowhere**, setup weed companies and call them cool names like \"Blaze It  Erryday Co\", \"Kush Money Inc\" and \"Aphria Inc\". The empty barns were  publicly listed on the TSX and we were off to the races! Retards like us  bought everything we could get our hands on, **weed was about to make us millionaires**.\n\nTurns out most companies shit themselves after reality set in.\n\nSales were **disappointing**, low profit margins meant that almost none of the companies were profitable, the **bubble popped** and your boys were left **holding bags** of weed(stonks). Some of these companies are still around, while others are now **lol tier pennystocks**.\n\nI  was originally going to compare the current state of EVs to the dotcom  era internet companies but only the boomers here will remember that ancient stuff  so weedstocks it is. Okay, enough with the history lessons. Here's why I  think 2018 weedstocks are a good comparison to EVs.\n\n* \"New\" industry with incredible growth expectations from investors.\n* A ton of public listings by companies in a short period of time.\n* Stonks going to the moon\n* Strong belief that these companies can actually turn a profit.\n\nLet's move on to **what's hot with the SEC** right now. I'll list some of the EV companies here and tell you why they're terrible. Note: I'm **not touching Chinese EVs**, the CCP will eventually decide which manufacturer they want to install their **spyware** into and declare the winner. Also I'm sorry if I left out the EV fraud you're holding, too bad, I'm about to **blast some ass**. I think you'll quickly see a pattern emerging with these companies.\n\n**Canoo Inc ($GOEV)**\n\n* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.\n* Not  mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a terrible  looking minivan in 2022. These minivans will be subscription based  revolutionary \"lifestyle experiences\". I need to know what these guys  are smoking.\n* The company estimates it will produce 95k cars per year by 2025, lmao.\n* **Rating: Lol tier**\n\n**Fisker Inc ($FSR)**\n\n* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.\n* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start outsourcing production of a decent looking SUV in late 2022.\n* They're  strictly using 3rd party manufacturing for their cars and using a  'leasing' type of business model, so customers will pay a monthly fee  instead of a big upfront payment. Foxconn has stated they will be able  to produce up to 250k Fisker cars around 2023. Essentially Fisker is  drawing pictures with crayons and hoping their 3rd parties can deliver.  3rd party manufacturing and business model doesn't sound that terrible, they may have some brain cells.\n* **Rating: Crayon tier**\n\n**Nikola Corp ($NKLA)**\n\n* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.\n* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing trucks in late 2023.\n* CEO resigned after fraud allegations last year. Investigated by the SEC. Also that fake truck video was hilarious.\n* Didn't  find any reliable production estimates. The company is allegedly filled  with fraud, which is why I think this company will never mass produce a  car/truck.\n* **Rating: Fraud tier**\n\n**Lordstown Motors Corp ($RIDE)**\n\n* Listed via SPAC. Not making profit.\n* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a nice looking pickup truck in late 2021.\n* Allegations of producing fake pre-orders and being years behind of schedule. Investigated by the SEC.\n* Aiming for 100k cars per year in 2024, CEO has stated their factory  has potential capacity to produce 600k cars per year.\n* **Rating: Fraud tier**\n\n**Lucid Motors ($CCIV)**\n\n* Listing Q2 2021 via SPAC. Not making profit.\n* Not mass producing cars, but has plans to start producing a very nice looking sedan in Q2 2021.\n* Factory capacity to produce 30k cars per year with plans to increase it to 400k.\n* Actually not a complete disaster but production capacity is very low at this point.\n* **Rating: ex-TSLA tier**\n\n**Tesla Inc ($TSLA)**\n\n* Did an IPO back when you kids were sucking on your **mommys nipples**. Profitable because they sell billions of regulatory credits.\n* Mass produces multiple models and has plans to start producing more models.\n* Current capacity over 800k cars per year with upcoming expansions.\n* OG memestock. Only EV company that has a **Technoking**.  Incredibly overvalued. Multiple reasons pumping valuation,  Full-Self-Driving & robotaxis being one. Go check the 8.2 beta  videos, that thing is nowhere near autonomous. \"tEsLa iS nOt a CaR  ComPanY\", okay, right.\n* **Rating: Meme tier**\n\n**In conclusion.**\n\nAlmost every single company in the \"purely\" EV space is **losing money**. Most of them **aren't producing anything**. At least a few of them are producing **fraudulent data**. Some of the founders have **terrible track records**,  look at the founders of GOEV, FSR and RIDE. This is 2018 weedstocks all  over again. Most of these companies will go away in the next 5 years as  car companies that actually sell cars begin to shift over to EV. Even  though TSLA is incredibly overvalued it looks like a 10 compared to the  other turds in the industry. Even TSLA will have to compete with Ford  and Volkswagen in the upcoming years but I'm expecting them to survive  and possibly become legit profitable at some point. If you think the EV  stonk your holding is going to moon this year, go look at what happened  with weedstocks after 2018.\n\nThank you, have a great weekend and good luck next week!\n\nI know a lot of you retards are holding these stonks so I'm prepared to receive my downvotes.\n\n**Related positions:**\n\nCurrently  I have no positions on the companies listed above except long dated  TSLA puts.

{"title": "AMC why it's all good from friday's Quadruple witching hour.", "selftext": " \n\nWhy we should be happy with Friday's AMC closing at 13.93. Wasn't AMC stuck at the $8 level just 2 weeks prior? If you were to ask me during the first week of March would I be happy to see AMC reach 12 and beyond by quadruple witching March 19, I'd be ecstatic if $14 can be established as the new base.\n\nHere's why this $14 is a new base. Biggest white elephant in the AMC room was when Wanda Group converted all the [B shares to A](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). With about [44 million A common shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-wanda-group-trimming-holdings-142528503.html) that you know Wanda is itching to cash out, Wanda Group was always a threat how they would be disposing of their shares. Well this Friday March 19, what many people did not notice was a flash block trade at 2 seconds after closing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[spot the elephant leaving the room?](https://preview.redd.it/qpq8gw220fo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=23166f1766cabe53fee69c8975190469cffa8e76)\n\nThat's 45 million shares at 13.93 totaling $630 million. Ladies and gentlemen, Wanda has left the building. So we should be thankful that Wanda did not recklessly dump their shares in the market. Instead they found a banker or bankers to take up the entire 45M share quota. I'm guessing it's Goldman Sachs and B. Riley Securities since those two were of critical help during their [cash crisis in Nov last year](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-to-issue-20-million-shares-of-common-stock-61282394).\n\nThis share deal doesn't happen instantly, but takes days or weeks to negotiate. It's an educated but realistic guess that Wanda has been wanting to sell it shares and would be happy at a $15 range. Just follow Silverlake who also immediately on January 27 converted their [$600 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000119312521022799/d30907dsc13da.htm) debt into common share at 13.51 and immediately sold into the market starting at what price? 13.55 - 14.5 range then all the way up to $24. Don't know how they sold 200k shares at $24 but that's what is filed.\n\nSo Wanda wanted to follow Silverlake's lead but were just too late when they filed the papers to [convert on Feb1](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). Luckily they waited instead of just dumping, until AMC revived to above 10. By then they reached an agreement with bankers probably at $14. This is all guessing here and not established fact (except for that 45M block trade).\n\nBut if that's what happened, that's good for us because it means a big bank (Goldman? Riley?) is willing to take up a wholesale $630 million equity share position on AMC at 13.93 /share cost and will be retail selling these shares at 16 dollars and above? 18 dollars and above? 20 dollars and above? Once again based on Silverlake's move, they can see AMC going to 24 dollars.\n\nIf a deal was struck with Wanda at about $14, then it was imperative for them to make sure AMC stocks had to land at $14 dollars by end of Friday March 19. That's what we observed happening all day Friday trading.\n\nIf this is what happened, we should count ourselves fortunate because it's now a big banker who will be establishing $14 as the new base.\n\nGo AMC, go Apes.\n\nAll this was NOT financial advice.

{"title": "TSLA fundamentals analysis - why it's not overvalued", "selftext": "ARK’s latest price target for Tesla has been the subject of a lot of discussion lately. They believe it will reach $3000 per share in the next 5 years, which based on its current market price of $654 implies about a 50% annual rate of return. If you haven’t already, you can take a look at the [article](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/) they published explaining how they arrived at this price target and the assumptions they made.\n\nI recently got [downvoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8pntp/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/grq28wo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) for suggesting that this price target wasn’t illogical and that Cathie wasn’t crazy. So I wanted to explain my reasoning a bit more so that more people can downvote me and tell me why I’m wrong.\n\nNow just to be clear, I’m not here to argue about whether EVs are the future, whether existing car companies are unprepared to switch to EV, or whether Tesla is an insurance play. I’m assuming that you’re already interested in investing in Tesla and the only thing stopping you is its valuation.\n\n**P/E. It’s over 1000! But is it a useful metric?**\n\nP/E seems to be the most common argument for why Tesla is overvalued. Why buy Tesla at 1023 P/E when you could buy GM at 14 P/E or even Workhorse at 23 P/E?\n\nLet’s step back a bit. Companies can be categorized into one of three stages: growth, maturity, and decline. P/E is useful for valuing mature companies against their mature competitors, since all other things being equal we’d expect their P/Es to eventually equalize as well. For example, I recently bought Target partly because of its P/E of 22 vs Walmart’s 28 and Costco’s 34 (although one could argue that some/all of these companies are still in their growth stage).\n\nOn the other hand, P/E is less useful when looking at companies in the growth and decline phases. You could find companies with P/E below 1, but they may be value traps rather than automatic buys. If they go out of business next year, their stock will be worthless.\n\nP/E is similarly flawed when looking at growth stocks. P/E doesn’t account for whether a company is spending a lot aggressively re-investing in itself, or if a company has small earnings now but a good chance of quickly growing into a much larger market. If you had the chance to buy a loss-making company now at $1B market cap now, knowing that its addressable market will quickly expand to $100B, you’d still make a profit over the long term, even buying at massively “inflated” P/E.\n\nThat said, P/E is still useful for measuring risk in a growth stock or upside in a declining stock. If Tesla were to transition from growth to maturity or decline, there’s no doubt its P/E and share price would decline significantly. But risk is part of growth investing; this risk exists with other growth stocks too.\n\n**Forward P/E**\n\nWhile Tesla’s trailing P/E is 1023, its forward P/E is a high but less eye-popping 119. Trailing P/E is calculated by dividing the stock’s market value by its share price, while forward P/E is calculated by dividing the company’s estimated earnings in the following year by its share price. Forward P/E is a more error-prone and risky metric since nobody knows what a company will earn in the future. But it can still be useful when considering the price of a stock, since the market tends to price in expected future performance.\n\nComparing to some other popular growth stocks, Tesla’s forward P/E is still high but not unreasonable. PINS has 58, SHOP has 227, NFLX has 40. And at least it’s positive. Many growth stocks such as NIO, NKLA, lucid, PLTR, and LMND don’t expect to be profitable within the next year.\n\nAnd while Tesla’s P/E is high it’s difficult to make a direct comparison with these mentioned companies since they’re not profitable companies in the EV space. There really isn’t another profitable EV company to compare forward P/E with, and that uniqueness/first mover advantage could be partly why Tesla trades at a high forward P/E.\n\nThat said, Tesla is still overpriced if (unfairly) comparing against mature auto-makers; GM is at 10 forward P/E, F is at 8. But if you believe those companies have a chance to become EV growth companies and won’t be weighed down by their mature/declining combustion businesses, I’d argue that’s more of a reason to buy them than to sell Tesla.\n\n**Price-to-sales**\n\nIf a company is re-investing in itself aggressively, it may be incurring costs that aren’t part of its core business. Once growth slows, it may be able to cut these expenses and dramatically improve its P/E. To account for this, we can look at price to sales.\n\nTSLA’s price-to-sales is 20. For comparison, SHOP is at 47, PLTR is at 40, FVRR is at 42, NIO is at 27, NKLA is chilling at 63619, lucid is at infinity since it doesn’t have sales yet. It’s quite an oversimplification to make these comparisons without considering what portion of a company’s expenses is related to operating costs. SHOP has better margins than TSLA for example, since it’s in a totally different business. But nevertheless, one could argue TSLA is currently undervalued by this metric, even compared to other EV companies.\n\n**A historical example**\n\nAnother common argument is that the whole market is overvalued right now, and this is especially the case for growth stocks. I don’t pretend to know what the market will do in the short term, and I’m certainly not discounting the possibility of a further rotation out of growth in the near future. But I know that eventually the market will rotate back into growth stocks. You may have looked like a fool buying Amazon or Microsoft at the height of the dot com bubble, but if you held until now, you’d get the last laugh.\n\nSo let’s look at an example from a time when there was less talk about stocks being overvalued. Facebook IPO’d in 2012 at a P/E of 91.2 and price to sales of 24 ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndobosz/2012/05/17/facebook-is-flat-out-expensive-compared-to-google-at-ipo/?sh=5c83b70c6d03)). Both FB at the time and TSLA now have an annual growth rate of about 45%.\n\nIf we take Tesla’s forward P/E, this comparison actually makes Tesla’s price look reasonable, even though Tesla currently trades in a market with record high average P/E.\n\n**Market cap**\n\nOne last note - market cap. Yes, Tesla’s market cap is quite high as it’s already one of the most valuable companies in the world. At $654B, if Tesla actually reached $3000 per share it would be the most valuable company in the world (unless other top companies continue to grow as well, which is likely).\nThe global market for EVs is expected to grow to $800B by 2027, from $162B in 2019. If this is accurate, and you believe Tesla retains its market share and current valuation, without expanding into other areas like ride hailing and insurance, then  the EV market ~5Xing could justify Tesla’s share price ~4.5Xing.\n\n**Tl;dr**\n\nWhile Tesla is certainly overvalued by trailing P/E, this is a somewhat flawed metric, and by looking at other metrics like forward P/E, price-to-sales, and growth rate, an argument can be made that Tesla is more-or-less fairly valued, and potentially even undervalued. This argument holds even if looking at historical examples from less frothy markets, such as FB after its IPO in 2012.\n\nLike any growth stock, Tesla is a high-risk investment, since its future share price depends on future growth of both the company and the EV space. But the potential for reward is also higher.\n\nI’m not a financial advisor and this isn’t financial advice.\nPositions: $4k in Tesla shares, $15K in ARK LEAPs", "id": "ma4uwb", "created_utc": 1616357121.0, "score": 337, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 321, "comments": [{"body": "You give one +676,868,748,383,374,380% price target and suddenly you are “Crazy” Cathie... sheesh", "score": 115, "replies": [{"body": "Quik maf cathie", "score": 25, "replies": []}, {"body": "Is...\n\nIs that actually what it is?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "... can you do maths?

I'm long on TSLA.\n\nTesla is the Apple of cars, except that they are like Apple that owns Foxconn.\n\nThey sell every single vehicle that they make.  One bigger factory is ramping up this year (Shanghai), one bigger factory is going to start production (Berlin) and one more factory will start production next year (Austin) - and these are likely a bit pessimistic timelines.\n\nTesla is making big innovations in the car manufacturing space - forming the body in two big pieces (front and back casting) instead of dozens of pieces that need to be welded or glued together like every other company (including Tesla prior to the Gigapress coming online).\n\nThere are only a few currently shipping credible competitors - Mustang EV (teething problems and battery supply constrained), Kia/Hyundai EVs (battery supply constrained), Porsche/Audi Taycan chassis (a generation or two behind in efficiency - range - and battery constrained), Toyota RAV4 PHEV (not a full EV, but a great choice, but battery constrained).  Battery constrained means the company cannot make enough vehicles to sell because they do not have batteries; I'm not talking about battery range here.\n\nAll of VW's new products on the MEB platform are fine if you're talking 2 generations ago competing with a Nissan Leaf.  They are too slow to be credible.  VW also did shady sales tactics to goose the year end sales numbers last year to make the ID.3/4 launch look good.  In Europe most of those sales are into sales channels (i.e. car dealers) and not customers.  Customers have not taken a bunch of deliveries of the ID models because it is an inferior product.\n\nRenault Zoe (EU only) is a good product but is in the EU city car class.  It's more like a Fiat 500e sized vehicle (also a good product but battery supply constrained).  GM's Wuling (China only) is also a good product but it is kei-car sized and a lot of customers buy it to replace a moped.\n\nGood luck to the new competitors trying to get off the ground (Rivian and Lucid have the best chance of actually delivering product).\n\nThe biggest issue for all these EV makers, from Ford to GM to Porsche (VW) is battery supply.  The second biggest issue is battery cost.\n\nOne cannot overestimate the advantage of having your own battery production factories.  None of the competitors have that.  I'm not sure if anyone is even planning to develop it (maybe only VW).  Most of them cannot develop battery production because of the capex involved - here is where you can leverage a high stock price into a competitive advantage.\n\nLike Apple with things like screens or small hard drives (iPod), Tesla was an early mover on also buying batteries from 3rd party suppliers (Panasonic, CATL, etc.).  Apple gobbled up all the parts years in advance because they knew they could sell all the iPods/iPhones that it would go into.  Other companies could not bank on such sales projections and therefore could not buy tons of components.  Ergo they could design a great product but they could not get access to parts to build it and sell it.   All these other EV makers will fight amongst themselves for the limited battery supply left over after the Tesla purchases.  And lets not forget that Tesla will soon make its own batteries and lower its kwh costs versus the competition.\n\nApple does not dominate the phone market share - it just makes the most money from it.  Part of this is their walled garden subscription model.  I'm actually bearish on FSD as it relates to robotaxi but FSD as a monthly subscription model would work nicely.  \n\nThe other part of the company that gets overlooked is energy.  And not 5 years into the future energy stuff (big battery farms, making money from energy price arbitrage).  I'm talking about basic stuff like good old solar panels, not even the fancy solar tile stuff.  Tesla currently is the lowest cost company for putting solar panels on your house, for most (if not all) of the US.  ROI is about 7 years for most areas of the country.  Lots of densely populated areas are thinking of requiring all new builds to have solar.\n\nIn short I'm long on Tesla because\n\n\\- insane consumer demand (sells all it builds), plus insane future demand (cybertruck and semi)\n\n\\- more production capacity coming online than anyone else (perhaps even the entire car industry combined)\n\n\\- gigapress is a major innovation and cost reducer in the industry\n\n\\- makes its own batteries while competitors are supply constrained\n\n\\- currently dominates solar sales to end users\n\nJust the above is enough for a PT of 1k by EOY imo.

Goldman Sachs have about the same estimates for 2025 - they estimate about 120 milliion cars sold.  \n\n\nLets say 100 million cars sold - that would mean 10% of all cars sold in 2025 will be a Tesla.

Cooling the motors is a nonstarter, if you can keep brake rotors cool with air you can keep in-wheel motors cool the same way, even if you have to go with fans like on some high-performance racing vehicles when needed at low speed. Liquid cooling could definitely be in the future for high-powered applications; Elaphe does make some seriously powerful motors. That said, I do expect the Endurance to utilize some form of active cooling in the future, at least for work-truck models.\n\nAptera is using the same type of motors and have undergone fairly extensive road testing, and are nearly ready to roll out the first batch of cars. Lordstown trucks are even easier to make since they aren't optimizing for range and efficiency; it's just a truck frame, batteries, and motors. That's it. No motor/transmission engineering, no drivetrain; all cost savings. Roll that into the RV deal with Camping World and you've got another sellable product before the first even rolls off the line, and you can kit the hell out of the camper with solar panels for virtually unlimited range. \n\nHonestly, I'm really more bullish on Elaphe than either of the two. The motor tests are extremely impressive! Like I mentioned, you likely won't find the motors in a racing vehicle, but they are more than adequate for your typical passenger vehicle and you should expect to find them on more cars in the future.\n\nAs for mass production, I don't see them competing in the short term to beat out Big 3 sales, but it's a massive foothold and a genuine success story. When they do start rolling off the line they will have the single best vantage point to dominate the off-road EV space, being years ahead of any large competitors. I fully expect GM or Ford to straight-up buy them out in the future, and at that point whoever does throws their engineering and manufacturing know-how full force into making them at existing factories. I'm more bullish with GM on that end, what with saving face over the Nikola acquisition debacle, but also because the Endurance even looks like a Silverado replacement. I wouldn't count Ford out on gobbling it up though.\n\nMind you I don't have a RIDE position, but I do like the stock and think it's got amazing potential. The price point is also very reasonable, although it may be sold at a loss at that price to get market penetration. Kind like what GM did with the first Corvette-8 model because people weren't quite sure about it with a mid-engine layout.\n\nRegardless, in-wheel motors simplify the entire design of EVs and you should expect to see them in more cars in the future, perhaps even in a more consumer-friendly Tesla model.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Aptera - A lightweight car should not be compared to the endurance. The forces you are dealing with are much less which likely makes a huge difference.\n\nUnsprung weight... I don't know. When every person who has designed autos says unsprung weight is bad and then someone comes along and says, well if that unsprung weight is a motor in each wheel it is not a big deal without proving that (I don't care about their claims of miles driven... probably something like their claims of pre-sales) is simply ridiculous to buy that claim. I am looking for vehicles out there that use Elaphe motors and can't find anything. They made a test mule. Nice. Again, not a mass produced vehicle and frankly the demos of it they show are of minimal value.\n\nFurther, in wheel motors seems to really limit how you can build the motors. I don't know, but something about EV's tells me that efficiency is critical. The Endurance just does not seem will be very efficient.\n\nOh, also is really a centrally located motor (especially if your motor is the size of the one Lucid claims to have) with a diff and axle really more expensive and less convenient than two in wheel motors (with in wheel motors you need two minimally for front or rear wheel drive, whereas you can have one regular motor instead).\n\nFYI, there is no need for a transmission with an EV in any case. The only time you would need a transmission is if you want a gear for high speed and one for low speed, which RIDE anyways is not designed for. Bottom line, I am not sure the cost saving claims make sense in the first place.\n\nMy point about mass production is not whether they have a factory (well if a factory is all it took, then where is all the big automakers EV pickup trucks?), but rather they can actually figure out how to build these trucks and motors properly. I just don't see it happening. I mean the moron in the hard hat and his shiny yellow jacket straight-up lied about pre-orders in order to jack up the stock price (if the company is on such solid ground no idea why he would have felt a need to do that), but I guess you should believe him about some hard to achieve claims.\n\nBottom line, you are not simplifying the  design, rather you are creating many more complications to how you build it. A motor in the center with an open diff (a small device) connected to two metal shafts that turn the wheels, is pretty simple already. Needing two motors is already a complication. Adding unsprung weight is not good. The performance attributes of a design limited by the wheel, with no  ability to use reduction gears, is questionable. The overengineering of the wheel to get this motor in also makes no sense. Finally, the greater forces that will act on the wheel when you hit a bump or pothole also don't make things  better.\n\nWhen I first saw the design, I thought it was brilliant as it seemed to simplify things, but the more I dig, the less it makes sense.

If they left them in the driveway the lifelong efficiency approaches 100%, but they aren't very useful.\n\n>but rather they can actually figure out how to build these trucks and motors properly\n\nThey aren't building the motors, and truck frames are about as simple as you can get. People literally make them by hand in custom shops. As for making them crash-safe, everyone uses FEA programs, it's nothing secret that only the Big 3 have access to.\n\n>Needing two motors is already a complication.\n\nAnd a powertrain isn't? You've got electric motors either way, adding more and heavier powertrain components makes the design more complicated, not less. Can't get much more simple than the wheel being literally the only moving part.\n\n>Finally, the greater forces that will act on the wheel when you hit a bump or pothole also don't make things better.\n\nHigher unsprung weight means there is less wear-and-tear on the vehicle, not more. Your tires take the brunt of the impulse forces because it's harder to move the entire assembly. Matching springs and struts to the extra weight is a trivial matter of course.\n\nAnd since you can't find an Elaphe use case I'll just leave this here: https://cleantechnica.com/2018/10/03/elaphe-in-wheel-drive-audi-r8-0-60-cleantechnicaexclusive/", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I am aware of the Audi R8 they built and the 5 second video they showed.

The forces of those impact are going to make it harder to engineer your motor as it has to stand up to stronger forces. You have more wear and tear, not less.\n\nUnsprung mass means your brakes wear out faster as well, so it makes your vehicle less safe.\n\nAnd your comment about efficiency makes no sense. No one is talking about leaving it in the driveway as that has nothing to do with efficiency. Efficiency is being able to do more with less, not sitting around doing nothing.\n\nThe rest is just getting ridiculous. If EV's were so easy to build everyone would be doing it and no one would care about RIDE's ridiculous claims. You are talking about two motors on a Endurance for one motor by a competitor. You can't simply wave your hand and ignore the cost difference of two versus one motors and say well, that two motors makes more sense then some drivetrain components. The cost of a second motor is most likely going to be more expensive then a piece of metal to connect the motor to the wheel. This line of thinking just makes no sense. \n\nTell me, since you think what they are doing makes sense, what is the cost of two of their motors versus the cost of a single motor and a few pieces of metal to connect that to both wheels.

If you thought that was some sort of Tesla exclusive you'd be just as remissed being told you don't understand impulse response in a dynamic system and why unsprung weight in a big ass truck literally does not matter with critically damped suspension.\n\nAs for cost, electric motors are dirt cheap because they are extremely simple. It's why we use them for pretty much everything instead of any other alternative. Endurance needs 4 of the same hub motors. Does Tesla even use the same motors for front and rear applications? Tesla also needs the power transfer units, so that's another two different parts made in two different plants. And the axles, can't forget those, also probably different parts for front and back. Cradle casters, pretty important. Several factories all involved in just the powertrain, and you still have to assemble those parts, and then assemble the cradle assemblies before they can even think about taking them to the assembly line to put in a car.\n\nMeanwhile at Lordstown: hub motors come in, hub motors get bolted into the knuckle at the end of the line and the tires go on.

There is one single thing separate motors gives you that you can't achieve with a single motor easily and that is you can have the wheels spin opposite directions. Would allow a tighter turning radius.\n\nAlso, power transfer units? Tesla's are either rear wheel drive (single motor) or four wheel drive (dual or tri motor... tri motor allows for torque vectoring). You are just making stuff up.\n\nOf course you are likely correct that Tesla's design requires a few more steps to assemble the drive train. The amount of work and cost though associated with that may very well cost less then having to put in extra motors. In any case, the in wheel design is an unproven design that inherently makes less sense.
