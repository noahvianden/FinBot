Playing the tape over and over in your head is a torturous poison that winds up leading to more bad decisions than good ones down the road. I used to do it all the time and it would drive me nuts and it would suck. The best thing you can do is try to figure out your risk/reward tolerance and try to be as consistent as possible with that structure. If you let yourself trade emotionally instead of objectively you will usually get burnt. Its unreasonable to expect to time the bottom and the top. If you figure out a strategy that works for your particular pallet for risk and similarly a strategy as to what point you take profits, that is the personal homerun and something that you can repeat. Ive struggled with that but finally got better at it over the past couple months and have been making much better moves as a result. I had 24 rocket contracts through earnings. Some expired worthless on friday but i had 18 good til March 19th. i wound up selling most of them on monday when they doubled. only had a few left going into tuesday. Every contract that I sold was worth over 1k more on tuesday than i sold them for the for on monday.  But you cant look at the what ifs and beat yourself up too much. Any winning trade is a good one. Just some could always be better if you hold...hahah but they could also be a bust if it moves away from you. So dont buy and and sell everything at one time. it puts too much pressure on timing and will always leave room for you to play back the tape and beat yourself up about the what if. It makes for a very unhealthy phsycological relationship with trading.  If you could keep as much emotion out of it and be able to stay objective you will have much more success I promise!!!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I really appreciate this man, seriously, thank you.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Its my pleasure man. My cousin was the one who talked me off the ledge so speak...lol put it in perspective that I can't have unrealistic expectations and put so much pressure and criticism on yourself to time bottoms and tops. And hes right. only a couple lucky trades get executed at tops and bottoms but as long as you are somewhere close you can do well. Hes an investor and im a gambler at heart so it has been hard to get out of that all or nothing mentality... but it is certainly doable... you just need to do some soul searching and figure yourself out so you could target things that work for you. I have a very high risk tolerance (because of the gambler in me.lol) but I have tried to balance out a percentage of my portfolio that goes into options and potential homerun types of plays. But most of it is in stocks that I like the story or think they are a good value and things that i am willing to hold for a while in case they move away from you. And then like 20% or so goes towards the gamble types of plays. Like short term options and short swing trades. Its enough juice that its fun and exciting but not enough to blow up your account.  Discipline is key so that one bad day or bad week doesnt set you back too far where you cant recover without a lot of help and good moves. if you go 50% down in your total portfolio, then you would need to make 100% return on that remaining 50% to get back to where you were. Managing risk is probably the most important part of the discipline game. But either way its all about learning about yourself and what trades you are actually capable of doing and executing. And once you get a decent bead on that (and it certainly takes time and you will make many mistakes along the way but if you learn from those mistakes it can protect you from more expensive ones in the future) you will have a much more enjoyable trading experience and the stress goes down dramatically!!\n\nI know this was long winded but I read your post and our brought me back to that dark place where I have been many a times and i remembered how much it sucks and seeing ticker symbols and percentages in my sleep...lol it fucken sucks and it stressful and it makes the whole experience so much more negative and stressful in real time than positive or passive. So I just wanted to send a motivational word that you are certainly not alone and that there is a better way to be involved in the action without it taking away from your quality of life and becoming an obsession. You just have to spend time and actively focus on how you can trade and not how you could or would like to have in fleeting moments that pass. Dont beat yourself to much about shit you probably never would have realistically done and certainly dont beat yourself up about a trade that was profitable. Greed is the characteristic that breeds losers. I learned that from years of gambling and the market certainly enforces that :) \n\nThe take away from all of this is that I dont stress and obsess even 10% as much as I used to and my overall quality of life is better and my portfolio does better. I make less mistakes and decisions that are solely impulse driven and its easier to stay objective and that is the key.  Dont get me wrong i still fuck up all time. we are human. But as long as you learn and dont keeping making the same mistakes, it makes you stronger and more confident in understanding your style. So stay the course and pay more attention to your emotions and psychology for when you are down in a trade and up in one and see the patterns and then you can find a way to structure moves that can shield you from them or better understand how you are going to feel in these common and reoccuring situations.  Understanding your emotions throughout these evolutions is super helpful because you can get familiar and better prepare for them. You wont be overwhelmed by the element of surprise and you will make many less impulsive decisions which are usually bad for you market wise. So stay the course and I wish you much luck and success brother. But I most especially wish you peice of mind!

I chose strike 26, which means that if the price goes above $26 I agree that I will sell the shares at $26 regardless of the actual price.  For this contract, I was paid a $72 premium. That premium is mine to keep no matter what.  \n3.  Price already had gone way above $26.  If the buyer of my contract exercises the contract or if the stock price is above $26 a share at the end of Friday, I will owe 100 shares to the contract buyer.  They will owe me exactly $2600.  \n4.  Since I already have 100 shares, they will get called away and the $2600 will be put in my account.\n5.

(It's used to determine a stock's value based on trailing earnings while also taking the company's future earnings growth into account, and is considered to provide a more complete picture than the P/E ratio). The PEG ratio enhances the P/E ratio by adding in expected earnings growth into the calculation.\n\no\tA lower PEG may indicate that a stock is undervalued. According to well-known investor Peter Lynch, a company's P/E and expected growth should be equal, which denotes a fairly valued company and supports a PEG ratio of 1.0. A PEG less than 1.0 is considered undervalued, while a PEG over 1.0 is considered overvalued\n\n&#x200B;\n\n•\tRevenue has been on an up-trend, increasing every year:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d60d8hs29pk61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=65876c7e01a79bc84b7cb99d3a7edc4260df4d8c\n\n \n\n**Shares Sold Short & Put/ Call Ratio**\n\n•\t$RKT is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market as of right now with a short float of 39.7% as of 2/12\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgwfggb39pk61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea741ccf912d4a7726ff75ebf22a0267b8a40f27\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Management Team/ Leadership**\n\n•\tA look into $RKT’s culture from u/The_Big_Short_2020: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt\\_dd\\_part\\_ii\\_a\\_former\\_employees\\_take\\_on\\_rockets/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpg7d/rkt_dd_part_ii_a_former_employees_take_on_rockets/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bullish Case/Upside/ Positives/Strengths/ MOAT/ Advantages/ Growth/ Opportunities/ Catalysts** \n\n•\tHomebuilder stocks are doing well, indicating strong demand residential real estate buyers.

That leaves 25 million free trading shares. Shorts have committed to deliver 43 million. Shares traded the last two days is 85 million.

Nothing wrong with either of those stocks, I really like both with Apple advancing into their own computer processors and cars and Microsoft just dominating my office job (Outlook, Word, Teams, etc) and just killing it in the pandemic. Just make sure you check out ETF holdings so you know your potential overlap. If you want a portfolio that is 25% Apple and 25% Microsoft, there’s nothing wrong with that (invest in what you know) but just know that carries more risk than VTI where the top holdings are Apple (5.3%) and Microsoft (4.6%), but you also own hundreds of other stocks at 1% and below, so this one ETF is basically a massively diversify your portfolio. \n\nIf you want to “prove him wrong” and beat out his 0.5% high yield savings, just dumping it all in VTI will pretty much do this. You want to be more risky, throw some QQQM or QQQJ in there. You want to be even more risky, ARKF (fintech) is really good in that time frame and possibly weed stocks. For you, ARKG is the genomics ARK ETF and could be life/world changing in 10-20 years. I also personally like nuclear, though idk if that nuclear etf is my favorite (for me it’s more a hedge on the 2 individual nuclear stocks I’ve picked after doing research into the sector). The only risk here is a market turn, but people who have spent the last 10 years predicting a crash have missed out thousands in gains. There was a “correction” in 2018 and another with the covid 19 pandemic. Even putting in at the peak right before both of those, you’d be back on top already. 2008s crash (~50% drop) took 5 years to recover just to add. However, it took 5 years for people who didn’t touch their money and didn’t invest more. Plenty of people had cash on the side, “bought the dip” to average down or take advantage of the sale, and they could have recovered even quicker. If you do ever buy the dip, do make sure to put a little in at a time since is is almost impossible to know where the actual bottom is. \n\nIf you really want to stick with Apple and Microsoft, you can certainly do individual stocks, that just caries more risk than doing the ETFs.  VGT is 21.8% Apple and 16.1% MSFT with the third highest being Nvidia at 3.1%, so quite a drop there. This would be the “diversified way” of buying heavy into Apple and Microsoft. It has a 0.10% expense ratio by the way, so still very cheap (ARK ETFs are 0.75% which is high, but when they do a 150% growth year, people don’t complain). I will add this in too, ARKK, ARKQ, and ARKW are all very heavy on Tesla stock. I’m a bit of a Tesla bear, so it keeps me from putting more into those ETFs.

You talked about companies being valued based on future prospects - they did this to avoid bankruptcy. The future prospects of the company at the end of last year when 178 million shares were issued is that the company wouldn't survive another year, and now it's doing the bare minimum to survive by issuing more debt and equity for a year while generating miniscule revenue because of covid that won't cover their expenses.

By way of comparison, the multiple was 32.3 in March 2001, as the tech wreck bear market really got going; and 32.6 in September 1929. Investors always think they can get out before the peak is in. History rhymes.\n\nP/E is backward looking, and earnings have been depressed by the pandemic.  Earnings are expected to grow by 23% in 2021, which will drive P/E back down if stocks go up less than that.

I still haven't sold a share because of it. Our daily discussions started as making guesses at EOD numbers, but up or down we were a group of people that were united by a love of the stock and Elon. I made a post this morning poking fun at paper hands selling the stock down to $725 to $705 and it got downvoted to -5 before slowly coming up (-1 now) but a year ago that would have been golden.

Today, Tesla's market cap sits around 700B USD.  My wild guess is that it could reach 4-5x this level by 2030-2031 (2.8-3.5 Trillion), but that depends on them continuing to successfully lay the groundwork for domination in transport, energy, and autonomy.

Some facilities had to be shut down, workers laid off, expansion plans delayed. Lots of teeth grinding at the C-suite level of chip-makers.\n- As a result these chip-makers put legacy auto on their customer shit-list, served after everyone else: \"New orders? Expansion? Please form an orderly queue and here's the new 5-year guaranteed purchase agreement to sign, thank you very much.\"\n- There's no way for legacy auto to get enough chips until late 2021 or so, maybe.\n\nTesla auto chip usage:\n\n- Tesla has a dream systems design using effectively a single central computer that does everything - with only very few & insignificant exceptions.\n- Tesla uses \"dumb\" sensors wherever possible, and keeps smarts in the central controller. (ECU)\n- Tesla uses consumer grade electronics - and is cooling/heating it and uses a Faraday cage to turn it into a automotive garde platform.\n- Tesla didn't cancel chip & board orders in 2020 - they have a single board assembly manufacturer who was ramping up for the GF3 expansion anyway. Tesla has a single waver producer - Samsung - and didn't cancel HW3 chip orders either.\n- By all means Tesla is a perfect chip customer: not only didn't cancel orders in 2020 but grew, expected to grow 50% per year for the next decade, and is buying high complexity designs with commodity consumer grade electronics - with good margins and a robust multi-leg supply chain.\n\nThe Samsung Texas ice storm wafer production interruption - speculated to have lasted a few days, possibly causing the 2-day Fremont shutdown, is entirely separate from the big \"legacy auto chip shortage\" problem which is a long-lasting supply problem.\n\nTesla, as usual, hedged their 2021 forward looking statements with a \"possible semiconductor shortage\" language - but **per the thesis & assumptions above, Tesla's robustness against semiconductor chip shortages should be a lot higher than legacy auto.**", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "This is excellent summary to get started.

The pandemic hit everything really hard, and now we are  looking at a potential recovery going into 2021. We saw a huge dip in  the market last week despite **GME** and **AMC**  surging big-time. We've been watching the market do a ton of swings,  with Marijana stocks surging briefly, then dying off, and now there's  been a huge sell-off in the Tech sector--I believe because the market is  transitioning to the Travel sector and not necessarily because of anything fundamentally wrong with the Tech sector.\n\nCoincidentally,  I've also been doing a lot of research into the housing market because I  am looking to move this year into a new home, thanks to the blessing of a well-paying job that allowed me to work from home throughout the pandemic. I noticed some significant trends and parallels with major,  historic economic events that are going to change the landscape of our  economy for decades. In summary, I believe we are on the cusp of a new house market collapse that will mirror and possibly overshadow what we experienced in the 2008 Sub Prime Mortgage crisis.\n\nIf you are a well-versed ape who knows their shit when it comes to the  American housing market and how it affects the economy, feel free to skip all this history and go find the stock picks that you can start drawing your green crayon charts with.\n\n# Important References\n\n**The major economic events I am referencing that are most relevant to my research are as follows:**\n\n* The Great Depression (A.K.A. GD)\n* Home Owners' Refinancing Act of 1933 (which pulled us out of it)\n* The New Deal's Wagner-Steagall Housing Act of 1937 (Also helped in the recovery)\n* The Great Recession of 2007\n* The Sub-Prime Mortgage Crises of 2008\n* The Recession Scare of 2016\n\n# Great Depression & and the Covid 2019 pandemic\n\n**This part is going to be a long analysis on past events on the history of  American Economy in support of this analysis. If you don't care about it  or already know, skip it.**\n\nThe most significant economic event in US history was The Great Depression (GD) which began in 1929. Most people don't really understand the real cause.  The main trigger of the GD was that growing industries at  that time which focused on the manufacturing of cheap goods and had historically (at that time) performed really well, were suddenly starting to suffer from consumer lag, meaning nobody was buying their products. Despite this, stocks in many consumer goods and luxuries continued to rise, and the \"Roaring Twenties\" had an overwhelming feeling of optimism. The average debt of American citizens was rising as we began to widely adopt a culture of buying on credit, something we still do heavily today. When people fall into debt, they tighten their belts and stop buying frivolously in order to save money for the essentials.\n\nThe Crash finally happened on \"Black Tuesday\" because Wall Street realized that the optimism of the market was no longer feasible, and began selling off shares in huge numbers. Margin buyers (those who buy stocks on credit)  snapped up the \"opportunity\" and basically borrowed the shares with money they could not afford.\n\nSuddenly,  on October 29th, the floor fell out beneath the entire market, and anyone buying on margin was completely wiped out. Consumer debt went through the roof, and everyone scrambled to pull their money out of the banks in order to hold onto what cash they had ... all on the same day.\n\nThe banks' vaults were completely wiped out, and when people could not withdraw their money because there was none to withdraw, and the banks could not call in on the debts of people because the banks themselves had no funds to transfer. The entire economy collapsed instantly.  Companies could not afford to buy materials on credit, meaning they could not do business. Businesses closed, and hundreds of thousands of  Americans became jobless overnight, and this was only in the first few months. Homelessness became rampant as hundreds of thousands of  Americans defaulted on their mortgages in the following years. This will be important later.\n\n# How the Covid Pandemic Compares to the Great Depression\n\n**The Covid Pandemic is an exact replica of the events preceding the GD**, but simply masked by different causes. Because of the Covid Pandemic, over 500,000 Americans are dead, mostly seniors, and [unemployment has completely skyrocketed](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R46554.pdf) beyond 14.8% (as of April 2020), though it finally calmed down to roughly 6.7%, though the accuracy of that information is shakey at best because it does not include people who have stopped looking for jobs or have fallen out of the sight of the statistics because they have been rendered homeless.\n\n**The  Covid 19 pandemic essentially triggered a massive and instantaneous halt on consumer spending because so many Americans have lost their jobs--the same trigger that caused the GD. The reason this has not led to a complete collapse of the economy is because of two reasons:**\n\n1. **The  Stimulus Package released last year was almost entirely directed towards businesses in order to prop up the economy. Despite the fact that 20% of Americans are delinquent on rent, and 32% of Americans are late on mortgage payments a vast majority of the stimulus went into businesses and investors that would inject the money into the stock market.**\n2. **The moratorium on rent, federal student loans, and mortgage payments, has given Americans a brief respite to recover in the wake of an unprecedented unemployment crisis as a direct result of the pandemic. The money from the stimulus SHOULD have gone to these individuals so they could pay their rent and utilities to avoid an inevitable housing crisis, this action is basically a crutch holding up Americans while they accumulate a massive amount of debt on rent and utilities that they will never be able to pay back. When the moratorium ends, it will be a complete catastrophe.**\n\n# Crawling out of depression via mortgages and bonds\n\n**Skip this if you don't care about how important mortgages and bonds are to the US economy**\n\nThe US in the 1930s under Franklin D. Roosevelt took massive steps to rebuild the American economy using Mortgages as the foundation of it. [The Home Owners' Refinancing Act of 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeowners_Refinancing_Act)  enabled the American public to secure their homes by using the federal government as the backer for thousands of mortgages, which guaranteed financial security for the banks. This allowed the banks to give the average American the credit to afford a home and secure employment with affordable refinancing. By the mid 1930s, 20% of urban America successfully refinanced their homes, and the depression began making its turn-around. Basically, all of America now relies on mortgages as a sign of economic health, which became the start of the real \"American Dream\" of owning a home in the 1950s and persists today.\n\nAnother way we crawled out was because of US Treasury Bonds, and *ironically* thanks to World War II. Selling bonds is how the US Treasury builds capital to fund huge policies. The prime example of this was the mass sale of **War Bonds** during World War II, which **helped contribute to our pulling out of the GD**. As soon as we went to war in 1941, [more than 80 million Americans purchased war bonds to bring in $180 Billion in revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warbonds.asp) instantaneously.\n\n# What is a bond? How does it work?\n\nBonds are essentially an investment in the US government and are generally considered safe. When you buy a 5 year bond say at $100 at a 2% yield,  the bond pays you back 2 dollars for each year you hold the bond. Bonds are \"generally\" safe because they don't lose their value; however, in cases where inflation goes through the roof, bonds \"lose\" money because inflation outpaces the rate of return on the bond. If in 2 years, inflation rises by 6% when the rate of return of my bond is 2%, then I  basically lost 2 dollars in the exchange of my bond. This usually doesn't happen, and supposedly American inflation is secure, but that remains to be seen.\n\nIn any case, when bonds are the better pick, the stock market usually halts, which is what happened back during World War II; however, this was because America pulled together to fight what they believed to be the greatest evil of their time. Even Wall Street got a piece of it, and because of that historical trend, when bonds go up, stocks go down. The reason this happens is that when bond yields go up significantly, investors tend to choose bonds because they are safer. That being said, the market reaction to the bond yield rising is pure speculation and unlikely to indicate the market is failing *so far*, but it DOES signal what the US Government is trying to do.\n\nRecently, the stock market has been flying high because of the monetary injections from the stimulus. Everyone is feeling REALLY excited, or they have been up until recently. The market took a HUGE dip on Thursday  (25th) as a result of news that US Treasury Bonds had increased their yield percentage.\n\n# The problem with bonds today and the economic debt situation\n\nConfidence in the US Government is generally not good right now. Our situation today is very different from 1941. Presently, civil unrest for different reasons which we are all aware, have divided the nation, and the response from the government has not inspired much confidence.\n\nThat being said, bond sales are *extremely unlikely* to be as steady, or voluminous as they were in 1941, and that is going to force the Treasury to act more drastically in raising the yields. The stock market is going to suffer for it, probably, but more than anything the American Government is going to be setting itself up for disaster.\n\nThe US Government is increasing yields on bonds because they are preparing for an inevitable disaster where they are going to need massive amounts of capital to cover the American public when this housing crisis occurs. They would prefer to cover this expense with domestic capital rather than getting loans from its economic partners. That is because they have seen this before, but now we have the knowledge of history and the signals of an impending crisis. I mean... hell, it's obvious at this point.\n\nThe reason is that America is going to have to print HUGE amounts of money to pay back the bonds that are bought with what I think are historically higher yields than we've ever seen before. This will drive up inflation, but it would not increase the US Debt. I believe that as a result, the US government may put in a situation where it must pay huge sums of money in order to prop up the economy as we go through the upcoming crisis, they are going to do what they have always done...\n\n*Borrow borrow borrow*\n\nWe borrow money, mainly from European allies and China. This is having a detrimental effect on the world's confidence in America's economy, and it is likely going to fall out eventually. In a worst-case scenario, China may call upon America to pay back its debt, though it is unlikely because it would hurt their economy significantly as well.\n\nNevertheless, China is now the forerunner of the world economy, having completely overshadowed the global market in consumer goods and manufacturing industries. They are also surging ahead in tech and healthcare/pharmaceuticals--historically US-based industries. I don't necessarily believe China would demand a payback when we couldn't possibly do it, they *may* refuse to loan more to the USA, and that will be the trigger of the crisis which I'm about to explain.\n\n# Parallels to the Subprime Mortgage Crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession\n\n**For those of you who have seen \"The Big Short\" or studied the 2008 Financial Crisis and know about this, feel free to skip.**\n\nFrom 2000 to 2006, because of some highly unscrupulous actions taken by mortgage-lending banks, huge banks like Morgan Stanley and Lehman (which collapsed) accumulated a massive amount of uncovered risk in the form of \"Collateralized Debt Obligations\" or CDOs. A [CDO](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032315/were-collateralized-debt-obligations-cdo-responsible-2008-financial-crisis.asp)  is basically a package of loans that pays back premiums to investors. In the case of the 2008 mortgage crisis, lending banks were selling massive amounts of extremely poor quality or \"Sub Prime Loans\" to people who they knew were highly likely to default (fail to pay the mortgage and lose their house). The housing market was in a huge bubble because small and mid-sized banks were willing to lend INSANE sums of money for people to buy houses. These banks would then bundle up the sub-prime loans along with really good or safe loans, known as AAA (Triple-A) or Prime mortgages. The small banks would then sell these packages of loans for huge, lump sums to the big banks, who would assume control of the interest and premium payments in the form of a CDO, but the CDO would be marked as AAA-rated despite being made up of more than 14% of B-rated mortgages or worse.\n\nBanks continued to do this en-masse, bundling huge amounts of bad loans, until they made up more than 14% of the CDO packages. We're talking BILLIONS of dollars in horrendous, subprime mortgages that were almost guaranteed to fail.\n\nBy mid-2007, defaults on loans were through the roof, and more than 14% of the loans in these CDOs were in default. People were losing their homes en-masse, and yet banks continued this terrible lending practice. Some investors took notice and began buying up short positions known as \"[Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp)\" (CDS) on these bad loans. A CDS is basically like buying insurance against a default, meaning that if the majority of these mortgages defaulted, the person who shorted them would earn a massive payout the same way you are paid insurance if your home burns to the ground.\n\nThe combination of overwhelming mortgage defaults along with the massive sums of short positions taken up against the American Housing market and the banks that facilitated it completely bankrupted some banks. In the aftermath, the stock market plummeted, bank and hedge fund managers were among over 5,000 new suicides in 2009 in the wake of the disaster that ruined them and their clients financially. The US government was forced to step in and bail out big banks like Morgan Stanley, AIG, and many others in order to prevent a total economic collapse.\n\nAs you might have guessed, average Americans never saw a penny of it. Millions of people lost their homes, jobs, and their lives. It was an instantaneous and disastrous crisis that only could be compared to the GD, despite how brief it was.\n\nWe are now facing an identical, inevitable, and exponentially worse scenario by September 2021...\n\n# How the market is going to collapse by September (without intervention)\n\nAs I mentioned in my references above, over 32% of home-owners and 20% of renters in America are delinquent on payments. Banks are already feeling the pinch because nobody is making payments, but the government has forced them to eat it and say \"tough shit\" until the pandemic is over. [The losses are astronomical](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/14/833920538/americas-largest-bank-jpmorgan-chase-prepares-for-massive-round-of-defaults).\n\nHow  I feel personally about these banks is irrelevant, and I do think they are evil incarnate, the fact that nobody can pay their mortgages is a REALLY BAD THING. The problem is that the government only told banks they can't force anyone to pay, nobody can be evicted, and yet the debt continues to grow.\n\n**Without intervention, this is what is going to happen...**\n\nWhen the moratorium on ~~mortgages and~~ rent finally goes, the American economy is going to collapse under the weight of displaced residents, and the stock market will see a massive pullback from the economic burden. Due to evictions, they won't be able to qualify for mortgages or homes, and rent qualifications will be just as shaky. The end-result is pretty much identical to what we saw in 2008 in terms of debt to income ratio, and the lack of secured housing for millions of Americans. Wall Street and the banks  are doing everything they can to hedge against their inevitable losses from this, but when the defaults finally happen, we can expect more than  [9% of Americans to default](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-speculative-grade-default-rate-seen-rising-to-9-by-september-2021-8211-s-p-61424480)\n\n>**Edit note:** I did not correctly interpret forbearance and debt accumuluation. I have come to realize that mortgage forbearance allowed home-owners to cease all payments and defer them entirely. This protection only applies to home-owners though. Renters do not have this protection, and are expected to pay back their debts in full. I still believe that many home owners on B, BB, and BBB-rated loans may have their backs broken by the pandemic regardless and still default on their mortgages. Defaults are still very high, and without intervention, this will break the back of the US economy. Thanks to the degenerates who pointed this out to me.\n\nUnless billions of dollars are injected into the banks in order to cover their losses, on the condition that all delinquent American home owners and renters are COMPLETELY FORGIVEN, this is inevitable, and it is already affecting us.\n\n# What the housing market is doing now and what is about to happen\n\nThe housing market has been a \"seller's market\" bubble since May. I know, because I sold my last home at a 45% profit, despite the pandemic in September. I have been looking for a new home to move out of state since December while renting an affordable apartment to accumulate money for a down payment.\n\nWhile doing my research on homes to move to, I watched houses in the area I was hoping to move drop by an average of 20% in asking price since January. Most American home owners aren't stupid, they know what is coming, and they know they won't be able to pay.\n\nAs of December, housing inventory was 1.06 Million homes, down from 1.5 Million in June. Everyone is currently saying \"We're running out of homes\" which has been driving the prices of homes and number of mortgages higher than ever at historically low-interest rates. In the last month, home construction costs being at relatively low prices depending on the area) have allowed property developers, especially on the west coast and rural America to build massive amounts of single and multi-family homes averaging over $400,000 with a 15% profit margin on building costs. Land development and realty companies are looking to take advantage of the seller's market, thinking that they can build enough homes in time to sell at record-high prices. All this sounds like great things for the housing market, but it's about to all come to an end.\n\n>***Edit Note***\\*: I made statements here which implied that construction costs on new houses were down for everyone. This is not true for the average home buyer, but\\* ***might*** *be true for* ***development companies*** *in areas with easy access to lumber (such as OR, WA, CA, ID, etc). I was misled based on new-home costs in these states, which have easy access to cheap lumber, despite the downturn, and new homes are being built in massive numbers. I appreciate those who pointed this error out to me.* [Some data I was linked](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST)\n\nAccording to [Black Knight](https://www.blackknightinc.com/blog-posts/slowdown-in-rate-of-forbearance-improvement/), 5.2% of mortgages are in forbearance pending the end of the pandemic protections with a total of 2.7M homes facing default when the forbearance ends. ~~Every one of those people is going to be expected to pay back absolutely everything as soon as the moratorium ends~~ *~~in full~~*~~.~~\n\n**Edit**\n\n>This statement was inaccurate. Mortgage payback is being deferred to the end of loans. This does not apply to renters. Defaults are stil high, and my opinion on a crash remains the same.\n\nThe current numbers of new homes on the market is not out as of today, but based on the rate of increase from Zillow, showing an average 13.4% increase in house prices since January to December 2020, and now watching as the collective price of homes suddenly plummeted by 20% on the searches I have done, I see a flood before the comet strikes and they are forced to default. The simultaneous increased home construction and the flood of homes from Americans trying to get out is going to lead to a sudden rise of (I believe) more than 3 million homes. This is going to cause housing prices to plummet, and they already are, ahead of any data or news.\n\nFor those Americans too slow or unwilling to sell and cannot pay, eviction is the only alternative. Foreclosures will flood the market, and banks will be forced to auction at dramatically lower prices in order to avoid losing their investments to weather damage as the houses sit empty for months or years.\n\nThis will force banks to compensate their losses with higher interest rates. Variable-rate mortgages will feel the squeeze the hardest, and homeowners who were once paying 3% will, in another 2 years, likely see their mortgage interest increase significantly over time. People who are still facing struggles in a post-pandemic America will likely be forced to surrender their homes, but they will get no relief from renters, as they have been put in the same boat as the banks but without any hope of government support, as they are privately owned entities that have much less impact on the economy.\n\nDue to the rent crisis that we are already witnessing unfold, I predict landlords will be forced to raise rent prices to recover their losses from the forbearance. Worse, many will be forced to sell their property because they have their own bills to pay and no income to do so. When rent becomes impossibly high, mortgages are unobtainable, home-owners are forced to refinance at insane rates of interest, and the market inevitably floods with more homes at prices running away to near-worthlessness.\n\n# How in the F-ing hell does ANY of this awfulness have to do with stock market DD!?\n\n**This is the section you've been waiting for**\n\nThe pandemic has financially crippled the American economy, and the stimulus package that was released is currently propping everything up. In the end, I'm expecting the housing market to crash VERY Hard. However, unlike Michael Burry, I'm taking up long positions in what I believe are going to be very important businesses that will provide the necessities for Americans as the crisis unfolds.\n\n1. **Moving and Storage companies - CUBE UHAL EXR**\n\nWhen people are forced to move, the first thing they have to do is collect their belongings and put them somewhere. This crisis is going to force Americans to move out of their homes and apartments en-masse, and it's going to be an absolute brutal disaster. I believe that people are already getting ahead of this by selling off their homes, and they will start putting their stuff into places they can afford, mobile or climate-controlled storage units.\n\nI want to be clear, the idea of this is utterly depressing to me... but the first stock that is going to skyrocket ahead of the market downturn is moving companies, and storage units. U-Haul, owned my Amerco, does both, and they have packaged deals. The company has done nothing but made stupid money since it was founded post WW2. But in the years leading up to the 2008 crisis and in the 6 years after it ended, Uhaul made INSANELY STUPID money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Amerco\\/UHAL stock analysis & historical performance \\(1995-2021\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qlvlfmamfik61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4e1d14b30c267551414bc1a6be8b57944ce5e5d)\n\nBesides Amerco/UHAL, EXR (Extra Space Storage) and CUBE (CubeSmart) are both making huge moves in the market and despite being in direct competition,  typically keep to their own respective areas of the nation where they do the most business. Because of this, they don't steal each other's clients. Being national companies, they offer much better rates, on average, than private/family owned storage facilities.\n\nSince  UHAL is the only company on this list old enough to have been a  national brand at the time of the 2008 crisis, it is the only real litmus test I have pulled up for how the market will react and how they will make their money. Because CUBE is much cheaper, I have thrown my bets on them, and I anticipate good news on Monday.  \n\n\n>**Edit:**  \nMonday was a sell-off after CUBE beat earnings, and my calls dipped due to dividend-whores. Outlook is still very bullish.\n\n[My positions disclosure as of 3\\/2 \\(couldn't get off RH yet\\)](https://preview.redd.it/g7sce0l0hnk61.jpg?width=655&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=048f2078c6f0ab2937ec5dd93f478943930482b9)\n\nCUBE announced earnings this weekend, and I'm anticipating the price to rise sharply on good announcements that they strongly outpaced their earnings once the transcripts go public. At any point they dip, I have every intention to start buying up stocks, even if my calls expire worthless. This is a very LONG play, and I do not advise anyone to copy my trades unless you have the capital to spare. Just like UHaul in the wake of the pandemic, they dipped HARD, but after their latest earnings announcement, absolutely blew through the roof.\n\nOptions on CUBE are cheap right now, and I am willing to throw $800 down on that bet. Even if CUBE only goes up by $1 per share after earnings are public, that's break-even for me. I'm also expecting that other investors are going to get behind this trend and start buying up shares in these sectors as well, ahead of a mortgage crisis.\n\nIf I had more capital, I would throw money down on UHaul at the first sign of a dip, but at the present, this is what I have available. I can say the same about EXR. If I had the money, I'd diversify these calls, but I still consider this a worthwhile risk for an initial investment. I believe EXR has higher loss-tolerance because they have a higher market cap and more facilities, but fundamentally, they are identical to CUBE, with the caveat that CUBE has more facilities in high-density urban areas on average--at least according to the research I've been able to turn up.\n\nCubesmart still has solid fundamentals, they've beat earnings expectations every quarter last year, and had a 3% increase on dividends in December. With over a $7 Billion market cap, they have money to burn, and I think they'll come out huge at the end of this. Even with the pandemic hurting everyone, I am expecting a big push on Monday and the weeks to follow.\n\n2. Cheap Goods and Wholesale $OSTK $COST $WMT $AMZN\n\nMy pick here is Overstock ($OSTK), but Cost-Co Walmart and Amazon are other obvious picks for people who can afford them. Sadly, a LOT of Americans are going to be very desperate as they face homelessness and have to bargain for essentials and cheap furniture. I don't like Walmart or Amazon because I disagree with their business practices as a whole, but you can't argue with their long-term performance and their success. That being said, they're safe bets even in a post-pandemic market disaster.\n\nFundamentally, I find  Overstock is WAY undervalued at $67 per share, especially at their recent high of $102 that got rejected in August 2020. They have been absolutely crushing expectations, and the only reason I believe they are so undervalued is because of the stiff competition and attention  whoring of Amazon and walmart. At < $70, $OSTK is at a huge discount.  I plan on buying shares with them, since options are unpredictable. Currently waiting on funds to settle, but I have limit positions set at 100 shares $80 limit price.\n\nCall options on this one are higher due to recent volatility, but OTM calls a  few months out are still cheap. Assuming the price doesn't skyrocket (like I think it will in a couple months), and OSTK settles in at \\~$80  per share, I plan on buying more share and calls as soon as the market  collapses, assuming I'm right about the housing market.\n\n3. Travel industry $CAR $LUV $UAL\n\nIn the wake of the pandemic, travel industry froze overnight, which caused an immediate downturn. Nevertheless, the big names have been able to survive all this time, and some are doing better than ever now that restrictions have lifted and the market has shown its confidence by buying back into $CAR (Avis budget group) and $LUV (Southwest Airlines) hugely. I believe that $UAL (United Airlines) is lagging behind the trend at the moment because the market is awaiting reactions to a recent engine explosion that happened on a Boeing 777 flight. I am anticipating that the news is going to show that Boeing is the cause for blame, but if you are unsure, you could always do a straddle/strangle strategy on UAL. The price is likely to move sharply in one direction or the other, so it's a 50-50 shot. Fundamentally, UAL isn't going anywhere, since they service tons of international and domestic flights in the US.\n\nThe travel industry is exploding more because of people just itching to get free and travel again and not necessarily because of a housing market fiasco; however, it's worth pointing out that $CAR also owns Budget Truck, which is in the same vein as UHAL, which I've already discussed that I'm long on.\n\nFundamentally ABG is a strong company that is highly diversified across rental cars, trucks, vans, and even have rental-purchase agreements with used car dealerships which are likely to be a huge revenue stream once their older vehicles cycle out of their service lifetime. $CAR had to cut almost half its workforce because of the pandemic in order to preserve capital. They survived, and the market responded by exploding their price to $55.55, just barely under 20% of their previous ATH of $68.89. I expect them to continue to beat their previous performance, mainly because most of $CAR's competition got decimated by the pandemic and many of them still have not recovered. It's difficult to say if they will continue to move up as sharply as they have recently, but $60 OTM calls for 3/19 are absolutely within reason, in my opinion. These calls are currently very cheap at $2.15/contract, but if you're risk-averse, setting up a position to expire farther out, or simply buying a bunch of their stock while it's still reasonably priced are both good long-term strategies for me.\n\nAgain, I'm a  poor bitch, so I'm limited on capital and don't currently have a position in $CAR or $LUV, but they're both my personal picks, and I hope to place market buys as soon as my recently traded funds settle next week.\n\n# Closing thoughts\n\n**I  am also paying very close attention to the overseas healthcare, professional service, alternative energy and tech sectors, as I believe a lot of those jobs will start heading overseas as the US economy begins to tank. I'm looking at Japan, China, Taiwan, and Canada the closest.**\n\nFor the record and full disclosure, I am also holding 500 shares of AMC (TO  THE MOON!!!), which I believe will reflect the sentiment of the public ahead of travel restrictions lifting completely. If people are willing to throw money at movie theaters, people are going to start traveling soon after that, and the outlook is promising for that.\n\nThere are other sectors that are likely to do well in the wake of the upcoming economic turmoil, and you can be assured that Wall Street is well aware of them. Even if the prediction makes me feel sick, I think the best thing I can do, personally, is to do something to pull some money out of this pending disaster so that I have the funds to put back some good into the world.\n\nI'm looking for feedback on the DD, and I hope that I can get some other people's opinion on whether I might be right or wrong about this. Part of me wants to be very wrong, and I want there not to be another economic crisis, but it feels inevitable.\n\n**Edit 1 :**\n\nSeveral insightful degenerates pointed out that I made some errors in my post regarding several issues, and I have updated struckout the errors accordingly.\n\n* I was unclear in my statements about debt accumulation that led to confusion. Debt accumulation does not affect mortgages in forbearance.\n* I made a statement about the lower cost of building homes that was inaccurate \\_for the average home-buyer\\_.", "id": "lvpgzj", "created_utc": 1614645396.0, "score": 516, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 298, "comments": [{"body": "Yes, hi, I’d like a Big Mac combo with a Diet Coke.", "score": 397, "replies": [{"body": "Houses in my area are being bought for 10-20% over ask.

Here is why I made my statements specific to your points.\n\nInventory is small right now in most of America, which I did consider in my analysis, about 1 Million homes available in inventory. The inventory right now should be around 3 million according to historical levels in order to be healthy. This is the reason for the astronomical prices. \n\nPeople are taking advantage, especially people who are in debt up to their necks and see an opportunity to get out. However, I'm seeing a massive shift between home-buying and selling. Land leasing and development companies took out huge loans for building new residential areas. In the states where I looked (pacific northwest) there plans for hundreds of thousands of new homes to be built, and the inventory out there is rising fast. Proportionally, house prices are falling in these areas, except California because well... it's California. Houses are expensive in California. It's just the way it is. \n\nIf you do the math, with 9% of mortgages in default and hundreds of thousands if not millions of homes being built by land developers looking to take advantage of this seller's market, the amount of available houses is going to go up significantly over the next several months, I'm estimating well over 3 million homes will go on the market in the next few months, while at the same time, defaults continue increasing at an alarming rate until the pandemic officially ends. Remember that many people are still unemployed because of COVID, and a lot of companies went belly-up in the wake of it.\n\nAfter July, unless Biden extends the eviction prevention moratorium (and several supreme court justices are saying that this is unconstitutional, so we can assume it is going to be rejected), there will be a swathe of evictions, and rent will go up sharply.\n\nThe big takeaway here is that people are going to be kicked out en-masse from their houses and apartments as banks, lenders, and landlords attempt to shore-up their profits. People won't be able to afford the same sized apartments when rent goes up. There will be a huge spike in the number of people that need to pick up their shit and go, and then they are going to need to put it somewhere.\n\nUhaul isn't the main DD here, but they are a very good indicator. Their stock has already risen sharply in the last several months, rising in tandem with the high default rates.\n\nMoving & storage companies overall are going to be in huge demand, and I believe they will also raise prices to meet that demand, and most people will have no choice but to accept it in order to hold onto their furniture and belongings that they have nowhere to put. \n\nThe housing market moves slow.

That has nothing to do with my observations. I am pointing out that home inventory, once the supply explodes in the wake of a mass of home sales and land development/realty companies place their newly built developments onto the market at the same time. Land development companies that can't sell the homes they contracted to be built will contribute by failing to pay back construction loans, and demand for lumber will dry up. Price is irrelevant.\n\nAlso remember that with the end of the pandemic will come an onslaught of pent-up home sales that were delayed because of it and contributed to the housing inventory shortage. \n\nFinally, yes, remote work does change everything and will contribute to the issue.

In the years leading up to the crisis, there was a lot of predatory lending in that market, where people were being shoehorned into home loans that they shouldn't have been.\nFrom what I've read, once there was a slew of defaults on loans, the banks lost a ton of money. Since our economy depends on those loans, millions of them, once a large chunk were suddenly gone, so was a lot of capital for the banks. Banks go down, markets go down.

While I agree we are fucked, I think we are fucked for different reasons, namely because of the tools available to the Fed before and after 2008. I'm going to enumerate the facts so the reasoning can be more easily understood.\n\n1. The USD is the world reserve currency. The idea of a Chinese-run world economy pretty much faded away with the covid pandemic, when the world economies stockpiled US dollars because they trusted USDs more than their own currencies. The USD became the world reserve currency after WW2 with the Bretton Woods system, and when the world switched to the modern monetary system in the 1970's, the US is still in the center.\n2. The Fed can pretty much print however much money it wants with no repercussions, and because of 1., there is a guaranteed demand for USD's, and so CPI inflation will stay low (not asset inflation). Asset inflation is going through the roof, as can be seen with housing, the stock market, art collections, etc. So for example in the CARES act they lowered the fractional reserve lending requirement from 10% down to 0% !!! Not that it really matters since banks weren't using the full capacity of the 10% anyway. As an aside, other countries cannot print their own currencies to infinite because those other currencies will go through inflation (relative to USDs), but the US has this enormous advantage to be able to print reserve dollars in its own currency. I tend to think other countries are extremely fucked, in the sense of they will go through absurd inflation.\n3. From the financial tools created in 2008, the Fed now has a go-to mechanism for correcting enormous jolts in the economy. So in April 2020, congress passed the CARES act, a $4+ TRILLION bill in about a week and a half. So there is no way there will be a bank run like there was during the Great Depression. Note that this bill, $4+TRILLION, it came out of nowhere, Congress didn't raise taxes or cut spending or balance a budget, that entire pretense has completely collapsed - if Congress wants to fund something, they can just brrrr the money printer.\n4. From 2, we know that CPI inflation is non-existent, while asset inflation is through the roof. And from 3 we know that the Fed can just go brrrrr. Usually in periods of economic growth, money velocity is increasing, and during recessions velocity is decreasing. This has always been the case up until 2008, when everyone that wasn't already rich got fucked and is drowning in debt. Velocity has been going down year-over-year since 2008, with a huge drop in 2008 and 2020, and a slow-but-steady drop between 2010 to 2020 ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V)).  Since March 2020 alone, velocity has dropped by 40% !!!. This means that the non-super-rich aren't spending money (velocity is low, CPI inflation low) while the super-rich have so much money they don't know what to do with it, so they dump it into rocket ship companies or $1.18Billion parties [https://www.theafricareport.com/65226/saudi-arabia-yacht-top-models-pitbull-concert-mbss-penchant-for-the-good-life/](https://www.theafricareport.com/65226/saudi-arabia-yacht-top-models-pitbull-concert-mbss-penchant-for-the-good-life/)\n5. From 4, we can now see the problem.... Wealth inequality in the US is at such absurd levels, basically from millennial indebtedness, that it is severely hurting spending. The role of the Fed is to increase spending when the economy isn't spending enough, and to tone back spending when the economy is spending too much, so that way the economy has nice steady growth. The Fed though can only control growth indirectly through loans to banks, who then in fact spend that money speculating on real estate and the stock market, with only a pittance trickling down to millennials. This doesn't fix the spending/indebtedness problem, because only Congress can pass laws e.g. taxing billionaires, forgiving student loans, etc. This is pretty much the main stumbling point of MMT, at least how I understand it, assuming that Congress can/will pass the necessary economic bills in a timely manner.\n\nSo basically my point, which is actually Thomas Piketty's point, who is actually credible, unlike some rando on reddit, is that the Fed is fine, the Fed is doing everything it can to stave off an economic collapse by trying to get people to spend as much as possible. But the Fed can't solve wealth inequality, only Congress can do that, and only with improving wealth inequality can we actually fix spending, which will fix the economy. And if people are worried about spending increasing inflation, i.) the Fed can't even get to 2% inflation when they've been trying for a decade and ii.) if inflation does come along, then we can just increase taxes and take currency out of circulation.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

I don't think they wouldn't make an attempt. What I think though is that the government is plugging holes in a cracking hoover dam with their fingers. The government is trying to sell bonds at a higher yield than ever in recent history, trying to stay ahead of the need to stimulate the economy again. Discussions about student loan forgiveness are floundering, even though it would easily save millions of lives financially speaking because Congress can't agree on anything. Renters are feeling a huge squeeze because they aren't making any money, and evictions are going to happen en-masse. I don't think the government can sustain the eviction moratorium because a District Court judge already said it was unconstitutional, and the topic is probably going to go to the supreme court if Biden pushes it, and with a right-leaning SC, I don't think the prognosis for continued moratoriums looks good. If the SC rules against it, it will die, and congress's hands will be tied.\n2. My reasoning is because defaults are super high right now. I expect that there will be a huge run-up in these stocks up until the moment of a crash. Nobody can see exactly when it will happen, but I can see opportunity to make gains and secure my capital up until that critical moment. I'm expecting the crash in September, at which point I will probably pull most of my positions and secure my gains/losses, unless intervention occurs. I will then wait out the crash, then buy more again at all-time lows. Crashes affect everyone, even companies that are doing super well. Panic always has that effect. Staying ahead of that panic and making smart withdrawls is the crucial differentiator. If your style is to go short, then by all means, go for it. I don't like having uncovered risk, ergo, I don't short, but I MAY throw down some puts against companies that I think are dogshit and are going to be hit hardest by it. Once the crash hits its all-time low, it will last for months. There will be plenty of time, at that point, to resume my long positions and buy back in at huge discounts.\n3. Mortgage defaults are still over 9% last I checked. A rent crisis is gonna be super bad. Naturally your response is \"Well, if homes are cheap and rent is expensive, why wouldn't you buy a house?\"\n\nBut I think we'd be ignoring a crucial piece of information.\n\nPeople are in huge debts because of the pandemic. Everyone has exhausted their savings to keep their heads above water. Hell... people are going hungry now, lines for soup-kitchens are flooded with people who still own homes and apartments in the worst-hit areas. That means nobody will be able to afford 10-15-20% down payments for new homes. Ergo... nobody can buy a house. When the crash happens, interest on mortgage rates will shoot back up again as the banks try to shore up their losses. They won't be able to afford more defaults going into a crash. It happened in 2008, and it will happen again if this occurs. Land development companies are also already over-extended on loans trying to build new properties which nobody is going to be able to afford. I have a feeling that they are going to leave a lot of these houses empty as a result of that decision. \n\nIn the end, I expect homlessness to skyrocket.

{"title": "Fisker Inc (FSR) DD", "selftext": "So in addition to being a Palantard and a proud owner of a single GME share, my latest play is Fisker (FSR), and I am fucking hard about this one. Now I admit, I only like losing money *some of the time*, so that doesn't mean I'm stuck in boomer T-bills, wondering how I can clamor for yield. Here's a low risk, high growth play that attractively suits any risk profile. \n\nFSR recently climbed into the mid-high 20s range, as a result of several positive catalysts that emerged. For starters, FSR announced a partnership with Foxconn, which I think we all know is the gold standard for high-quality technology-hardware manufacturing (see Apple). Foxconn has deep supply chains/international clients that are invaluable to an emerging player like Fisker, which bodes well as the partnership looks to target markets spanning the Americas, Europe, China, and India.\n\nNow unlike many EV wannabes clamoring for a share of this lucrative market, Fisker is one of the few that has been at the rodeo before. Unlike boomer bureaucracies (GM/Ford) or wannabe startups (XL/WKHS), FSR is Henrik Fisker's brainchild, and boy is he a notable automotive designer! From the BMW Z8 to 007's DB9, this is a guy who knows how to design a car that *you want* *to drive*, enough said.\n\nFurthermore, this is Fisker's second at-bat as a commercial play. Fisker launched Fisker Automotive in 2007, but even Gods cannot control macro forces (a combination of the financial crisis and its battery supplier going bankrupt forced the firm into a sale). Having launched FSR in 2016 (2020 SPAC) the company has had time to learn from its previous mistakes, which are often glossed over when considering the skillsets necessary for an EV player to rise to stardom (TSLA comes to mind).\n\nBut why is FSR not your ordinary SPAC, jack, and run? ***FSR is*** ***so undervalued and has so much room to run.*** Let's consider valuations really quickly (yes, I know WSB hates this, but earnings just came out and they rocked)- TSLA currently trades at 6.5X 2025 revenues, NIO at 3.8X, 2025 revenues,, and XPENG at 2.6x. For comparison, assuming FSR reaches its target of 200,000 units sold in 2025, Fisker is trading at roughly 1.0X 2025 revenues, assuming a $30 share price and $9.5 market cap- *this is crazy b/c FSR is trading at roughly $27 as of today, even on the back of good news*. \n\nYes, you read that right. At TSLA's multiple, FSR is a $200 stock.\n\nNow, *I'm not just buying/talking up FSR because it's cheap* *or to daydream while I rip fat chops-* I really like FSR's long term strategy with respect to production/manufacturing. Unlike TSLA, GM, Volkswagen, or pretty much any company aspiring to compete in the EV space, FSR outsources manufacturing to established names like Foxconn, whilst working on UI, design, and software at home. *I think this is genius*.\n\nUnlike any the well-known EV names, which have to worry about how arbitrary fears like rising rates or engulfed trade relations affect their earnings, FSR makes it someone else's problem by giving it to the smartest/skilled manufacturer in the room. Not only does this save on hefty capital expenditures/liabilities, but allows FSR to focus on the software aspect that differentiates EVs from yo momma's car and justifies their insane valuations. And to their credit, Fisker estimates this outsourcing approach will expedite their launch time to 29 months from 60 months traditionally.\n\nFrom what FSR has said so far, it seems like the Foxconn play appears to be an attempt for the company to play in Asia, and perhaps the U.S. Already, FSR has a partnership with Magna (MGA) in Europe- another high quality manufacturer that mirrors some of Foxconn's strengths, but only in Europe. With these two heavyweights under their belt, all FSR will have to do is execute on the software side, which is never an easy proposition, but looks optimistic given the company's track record.\n\nBut Fisker also projects to deliver 200,000 units by 2025, across their 5 different expected models by that point. Again, assuming a conservative average sale price of $55,000 (FSR internal estimates are in the $60,000) range, this thing is a Puritan-conservative's value play worth $11B. When you factor in a partnership with AAPL's lover, a beautiful EV that *actually looks cool*, considerable undervaluation, and a decent cash position (about roughly $1B- way more than so many other EV firms), FSR is a great flier, and likely going into orbit.\n\nSo tldr, I am extremely bullish on Fisker. Henrik Fisker said himself the partnership with Foxconn would produce some new car that would be \"futuristic,\" \"something completely different,\" \"affordable,\" \"and will introduce things that probably will almost feel a little scary to some people.\"  \n\n\nFSR to the moon! 💎🙌💪🏽🦍🚀\n\nAug 2021 PT: $60\n\nDec 2021 PT: $100\n\nDec 2022 PT: $200\n\nPOSITIONS: https://imgur.com/gallery/IFFMW7L\n\n***This is not financial advice.

{"title": "My Bear Case for CCL (Carnival Cruise Lines)", "selftext": "(Sorry this is long, I have TL;DR throughout and at the bottom)\n\nTo start off, I know what you’re thinking. “Cruises are totally a recovery stock, and CCL is trading at $26.35 a share, 45% lower than the January prior to COVID. With vaccine news this is a no-brain buy.” And while that’s the sentiment that has driven up price, it doesn’t account for a variety of factors. (Given, this is a fair bit speculative on what the CDC will announce, but we can make pretty safe bets).\n\n**Share Dilution and Current Market Cap**\n\nSince COVID forced a shutdown of the cruise industry CCL has taken on a boat-load of debt. After selling $1 Billion in shares last week they had secured $23.5 Billion in liquidity since COVID began, and their long-term debt raised from $9.7B to $25B. They diluted shares like crazy throughout the whole process. Even now if you look at the current market cap of CCL ($30.54B) it is only 16.26% lower than prior to COVID (36.47B). This amount of dilution and current market cap is kind of alarming to be honest.\n\nThey have pushed back the due dates of some contracts of new ships and a port, but they have sizeable financial obligations throughout the next several years. At $3B average net revenue prior to COVID, the interest and payments on the addition of possibly $20B in debt by the time they return to normal, as well as obligations, is going to screw net profits over.\n\n*TL;DR*: Crazy dilution of shares means that current stock price is much closer to pre-covid levels than it appears, but with the addition of $15 Billion in debt added to the company so far, and an expensive next year ahead that I’ll touch on below.\n\n**Ramp up Period**\n\nWith the CDC’s release of the “Framework for Conditional Sailing” late last year we saw a generalized process of how cruises will return back to normalcy. In summary cruise liners are still waiting for even more updated instructions from the CDC on how to specifically conduct these but each cruise will need to operate trial cruises, at normal staffing levels and expected capacity, to prove that implemented safety processes won’t result in new cases. After these trial cruises are conducted, they can apply for conditional permits no sooner than 30 days before the scheduled departure of the cruise.\n\nThis process is going to be incredibly expensive. Currently CCL is losing $3-5B a quarter maintaining and staffing the ships with skeleton cruises, and several are dry docked. In order to get passed off by the CDC they will incur additional maintenance expenses as well as the costs of running several complete cruises, filled to allowed capacity with non-paying test subjects, with $0 in revenue for doing so.\n\nOn top of this we can expect the CDC to mandate social distancing practices, even if cruise liners require passengers to receive vaccinations prior to booking. One of the only operating cruise liners right now is offering no-destination cruises in Singapore. They go out and back throughout three days, and capacity is limited to 50% of ship capacity. I would expect this 50% capacity to be mandated on all US originated cruises.\n\nFor cruises to be profitable they need to fill every single room on board. Ships normally operate at \\~105% capacity, as a majority of expenses these companies incur are fixed expenses (fuel, operating expenses, insurance and some other onboard expenses, and to a degree payroll expenses and food for employees, as you do not have a proportionate crew size for a lower capacity cruise, a majority of positions are necessary for the customer experience).  While profit margins on booked cruises are high (17% for the industry) a 50% capacity limitation would destroy these margins and ensure that every single cruise operates at a loss for the duration of the restrictions.\n\nOn top of this, 25% of reservations that have been cancelled since January 2020 opted out of full refunds and received travel credits and onboard vouchers totaling 20% of ticket price. This is a MASSIVE amount of already recognized unearned revenue, and while it helped the company maintain liquidity it  will further reduce profits as cruise bookings pick up and a large number of people who opted into credit are the mega-cruise fans that will be booking as soon as allowed, and will use the 20% on-board voucher to cover a majority of onboard expenses that would provide additional revenue to Carnival. They will be 0 revenue- net loss customers, and consist of a huge amount of people.\n\n*TL;DR:* We can expect even larger losses during the next quarter as CCL tries to get approval to cruise, and we can expect large losses on every cruise through the rest of 2021 unless the CDC deems there is no risk at 100% capacity.\n\n**Cruise Destination Limitations Through 2021**\n\nWe can expect to see a limited number of destinations throughout 2021. Canada this week announced that it will not be permitting cruises originating from outside of Canada to dock at Canadian ports until February 2022. Several cruise lines have already cancelled Alaska and Canadian cruises until that date, and you can expect every other company in the industry to follow suit.\n\nAdditionally, I can all but guarantee that with their restrictions in place cruises will not be allowed to travel to Australia or New Zealand throughout the remainder of the year, and will see a limited number of European countries that allow them. The Cayman Islands has announced that by request of residents and business they will be largely reducing cruise calls indefinitely. So optimistically we see cruises domestically as well as to select destinations in the Bahamas, Central, and South America throughout the remainder of the year.\n\nTo further complicate this, the CDC still hasn’t announced what their guidelines on recreation cruise travel will be. I would not be surprised if destinations were limited to either: a) countries with below a certain level of infection, b) countries with above a certain level of vaccination, or c) countries without the presence of confirmed COVID-19 variants. The last thing they want is the spread of mutations that current vaccinations aren’t as effective against.\n\n*TL;DR:* Optimistically we will be extremely limited in destinations throughout at least the remainder of 2021. Worst case the CDC will limit travel to select countries with low rates or only domestic/no destination cruises.\n\n**Executive Sell-Offs**\n\nIn the last two months the CEO, CFO, and General Counsel members have sold off over $4.5 million in shares. Just as many insiders in the industry are selling off, they believe current prices are overvalued. Just sayin🤷‍♂️.\n\n**Even more Hypotheticals**\n\n*Bull case for CCL* would be the CDC allowing 100% capacity cruises ASAP, which would currently mean resuming in June of this year. Demand is definitely pent up and absent legal limitations cruise liners will see above average bookings for the foreseeable future. Best case scenario they’ll return to normal revenue, hell maybe even higher (prior to covid they would net $3B a year). This obviously doesn’t account for increased interest rates and payments through 2027 for the $20B they will have borrowed throughout the last year. Best case they will have recovered from COVID by 2024? Maybe? If they have great finances?\n\n*Bear case for CCL* would be that the CDC enacts tighter restrictions. 50% capacity cruises, limitations to foreign ports and possibly only even domestic cruises. This would last at least throughout the remainder of the year, may become less stringent as time goes on and case numbers drop. Would see affects well into 2022. This would cause bleeding losses throughout the remainder of the year, and possibly needing to incur additional debt. If cruises have additional cases on board we may see mandated ship quarantine scenarios again which would damage PR even more and add expenses. We’d look at an 7-10 year recovery.\n\n**TL;DR**: Long term CCL is absolutely screwed. While retail is currently hyped due to vaccine news, big money that have a hell of a lot more knowledge than I do, and company executives are dipping out. CCL has an incredibly long recovery ahead of it and I can expect stock price to bleed long term as dilution is factored in, even through short term volatility.\n\nPositions: $22.5p 07/16/21\n\nAlso all this is all IMO, in no way advice, and I’m definitely going to be wrong as I always lose money so inverse the crap out of me.", "id": "lvwqan", "created_utc": 1614671119.0, "score": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "I think they should just convert cruise ships into old folks homes.", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "I already thought they were 🤷‍♂️", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "But just close their doors and put tv screens in the port holes and make them think they travel and save fuel.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "I’d invest in that...", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "They tried to but Cuomo wanted to pack sick, old folks into nursing homes like sardines instead.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I bought CCL and it’s been a slog but I’m about 20% up now, was 25% a few days ago.

That doesn't mean everyone made money on it, or that everyone who made predictions about GME based on public info was correct. In hindsight of course you can look at the short interest and say a squeeze was primed to happen. In reality, short interest was high for a long time; in reality, some stocks maintain high short interest without ever seeing a squeeze.\n\n> Is OPs information actually invalid simply because it’s more bullish and appeals to confirmation bias?\n\nNo of course not. But remember OP is providing 2 things: Information, which anyone can look up and verify, and an opinion on future market movements. Why should I trust OP's interpretation of the data? Is it any more valuable to me than asking a child what they think of it? Lately this sub has been upvoting a lot of *opinions* and there's nothing wrong with that inherently, but in general I really don't trust anyone's interpretation of the data here. \n\nI mean OP's grand theory boils down to a gamma squeeze due to high open interest in contracts expiring on a quad witching day. Few issues:\n\n\\1. Quad witching day means it's monthly contract expiry. Open interest is almost ALWAYS higher on monthly contracts than weekly, and we don't see massive monthly gamma squeezes.\n\n\\2. OP doesn't work through the pretty simple math to analyze these movements. Let's check out something he calls \"HUGE\":\n\n> YES, that is 127,885 contracts at a $5 strike. HUGE. If this hits $5 it could just as easy keep going.\n\nOkay but those $5 strikes are 25% OTM, have 90% implied volatility, 16 delta, 30 gamma. Open interest represents $768,000 of capital and if all the sellers are perfectly hedged, about 2M shares or $8M in capital. If the stock goes to $5 tomorrow, delta will be about 55 so hedging would require buying another 5M shares. Volume today was nearly 30M, and that's the second lowest it's been this month. So how much is another 5M shares in volume really going to affect the price? Picking 1/28, a day where price swung about 20% between the low and high, had volume of 675M. You see the mismatch in scale? And this is assuming the best case for bulls, that this massive swing happens all in a day. A more realistic scenario is that this happens slowly over a couple weeks, and that 5M in volume is maybe more like 10M (overestimate) in volume to account for delta being a bit higher closer to expiration. That 10M is spread out over weeks where there's hundreds of millions of shares traded. \"HUGE\" gamma squeeze on Nokia? I'll press X to doubt.\n\n\\3. Somewhat minor point: OP is looking at call volume of a bunch of reddit meme stocks with high short interest. You know who uses calls? *Short sellers*, calls work great as a hedge because you don't get BTFO by sudden unpredictable retail interest. But no, OP still thinks everyone is a degenerate gambler using OTM options as lottery tickets (or for market manipulation I guess?):\n\n> Get on your tin foil hats.I think 'someone' or many 'somepeoples' have discovered the incredible power of near-term options and their influence on the upward volatility on price.\n\nI suppose to be fair OP prefaced it with the tinfoil hat's bit. But that's just lampshading the fact that it's an outlandish idea he went to all the effort to post.\n\nSo to me, OP reeks of someone who just heard about quadruple witching, knows vaguely about market maker hedging, is impressed by big numbers, and worst of all thinks their discovery is worth everyone else's time (a.k.a. an idiot).", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "One other thing I want to add, is that people have known about options accelerating price movement for a long time.

{"title": "Keep Your Eyes on the Volume Behind the Movement", "selftext": "**The Key to Success has Been Underneath Your Nose the Entire Time**\n\nThe key detail that every new trader seems to miss is that volume ultimately controls price movements because the presence of adequate volume validates the price movement. If a price movement fails to be validated by adequate volume , then there is going to be an equal an opposite reaction. There exists a variable that satisfies both quantitative and fundamental analysts. That is the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) and it is complemented by the Volume Weighted Moving Average ( VWMA ). When you do not consider the weight of volume in price movements, you are at the mercy of manipulative, high volume whales that seek to sink Simple Moving Averages ( SMAs ) during times of low volume in the interest of accumulation of the asset.\n\nVWAPs can be treated as the \"true\" price of an asset on any given resolution, but become less sensitive to change as you zoom out. These ever-shifting values can be treated as floors, in bullish times, and ceilings, during a bear market. You can always expect a \"bounce\" off of the VWAP in the opposite direction at least once as price attempts to cross over it. These resistance lines are useful to every audience, the soon-to-be long holders who would like to plan a decent entry, the short sellers trying to make a quick buck, and the swing traders who like to make money regardless of who controls the market. One should always keep in mind that price never strays too far from the VWAP before attempting to violently correct itself in the other direction.\n\nThere is a measure of movement around the VWAP , which we'll call volatility , and it masks the true price of the asset and its direction. By following the VWAP , you can see accurately whether the asset is going high or low. I'm using these customized bands to look for long entries (in the green or below) and short entries (in the red or above) to make short term profits to be accumulated in my spot balances. Ultimately, by building your position you can ensure a long-term profit but it doesn't mean too much if one simply never takes profit.\n\nLongs can be slept on. Shorts must be monitored. Set a budget, craft a plan, and stick to it. Remember to remove your principal investment at some point to reduce your risk.\n\nIn a bull market, buy at the monthly VWAP (Purple Line) and in a bear market, sell there.\n\nHappy Hunting!- Patch Hemlock\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/ApPTU3cw-Keep-Your-Eyes-on-the-Volume-Behind-the-Movement/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/ApPTU3cw-Keep-Your-Eyes-on-the-Volume-Behind-the-Movement/)\n\nProof of Institutional Use of VWAP: WATCH LIVE: GameStop hearing: Robinhood, Citadel and Reddit CEOs testify — 2/18/21 by CNBC Television on YouTube (Timestamp 4:55:34)\n\nEDIT: For any would-be quants out there, I've developed an open-source pine script to act as a springboard for you\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/script/kJqBZ6s8-Realtime-All-Time-High-and-All-Time-Low-Tracker-WIP/](https://www.tradingview.com/script/kJqBZ6s8-Realtime-All-Time-High-and-All-Time-Low-Tracker-WIP/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReposted due to automoderation of youtube links\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDECLARATION OF BIAS:\n\npurchased GME at $13 and AMC at $4\n\ndoubled down after the crash at $50 and $6 respectively\n\nnever sold", "id": "lweje6", "created_utc": 1614724786.0, "score": 4558, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 494, "comments": [{"body": "Sooooo this means volume was low so not a true reflection of price?
