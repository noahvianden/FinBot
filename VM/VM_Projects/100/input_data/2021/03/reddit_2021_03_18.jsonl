The electricity grid, to my understanding, functions best when there's a consistent, predictable amount of load, or even better, when you can dynamically control the amount of load. Renewables provide an unsteady, somewhat uncontrollable supply of energy. The ideal approach would be batteries that soak up excess energy, then release it when more is needed, but that's tricky.

If I were running a cash secured strategy I would do the following, and I do in my IRA:\n\nSell ATM CSPs until my BP reaches zero. Immediately set a BTC GTC order for 25% profit, wait for an email that something executed, find another trade(s) to take buying power down to zero. When the last Friday of the month rolled around, look at all remaining positions. Take down all winners that didn't hit 25% and everything that is 20% or less in the red. Roll the remainder at the same strike to the next month, calculate net premium received from the original put and the roll and set a BTC GTC for that so I can exit at a scratch. Open more positions with the remaining buying power. I am currently 3-5% monthly YTD with this strategy as of close of market today. Last year was around 4% a month average including March.  This works because you are constantly compounding your premium on average every 6 days on winners. You should see a \"win rate\" of around 90% with this if you are picking things that aren't just stupid high vs. their mean. What most people worry about when selling CSP is losing out on a stupid bull run. However if you are selling ATM you will be getting large amounts of participation and if you are closing at 25% profit (you should be) your delta won't venture too far from 50 because as you get further OTM and you generate more unrealized profit your delta keeps shrinking so your participation in future appreciation shrinks as well. Having very low profit thresholds fixes this fault. ATM also saves money on commissions (I pay 2% of gross profit in premium, or $10 per $2000 in profit. If you are running margin it will not fluctuate too much on buying power. In a deep bear market you will see a 2x expansion vs. 3x or more with OTM. It doesn't take very long to get to a high delta during a down market so you can participate in the recovery. A march 2020 situation would of recovered by May. You make the same profit at 25% that a 30 delta does at 50%, you collect twice as much premium if not more so you need less contracts overall, your delta is higher so if the stock goes up you close out quicker, if it goes down you build delta quicker, because you are closing at 25% your probability should be north of 90% because of the increased theta decay and lower threshold as well. Also while you are waiting for your losing positions to recover you are still collecting theta decay so your break even threshold strike requirement keeps reducing over time.\n\nAs for when I sell, whenever the target month I am selling in reaches 30 DTE I switch the the next month. When I say monthlies I always mean the ones expiring on the third friday of the month as well. So right now I am selling only May 21 puts, all of them. Next friday (march 26) I will roll all of my April contracts over to May 21 as well. I will ride everything out then until they close or April 30th and then roll those to June. When April 21st arrives the May monthlies will be 30 DTE so I will start writing my new stuff in June as well.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "So you don't hold any stock for long-term appreciation? even in an IRA?\n\nI just left my job and have a large 401k that will get converted to cash for a rollover IRA and I'm trying to decide what to do with it.

So while many commentators have been quick to say that the cheating engines are not a highway safety concern, safety ‚Äî as in health ‚Äî is still an issue.\n\nUnlike the ignition defect in General Motors vehicles that caused at least 124 people to die in car crashes, Volkswagen pollution is harder to link to individual deaths. But it is clear to public health researchers that the air pollutants the cars illegally emitted damage health, and they have formulas for the number of lives lost from excess pollution in general. Indeed, the Environmental Protection Agency uses its own estimates of the health effects of air pollution to create its regulations of what‚Äôs allowed. After consulting with several experts in modeling the health effects of air pollutants, we calculated a death toll in the United States that, at its upper range, isn‚Äôt far off from that caused by the G.M. defect.\n\nVolkswagen said last week that it had installed software that deceived emissions tests in 11 million diesel cars, allowing the vehicles to emit far more pollutants than regulations allowed. Our estimates examine only the impact on public health in the United States, but it‚Äôs clear the negative effects were probably substantially higher in Europe, where the cars are much more common.\n\nThe chemicals that spewed illegally from the Volkswagen diesel cars ‚Äî known as nitrogen oxides or NOx ‚Äî have been linked to a host of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, as well as premature deaths. Nitrogen oxides are a byproduct of burning fossil fuels at high temperature, whether in cars, power plants or other machines like industrial boilers. The chemicals can be harmful to humans, and in warm, sunny conditions, they can also turn into ground-level ozone, or smog, and unhealthy particle pollution.\n\nNitrogen dioxide and ozone irritate the lungs, increasing airway inflammation, coughing and wheezing, and can lower resistance to respiratory illness like influenza, especially with long-term exposure. The chemicals can also worsen the suffering and risk of serious illness or premature death for those with conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Older people, who are more likely to have these ailments, are particularly vulnerable.\n\nA corporate logo of Volkswagen illuminated by the morning light at the plant of the German car manufacturer in Wolfsburg, Germany, last week.\nA corporate logo of Volkswagen illuminated by the morning light at the plant of the German car manufacturer in Wolfsburg, Germany, last week.Julian Stratenschulte/European Pressphoto Agency\nThe impact of smog and soot pollution on global health is substantial: A recent paper by Jos Lelieveld, at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany, and colleagues estimated that air pollution causes some three million premature deaths a year, and that the number of deaths could more than double by 2050.\n\nThe American Lung Association estimates that nearly 41 percent of Americans live in areas with unhealthy levels of ozone. And that‚Äôs with reductions brought about by national air quality standards and regulation. Between 1980 and 2014, the E.P.A. estimates that nitrogen dioxide levels in the air fell by more than half. The Obama administration has stepped up its regulation of emissions from power plants and tightened standards for vehicles. A still tougher ozone standard is expected next month.\n\nThe part of the country that has probably experienced the most harm from the Volkswagen fraud is California, which already has the worst air quality in the nation. About 7,200 premature deaths a year are caused by air pollution there, according to the California Air Resources Board, and 73 percent of the state‚Äôs population, or 28 million people, live in counties with unhealthy levels of ozone or particle pollution.\n\nCalifornia also has the largest number of diesel passenger cars ‚Äî some 50,000 of them, said Dave Clegern, a spokesman for the state‚Äôs air resources board, which regulates air quality in the state. Regulation has helped, Mr. Clegern said, but ‚Äúwe still have a significant problem.‚Äù Regulations are developed with automakers at the table, he said, and ‚Äúin order to do that, you have to have a level of trust.‚Äù Regarding the Volkswagen deception, he said, ‚ÄúThis kind of thing is, to say the least, absolutely no help.‚Äù\n\nThe potential damage of technologies like the ‚Äúdefeat device‚Äù that allowed Volkswagen to evade pollution rules since late 2008 is substantial. Volkswagen diesel cars represent fewer than 1 percent of cars on the road in the United States. But if every car ‚Äî gasoline, diesel and electric hybrid ‚Äî exceeded the legal limits by a similar amount, the consequences for air pollution and human health would be significant.\n\n‚ÄúBeijing comes to mind,‚Äù said Paul Billings, a senior vice president at the American Lung Association.\n\n\nHow Volkswagen‚Äôs ‚ÄòDefeat Devices‚Äô Worked\n\nVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.\n\nTo estimate the harm in the United States, we used two different scientific models for the effects of nitrogen oxide pollution on human health.\n\nOne comes from a sort of natural experiment, when new regulations on power plant pollution caused some counties, but not others, to cut back on nitrogen oxide pollution. The counties subject to regulation reduced their nitrogen oxides emissions by 350 tons a year.\n\nA team of three researchers ‚Äî Olivier Deschenes, Joseph S. Shapiro and Michael Greenstone ‚Äî looked at the mortality rates and medical spending before and after the change. In a working paper, they found the reduced pollution was responsible for about five fewer deaths for every 100,000 people in the affected counties each year, as well as for a decrease in spending on prescription drugs. Most of the seemingly excess deaths in the higher pollution regions occurred among older Americans, though other health issues affected the young as well as the old.\n\nThe estimated Volkswagen pollution, about 46,000 tons since late 2008, is the equivalent of about 4 percent of the power plant pollution reduction they measured, meaning it could be expected to cause an estimated 106 deaths if it had similar effects.\n\nWe ran this projection by Mr. Greenstone, a professor of economics and director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, and a contributor to The Upshot. He said it seemed sensible as an estimate, but ‚Äúthe magnifying glass is really close.‚Äù\n\nNoelle Eckley Selin, an associate professor of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at M.I.T., ran the numbers a slightly different way. She looked at the mortality effects of the particulate pollution produced by nitrogen oxides, using the numbers the Environmental Protection Agency uses to make health estimates. Her method brought the effects to about 40 additional deaths over the period, in addition to some other nonfatal health consequences. That probably undercounts the impact, though, since it does not consider the effects of direct nitrogen oxide pollution or smog.\n\nNow for all the caveats. Our estimates for the amount of nitrogen oxide pollution are back-of-the-envelope. We relied on data from Kelley Blue Book on the number of Volkswagen diesel cars registered each year, and we applied a standard number of miles driven by each car, based on a government average, to arrive at a total number of vehicle-miles traveled.\n\nThe E.P.A. has said that the vehicles emitted up to 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxides. But earlier research suggests that the pollution levels ranged widely among the vehicles and their driving conditions. We looked at 39 times the legal standard, but that may be a high assumption. (If you want to estimate the effects for emissions at, say, 29 times the legal limit, you can adjust our numbers down accordingly.)\n\nBecause smog is worse in the summer, Mr. Greenstone recommended that we look at pollution from five months each year. Ms. Selin‚Äôs approach was based on year-round pollution levels.\n\nOf course, modeling the health effects of tailpipe emissions is more complicated than the sort of straight multiplication we have employed in both methods. The harm from nitrogen oxide pollution depends on how close people are to roads, as well as on topography and weather patterns. People who live in large cities, or near major roads, tend to experience disproportionate harm. Other news organizations, including Vox and The Guardian, have calculated slightly different estimates of the amount of pollution and the resulting harm.\n\nDon Anair, deputy director of the vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the precise effect of the Volkswagen fraud would require intense and complex computation.\n\nStill, he cautioned against taking the view that the Volkswagens have reversed the progress with pollution from automobiles. Since the standards went into effect from 2004 to 2009, he said, emissions of nitrogen oxides have been 90 percent lower. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like this is going to offset the majority of the benefits of these standards,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut there will be some impact, and we need to get a better handle on it.‚Äù\n‚Äú", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "It's been known forever.

{"title": "Who will win Autonomous Driving? Waymo Vs Tesla", "selftext": "After watching a video featuring Teslas \"Full self driving\" video Vs a Waymo video I have realized Waymo is far ahead of Tesla. Comparing the dashboard display of what the car is seeing, Waymo's software is far more advanced, less erratic and to me seems evident that Elon will indeed need a Lidar/Camera sensor like Microvisions which will be released in April . IMO Teslas software doesn't seem to read the velocities of other cars and pedestrians well. The rep seems to think the Tesla isn't programed to see potholes. Which we have seen from the MVIS Lidar video to be a key point. In the video the Tesla has a hard time reading curbs, pillions and a fence/ wall and by now im sure we've heard of at least one Tesla crash. This leads me to believe that Autonomous driving will be regulated and Elon could eventually be forced to use Lidar as Lidar could eventually become a mandatory sensor in all new cars, especially Autonomous. .\n\n(Youtube video links are not allowed here but you can look up Waymo's self driving videos vs FSD beta 8.2 in Oakland )\n\nTesla's \"Full self driving\" at times acts drunk and requires the driver to continually disengage the auto driving feature. While in Waymo's case passengers are sitting in the rear seat separated by Plexiglas and there is no one to take grab the wheel and over, to me that means Waymo is more advanced and confident in their tech.\n\nThis in my opinion Is great news for MicroVision $MVIS investors considering their \"Best in class Lidar\" is coming out in April and is going to be a two in one Camera and Lidar Combo under $1000\n\nThis is great news for MicroVision for the following reasons (not in chronological order):\n\n\"Waymo began as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009.\"\n\nSevals Oz the recently appointed MVIS director held a previous position for google\\[X\\] was \"Self driving cars- HEAD of global PARTNERSHIPS and BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT\"\n\n$Ford and $GOOGL \"come together in first-of-its-kind partnership to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to accelerate Ford‚Äôs transformation plan\"\n\nFord pledges $29 billion for Evs and Autonomous Vehicles\n\nFord backs out of $VLDR ( alsoVLDRs CEO backs down saying the company has fostered a anti share holder culture.)\n\nFormer Ford executive of 32 years, Judy Curran is added to the Microvision BOD.\n\nMicrovision's CEO has continually stress the fact that he wants to maximize share holders value and has stated he wants to burn the shorts.\n\nLook at Waymo's website, while they maybe ahead on the software side but I'm sure they are dying to to remove ALL of those big bulky sensors and increase aerodynamics and decrease drag coefficients . Thats why Microvision is so important to them. I'm sure Waymo and google are eager to release a car to the public especially after seeing teslas falsely advertised \"Full Self Driving\"\n\nWaymo Via has been learning to self drive class 8 trucks for 4 years now.\n\nWhen clarifying the A Sample in Microvisions ER CEO Sharma mentions Long haul trucking for the first time in the following quotes:\n\n\"Our solid-state, long-range LiDAR sensor could enable any interested party to perform testing with our sensor on their moving platforms, such as cars and longhaul trucks\"\n\n..\"No, that's A sample. That's where it's up for sale. So as I said, potentially, if somebody wants to work the hardware on a moving platform test because obviously, we're not investing in moving platform testing on cars or long-haul trucking\"\n\nCould they already be working with Google? Lets not forget Microvisions Board of Directors and their Google/ Ford ties..\n\nA look at Microvisions Board:\n\nCEO: Summit Sharma : Former Head of operations for Google glass\n\nSeval Oz: Former Google Self driving cars- head of global PARTNERSHIPS and BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT\n\nMark Spitzer: Former Operations Director at Google\n\nJudy Curran: 32 years at Ford, in Director and head engineer roles. Current Head of automotive strategy at ANSYS\n\nMicrovision is up for sale, and to me it appears google is making moves..  I don't see anyone from Microsoft there (Even though Microvision is inside the Halolens 2) .. I could imagine the bidding war is In full swing as both of the Tech giants seem to have planted their roots in MicroVision. We all know about the Value the Near eye display brings to MSFT. At this point Im starting to believe MVIS will be acquired by Google due to the value MVIS could bring to their Autonomous Vehicle sensors, Heads up displays, Augmented and Mixed reality, and interactive projections\n\n\nEDIT: For everyone saying camera vision is all you need and LIDAR is doomed. Check out what the simple application of what LIDAR did to the camera in the new iPhones and iPads, all the new features and laser fast focus, the accuracy and precision, the extra data and speed of it, which allows the computer to use less battery and processing power. I‚Äôm not saying camera vision is wrong, I‚Äôm saying they need LIDAR to pair with it, LIKE THE MICROVISION LIDAR AND CAMERA UNIT. They need the same data source of data with zero latency between them to bring any self driving car to scale. Im not saying radar can‚Äôt be used in conjunction but LIDAR lasers and the speed of light is faster than radio waves as their waves are longer and use less frequencies and make radar irrelevant and more of a redundancy. LIDAR can use more frequent programmable pulses and use time of flight senors to read velocity and create a point cloud of 33 Million p/s with multiple Fields of view. If autonomous driving is regulated and OEMS are required to use LIDAR and a bundle of sensors, Tesla will be in a bad position being so behind in LIDAR. \n\nYahoo Finance talked about Microvision and autonomous vehicles this week in their article titled  \"Two Tech Stocks To Watch As Biden Pours Trillions Into The Green Economy\" and I quote \"And [all] these automakers‚Äô ambitious plans aren‚Äôt possible without companies like MicroVision (NASDAQ:MVIS).

Over 15 years ago, he created a startup called MobileVoiceControl‚Äîa predecessor to Siri.

It was confirmed that production will begin this September ‚Äì which will make the *Endurance* the first ever *full-size* electric pick-up truck to hit the road. This will allow them first-mover advantage into the massive light duty truck market.\n\n2. The development mule that caught fire a few months ago was a result of human error ‚Äì this was a human-made prototype, and the Betas that are currently being produced are being welded by robots (Betas are basically 97% of the actual finished product ‚Äì so these will be a much more accurate depiction of the final vehicle than the development mules were several months ago).\n\n3. In the coming weeks, as betas come off the production line, the vehicles will be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.\n\n4. The fleet vehicle market is unique ‚Äì which is why pre-order numbers are more based on calculated estimates from service partners like E-Squared Energy (mentioned earlier) and [Holman Enterprises](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-and-holman-enterprises-announce-co-marketing). Holman manages 2 million vehicles including 600K pick-ups. These service partners buy from Lordstown and then sell directly to fleets. It‚Äôs important to build relationships early-on with these service partners especially since Lordstown is going to be first-to-market in 6 months.\n\n5. Demand remains very strong amongst service partners, government agencies, and commercial fleets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This is all great, but how in the world will a company from small-town Ohio scale across the whole country?**\n\nTo help scale and increase a country-wide presence, [LM recently partnered with Camping World](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html). This partnership will allow Lordstown to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US, with thousands of technicians and service bays via Camping World‚Äôs footprint.\n\nMarcus Lemonis is the CEO of Camping World and a successful businessman and entrepreneur featured on ‚ÄúThe Profit.‚Äù This man would not enter a long-term strategic partnership with a company unless it was the **real deal**, and I can tell you with 100% confidence that he‚Äôs been [all-in on Lordstown](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?lang=en) since last year. I highly recommend visiting Marcus‚Äô twitter and looking through all of the videos and tweets pertaining to Lordstown.\n\n[Joe Burrow](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/work-for-it-joe-burrow) is on board too!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Anything else besides their Endurance truck?**\n\nThey announced today that they will do a demonstration of their [electric van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) this summer, and it will begin production next year. Their 3rd vehicle will likely be a large SUV.\n\nKeep in mind that as of 2021, the [global light duty vehicles market size is valued at over $600 billion](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/light-duty-vehicles-market) ‚Äì creating a lot of space for companies like Lordstown to come in and disrupt the industry with their advanced technology and a low price point ($45,000 after federal tax credit).\n\nBut given all of that, I think $RIDE‚Äôs current *market cap* is currently wayyyy too low especially relative to others in the EV industry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is a market cap?**\n\nMarket cap‚Äîor market capitalization‚Äîrefers to the total value of all a company's shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by its total number of outstanding shares. \n\nMarket cap allows investors to understand the relative size of one company versus another. It effectively measures what a company is worth on the open market, as well as the market's perception of its future prospects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why are you talking about market cap?**\n\nBecause I think it is important to look at Lordstown‚Äôs market cap in comparison with two of the other most popular start-up EV truck companies based in the US. *These numbers were from 3pm EST earlier today*:\n\n*Nikola $NKLA - $5.9 billion market cap*\n\n*Canoo $GOEV - $3.9 billion market cap*\n\n**What is Lordstown‚Äôs market cap?**\n\n*Lordstown $RIDE - $2.3 billion market cap*\n\nListen.. I‚Äôm just making the point that Lordstown has one of the **biggest factories** in the country and also will be able to produce [**600,000 vehicles annually**](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio) in a couple of years‚Äô time. \n\nLordstown is only 6 months away from **mass producing** (not hand-making) the world‚Äôs first ever *full size* electric pick-up truck. An *Endurance* will be coming off the production line every 6 minutes in September, and then every 4 minutes beginning in 2022. This is a very big deal, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until the stock is accurately-priced especially relative to its peers.\n\nCompanies like Nikola, Canoo, and many other EV start-ups are year(s) away from mass production. And I can‚Äôt even imagine the 10‚Äôs of billions of dollars it will cost those companies to get to market ‚Äì meanwhile, Lordstown acquired their state-of-the-art facility for [$40 million](https://www.mbtmag.com/home/news/21244850/lordstown-motors-to-finish-first-electric-truck-prototypes-in-march) (and then a couple hundred million in re-tooling the facility). But seriously ‚Äì this is basically pennies compared to what other EV players like Rivian are paying for their production facilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Is this just a pump and dump DD post?**\n\nNope ‚Äì I‚Äôm actually holding mostly January 2023 calls (LEAPS) - meaning that I believe in the long-term growth story here. I have 10 January 2023 call contracts at a $40 strike price. My price target for January 2023 is $150/share, which would mean a market cap of \\~ $20 billion. This is a very volatile stock if you look at the 6-month chart, which is why I think holding onto shares or LEAPS is the smartest approach. It is also worth noting that the average price target between the 5 analysts that cover the stock is $30.\n\nAdditionally, I hate Hindenburg, and seeing that ‚Äúreport‚Äù last Friday set me off. That‚Äôs what caused me to do so much research into Lordstown over the past week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Summary:**\n\nTo quote Warren Buffett, ‚ÄúYou should be greedy when others are fearful‚Äù\n\nHindenburg Research putting out a hit-piece against $RIDE has created some fear for investors. This fear has caused a sell-off and an increasingly high short interest in the stock ‚Äì I think Hindenburg and the remaining shorts are going to have to cover by the end of this week before they get burned really badly. This company is very real and it is now in the public-eye more than it has ever been.\n\nAnd to the doubters and bears that will appear in the comments - you‚Äôre going to come back and look at this post in about a year when $RIDE is valued about 3-4x of its current price and wish you would have loaded up on these cheap shares ;)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nCitron and Hindenburg can go straight to hell. Load the boat on shares of $RIDE ‚Äì this chart is poised for a breakout.

{"title": "GME DISINFO EXPOSED #1: Why the ‚Äú$GME MOASS‚Äô‚Äù post that hit the front page is pure BULLSHIT", "selftext": "There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation going around WSB right now, and the common knowledge is that hedge funds shorting GME are the source of it. Unfortunately, common knowledge isn‚Äôt always correct knowledge. The reality is that much of the disinformation being spread on WSB right now is very pro-GME, and the new crowd here, which consists mostly of greenhorn traders (who don‚Äôt really understand how the market functions) is lapping it up. The [people ‚Äî 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) participating in this disinformation campaign often intentionally reach the wrong conclusions after overloading posts with very technical information that most greenhorn traders do not understand, or even just [make terms up](https://postimg.cc/B8W93Yth) ‚Äî [Source ‚Äî 18.5k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/)\n\nThere are many common tricks they use to positively manipulate sentiment surrounding GME. I wrote about it a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m68ybj/comment/gr6asm3?context=3). Unfortunately, that post was deleted by Automod when I edited a YouTube link into the text, and the mod team did not respond to requests to restore the post.\n\nRegardless, I‚Äôve noticed many of the same pro-GME talking points being recycled ‚Äî often by brand new accounts that have a post history of begging for karma and posting exclusively about GME. You can love the stock, that‚Äôs fine, but if you *really* love the stock, it‚Äôs important to know how you‚Äôre being misled and lied to by posts that frequently hit the front page. In this thread, I‚Äôll be addressing [this post ‚Äî 21.1k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79wdx/why_the_gme_moass_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_is/) specifically, and I‚Äôll also be linking to similar shady posts that parrot the same baseless or misleading claims.\n\n**Claim #1: GME is inversely-correlated with the broader market because the squeeze forces institutions to sell long positions to protect against margin calls**\n\nThere does seem to be *some* correlation between GME and the broader market, but this doesn‚Äôt imply causation (or shorts getting squeezed). It‚Äôs not uncommon for meme stocks to do well while the rest of the market is selling off. [Exhibit A](https://postimg.cc/PvGJgzYY) ‚Äî [Exhibit B](https://postimg.cc/1VpXsnrT) ‚Äî notice how RIOT‚Äôs peak in 2018 coincides with SPY‚Äôs trough? That‚Äôs correlation, but not causation. Why does this happen? I can‚Äôt say for sure, but my guess is that stocks like this have a lot of volatility, so when funds pull out of the broader market, they place their wealth in these volatile stocks as kind of a ‚Äústore‚Äù of wealth until the sell-off is finished, at which point they cash out and re-enter the market. Just speculating, though.\n\nWhat I *can* prove, however, is that the claim that the broader market and GME are inversely correlated is **complete bullshit**, and it takes only [the barest, most basic amount of research](https://postimg.cc/jDjfQcXS). Here, I‚Äôve overlayed the S&P 500 with GME. If there were any correlation, you would see GME go down roughly whenever SPY went up, and vice-versa. Not good enough? Think GME ought to be valued as a tech company? [Nasdaq similary shows no correlation](https://postimg.cc/VdgMCpXh). Yes, I know the overlays aren‚Äôt perfect, but I‚Äôm working on an iPad here ‚Äî cut me some slack. Regardless, you can see there is **no correlation**, proving that this part of Bows_N_Hoes post is **bullshit**.\n\nFor the record, I *do* think there was an inverse correlation between GME and the broader market back in February. In my opinion, there genuinely was a threat of system collapse. The IBKR chairman himself admitted that. (Request a link to the vid in comments and I‚Äôll provide. I can‚Äôt post it in OP or my post will get whacked). In this case, hedge funds likely *did* have to sell some of their positions to free up liquidity so that they could cover or protect their shorts. This led to the broader market falling while GME squoze. As demonstrated, this correlation no longer exists.\n\nNote: This claim is about inverse correlation is the same as [another unfounded claim ‚Äî 4.4k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6if56/the_mythical_unicorn_aka_extremely_abnormal/) that hit the front page of WSB, and which one of WSB‚Äôs mods similarly dismantled.\n\n**Claim 2: The illegal practice of naked short selling is causing the stock to show over 140% ownership**\n\nThe post claims that short shares are being invented out of thin air and sold on the market. While this is theoretically possible (but illegal!), this is pure speculation. So how then, might you ask, can a stock display over 100% ownership? When stocks are shorted, they are *borrowed* from someone who owns the stock, and then sold. Now, the same shares can be lent from one person to another to another. All of the entities borrowind the stock must report ownership of the stock. So, imagine it this way: I lend my dildo to my friend, and then *he* lends that dildo to *his* friend. I would report owning that dildo, my friend would report owning that dildo (albeit temporarily) and *his* friend would report owning that dildo. So you see how one single dildo can become three? [Investopedia even has an article about this](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp ). The same thing is happening to GME, and any claims that higher than 100% institutional ownership being indicative of the illegal practice of short selling is pure speculation, of which no one has yet provided proof.\n\n**Claim #3: No seriously, these ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù are real, and are being sold back and forth on the market place!**\n\nDo you know what you get when you Google ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù? A bunch of [Indian biomed companies](https://postimg.cc/FYc2syMD) with ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù in their company name. Do you know what happens when you control for these Indian biomed companies?  You get results that are [basically nothing](https://postimg.cc/xcBw2x4X). If ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù were a real phenomenon, you wouldn‚Äôt have to go digging through this many foreign small-cap biomed companies to find any information about it. And before anyone chimes in, snthetic call options and put options *are* real, but those are **very** different from what OP is claiming.\n\n**Claim #4: Hedge funds are totally getting squeezed by GME‚Äôs rise!**\n\nPeople who make this claim often resort to proving it by:\n\n* using complex calculations\n\n* depend on incomplete data\n\n* make suppositions\n\n* discard any data that disproves their claims\n\n[Source ‚Äî 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/)\n\nHowever, we don‚Äôt need to do any logical loop-de-loops to prove that GMe doesn‚Äôt have an exceptionally high level of short interest. In fact, all we have to do is go to [an old fan favorite of WSB](https://isthesqueezesquoze.com/) to see the true story laid out for us in a very clear, concise argument.\n\nHere, we have a few important metrics:\n\n*Short interest ‚Äî 16% ‚Äî the amount of shares short as a percentage of the float ‚Äî while 16% is atypically high, it‚Äôs nowhere *near* the purported 100-350% [some suspicious people](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) with one-month old accounts are shilling.\n\n* Borrow rate ‚Äî 0.6% ‚Äî particularly low. Borrow rates ‚Äî that is, the rate people are paid to lend out the stock on a yearly basis ‚Äî go up a lot the more a stock is shorted. For reference, RKT was at 20% a few weeks ago.\n\n* Borrow availability ‚Äî 300,000 shares ‚Äî the most heavily shorted stocks often appear as ‚Äúno shares available for shorting‚Äù for a long time ‚Äî *days, even* ‚Äî since their shares are so in demand to borrow and sell short.\n\nSo there you have it. Three very simple, easy metrics you can use to verify that the stock is not as heavily shorted as some people want you to believe. To believe otherwise would mean you would have to buy in to conspiracies about a wide-ranging collaboration between various market participants and entities with differing aims, ethics, and stakes, involving thousands of people, and all to cover up the true short rate of just *one* stock. [Occam‚Äôs Razor, y‚Äôall](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNow you have to ask yourself ‚Äî do you like the *stock* or do you like the *hype*? Because if it‚Äôs the former, then you should not be supporting the people continually spreading disinformation about it. If it‚Äôs the latter, then have fun on this wild ride, but don‚Äôt lie or support lying to your fellow WSBers.

For a period of time around the January run-up, it had an inverse correlation with the overall market, which is noteworthy but not necessarily causative.  The strength of the correlation also wasn‚Äôt that great (R^2).  The beta figure that is reported by sites like Yahoo never really tell you the important parts, like ‚Äúover what time frame?‚Äù or ‚Äúwith what predictive strength?‚Äù  Extreme example, beta measured over a two-day period around an earning miss could show insane inverse beta‚Äîjust a function of the price readjustment.\n \nBTW, it‚Äôs easy to test this by doing a quick regression on GME and SPY.  The negative coefficient shows up around the January squeeze-ish.  \n \nOn another note, the OP that started this beta hype misunderstood the basic premise.  If you want to add negative beta to your portfolio, pick a stock that has positive beta and short it.  To you, the beta will be effectively negative.  That does not imply that a heavily shorted stock would itself have a negative beta as that poster thought.

{"title": "Why I think $GME is still bullish and going to moon", "selftext": "Fellow apes, I know many of you, me included, have been through some tough days and hours. Many of you might even have stopped eating crayons or worse: sold your $GME stocks with huge losses. \n\nI want to use this chance to tell you that not all is lost. Nothing is lost (until you sell in fact!). Of course I have no idea what I'm talking about - I'm really no one to trust in financial advice, so be aware. \n\nBut still I am using all these fancy indicators and am wondering why everyone is complaining. Trends in stocks need corrections, that's basic DOW-theory. And how much do they correct in general? A 0.5 Fib-retracement correction is very usual in almost all trends. They even sometimes correct a fib-retracement below. \n\nSo when you're looking at my chart now (very fancy, colors!, buy!) you will see that we're pretty exact around that retracement now. Furthermore price tried to go under EMA50 but directly went up again to the exact position of EMA50. Where are we now?  Correct, almost at EMA50 but NOT below. This is a hell of a support and we're not letting it fall below my fellow apes!\n\nFurthermore EMA100 and EMA200 are still showing upward movement, which is also good. \n\nLast but not least MACD aims for its zero-line and might turn positive. You ask when? Hm, if you look at the MACD trend it might be soon! \n\nAs you can see, from my perspective everything is still fine. For disclosure, I'm stuck in the upper 300s in GME, and I won't sell before we reach at least four digits! \n\nTL:DR: Trend is still fine, EMA50 is holding like a son of a bitch and we should see some upward movement soon. I like the stock and you should like it too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My technical analysis on $GME](https://preview.redd.it/rwn267m02un61.png?width=2091&format=png&auto=webp&s=09182b5399332de89d5a0db97254e1762fad8278)\n\nEdit: Some of you have pointed out we shouldn't put dates on our analysis and I must say I agree. Although I see a very good chance of upward movement soon, we shouldn't link this to today or Monday.

I've kicked myself in the shins because I should have sold when RH cut buying, but it is what it is.\n\nAnyway; The stock is still being shorted every single day. In my opinion, it's keeping the price down to a degree. Now, once people short positions start being covered, then the resistance(shorts being deployed) is now gone (because shorts will be covered by the same people deploying them currently(It's my opinion that the HF's/whales shorting the stock are also the ones in danger of being margin called, or going bankrupt, but that is up to you to agree or disagree with) ), and the price will rise up like a pepsi with a mentos in it.\n\nNow take into account the amount of people actually selling. If someone has to buy back millions of shares, they will eat up the minimal amount of shares actually being sold at market price, and then start jumping to the next available shares. I'm sure there are some people/HF's/whales with sell limits at 500$, 800$, 1k, 3k, 5k, 10k, 20k, etc. and those sell limits will start to become the new market prices over time, because like I said, they will be buying millions upon millions of shares, that will eat away any low price market sales. So in theory, if they owe lets say 200mil shares that are shorted, that is a whole lot of time to buy through market sales and start new price floors at those mentioned limit sale prices. if it's only 100 mil shares shorted, then more shares need to be held and sold at limit prices leading up to 100k in order to actually reach it, and same goes for if there are only 50 mil shorted shares. \n\nBut yes. at some point the shorts are covered, and the party over. Which is what is dictating how high the price goes. people say 1 mil floor, because they see DD and believe whole-heartedly that the short position is just huge enough to warrant the price kissing the 1 mil point(even if it's only 1k shares sold for that, or 1 share sold for that), especially if a majority of people hold their shares. The same logic goes for the 500k price point, 100k price point, 50k, etc.\n\nEdit addition: The price in total paid by short sellers, imo, won't be 100k times X amount of shorted shares. it will be a great mix of different prices that could still tally up to quite a lot of money, but definitely not 100k every share bought.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This is totally fair and a very good argument.
