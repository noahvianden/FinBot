Almost every indicator is showing that inflation fears were overblown.  Its also been about 6 weeks now since the inflation fears began...its becoming old news and investors are becoming less afraid.\n\nThe second reason for the correction was the rotation of major funds from tech into value stocks.  These rotations generally play out over several weeks.  Most funds that were going to rotate, already have and the rotation is more or less complete.\n\nSome other reasons also include the stimmy checks that are coming.  One study showed that 50% of millennials were going to invest that money in the stock market.  Millennials LOVE tech stocks and with them on discount its hard to imagine there wont be some money coming in.  Another reason is the opposite of fear....its Fear Of Missing Out.  Once theres some big green days come in, it fuels even more green as people dont want to miss out.

First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                \n \nNext is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about \"other \" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  \n\nNext is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           \n\nNext is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           \n\nNext is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. \n\nNext is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. \n\nNow I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               \n \nNext is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. \n\nLastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask.

First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                \n \nNext is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about \"other \" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  \n\nNext is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           \n\nNext is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           \n\nNext is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. \n\nNext is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. \n\nNow I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               \n \nNext is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. \n\nLastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask.

Since there is massive untapped labor to be utilized in filling that demand, inflation will be transitory, as Powell and Yellen have both pointed out.  \n\nThe thing is that the money supply is only correlated to inflation and where that money is in the economy will have massively different effects.  If most of the new money has no velocity as it has for decades in the US, inflation will be low, again as it has been.

{"title": "Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose", "selftext": "# Overview\n\nFor much of its‚Äô history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford‚Äôs potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean‚Ä¶ just look at this chart, Ford hasn‚Äôt had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.\n\nI would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She‚Äôs All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we‚Äôre going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.\n\n# New Leadership, New Vision\n\n**$11B Restructuring Plan**\n\nIn October of 2020, Ford hired its‚Äô new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company‚Äôs [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its‚Äô pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.\n\n**Trimming of Fat**\n\nFord has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.\n\nFord also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn‚Äôt turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.\n\nFord Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.\n\n**EV Investment**\n\nHere is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.\n\n**Revival of Valuable IP**\n\nIn the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They‚Äôve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.\n\n# The Power of Partnerships\n\n**Ford, VW, and Argo**\n\nFord, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven‚Äôt been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.\n\n**Ford and Google**\n\nIn February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google‚Äôs software and technology in all of Ford‚Äôs new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\\*cough\\* Toyota \\*cough\\*).\n\n**Ford and Rivian**\n\nFord made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO‚Äôs at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian‚Äôs unique [‚Äúskateboard‚Äù](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of ‚Äúa flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking‚Äù on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.\n\nThe equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\\~$5B-7B) and now (\\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.\n\n# Financials and Valuation\n\n**Financial Overview**\n\n2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?\n\nDespite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don‚Äôt expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.\n\n**Dividend Reinstatement**\n\nGM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \\~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won‚Äôt hurt either.\n\n**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**\n\nGenerally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford‚Äôs numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I‚Äôm avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren‚Äôt comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.\n\nQuick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:\n\nP/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)\n\nForward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)\n\nDebt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)\n\nCurrent Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)\n\nPrice to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)\n\n|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|\n|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|\n|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|\n|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|\n|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I‚Äôm not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.\n\nCompared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford‚Äôs higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.\n\nMy personal price target: **$17.14/share**\n\n# 2021 Outlook\n\n**Massive Demand**\n\nFord‚Äôs most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer‚Äôs lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I‚Äôll list the Time to Turn for Ford‚Äôs three new models in 2021 below:\n\n2021 Ford F-150: 9 days\n\n2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days\n\n2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)\n\nAs you can see Ford‚Äôs recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.\n\n**7500 tax credit availability**\n\nRemember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.\n\nThe way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla‚Äôs recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).\n\nBear Case\n\n**Chip Shortage**\n\nAs I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly 1 million new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they‚Äôd like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford‚Äôs top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.\n\n**Battery Supplier Issues**\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.\n\n**Debt Burden**\n\nThere‚Äôs no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn‚Äôt due in the near future and Ford‚Äôs outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.\n\n**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**\n\nThis post has already become obscenely long so I‚Äôm not going to go into great detail here. You‚Äôve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford‚Äôs path to success.\n\n**Closing**\n\nI believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford‚Äôs core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford‚Äôs future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.\n\n*Disclosures: I am long Ford at an average cost basis of $10.30.

There are advantages to that, because if you do buy the additional 200 shares and sell say two $12 strike calls with your $8 basis, you'll be getting about $125 each from those compared to $54 each if you averaged the cost of shares and sold $15.50 calls.\n\nI agree that you shouldn't just slap another purchase in because it makes the number look better to you, though.

But people have created this \"average down\" idea that creates the false impression that if you buy enough shares, you'll limit your down side. No, that just exposes you to *more* potential down side. The maximum loss of 100 shares at $25 is $2500 if the stock went to 0. The maximum loss of 200 shares at an average of $16.5 is $3600 if the stock went to 0.

Apple is valued $2t, in large part based on the comparatively much smaller smartphone market that only has ~$0.5t sales per year. Tesla is targeting markets that are an order of magnitude larger than Apple. If they succeed, Tesla's valuation could easily exceed $10t.

{"title": "Frequency Therapeutics - A sleeping biotech giant, about to wake from its slumber", "selftext": "**Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.**\n\nThis is not a company I came across through my general stock research. In fact, it is a company I stumbled across through my own personal health journey.\n\nI'm expecting a significant jump in the stock price in the next week or two (possibly even in the next day or two) and so wanted to post my own due diligence for others. I am currently long on $FREQ.\n\n**Some personal disclosure first**\n\nAs mentioned above, I came across this company through my own personal health journey. Until Frequency Therapeutics, I had never invested into biotech as I deemed it was too risky and I considered the science beyond my understanding, and to some extent still do. To put it simply, I saw no reason in investing in something I couldn't understand.\n\nThis all changed when I started to experience problems with my hearing. I currently suffer from hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis. Frequency Therapeutics' leading drug candidate aims to regenerate hearing in the human ear.\n\nNaturally then, I am not only financially invested but also emotionally invested in this company. I want them to win and it‚Äôs only right I disclose this. The thing is, these conditions have led me down a journey towards understanding the science behind the anatomy of the human ear over the years, as well as look into why previous attempts at regenerating hearing have failed. I do not have a medical background, but I believe the amount of understanding I have accumulated over the years after having read dozens if not hundreds of peer-reviewed medical journal articles has given me an insight into an area of biotech - namely otology - that I otherwise would not have had.\n\nSo as I say, I've seen many companies come and go over the years, attempting to treat hearing loss with no success. I did not invest in any of them. So what's different this time?\n\nMy analysis will focus on five things: the leading product and how it works, how this drug is different from other companies trying to treat hearing loss, Frequency's clinical trial results so far, the team behind the product, the financials and the potential market size.\n\n**The leading drug candidate: FX-322**\n\n[FX-322 aims to regenerate hair cells in the cochlea.](https://www.frequencytx.com/pipeline-programs/hearing-program/) The auditory system is complex with many points of failure, but the most common cause of hearing loss along that pathway is induced by the loss of these hair cells, either due to noise exposure, age or drugs (ototoxicity). When these cells die, they are gone forever. Current treatments consist of hearing aids and cochlea implants, which simply amplify the remaining signal from the surviving hair cells. They do not replace or restore the clarity and frequencies lost by dead hair cells. These hair cells are located in the cochlea, a small membrane located behind the middle ear and in one of the most difficult-to-reach areas of the body. Treating hearing loss therefore poses not just the challenge of developing the drug, but also finding a way to deliver it to the cochlea once developed.\n\nInterestingly, birds and some other animals are known to regenerate their hair cells, and therefore their hearing, naturally. The relevance of this will become more obvious further down below.\n\nUntil now, one of the obvious attempts at restoring hearing in the ear has been through the use of stem cells. The idea behind using stem cells, as we all know, is that a stem cell can turn into any other cell. Stem cells, however, present their own sets of challenges. As described above, there is a delivery issue. Even if one could culture a good number of hair cells from stem cells, it is very difficult to transfer them to the cochlea. Moreover, the process of injecting the cochlea would itself cause cochlea damage (and potentially hearing loss). Secondly, stem cells turned into hair cells lack the genes required to integrate fully into the the colonies of other hair cells. It would be a retro-fit, rather than a seamless fit. Thirdly, developing stem cells on a mass scale for such a big market (which I discuss further down) also presents its own challenges.\n\nBack to FX-322.\n\nA few years ago, researchers discovered that the cochlea is a host to what are known as progenitor cells. Progenitor cells are cells that are slightly further down the line of a stem cell, but unlike a stem cell, which can turn into any kind of a cell, a progenitor cell has a pre-determined cell ‚Äúfate‚Äù, in that it can only turn into one type of cell. A man named Will McLean, co-founder of Frequency Therapeutics, discovered during his PhD that a certain progenitor cell in the cochlea - the LGR5 cell - was the progenitor cell during development (i.e. in the uterus) responsible for going on to become a hair cell. This was an important discovery, as it was not previously known ‚Äúwhich cell became what‚Äù. These progenitor cells divide and replicate until there are enough hair cells, and the process is self-limiting in that once the 15,000 hair cells found in the human ear have been produced, the division and replication stops. This is important, because you would otherwise have a cancer risk, but this is nature we are talking about. The LGR5 cells continue to remain in the cochlea after birth, but the cell signalling required for them to continue to divide and replicate has been ‚Äúswitched off‚Äù. This is in contrast to birds and other animals, where the cell signalling remains.\n\nAround this same time, another researcher, Xaiolei Yin, working in the same lab, had been doing some [research on the lining of the intestine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3951815/). Many do not know this, but the human intestine is one of the few regenerative tissues in the body - it replenishes every 5 to 7 days. Xaiolei Yin was able to show that this regeneration was down to the exact same type of progenitor cell ‚Äì the LGR5 cell. The difference between the LGR5 cells in the intestine and in the cochlea was that the intestine was accompanied by something else called a Paneth cell, which provides the cell signalling required to ‚Äúturn on‚Äù the LGR5 cells. No such cells exist in the cochlea. Xaiolei Yin, however, was able to show that if you used two small molecules ‚Äì CHIR (a proprietary molecule) and VPA (valproic acid) ‚Äì you could replicate the effect of Paneth cells on LGR5 cells in the absence of Paneth cells. [Will McLean took this idea and applied it to his cochlea research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124717301365). By applying VPA and CHIR, Will McLean was able to completely regenerate hair cells in mice and human cochlea ex vivo. Moreover, this process too was shown to be self-limiting: a key requirement in terms of cancer concerns. Finally, Will and his team were able to show that this method allowed them to regenerate 2000x more cells than previous research attempts.\n\nIn short, they were able to ‚Äúswitch on‚Äù the body‚Äôs innate ability to regenerate itself. This is when [Frequency Therapeutics](https://www.frequencytx.com/) was born.\n\nFun Fact: Will McLean used to post on reddit many years ago as PhD student while doing his research into progenitor cells and used to post regularly in hearing loss and tinnitus forums about the work he was doing in his lab.\n\n**Previous attempts and how FX-322 is different from the competition.**\n\nAs mentioned above, previous attempts have consisted of retrofitting stem cells and other experimental approaches. Frequency does have some competition from other biotech firms, namely [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/), [Regain](https://www.regainyourhearing.eu/) and [Pipeline Therapeutics](https://www.pipelinetherapeutics.com/).\n\n\\[Imgur\\]([https://imgur.com/AewCyUu](https://imgur.com/AewCyUu))\n\nThese companies have a similar approach to Frequency in that they too are trying to make use of progenitor cells but they all differ in one key way. These companies all use an approach called direct transdifferentiation, whereas Frequency Therapeutics use an approach called mitotic regeneration.\n\n\\[Imgur\\]([https://imgur.com/4yzH814](https://imgur.com/4yzH814))\n\nUsing direct transdifferentiation, one can convert a progenitor cell into a hair cell. The problem is, once you do this, that original progenitor cell is gone ‚Äì it has been depleted. In other words, the prospect of repeat treatment is zero. Frequency Therapeutics drug is different in that it induces the progenitor to asymmetrically divide into another progenitor cell and a hair cell, meaning that the original progenitor cell is never depleted ‚Äì the equilibrium is maintained. The new hair cell then takes the place of the dead hair cell, which is absorbed and/or washed away by the body. This difference in drug philosophy has many implications, both from an effectiveness point of view and also a financial point of view, in that it allows for the same patient to receive multiple treatments if required.\n\nIf you recall, I also mentioned something above about drug delivery. The beauty of Frequency‚Äôs approach is that the procedure is extremely simple. It simply involves an injection through the eardrum using local anasthetic. The gel then diffuses from the middle ear to the inner ear through what's known as the round window, so the cochlea is never compromised. The molecules then do their thing.\n\nSo where are we now?\n\n**Phase 1 results**\n\nFrequency are due to release Phase 2 results any day now. All we have now to glean data from are the Phase 1 results.\n\nI feel this is the point where most people have missed the value of this stock, in that they have totally misinterpreted the data and why this stock has gone under the radar the way it has.\n\nPhase 1 trials are usually conducted with one thing in: safety. They rarely look into efficacy of the drug, as the sample is so small. However, Frequency did carry out some small efficacy research. At first glance, these results were somewhat underwhelming. Audiograms showed no statistically significant changes. Some 4/15 patients showed a minor blip at the very top of the audiogram ‚Äì 8,000kHz ‚Äì but again nothing to write home about. Furthermore, out of the 15 patients who received FX-322, only 6 showed improvements in their word recognition scores and only 4 of the 6 at a statistically significant level.\n\nYou‚Äôre probably now thinking I‚Äôve just wasted your time. **Bear with me.**\n\nThere are a few things to note here. Firstly, audiograms only test for a range of frequencies. Humans can hear up to 20,000 Hz, but audiograms only test up to 8,000Hz ‚Äì that‚Äôs less than half of the frequency range. Until recently, it had been suggested that the frequencies above 8,000 Hz were not important and of ‚Äúacademic interest‚Äù only, but for reasons that will soon become apparent, this is not the case at all. In any case, [check out this study.](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/47/23753) Secondly and most importantly, when one reads the actual study, it is made clear that only 6 of the 15 patients who received FX-322 had ‚Äúheadroom‚Äù to improve their word recognition scores. In other words, the scores of the other 9 patients were already so high, that it would be impossible to differentiate at a statistical or even clinically meaningful level whether an improvement in those high scores was down to re-test variability or the drug itself. So Frequency decided it was best to compare the 10 patients who had the headroom required for hearing improvement: 6 who received FX-322 and 4 who received placebo.\n\nWhen Frequency did this, the results were staggering.\n\n\\[img\\][https://i.imgur.com/pmZNvZo.png\\[/img\\]](https://i.imgur.com/pmZNvZo.png[/img])\n\nTwo patients saw their word scores more than double, while two other patients saw their words scores almost double. The other two patients also improved, albeit not at a statistically significant level. None of the patients who received placebo showed any such improvement.\n\n*These patients were tested and retested over more than a year and their results remained (when accounting for re-test variability) at the end of the durability study, with the exception of only one patient who worsened below original baseline. We don't know why this one patient worsened, but one idea is that the false sense of security arising from their initial improvement may have resulted in them returning to dangerously noisy activity again (the new cells are equally prone to damage as the old ones)* ~~One patient~~ ~~did fall out of the statistically significant boundary but remained with a notably improved score.~~\n\nThe question then became: if these patients are improving their word scores, why are we not seeing it on the audiogram? Those investors left unimpressed by frequency‚Äôs results have suggested that either the sample size was too small while others have outright accused them of ‚Äúp-hacking‚Äù (a very serious accusation). I personally believe the answer to be quite simple.\n\nIf you may recall, I said above that 4/15 patients did see a 10db improvement at 8,000 kHz. 10db may not sound like much, until you realise that the hearing loss scale is logarithmic. A 10db improvement means that sound sensitivity has improved 10-fold. But here is the pertinent point. Have a look below at the diagram of the cochlea.\n\n\\[Imgur\\]([https://imgur.com/5pcsPFs](https://imgur.com/5pcsPFs))\n\nYou will notice that different parts of the cochlea are responsible for different frequencies. You will notice that the very top of the range - 20,000 Hz - coincides with an area of the cochlea called the round window. As you may recall, the round window is the entry point for FX-322. In other words, the very first cells that regenerate from the drug are in the very frequencies that audiograms do not traditionally test for. The hair cells responsible for these frequencies are also the ‚Äúfirst to go‚Äù in human hearing, and therefore have the most amount of damage ‚Äì and therefore the most amount of regeneration. This would also explain why some improvement was observed at 8,000kHz in that it was the highest frequency on the audiogram. The part of the cochlea responsible for this frequency is closer to the round window than any of the other frequencies on the standard audiogram. The idea then is that the improvement in word scores are down to improvements that cannot be measured on the audiogram. As a result, Phase 2 results are now measuring patients‚Äô hearing using extended audiograms up to 16,000 Hz.\n\nThe problem is, this doesn't explain why improvements were not observed at lower frequencies. Frequency Therapeutics' own modelling has shown that the drug in its current dosage and form does not reach the majority of the lower frequencies measured on the audiogram:\n\n\\[Imgur\\]([https://imgur.com/p8uQC5b](https://imgur.com/p8uQC5b))\n\nThis is a pharmacodynamics issue and would explain why improvements were not observed in the lower frequencies. It may, however, be resolved in Phase 2 for one of two reasons. Phase 2 is currently testing multiple doses, the idea being that not only does the drug reach deeper into the cochlea with more doses but also that, because less of the drug is likely to absorbed once the first ‚Äúwave‚Äù of regeneration has occurred in higher frequencies, it means the drug will simply travel through to the lower frequencies without being immediately absorbed. It remains to be seen whether the drug will reach deeper into the cochlea, but ultimately this is something that can be improved down the line with a reformulation. Frequency only need to prove that the drug is safe, that it works in principle and that it gives a real quality of life improvement to take it to market. They can always reformulate the drug carrier - the gel - and bring an improved version a year later. We know this is possible because other companies, such as Otonomy, that are focusing on other ear-related conditions, such as Meniere's and genetic hearing loss, have developed a [sustained release delivery vehicle](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/otonomy-presents-data-on-breakthrough-ear-treatment-92658769.html) that can reach the lower frequencies of the cochlea.\n\nAs I said at the very beginning, the biggest issue is drug delivery. Frequency have not completely cracked that, but they seem to be on the right path.\n\n**Phase 2 results**\n\nPhase 2 results come out any day now. I believe we will see some phenomenal responses in the extended audiograms and some improvements in lower frequencies in the higher-dose cohorts. I also expect there to be some improvement if not resolution of other associated conditions, such as tinnitus. Although not mentioned in their study or above, [Frequency have been on the record saying that they have anecdotal cases of patients from the Phase 1 trial saying their tinnitus improved](https://www.tinnitustalk.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/transcript-tinnitus-talk-podcast-ep12-frequency-therapeutics.pdf). They have therefore added tinnitus as a secondary outcome measure.\n\n**The team behind the product**\n\nI‚Äôve already mentioned two individuals who played a key role in developing FX-322. I now want to spend a moment talking about other people behind the company. There are many to pick from, but I will focus on just two. The first man is none other than [Robert Langer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._Langer). Why should you care about this guy? Firstly, his forehead is brighter than my future, but more importantly, he is the most cited engineer of all time, the 4th most cited individual in history and he has participated in the founding of more than 40 biotech companies, including Moderna. He is also regarded as the founder of tissue engineering in regenerative medicine. This is a seriously big name to have and I do not for a moment believe he would be [part of this](https://www.frequencytx.com/people/robert-s-langer-scd-2/) unless he believed this drug is the beginning of something special.\n\nThe other man is someone called [Carl Lebel](https://www.frequencytx.com/people/%E2%80%A2carl-lebel-phd/), their chief development officer. Carl Lebel specialises in getting drugs approved by the FDA. He knows the process inside out and is someone you want on your team if you are trying to get your drug to market. However, the most pertinent point about Carl is that until he joined the company in 2018, [he was actually retired](https://www.tinnitustalk.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/transcript-tinnitus-talk-podcast-ep12-frequency-therapeutics.pdf). It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the product and data with his own eyes that he realised this was a boat he could not miss. When one considers that it takes, on average, 10 years to get a drug to market, this was a pretty big decision to make, and not one I think Carl would make unless he was confident this drug would indeed get to the market.\n\n**The financials and potential market cap**\n\nLike most start-up biotechs with no drug currently on the market, Frequency is, for now, [loss-making](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/freq/financials/cash-flow). Without cash and investors, this company is as dead as the hair cells in my ears. It looks like, however, that this should not be a problem for frequency, assuming they hit their targets. Following Phase 1 results, they came to a deal with Astellas for over half a billion dollars with an [80m upfront cash payment](https://investors.frequencytx.com/static-files/bd82e199-8b2c-4c35-9929-3d7ed4cbcfc2). The deal is contingent that Frequency hit certain milestones through their clinical trials and in return Astellas get the rights to license FX-322 outside the US, although Frequency Therapeutics will receive royalties for sales outside the US.\n\nInstitutional ownership amounts to 81% of current shares and big names include [Blackrock, Vanguard, Federated Hermes and others](https://fintel.io/so/us/freq#:~:text=Lucchino%20David%20L.&text=Ownership%20and%20Shareholders-,Frequency%20Therapeutics%2C%20Inc.,a%20total%20of%2027%2C594%2C671%20shares).\n\nIn short, the company is well placed financially to get FX-322 to market, assuming the product lives up to expectations.\n\nRecent appointments this year, including [Kevin Franck,](https://www.frequencytx.com/people/kevin-franck-phd/) who is responsible for strategic marketing and planning, and [Quentin McCubbin](https://investors.frequencytx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/frequency-therapeutics-appoints-quentin-mccubbin-phd-chief), are also positive signs that the Phase 2 data Frequency are sitting on is positive.\n\nThe last question from an investment point of view then becomes one of how big the market for this drug is.\n\nHere‚Äôs just a few numbers for you. The global hearing aids market was recently measured at $8.9 billion and is projected to increase to over [$13 billion by 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/05/2153196/0/en/Global-Hearing-Aids-Market-worth-USD-13-38-Billion-at-8-2-CAGR-GN-Hearing-Launches-Revolutionary-New-Hearing-Aid-Named-ReSound-ONE.html). The cochlea implant market is valued currently just under [$1.7 billion](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cochlear-implants-industry) and is projected to increase by approximately 10% every year until 2027. This would give an expected market cap for cochlea implants of over $3 billion and a combined hearing aid and cochlea implant market of over $16 billion by 2027. Frequency‚Äôs market cap is currently just under $1.4 billion. If you may recall, neither hearing aids or cochlea implants are ideal solutions. They only amplify the signal that‚Äôs left, they do not restore the signal that is lost - not to mention that aesthetically they are awful. The demand for a natural, regenerative treatment is high and the cost of hearing loss to the world economy is estimated to be approximately [$750 billion annually.](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254659/9789241512046-eng.pdf;jsessionid=FA333887A741DE3503CF3A7F70231FF1?sequence=1)\n\nApproximately 466 million people have hearing loss and the number is increasing exponentially due to the excessively noisy world we live in and increased use of portable sound devices.\n\nMoreover, there is also the global tinnitus market. Some 32% of the US population has tinnitus - approx 100 million people. There is no cure for tinnitus currently and the size of this market as far as a treatment is concerned is pure speculation. For what it‚Äôs worth, current tinnitus treatment (such as TRT or CBT) currently costs the UK economy ¬£750 million a year ‚Äì approximately $1 billion a year. Given the UK has a population of 66 million, I can only imagine how big of a market there is for tinnitus worldwide. I should make it clear, however, that although the primary cause of tinnitus is hair cell death (resulting in misfiring neurons, producing a phantom signal), it is still speculation as to whether FX-322 will cure or treat the condition in these cases. The only evidence we have are the anecdotal cases from Phase 1, as well as the general anecdotal cases of patients with hearing aids and cochlea implants who see their tinnitus improve, suggesting then that the underlying cause is a loss of input.\n\nFrequency Therapeutics also have another drug in their pipeline aimed at treating MS. Their aim is to regenerate the myelin sheath using the same small molecule approach. They are expected to announce this drug candidate for clinical trials later this year. The current MS market is valued at $25 billion and is expected to reach $40 billion by 2027.\n\nFinally, Frequency Therapeutics, in their investor statement, have stated that their small molecule approach may have applications for many other diseases and conditions throughout the body.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe Frequency Therapeutics are at the pinnacle of a major medical breakthrough and I believe we may be seeing the leader of regenerative medicine in its infancy. I know I am personally and emotionally invested in this company, but I believe I have researched this company enough to know what I‚Äôm investing in. I urge others to do their own due diligence as well.\n\nPhase 2 results will be announced end of Q1 2021, and with a [hearing conference taking place this Wednesday](https://www.tinnitustalk.com/attachments/event-schedule_fhhconference-pdf.43840/), which Frequency are sponsoring and presenting at, I believe those results could well be announced as soon as today or tomorrow.\n\nAdditional info:\n\n\\- [Presentation on Phase 1 results](https://investors.frequencytx.com/static-files/16a21001-6397-409d-b760-77ef91e9658c)\n\n\\- [Another presentation on Phase 1 results](https://investors.frequencytx.com/static-files/47014168-736e-4a25-9435-b1a8bf19599e)\n\n\\- [2019 annual report](https://investors.frequencytx.com/static-files/bd82e199-8b2c-4c35-9929-3d7ed4cbcfc2)\n\n\\- [Peer reviewed paper of Phase 1 results and pre-clinical work](https://journals.lww.com/otology-neurotology/Abstract/9000/Improved_Speech_Intelligibility_in_Subjects_With.95768.aspx)\n\n\\- I also have a private Youtube link to a presentation given by Will McLean during the infancy of Frequency Therapeutics which I think encapsulates his research very well to the layman. Unfortunately I'm not allowed to post the link here under sub rules but hopefully the mods can do something about that.\n\nEdit: grammar.\n\nEdit 2: I'm trying to link the images through imgur so that they appear in the body of the post but no luck. Any advice on this? I'd like to make it easier so people don't have to click.\n\nEdit 3: Just clarified something about one patient in the durability study who not only lost stat sig but also worsened below baseline. Not something I think to worry about though, as there are two possible explanations for this. Either the patient had a false sense of security post-treatment and returned to dangerously noisy activity again, or the hair cells that were not only originally regenerated (most likely in the lower frequencies) continued to wear and tear until they died as well. I suspect it may have been a combination of both.\n\nEdit 4: Wow, my first silver!

We already know from pre-clinical testing in mice and human cadavers that the drug WORKS in that they were able to fully restore hair cells across the cochlea. The only concern in live humans is how well it works because there is a delivery challenge that doesn't exist when you have a cochlea in a petri dish, which is: how do we get enough of this drug into the lower frequencies?\n\nI can only see good results from Phase 2. Why?\n\n1) They are using multiple doses.   \n2) They are using extended audiograms (therefore better measurement outcomes)  \n3) They are focusing on moderate to severe groups that have a higher \"ceiling\" in terms of potential improvement.   \n4) We have seen Frequency Therapeutics recruit two people this year who specialise in marketing and producing drugs on a mass scale. They would have already had sight of their Phase 2 data before hiring these guys.   \n5) Their Twitter feed has also been unusually active lately promoting the lack of awareness with regards to hearing loss, suggesting then that they are already making moves to \"prepping\" the market\n\n**Medium term**\n\nAssuming a positive readout from Phase 2, there isn't much other than speculation that will shift the price between Phase 2 readout and Phase 3 readout. There are some Phase 1 trials running in parallel where Frequency Therapeutics are re-running their Phase 1 but with different target groups - for example, age-related hearing loss patients.\n\n**Long term**\n\nOne long-term concern is some kind of adverse event at Phase 3. Some side-effects only become apparent once you test a drug on a large enough population. It's possible that we could see some adverse effect, but there has not been anything yet to indicate that this could happen. The drug is delivered locally, not systemically, so it is very unlikely someone might die or be seriously medically compromised during the clinical trial. Phase 1 results show very low systemic absorption of the drug in the blood tests. I also mentioned that the regenerative process has been shown to be self-limiting ex vivo.\n\nAnother is education and re-training of doctors. The expectation is that, if the drug is successful, the demand will be so high that there will not be enough doctors trained in the procedure - an injection through the eardrum - that will meet the demand. It is expected therefore that it may take some time to prepare and train doctors and this may \"cap\" the market cap in the days immediately after market approval. But from a 5-10 year timeline view, I do not think there should be many concerns. \n\nAnd yes, now would probably be a good time to buy (not financial advice). It was hovering around the 30-35 dollar mark for a while before speculation took it into the 50s. I do not think that price was a fair reflection given no Phase 2 readout.

Manufacturing millions of doses annually is something I'm unsure the difficulty, but between companies like https://resilience.com/team/ and all the emphasis on bio manufacturing, I think they have plenty of options if they search. Sales and commercialization usually is a problem with negotiating regulator approvals, reimbursement, and various other aspects of a sales and marketing team.\n\nIf this treatment goes to market, Astellas takes care ex-US so they only have to worry about US FDA regulator. Sales and marketing will be easy in my opinion so long as the financial model meets the ENT/audiologist incentive of making more money (which I believe it does). Soon as there's a treatment that is a minor procedure to improve your hearing, it'll sell itself in my opinion.\n\nAnd small molecule manufacturing is much cheaper and easier to scale then complex large molecules.\n\nHence I imagine they will tackle this themselves, or get a bidding war going because whoever gets the rights to this treatment if the ph2a and ph1b results are positive, will easily make tens of billions of dollars of pure profit in a decade. Just offering it once to everybody in the US for 5k is equivalent to 150B dollars of cash flow.\n\nA license deal for US rights is easily worth 1-2 billion up front with 10-20B in milestones in my opinion (all depending how good the data is and how far they get in clinical development)\n\nGiven the next step after the current ph1b and ph2a trials is likely a registrational they will do in 2022, I feel good odds they will run the trial, get the data demonstrating all populations benefit, and then either just print money (and I draw a parallel here of VRTX which did what FREQ is doing for hearing, to Cystic Fibrosis and prints 8-10B in sales annually and has a 50B market cap purely off of that single asset monopoly).\n\nThe difference is PCA can be used for so much more and hence I think if FREQ plays their cards right, they can easily become a BP giant.

Firstly, FX-322 clearly did something - Frequency said as much. The problem was that there was an unprecedented response in the placebo group never seen before in the history of hearing loss trials, which made it impossible to differentiate between the two groups. If neither group saw any improvement in WR scores there would be no discussion to be had here. \n\nWhat also didn't help was that the response in the treatment group was not as big as what they had seen in the Phase 1/2 trial and Phase 1b trial. The only explanation for this is the multiple dosing regime, which was unique to Phase 2. Even if a patient got one dose of FX-322, they still ended up getting 3 more injections of nothing after that. Clearly that was very unfavourable to the biological environment, but they went for it in the hope that the drug would get deeper than normal.\n\nAs for the placebo response, it is not unreasonable to suggest that people faked their scores to get into the trial. Lucchino said they had combed through social media and found evidence of people who were rejected sharing the entry criteria. This was quite a statement, so I decided to see if I could verify this myself. Having combed through some forums myself since yesterday, I can confirm that this did happen. If some patients purposely flunked their word score to get into the trial, it would be extremely difficult to then tell if their improvement was from the drug or placebo. \n\nThis was always a binary play and clearly something has gone very wrong and a lot of credibility has been lost. This is now an extremely risky play to hold through. I don't think this is quite over by any means as they are well-financed to go to pivotal and if their two other trials this year establish the same hearing signal the FDA will allow them to go to pivotal. No doubt though, they have a lot of work to do if they're going to save this.

{"title": "$NOK (Nokia) DD. Big week ahead with other recent news. Maybe fourth time posting is the charm.", "selftext": "Alright smooth brains, strap in. This is going to be a wild ride. I said I wouldn't post more $NOK DD...I lied.\n\nObligatory, I didn't wear a helmet growing up, so I'm not qualified to give financial advice. I just like the stock.\n\nMy position: I'm in for a bit over 2,500 shares and 211 calls.\n\nThis is going to be a two-tiered DD that will focus on the very near term (this week) and a bit longer time frame.\n\n***1. Open Options expiring 3/19***\n\nI've written a bit about this in my past NOK DD posts, but I want to give just a small look at it again, as this week is shaping up to be incredibly wild with Nokia. Aside from the already astronomical OI on call contracts, we have two catalysts that will come into play this week. The first is stimulus money. As we all know by now, that sweet sweet government money is going to start hitting accounts today and over the next few days. Now, IDGAF what you do with that money, but we already know that a massive amount is gonna go straight into the market:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a)\n\nWhy that is especially important for NOK. NOK is currently the #1 stock on Robinhood, a frequent top 20 stock here, and around 100k watchers on another platform (not sure if we can mention it here or not). Needless to say, NOK has more retail eyeballs on it than pretty much any other stock except for GME, AMC, and a handful of the other big boys (TSLA / FAANG / ETC). So, you tracking me....stimi money make NOK go üöÄüöÄüöÄ.\n\nThe second catalyst is Nokia's Capital Market Day event taking place on 3/18. If you want any more information on that, you can scroll through my post history. I'll sum it up. CMD could be a paradigm altering event for Nokia. Their new CEO has been aggressive with increasing FCF, and it's working. They are now seeing great cash flow increases even during COVID. This puts them in a position to either increase buybacks, reinstate dividends, or invest heavily into R&D to take over 5G/ be a frontrunner for 6G.\n\nThis all leads me to the wild options chain expiring next Friday. At this point, if you don't know what a gamma squeeze is, then I can't really do anything for you. This last week was huge as we went from well under $4, to well over it. That completely changed the ball game on 42k option contracts at the $4 strike. It put them well ITM, drastically increasing the delta on the options. Now that they are well ITM, the delta on those (currently .7433) will only increase as we draw closer to expiry. The next strike is $4.50 and we have around 26k OI on those. Gamma and Delta on these are currently .7260 and .3078, respectively. I'm curious what kind of action we see Monday PM. This week is looking like it's going to shape up like the wild week back in January. That week NOK closed on Friday at $4.20, and this Friday it closed at $4.21. The Monday of that week, NOK basically gapped to $4.75 and started it's wild ride. If that happens again, or if we see any movement closer to $4.50 early in the week, things will get wild.\n\n**The \"finish line\" on the craziness is the $5 calls.** There is currently 133k OI at the $5 strike. This is an absolutely mind boggling amount of calls open this close to expiry. Currently, they are essentially worthless with a bid at .03 at close on Friday. However, if we see stimulus money poured in and any sort of positive rumors preCMD, we could see the price action of NOK drift towards $4.75-4.90. At this point, the gamma squeeze begins on those $5 calls, and could set off a wild ride. I don't foresee something like what happened back in January happening again, but all of the catalysts are there to make it happen again...if not more this time around. It really all stems around CMD. If they come out with some wildly positive news, this thing could explode.\n\nBonus...there is another 64k OI @ $6, 53k @ $7, and 45k @ $8, to keep the ride going.\n\n**2. Relevant news since my last DD Post**\n\nI thought a lot about not posting another DD post, but I just feel the news is coming so fast and often with Nokia lately, that someone should at least compile the big pieces together and post them here for the sub's benefit. I won't add much too much commentary on each piece.\n\nFirst, the FCC reiterated their stance on Huawei and ZTE as security risks. IMO, this is a big one. It shows that the administration isn't going to stray away from the previous one's stance on the Chinese 5G companies. This gives Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung a few more years to develop an oligopoly in the US market.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022)\n\nSecond, in the same vein as the previous one. It looks like India is going to institute a Huawei ban.\n\n[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials)\n\nLastly, Samsung and Nokia signed a deal for Samsung to pay royalties to Nokia for a patent license. This one doesn't have anything to do with 5G, but something to do with video standards. The bigger piece in this one is Samsung's apparent rift with Ericsson. If Samsung needs access to some sort of 5G patent, it appears they are more wiling to play ball with Nokia than Ericsson. It also shows how wide Nokia's patent landscape is.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML)\n\nThere are so many more things that I'm looking out for on the Nokia front. Here is a very short list:\n\n\\- What other countries will institute Huawei/ZTE bans. At this point it appears it's going to be a China vs. the world battle when it comes to 5G/Data infrastructure.\n\n\\- Either at CMD, the annual meeting in April, or the next ER we should get an update on their ReefShark delivery percentage. It is their top KPI as a company. The higher % of ReefShark they have across the network, the more profitable their networks segment becomes.\n\n\\- Can they keep increasing FCF in the next few ERs? Kind of tied into ReefShark and a ton of other factors.\n\n\\- What kind of contracts does the US DoD sign with Nokia in the near future?They were part of the $600M deal back in the fall of last year, and at this point it looks like the government wants to work with either NOK/ERIC for that kind of buildout.\n\n\\- Will we see some sort of stimulus in order to build out 5G networks in the US/EU? Goes back to my China vs. everybody point earlier. I'd like to see the FCC utilize the massive haul they got in the latest spectrum auction to provide grants or some sort of funding to the telco companies to actually build out the networks in those spectrums.\n\nLastly, if anyone makes a comment about the float being a hinderance to NOK's ability to move, I will buy them an all expense paid trip to the Crayola factory. I will send an email to the CEO, and ask them to work with you to create a new color. It will be called, \"WSB Short Bus Yellow\". Nearly 3B shares were traded in one week back in January, and it could have been more if not for RH and other brokers shutting it down. There are way more than enough retail and institutional eyeballs on Nokia to see the volume it needs in order to move.\n\nTL:DR - NOK's CMD event on 3/18 could cause a massive gamma squeeze with nearly 200k OI on calls ITM or close to being ITM. Stimi money pumping in this week with tons of retail eyeballs on NOK sets up for what could be an extremely interesting week. We almost saw $10 print in January, and all the factors, if not more, are in play this week.", "id": "m57vcf", "created_utc": 1615766462.0, "score": 990, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 206, "comments": [{"body": "You‚Äôre on point!

Why this week 3/19 ?**\n\nEarnings is set for 3/23 however at the current price point, >80% of the value is dependent on successful future business transformation instead of the current Q performance.\n\nDue to the structure of the current $GME option chains OI and external conditions such as the quad witching(the index futures, index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously on March's 3rd Friday) and new DTCC regulations, 3/19 provides the highest probability of success.\n\n**3.

What makes you so casually spill the blood of heretics based on the found ravings of a lunatic?? You may think I'm crazy... but you're here with me aren't you? Can you taste the electrified air?  Shh.. Can you hear it? Can you feel the siren call of the cacophonic wardrums? That's the high frequency pulse of gods waging endless war across the firmament far above us..The Bull... The Bear...

Do not fear my friend, it's doors will open soon enough\n\n**and you will find out who the fuck you are.**\n\n# Lets fucking Go.\n\n**The Thesis**\n\n1 - Canoo Inc. has /u/deepfuckingvalue which is unrecognized by its current SP.\n\n2 - Shorts pressed GOEV from an average share price of 17-18 dollars down to 10.\n\n3 - There is a recent sudden catalyst of macro market conditions and sudden revelations about the product line which has caused a sudden revaluation of the company.\n\n5 - There is a tactical and ~~benevolent~~ long who constructed a GAMMA ramp(Power üó°Ô∏è) and is pushing the SI into it. The past week we have seen strategic gap openings to utilize the gamma ramp. 16 is our next prize.\n\n8. At a certain point the short interest will be untenable and margins will get called.\n\n12. One may Profit.\n\n**If any of that has changed the thesis must be updated and expectations adjusted.**\n\n# The numbers.\n\nOrtex - Remember the Numbers are T - 1 Trading Day\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Power Table of Stat Madness|3/15|3/16|3/17|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Ortex Screen Shot|[Link](https://u.teknik.io/H9JPX.png)|[Link](https://u.teknik.io/1lQL2.png)|[Link](https://u.teknik.io/2eYDc.png)|\n|Estimated Short Interest|8.7M|9.8(+1.1M)|10.5(+.7M)|\n|Days to Cover|1.23|1.33(+.11)|1.42(.11)|\n|/u/pennyether did this|Total # Shares Delta Hedged 3/15|||\n|15.5|7,271,921|||\n|16|8,260,323|||\n|16.5|9,222,653|||\n|17|10,149,655|||\n|17.5|11,036,401|||\n|18|11,881,152|||\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# This is not a done deal.\n\nAs we saw Friday a large player on the short side initiate a gamma attack by purchasing a metric fuck ton of Puts which altered the buy/sell orders coming from MM to maintain their delta neutral stance to move to the sell side.  Essentially temporarily cut off from their supply lines of support, Longs struck a retreat, pulled the backstops and ran with the price down to what it opened at.  While the prices of options cratered, someone bought a fuckton of hyper cheap 15$ calls and closed them out.  This is either\n\n* A - A market maker looking for a good deal on hedging some short positions\n* B - A Ronin slipping in to scalp the fruits of war.\n* C - The short interest essentially turning states witness and hedging their outstanding short interest at a price 90 cents higher than the current share price.\n\nThe SP stabilized **at the opening price**.  The effect of this in my option would be like catching the sword blade while it is being swung at you bare handed, snapping it off and throwing it their face.\n\nLongs effectively told shorts, \" You're not in control, you just think you are. You just spent 500k or more on that and we are still going to close green. Bitch\"\n\n\"I'll see you at the bike racks on Monday after stimmie check Christmas.\"\n\nWe are now in an active fight.  Expect it to get messy.  This isn't just spend money and win. 8 million shares at a sp of 17 is **136 million dollars** they stand to lose at the very least. People have been murdered for way less.  Don't expect them to go down without a fight.  You wouldn't just walk away either.\n\nListen, the 16 is a magic number. I am not going to tell you what to do but after friday, that portion of the gamma ramp is done.  If we are not over 16 sooner rather than later, I feel differently about my 3/19 options than I did last week.\n\nThat isn't to say that I am highly fucking bullish about this play.  The amount of gambling tier call options being purchased at open will be astounding and I think in the end we will be victorious.\n\n# Lets Fucking Go\n\n# \n\nEdit 1 - This will be the post for the week unless something dramatic happens I'll update the ortex daily.\n\nEdit 2 - Keep in mind what you would do to keep from losing 200 million dollars that you did have and what you would do to win 200 million that you didn't are two different things. I am coming to believe that our Long friend(s) have a deep, if not cultural understanding at how to win at Tai Chi Push Hands...\n\nEdit 3 - Earnings Monday March 29 AM\n\nEdit 4 - 3/17 -See u/dekkars more in depth coverage in this [comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5jnmi/goev_the_bull_case_of_canoo_inc_aka_aka/gr8a6ce?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3). Increase of Short Interest at these price levels continues to confirm the fact that shorts are trapped and are spending short Interest to fight back.  I'm not the only fool with Ortex so I am sure bigger dogs see what's going on.  The slope of the increase is pretty dramatic which may suggest desperation.  Powell's comments today have the market throwing a tantrum.  He's not going to raise interest rates.  I'm going to give my thesis a break today and say that if we do not fight hard until those are done then its not a break from our tactical long.  I will probably pare down my 3/19s the first chance I get however rumor is Market is absolutely stacked to the gills on them today.  Ill update this when I find out.  good luck everyone. Oh if you have 3/19 15s dont worry... they are still good, but they are going to get hella volitile in the next few days...  Ill let you know when/if I think they are not...

Even with that we're still close to the $16 line.[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GOEV](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GOEV)\n\nEdit 3: They rebought a bit of the short and it looks like they attempted to do what they did on Friday and plunge the price. Did not work so well. We're still up considerably from Friday and the further we get into the $16 range the more of the float gets locked up in hedging. Check out the flux report below.\n\nI'm wholly in 3/19 15c and I'm zero percent concerned at the moment.\n\nCan't wait to see what happens 3-4pm and in AH. This should roll upwards even with no news. ANY good news and this thing is going to go off like a cork.\n\nEdit 4: Ended up about where I thought. Above 16 in Premarket/AH is a good target. Take a look at pennyether's hedge report. Shares that need to be hedge ranges from my conservative estimate of 11mil to his probably more accurate estimate of \\~18mil.\n\nEither way, a lot of hedge.\n\nEdit for 3/16 as I think we're keeping this thread. Lets see if we open at $16 or higher. There was some solid volume (for premarket) at 8am with several thousand shares bought at ask or above.\n\n9am: HOO BOY they just borrowed 1.5m shares.\n\nThings are getting desperate. Watch for another plunge like they did friday. If you're feeling adventurous set a call buy for half or a third of their current value and see if we can't scoop them up.\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GOEV](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GOEV)\n\n10:15am Edit: 16.63 confirms a breakout and we've touched it several times. $17 and shorts start to burn $$.\n\nShorts WILL NOT just let this go. Get ready for another short attack at some point. This is the longest the morning run has gone though so HOO BOY.\n\n3/16 2:00pm Edit:\n\nJust bought more calls. They're dropping the stock price on very little volume to buy cheaper calls to help cover their shorts. They don't want this above $16, but it is going there so they're trying to lessen the impact.\n\nDon't let them. Buy the dips!(Interesting note, volume on the 3/19 15c and 17.5c are 7k and \\~15k respectively) This is the SAME thing that happened Friday, they jammed the price down to 14.40 in under ten minutes. Honestly this seems like they're running out of steam to me...\n\n3/16 EOD Edit: The Good, The Bad (not really any ugly TBH)\n\nThe good:\n\nToday we had the longest momentum spike which lasted quite a while. We were flirting with our breakout point (16.68) and while we didn't have many major moves above it shorts really risked losing control of the situation there.\n\nAs we get closer and closer to 3/19 all the ITM calls (mostly the 15 strike price) are going to increase in delta. This means that more shares will have to be hedged which will naturally move the price up.  Shorts really, really tried to get us below $15 and couldn't make that jump. Which is a total win because 31k contracts are still ITM.\n\nWe saw a TON of volume around the 3/19 17.5c (15k, which is HALF the OI of 31k, 17.5c has as much OI as 15c  now) which is absurd. In my mind this lends some credit to the theory that shorts are buying and closing the 3/19 15c to close their short positions. We've had more 17c opened because I think shorts realize that it is going to get there and they need to keep hedging.\n\nI'm still bullish, and bought a bunch of calls on the dip. My plan is to sell some after the peak to pick more up when we inevitably spike down in the afternoon.\n\nThe Bad(ish?)\n\nWhile we did end up down from yesterday (barely) the shorts slammed the price in the same way they did Friday and honestly it hurt a bit. In terms of relative movement our peak was 16.68 and our low was 15.11. Compare that to Friday with a peak of 16.20 and a low of 14.20 and honestly they couldn't even get the 15c out of the money this time.\n\nAt the low, the ask depth between \\~15.15 and 16.00 was under three thousand shares. Volume is low across the market right now as everyone is waiting for JPOW to speak tomorrow. If there had been ANY news we would've been back through 16 in a flash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere has definitely been a pattern. Crash at open, then spike hard with momentum. Drop a bit and level. Then smaller spike. Then we drop hard between 12:30-1:30 and then edge up a bit into close.

We all saw it happen, that is how they did it.\n\nOption Open Interest:\n\nHere is 3/19 OI for this morning: [https://imgur.com/a/jzTRXy7](https://imgur.com/a/jzTRXy7)\n\nI haven't found an easy way to get historical data (nor can I make those beautiful flux charts u/pennyether can) but the gist of this is that:\n\n15c - Since Friday they've closed \\~5000 OI on this sucker. This was the most traded option on Friday/Monday, and on Friday alone half the total OI was traded.\n\n17.5c - Since Friday this has GAINED \\~5000 OI and yesterday this was by far the most traded option (volume was, again, half the total OI)\n\n20c - Also gone up, not exactly sure how much but a few thousand.\n\nAlso - If it isn't readily apparent the OI on this is absolutely absurd. Here is NIO's OI for example: [https://imgur.com/a/HFlhpb3](https://imgur.com/a/HFlhpb3)\n\nWe see that in proportion NIO has FAR more puts and the call OI is more distributed without the ramp that we are seeing in GOEV. NIO also has **4.5X THE FLOAT OF GOEV. This means to be completely equivalent the highest OI strike (45c) would need \\~45k more OI to equal what GOEV has going on at its 15c.** Look at any other equivalent stock and you'll see that our OI is honestly bananas.\n\nWhat I THINK we are seeing here is the Tai Chi hands that u/BrotherLuminous has been talking about. They used the 15c to push the price up from $11 to $15, and are now using the 17.5c to push the price up further. They've achieved the $15 pt and at several points during the rise the $15c has had a delta of 1.0. This means it is completely hedged and isn't contributing to the rise of the stock price.\n\nBy moving into the 17.5c they can make sure that during these momentum pushes they have to keep on hedging and keep pushing the price higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrice Movement / Volume:\n\nAfter 11am or so yesterday the entire market started holding it's breath waiting for jpow to do... Something? Our volume was low yesterday afternoon and shorts took advantage of that to shove 700k shares down our throats and drive the price down.\n\nIf you haven't noticed almost everything is red. So while it sucks that our benevolent rulers haven't popped the price up in AH/Premarket there has been relatively little volume compared to what it usually is.\n\nI'm watching for us to maintain the $15 price (premarket doesn't count, seriously if someone came in right now wanting to buy 3k shares they could pop the price to 16.50 that is how shallow the ask depth is.) We might stoop to 14.50 briefly in the morning but if our morning spike doesn't get us tickling that $16 wall again I'll start getting more concerned.\n\nI think our usual momentum pop is going to be more subdued than it typically is with everyone waiting for JPOW at 11. I am hoping our second spike that tends to happen around that time will actually be stronger given additional market momentum.\n\nMy plan is to sell some of my 3/19 15cs during a spike and save that capital for another downturn. I'm definitely not selling for a loss. This WILL go back up. Today just might be a rough day.\n\nPositions:\n\n\\~200 3/19 15c\n\n\\~20 4/16 20\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNews:\n\nThey've added two more board members - one of whom is a finance/growth expert. They get a bonus if the stock price hits $30 so you know they're gunning for it. Earnings was announced for 3/29 and hopefully Canoo will actually have some earnings/fun things to announce. (Like Wave 1 info, who the hell is building these things because they're supposed to start selling them NEXT YEAR).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10:20 ish update:\n\nWell, we had a halfway decent momentum break and are holding well above $15. We are actually trading up despite the fact that buying pressure is iffy at best.\n\nShorts did the same borrowing tactic they did yesterday, borrowing almost 1.7mil at open: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GOEV](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GOEV)\n\nI'm not actually sure what they're doing with those shares. I'm not seeing the volume to support that they're using all of it, and we're up regardless. I almost feel like someone is actually using them bullishly, selling into the open, then slowly producing momentum by buying them back. This would be a money losing preposition so if anyone has any better ideas I'd love to hear them.\n\nIf market goes up after JPOW this could seriously run. I think he's on at 11:55 and again a bit after noon. I'm interested to see how this coincides with our afternoon dump.\n\n11:05am Edit:\n\nNot sure how many of ya'll have the Level 2 data but the fight over the $15 price is getting epic. They are NOT letting this go and the longs aren't having to expend very many shares at all to keep it up. An unbelievable amount of SI is being expended for no gains.\n\nShorts might break themselves over this. If we go up with the market after JPOW we are going to RUN.\n\nQuick 11:10am edit: That giant green dildo of a volume bar? That was actually a sell order of 220k shares that was immediately pushed back ending the tick up green. Dayum.\n\n1:30ish PM:\n\nNot sure if it'll stick but buying pressure is the highest it's been since before 10am. Longs are holding strong at $15, and everyone is watching jpow.\n\nAsk depth is ridiculously shallow. 4k shares separates 15.10 from 16, and another 1000 shares from 16 - 16.50. ANY buying pressure will move this quickly. Positive treasury info will be great.\n\n17.5c have been maybe probably mostly de-hedged. This means that MM's have sold a lot of the shares they bought to remain neutral. An IV increase or share price spike would generate a significant response now.\n\n2:30pm ------\n\nLongs are pushing the price up and aren't taking 'DOWN BOY' for an answer. I'm currently watching several thousand shares being sold to the bid at 15.80 with absolutely no movement.\n\nSeems that someone wants their calls to be ITM and is willing to get real spendy to make it happen.\n\nIf we push past into $16 get ready for some real valhalla type energy\n\nEOD Update: -----------\n\nWell. I was hoping for us to push through $16 and get some oomph in but we got pushed back. We still ended up even though yesterday was rough for everyone. \n\nTomorrow is going to depend on how much we gap up by premarket. Think of this like a swing. Every day we push a little bit higher and see if the momentum is enough to carry us over and into the ramp. \n\nTomorrow has the bonus of being closer to expiry which will increase delta. \n\nHonestly - if we open at $16 or higher and get up into the $17's I'm seeing straight money. This may not happen.

Because I went so far out with the expiration, I don't have to face that expiration music for nearly two years (but eventually it could result in all of my tendies going \"poof!\"), so I'm not under the same pressure as someone whose calls expire on Friday.

You have the right, but not the obligation to do so. Since the stock is currently trading around $4.33, purchasing it at $5.00 today would be truly retarded, but if it happened to shoot up to $7.00 and you had the option which allows you to buy at $5.00, you'd stand to make a profit. You may be thinking, \"wait, do i have to buy 100 shares? thats like, all my bar mitzvah money!\" not to worry dear retard, you can sell the option to another buyer at any time, you don't need to exercise it to make money. Now, purchasing an option that expires in the same week like this one is a sped move, because normally stocks take a while to jump 50%, but with all this crazy shit going on it's completely reasonable to expect it. additionally, intraweek options are a LOT cheaper than more long term options, like a NOK 5c 4/16, which is currently trading at $0.18. the price difference is due to the time factor of options, they lose value the closer they get to the expiration date. ape vocab lesson if the end is all ur gonna read call= betting on it going up, put= betting on it going down", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "I'M RECLAIMING MY TIME!!!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Instead of those companies registering on U.S. exchanges, a bank holds a share, issues a receipt, and that receipt trades on our exchanges.

Well, share buybacks reduce the \"float\", the number of shares trading on the open markets. Reduced float = less supply for the same or (hopefully) increasing demand. That also makes life harder for Vlad's hedgie butt buddies that love to short the shit out of companies like this.   \n\n\nSince we're trading in 1:1 ADR instruments, long positions should benefit over time equal to whatever the stock does on exchanges where it directly lists.   \n\n\nAgain, not a cat.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I pick up 1/20/2023 calls last week.

I‚Äôm usually a low risk stock trader, but I saw an opportunity to ‚Äúget rich quick.‚Äù When I saw my portfolio go red for the first time ever, I was panicking, like wtf is going on. I knew RH and other brokerages restricted us from buying which led to the dip, so I HELD. So when I saw Mark Cuban on here and he told us to ‚ÄúHOLD!‚Äù I felt reassured. Since I created a new account and joined wsb, I thought to browse through all the post and memes. Here I saw stories of how people were effected in 2008, and their parents lost their homes due to these 1%. I saw stories of how people have been poor or barely making ends meet have this once in a lifetime opportunity to turn their life around. I‚Äôve seen stories about expensive medical bills, rent, buying a first home, and other necessities, how this opportunity can change their lives. I seen stories about just wanting to get their tendies so apes can buy a lambo. All these stories really touched me and changed my whole perspective about life, stocks and this short squeeze. I originally bought these stocks for the money, but now I know it‚Äôs much much more. It‚Äôs NOT about ME, it‚Äôs about ü¶ç. APES STRONG TOGETHER! And anyone else who doesn‚Äôt agree with this movement and only cares about their money, you‚Äôre just a selfish paper hand to me. So the past month and a half, I took the time to learn, learn about stocks, options, shorts, GME, etc... because I believe in this stock and I was to help others. I know firsthand how it feels to be a newbie and buying due to fomo and seeing the stock dip. So I‚Äôm trying to help and educate the fellow apes as much as I can, because every ape is important no matter how many shares they hold, because there‚Äôs more than one way to help the cause than buying.\n\nSo some of y‚Äôall can continue to criticize me, I really don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm going to continue to help and educate others.\n\nFinally if that story isn‚Äôt convincing, IF GME CLOSES AT LEAST $350 on FRIDAY, I will eat a Green Crayon. \n\nHopefully that convinces the naysayers that I‚Äôm a üíéüôåü¶ç!", "id": "m5t7pq", "created_utc": 1615837851.0, "score": 19586, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 1674, "comments": [{"body": "I‚Äôm down so much but I‚Äôm not sweating.

But the contract may only be exercised until March 19 (this Friday).\n\nBUT, just because the market value goes over 230 doesn't mean he is going to profit. Why? Because he had to pay a premium to purchase that call option. The premium is what you pay to buy the contract, and it is nonrefundable--so worst case scenario, the market value never hits the strike price (230), and the contract expires at market close on Friday, 3/19.\n\nNow, how does the premium work? It's likely that u/VicTheRealest paid a premium of $45 based on his estimate of GME hitting 275. So that means $45 per share, which is 45x100 (each option contract is for 100 shares). So his all-in cost for the contract is $4,500, and that is his maximum potential loss.\n\nSo at a premium of $45, and a strike of $230, that means that the market value has to hit $275 (230 + 45), and go over 275, before he is making money. At this point, he is ITM, or \"in the money.\" Say the stock shoots up to $300/share, and u/VicTheRealest exercises his contract at that moment then sells those shares immediately (this is a hypothetical). So that means that he is getting 300(x100 shares) MINUS the option price of 230(x100 shares) MINUS his premium of $4,500. Total profit: $2,500.\n\nThe other choice he has instead of exercising the contract, is selling the contract. By selling the contract, he doesn't have to buy those 100 shares at a price of $23,000 (maybe he doesn't have the funds), so he sells the contract to someone who can afford it.

The stock fell wider than 15% to as low as $223.00, bounced back, and then fell even lower.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShares of videogame retailer GameStop (ticker: GME) this month have surged back near their late January levels this month. At the close, GameStop stock was down 17% to $220.13.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe company said last week that Chewy (CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen and former Chewy executive Alan Attal were joined by Kurt Wolf, managing member and chief investment officer of activist investor Hestia Capital Management, on a new board committee aimed at transforming GameStop into a technology business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCohen kicked off GameStop's run by building a roughly 13% stake in 2020 and urged the company to pivot more toward e-commerce offerings. He joined the company's board with two associates in January, sending GameStop shares parabolic in the weeks that followed. Analysts pointed to speculative options activity and the closing of some aggressive bearish bets from hedge funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast month, GameStop announced the planned departure of Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell. A person familiar with the matter told Barron's at the time that the company thought it was the right time and was looking for a new executive with a technology background.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGameStop's latest run began following a Feb. 18 Congressional hearing on trading of its stock and Robinhood. The hearing included an appearance by Keith Gill, the YouTube personality known as RoaringKitty, who has developed a following for his successful long position in GameStop stock dating back to 2019; Gill revealed in a Feb. 19 post that he doubled his GameStop holdings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile some analysts are upbeat about the company's turnaround prospects, the highest price target listed by FactSet is $33. That analyst, Telsey Advisory Group's Joseph Feldman, pointed to valuation concerns, despite his \"high fundamental expectations and projected multiyear benefits from the transformation.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe company said it will report fiscal-fourth-quarter results next week. Like other so-called meme stocks favored by retail traders, such results present a risk to the company's sky-high run-up. \n\n\\#**That said, trying to call a near-term top for GameStop has been a fool's errand, especially for short-sellers facing unlimited downside.**", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Forget about the 19.

{"title": "Pricing Mechanics or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love GME's Dips", "selftext": "Listen up fellow smooth-brained apes. I get it, ending the day in the red sucks. It can also take an emotional toll if you allow. But there is something about GME pricing that I've seen a few people mention but not go into depth explaining. And it's pretty freaking important to understand:\n\nFirst: **The value of currency, goods, or services is only worth the value YOU place upon it.** If that's not ape enough for you: banana worth whatever ape want.\n\nRepeat the above a few times and let it sink in. This is not an oversimplification, it's a fundamental of economics.\n\nEveryone is conditioned from the time they are a baby ape to trust what they are told something costs. Ever since you got your first allowance (if you were lucky) so you could \"learn the value of money\" you've been conditioned to think a good or service is worth what other people tell you.\n\nThink about it: You go to the store to buy a pack of gum \"That'll be $1\", and you say \"Okay, if you say so\". Or as an ape, you go to the store to buy a banana \"That'll be $1\", and you grunt \"Banana good\". Rinse and repeat for the majority of things apes buy without question.\n\nOver time, apes will start assigning intrinsic value to currency based on the pricing they see over and over for goods and services. This is why uncool boomers complain all the time about how a soda cost 5 cents back in their day. People become conditioned to expect X costs $Y.\n\n### That's deep, but what does this have to do with stocks?\n\nAs some wrinkly brained apes get smarter, they may not take everything at face value and instead shop around for sellers with a better deal on that Banana. Basically, finding someone who assigned the same value to the good or service as them. When and if that occurs, they are both happy and willing to conduct the trade. It goes both ways, if you have a banana to sell you want to find the ape willing to pay the most. In the most simple sense, this is \"tHE MaRkET\".\n\nBuyers and sellers are continuously trying to find each other in the market. But driving around in apemobiles across the country to find the perfect match is a pain in the ass. This is where marketplaces come into the picture.\n\nA marketplace is a venue (physical or virtual) that serves to connect buyers with sellers. It's a great racket to be in, as those who operate the marketplace typically take a cut of every trade. Sound familiar? eBay? Amazon? NYSE? Because for most apes, it's worth not driving around to find the best price on 1 banana.\n\n### I already know what is a marketplace!\n\nMaybe so, but let me connect the dots.\n\nThe purpose of the marketplace is to match apes __willing__ to trade at the __same price__. In stock market terms this is \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices. So if one ape is willing to buy a banana for $1, and another ape is willing to sell a banana for $1, and that's the best price for both, a marketplace like NYSE matches them up automatically to conduct the trade.\n\nLet's take a theoretical case of a stock that has only 1 share, 1 buyer, and 1 seller. If the buyer enters a limit order of $100, and the seller enters a limit order of $200 - no trade will occur. Those orders will just sit there and do nothing. In stock market terms this is trade volume, and in this case it's a big fat zero every minute of trading hours.\n\nWhat if both apes had set their limit buy/sell orders for $150? The marketplace (NYSE) sees \"Hey, these two apes agree on a price, let me just conduct that trade for you.\" This happens in a split second given computers are continuously looking at the backlog of buyers and sellers waiting to match. This backlog is also known as Market Depth, or Level 2 trading information.\n\n(Bonus brain wrinkle: If either ape had set a market order instead of a limit order, the NYSE would automatically conduct trade at whatever price the other ape set. This is why market orders are probably not what most apes want to do. You never know who else might show up with a price you don't agree with.)\n\n### Come on already, what is your point?\n\nNow that everyone reading this should have the same understanding of the marketplace (NYSE) at this point, let's discuss how volume has an impact.\n\nIn the example above I use 1 buyer and 1 seller. Once their trade executed, it was a volume of one. If both buyer and seller had their limits set to $150, the NYSE would reflect a stock price of $150. Simple enough, right?\n\nBut what if there were 10 *potential* sellers with a share, 9 of which are diamond-handed apes, but 1 of those was a hedgehog and wanted to drive down price? We already know the 9 apes value their shares at $1M and are not __willing__ to sell for the __same price__ that the buyer is bidding ($150). Let‚Äôs say the NYSE shows the last trade price as $420k. All it takes is for that one hedgehog to put in a sell order for $150 and BAM! NYSE then shows the last trade price as $150, not the $1M that the 9 other apes value the stock to be. This is because NYSE did what is supposed to do and match a buyer and a seller that agreed on the same price. \n\n\"Preposterous! Market manipulation!\" the apes scream, as they start throwing shit around their cages. Unfortunately as a result, 1 of those apes may become paper hands after their primitive visual cortex lights up seeing $150 on NYSE and triggers a prehistoric behavior that says \"banana worth what other ape tell me it worth\" and starts mashing the sell button.\n\nWell good job you stupid ape. You let 1 hedgehog tell you what you think your share is worth, and therefore made it a reality. Ignoring the 9 other apes that think it's worth $1M. You‚Äôve been conditioned your whole life to let a sticker price tell you what something is worth and haven‚Äôt evolved. Pathetic.\n\n### So the last trade price on NYSE isn't really what the stock is worth?\n\nNo. Whether it be 10 apes or 10 million apes, NYSE is not going to reflect what the other apes value the shares to be. The last trade price is exactly that, the __last trade__. This is why trade volume is so important, anything less than 1M volume can easily affect the last trade price. But that's not the value of the shares! Repeat with me: \"The last trade price is not the value of the shares!\"\n\n### TLDR;\n\n* The HFs know that apes are conditioned to think money has value.\n* Share prices don‚Äôt reflect what people think it‚Äôs worth, they only reflect the __last trade__.\n* The HFs also know they can easily manipulate the __last trade__ price on low volume.\n* The HFs are screwed as long as apes don't let NYSE ticker tell them what they should value the shares to be.\n* üöÄüöÄüöÄüíéüíéüíé\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor, and I am not a cat.
