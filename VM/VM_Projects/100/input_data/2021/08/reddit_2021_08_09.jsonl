{"title": "Do Hedge Funds beat the market? - I analyzed the performance of 5000+ Hedge Funds over the past 24 years and benchmarked it against SP500. Here are the results!", "selftext": "**Preamble**\n\nHedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry’s Scion Capital returning 489%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry) shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Losses_by_short_sellers) of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -> What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \\[1\\].\n\nEven with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271771/assets-of-the-hedge-funds-worldwide/#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20of%20hedge%20funds%20worldwide%201997%2D2020&text=In%202020%2C%20the%20value%20reached,managers%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \\[2\\], it begs the question\n\n**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**\n\n**Data**\n\nThe individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \\[3\\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \\[4\\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.\n\nThis dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/), so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Result**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zy80c4kttbg71.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=22edbacdeeeab17670d3eaba794fffc867f1c41f)\n\nS&P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \\[5\\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.\n\nThis awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/5z8phclwtbg71.gif)\n\nIf you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp). FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.\n\nThe catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!\n\n**Warren Buffet’s take of Hedge Funds**\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter\n\n>A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.\n\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter\n\nWhile I don’t completely agree with this view that it’s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/) \\[6\\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&P 500‘s \\~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!\n\n**An alternative view**\n\nIt would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/vpb5klt1ubg71.gif)\n\nGiven that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?\n\nThe answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/121003.asp).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/evh5eqm3ubg71.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae3ca2caa10241fdec61f39801c45b7c14fce6cf)\n\nThe above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.\n\nIn the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.\n\nThis chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \\[7\\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry’s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \\[8\\].\n\nWhile you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100’s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don’t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI’s.\n\nEven if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.\n\nWhat this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI’s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.\n\nGoogle sheet containing all the data used in this analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nOQPyHdRNaRSv-c04iBRndvsgMDP78uSLKbxMwGWkeo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] To signify the impact of this fee, let’s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!\n\n\\[2\\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you’ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.\n\n\\[3\\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!\n\n\\[4\\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it’s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.\n\n\\[5\\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.\n\n\\[6\\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.\n\n\\[7\\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive. [This](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/fat-tails/) article discusses more on fat tail risks in the market and how hedging is done.\n\n\\[8\\] The volatility is calculated using [Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index](https://lab.credit-suisse.com/#/en/index/HEDG/HEDG/performance).\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor!", "id": "p10k98", "created_utc": 1628512468.0, "score": 1368, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "I have a sub r/market_sentiment where I post a similar analysis every week.

Even once it's qualified it still needs to go through the process of going through pilots before mass production. All these add up to huge lead times and if you're running a data center and have limited power, cooling and slots you need to retire old systems asap and get new systems in place quickly in order to scale appropriately.\n\nAMD has only really been shipping competitive data center hardware for the last few years. If Intel continues to slip then if course AMD will become more and more competitive as the cost of switching reduces but even then data centers are looking at 5 to 10 year road maps and they have to make sure that if they qualify an AMD platform now that AMD will still be the competitive platform to qualify on their next hardware refresh. That's one of the big unknowns at this point which will be significant friction to more widespread adoption.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with what you've said regarding datacentres and that market share change is very slow but what gives you confidence that Intel can reverse their fortune with the next node? What is the catalyst for change? They've essentially skipped 10nM and they are putting all their eggs in the 7nM basket. I still haven't seen why 7nM yields will be better than 10. Your point on the datacentres is exactly why this hasn't already happened, but unless Intel can suddenly become competitive, I see this as something that will eventually occur. The price to shift will soon be below the efficiencies and cost savings gained in moving to AMD.\n\nIntel is losing on CPUs for personal computing but for datacentres where efficiency is king they are getting obliterated.\n\nI'm genuinely curious.

However, one thing to keep in mind is that changing process modes isn't just making the dimensions of everything smaller. \n\nThe actual technology and steps used to create those smaller traces will vary quite a bit. Just because something didn't work well at 10nm doesn't mean it won't work well at 7nm. Or it could do to the hardware, perhaps newer hardware and techniques for 7nm resolve issues that 10nm had. It's not a perfect black and white comparison. \n\nThe new Intel CEO has also set forth plans to have Intel become a 3rd party fab as well to compete more directly with TSMC. This will mean more money for research and development of future fab technologies. One thing you'll hear a lot, I don't know how true this is, is that Intel wasn't properly funding 10nm. I can believe it because the last CEO was a bean counter and the one before him was also concerned with raising Intel's share value (setting a market cap target of $300B).\n\nFor R&D you expect to have to pour lots of money into it at the start and hopefully tailor off towards the end.

{"title": "Coinbase earnings will be massive", "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI have been looking at Coinbase recently. And I felt that the market, and analysts were all overly pessimistics concerning Coinbase Q2 earnings, which will be reported tomorrow.\n\nOver Q1, Coinbase reported a 3.05 EPS, with a user growth from 2M to 6.1M transacting users, and in total 56M users. In total, they generated 1.8B revenue. They reached these impressive numbers thanks to the start of the bull market.\n\nSee below the number of transactions on the Bit-coin, over the last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1zgd24qscbg71.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d096c1065555575153fa5dd7dd920b3822cb565\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ2 report will be between April and June, which means during still-extremely strong volatility market. In my opinion, it should results to even stronger EPS, when they will announce their results. The crazy part is that consensus amongst analyst is 2.23 EPS for Q2 2021. It's 27% lower. Crazy right?\n\nSo yes, June to August looks weaker. The volatility levels seems to have been affected, as the Bit-coin plumetted from $60K to $40 - 45K today.

On their last Q1 report, they said: \" “As we have previously discussed, it is important for investors to remember that our business is inherently unpredictable.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Analysts are totally wrong about projected Q2 EPS by over 30-40% for Coinbase.

Late into a bubble. All the bullshit reasons people give me for us not being in a bubble are very predictable things to see in the [tail stages of a bubble rise.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeatTheBear/comments/p1469b/passive_investing_bubble/)  I'm talking about us being due a crash, not a dip. An all out crash and in the future us seeing different US market conditions than we've had over the last 30 years.\n\nI know there's a lot of people who think it's pointless trying to work these things out. There are people who spent their entire life's learning about the markets. There are people who spend no time at all learning about the markets and think they are on par with everyone else. Both of these groups considers the other the fool, this is how a market is made. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Making a more efficient bet  \n\n# \n\n \n\n**Betting the market stops or slows**\n\nTiming a top is hard. Super hard. If in 2006 I told you the exact price the SPX would top and crash 50% off, that info would have made it very hard for you to actually \"Time\" the top. You could have sold into the top tick. Forecast the point the market stopped rising higher. But this would not be the same as making a timely forecast on the crash - you'd have been really early.\n\nForecasting the right price level also has it's difficulties but if you have ways to make estimates of zones in which you'd expect to see major inflection points you can start to take on a bearish bet on the market by first betting that the market will stop going up. Not crash. Just stop going up. You bet the market will not go above a certain price.\n\nAbsent of someone telling us in 2006 where the SPX would make a high, we'd have had to have some way to forecast important levels beforehand. Our best method (That I know of) to do this would have been to use a 161 extension off of the last pullback. Starting shorting as it hits the 161 and trades a bit above the 161. If 220 breaks this is the short exit signal.\n\nAnd in 2008 that would have worked pretty well on task of picking out the important area to trade in. But look how tough it would be here to make money on puts. It hits the level and goes sideways for a few months, spikes out and then the move happens over just one candle. So getting in when it's happening is tough and trying to be on-time without being too early is tougher.\n\nAnd that was just to catch the first drop. Then another rally comes before the real crash. So we have a period of several months in which the market is setting up for a 50% drop but being very unaccommodating to bearish bets on that if we're using put options as our main way of speculating on the move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubefyg440dg71.png?width=1424&format=png&auto=webp&s=a94503be1806065f50d36e1cc0adc14331792e36\n\n But if instead when the market tags into the 161 on the first touch we start to bet on the market slowing down and not going higher, then almost everything that will happen from here to the low will be either really good or very acceptable for this position. The range is profitable for us and apart from a couple candles most of the candles in this area are just little ranging ones before the break.\n\nWhen selling call spreads here we are usually get a pay off of close to 1:1. If we risk $100 we can win $100.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Adding crash bets**\n\nOnce you have some call credit spreads in you've greatly reduced your chances of being right but still losing, which is a very real possibility otherwise. You've made it more likely that if you lose it is just because the market is not crashing. Not because the market is not crashing yet but you've been at it for too long to keep going.\n\nNow we can start to add in some bets on a sharp break in the market by buying put options. The call credit spread we've sold was expensive. Calls are very expensive at market highs and we're selling them at the money. These are much, much cheaper than OTM puts - these are priced really low because the market has been up or ranging for a long time.\n\nWe'd need a way to target a price drop in the crash and the best available option to us in real time would have been to draw a 161 from the last low to high and assume this was the topping swing - and then use these fibs for downside targets. This would give us an expected exit in a good trade somewhere between the 127 and 161 fibs.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0be3ccfd0dg71.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=e543e70b57d4987a4e6359ecf8922a4486f5bf63\n\n If we're going aggressive on put options we can buy strikes just a bit above there and these will be incredibly cheap relative to the calls sold. If we buy a deep OTM put for a strike something like 1370 our upside on the trade if the market does crash increases massively, while our downside in the event it does not crash only increases a tiny little bit. If the market just does nothing for a few months we still breakeven. \n\n \n\nIf the market crashes within those months you do super well. If the market ranges you win, come in breakeven or have quite small losses and if the market rips against you you've got a predefined loss that's not going to get worse whether it's 5% higher or 50% higher.\n\nThe SPX general top in 2007 would take about a year. As with all big market moves people will report the crash as being impossible to foresee, but if you used some basic TA models you'd have watched, waited and wondered for a full year and by the time you were hearing \"The news\" - you'd know what you were going to do.\n\nSo here this type of position could have been taken 6 times. Would be \"Right eventually\" and either be slightly profitable or at least pay for itself in the run up to the crash actually happening. A strategy of just buying puts would have likely exhausted your will and resources sometime into the final few months, weeks or even days before the crash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4ak5vej0dg71.png?width=1442&format=png&auto=webp&s=1432b73c21d53537dd0051e6c8e8d1bf6be7656c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Our SPX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let's look at the SPX of our times. And let's assume we've taken a lesson from 2008 and when the March drop happened we drew a 161 fib and were ready to engage shorts into that area. Once we got into the 161 there's been a couple months sideways action and now we're into a spike out of this action.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4k20fssl0dg71.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=260b8ca492773f3a9c57d917a5787b855f7c3a98\n\n \n\nLooking much like these conditions.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jj6n89kn0dg71.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c6bf6310f465377a81f0bcc29135f13aae17ce\n\n \n\nUsing the same basic theories and strategies of an options position here we can bet on the market making a short-term crash, maybe even turning into a full crash. While also covering us against whipsaw bear/bull traps moves into the high and giving us a way to benefit from such a whipsaw back to the high by selling high value call spreads into it to get cheap OTM puts.\n\nWe can set ourselves up positions that will be profitable in these three types of moves. Almost entirely removing the risk of being generally right but specifically wrong on any aspect of timing, bounces and speed of the move. You're only going to lose if the market continues upwards - and the area of tolerance for moves against the position isn't that big, and the net risk is capped.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5g4gxwp0dg71.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3df86f5f22051a31068f51ef21bf71ce03fd13f\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**In conclusion**\n\nAs is oft said, timing tops is hard. But that's not a reason to stop thinking. If you make a study of previous market tops you'll find there was usually ways to approximate the zone in which the market would reverse. To know when was hard and in real time it'd not have looked like it was going to - but to make a structured plan before it and take a position into the high was possible.\n\nIf anyone does not think these things are applicable today, you can draw a fib from the high to low of the 2018 drop in the SPX and see how this strategy performed into the March 2020 drop. It still seems pretty relevant. To me it represents the best way to bet on a 50% crash without making a complete \"Hail Mary\" out of it.\n\nThese are the base concepts I'll be using to build up my bet on a big crash. What would have to be the biggest drop we've seen - making March look cuddly - and could start to become obvious sometime during Q4 of this year.\n\n \n\n&#x200B;\n\nExample of positions; \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**SPY**\n\nSpread.

The trend is towards larger drops. But they will refer to the previous bear traps and extrapolate the trend forward. \n\nThen comes the rush into the high. Usually 20- 25% above previous high, always parabolic and often 100% from the low of the last drop.  This is typically a 161 - 220 extension and the time to begin to short is heading into the 161 and stop out over 220 (Which implies trend continuation). \n\nI believe we entered into this stage in 2018. No drops of over 10% from 2010 to 2018. Then one every year since. 20%, 25% and then 30%.  And then 100% parabolic which comes in at a 161 above 20% above the last high.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "In fact, with regard to reading charts, TA is very valuable... the stock market itself is basically algorithmic even in natural patterns because of the mathematical pricing relationships and how they relate to human dynamics.  \n\n\nBut, those dynamics are in many ways subservient to the economic fundamentals... and in other ways decoupled.

Which would be the same percentage the DJI rose from the bear trap section (WW1 and forgotten depression) into the 1929 high. And that's the same percentage we're now up in the DJI from the 2000/2008 bear trap.\n\nThis is one of the main triggers for my interest in shorting in this zone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe drop was directly down to the 50% fib. Small bounce. Into the 61 fib. And then the break into the harsh slow bear. [https://imgur.com/a/kuYWdMC](https://imgur.com/a/kuYWdMC)\n\nThis was exactly how the first section of the fall in the DJI went in 1929. [https://imgur.com/a/pD1Rl3j](https://imgur.com/a/pD1Rl3j)\n\nI've used the exact same model to bet on a recent crash for something automod does not like, shorting 60K and taking profit on 30K - 50% drop.  Proofs of that in this post.

Ignorant of all the other things that go into explaining a move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBear trap section in DJI 1929 was two crashes of 50%.  Exactly like 2000 / 2008.
