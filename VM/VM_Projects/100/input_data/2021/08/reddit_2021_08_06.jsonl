The founders pioneered blockbuster anti-inflammatory drugs Remicade and Humira. Primary Active ingredient for Dupuytren’s Contracture is same drug already approved for another indication— Rheumatoid Arthritis the single largest market in pharmaceuticals. Read that last sentence again the founders discovered the biology behind anti TNF and are world famous academics including a winner of The Lasker Prize. Because the research was done on this P2B/ P3 on diseased human Dupuytren’s tissue the move straight to FDA drug submission upon proof of concept. Other indications being targeted in future in order are Frozen shoulder, POST Operative Cognitive Decline, NonAlcoholic Steatohepatitis (Fatty Liver Disease) and Ulcerative Colitis brought on by smoking cessation. Another pathway being targeted is pain and inflammation using SCA’s— synthetic cannabinol diet analogues. You see a founder is the Israeli scientist who first isolated THC and discovered the human endocannabinoid system. Known as godfather of cannabis. Some of you apes might be familiar with the stuff. But it’s synthetic and pure now think about pairing pain relief for musculoskeletal pain with the anti TNF meds proven effective on rheumatoid arthritis and consider that market. Get the picture. Now the CEO has a history of allowing data on patented medication to be released in academic setting. By the way current patents are worth more than stock price. So the catalyst of a keynote address at Oxford to the royal society of hand surgeons is the very stage for release if data. Oxford is also home to founder Sir Ralph Winner of Lasker prize. So do you think Anyone at FDA is denying a NDA for a medication already wildly successful for new indications for which there are no treatments. I don’t think so. It’s like telling Einstein E=MC squared is wrong. There is no one at FDA who can challenge the science.\n\nScientific team and founders are pioneers with proven track record in drug discovery from the University of Oxford, Hebrew University and Stanford University.\n\n[Stellar team](https://preview.redd.it/tkxat6k8orf71.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e64fa6971fb479a1c40586d64641f6785d544ba)\n\n[Blockbuster pipeline](https://preview.redd.it/q45rtttborf71.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=91c083c5f49998cc05c39ba6e2f7bd8a0ed683c6)\n\n[Market size](https://preview.redd.it/lmwoodckorf71.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1cc8309f230736336ac94854e7dfde912177cff)\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/wpv4clsmorf71.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=319ad878d0957acdbb61e30e4c8d40370e7c3448)\n\n# Fibrosis and Anti-TNF\n\nThe fibrosis and anti-TNF program is based at the Kennedy Institute, at the University of Oxford in the UK.The team is led by Professor Jagdeep Nanchahal, a surgeon-scientist who has been running the phase 2b/3 trials, and Professor Sir Marc Feldmann, a renowned immunologist and one of the pioneers of anti-TNF therapy. Feldmann was instrumental in developing infliximab (Remicade) as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, now one of the best-selling drugs in the world and the main driver behind Johnson & Johnson’s $4.9 billion acquisition of Centocor in 1998.**TARGETED DISEASES**• Early stage Dupuytren’s disease (DD)• Frozen Shoulder• Post Operative Delirium/Cognitive Deficit (POCD) FURTHER OUT• Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)\n\n# Synthetic CBD Analogs (SCAs)\n\n180 Life Sciences aims to develop SCAs that are safe, non-psychoactive and formulated to improve efficacy and bioavailability – a real alternative to unregulated cannabidiol (CBD).This program is led by Professor Raphael Mechoulam, who discovered tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component in cannabis, and the endocannabinoid system.Typical botanical derived CBD contains impurities such as THC (the psychoactive compound within cannabis) and other minor cannabinoids. By developing SCAs, 180 Life Sciences will create a pure compound (>99.5%) which offers accurate consistency across batches. Combined with novel formulations through use of patented ProNanoLipospheres (PNL), 180LS will deliver a superior CBD analogue that offers improved efficacy and bioavailability.These conditions create greater likelihood for obtaining regulatory approval.**TARGETED DISEASES**• Arthritis• Pain/Inflammation\n\n# α7nAChR\n\nNicotine binds α7nAChR and is a known immune suppressive. A subgroup of patients who cease smoking go on to acquire ulcerative colitis. 180 Life Sciences believes that α7nAChR agonist treatment provides a solution: without the addictive qualities of smoking, an α7-based drug will reduce ulcerative colitis in ex-smokers.Led by Professor Lawrence Steinman and Dr Jonathan Rothbard, who have been working on this project for more than a decade, 180 Life Sciences is developing a treatment for ulcerative colitis in ex-smokers. α7nAChR holds advantages over existing treatments:Fewer opportunistic infectionsReduced risk of kidney damageHigher anticipated success rate**TARGETED DISEASES**• Smoking cessation induced Ulcerative Colitis (UC) initially• Other inflammatory indications will be targeted after results in UC\n\n# Last insider purchase Aug 6:\n\n[Latest director's purchase](https://preview.redd.it/v7nmor86vsf71.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c223306cbcac48f87b6fd164e4406fd1f948e89)\n\n[180 Life Sciences Corp.

ATNF is an excellent investment. The founders pioneered blockbuster anti inflammatory drugs Remicade and Humira. Primary Active ingredient for Duputrens Contracture is same drug already approved for another indication— Rheumatoid Arthritis the single largest market in pharmaceuticals. Read that last sentence again the founders discovered the biology behind anti TNF and are world famous academics including a winner of The Lasker Prize. Because the research was done on this P2B/ P3 on diseased human dupuytrens tissue the move straight to FDA drug submission upon proof of concept. Other indications being targeted in future in order are Frozen shoulder, POST Operative Cognitive Decline, Non Alcoholic Stereopathic Hepatitis ( Fatty Liver Disease) and Ulcerative Colitis brought on by smoking cessation. Together all these markets are as big as the Rheumatoid Arthritis market and each of these disorders are caused by inflammation which the founders have pioneered effective biological no surgical treatments. There are no alternative treatments for these conditions.\n\nAnother pathway being targeted is pain and inflammation using SCA’s— synthetic cannabinol diet analogues. You see a founder is the Israeli scientist who first isolated THC and discovered the human endocanniboid system. Known as godfather of cannabis. Some of you apes might be familiar with the stuff. But it’s synthetic and pure now think about pairing pain relief for musculoskeletal pain with the anti TNF meds proven effective on rheumatoid arthritis and consider that market. Get the picture.\n\nNow the CEO has a history of allowing data on patented medication to be released in academic setting. By the way current patents are worth more than stock price. So the catalyst of a keynote address at Oxford to the royal society of hand surgeons is the very stage for release if data. Oxford is also home to founder Sir Ralph Winner of Lasker prize. So do you think Anyone at FDA is denying a NDA for a medication already wildly successful for new indications for which there are no treatments. I don’t think so.

Thank me in 5 weeks.\n\nSIX - Six Flags. Attendance set summer records with ticket sales for 2021 summer exceeding 2019 numbers substantially. This will show up in Q3 and Q4 numbers in a big way. Domestic travel has been strong and six flags has been tearing it up from an attendance standpoint.\n\nUGI - UGI Corporation is a large integrated natural gas supplier that most of you will know from the Amerigas brand. You know those bbqs that were firing up all summer now that we can see each other, yeah powered by UGI Corp. strong numbers coming in.\n\nVVI - Viad Corporation is the largest convention company in the country. Any large convention from video game conventions to medical conventions to Vegas anything, chances are it was put on by Viad. They own great tourist properties in Banff Canada as well which were very popular pre covid and stand to benefit strongly from an bilateral open border coming very soon. As conventions continue to open back up this stock will boom.\n\nGPMT - Granite Point Mortgage Trust is a wonderful technical play. It’s the gift that just keeps on giving. Real under the radar type stock that’s been steadily streaking higher day after day after day. They trade mortgages etc..\n\nSPR - Spirit Aerosystems, not spirit airlines, produces all of the composite wing tips and bodies for Boeing airplanes. They have government contracts as well locked in through 2035. Terrific company with extremely high barriers to entry. Do plenty of airline repairs as well.\n\nMCS - Marcus Corporation is the third largest cinema owner in the United States with a stellar presence in the Midwest. They own a series of high performing hotel properties as well and have a substantial fall coming up. Bond, Batman, Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Marvel etc… It’s the healthiest box office play by far. If you’re buying a theatre company for the business instead of the short squeeze, MCS is far and away the top choice over AMC and Edwards etc.\n\nJWN - Nordstrom’s has actually transitioned beautifully from just a big box retailer to an incredibly strong online fulfillment company. They blew people away by posting a profit in the depths of the quarantine and have started seeing numbers as high as 65% of all business being sold online and on mobile. Back to school shopping is already off to a record breaking start per CEO comments and JWN stands to profit further from a return to work shopping spree with many people having slightly different bodies than pre covid. Nordstrom’s also attracts substantial clientele from overseas travelers once borders fully open back up. Numbers also crushed Macy’s. Wasn’t close in mid summer reporting.\n\nNCLH - Norwegian Cruise Lines is the top cruise ship play with the strongest balance sheet as well as the most modern fleet of ships that require the least amount of updating for cruising in 2021. 2021 cruises have already sold out at higher prices than 2019. A lot of boomers are dying to get out there and travel and gamble their saving away on the open seas. Excited as recent bookings numbers that came in stronger than anticipated per CEO commentary.\n\nUAL - United Airlines is expected to see a boost from back to school travel and from reopened international travel. UAL was able to restructure advantageous fuel futures contracts during 2020 and stand to benefit from fuel synergies going forward.

If your thinking is that the purchase of assets being slowly tapered off will reduce demand and thus, assuming supply remains unchanged, will lower prices on treasuries (raise rates/yields), then companies taking on lots of debt to finance their operations (mainly growth companies) will get walloped as interest rates increase. However, there is apparently evidence that tapering in the past has actually ended up being positive for bond prices and negative for yields. \n\nIf you're concerned about the market reacting negatively to taper news, then that would likely manifest in a [taper tantrum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp). Essentially, the **notion** that the Fed **intends** to reduce their purchases drives negativity in investors and traders, who immediately realize that the inevitable will reduce demand and thus jack up yields. So they dump all their holdings to prepare for the rise in yields. It's not the tapering that shocks the market---it's the **intent** or even the **idea** of tapering. From Investopedia,\n\n> This prospective policy of reducing the rate of Fed asset purchases represented a massive negative shock to investor expectations, as the Fed had become one of the worlds biggest buyers. As with any reduction in demand, with reduced Fed purchases (bond) prices would fall. Bond investors responded immediately to the prospect of future decline in bond prices by selling bonds, depressing the price of bonds as a result. Of course, falling bond prices always mean higher yields, so yields on U.S. Treasuries shot up. It is important to note that no actual sell-off of Fed assets or tapering of the Fed’s quantitative easing policy had occurred at this point.\n\nSo should you start selling your winners?

Thank me in 5 weeks.\n\nSIX - Six Flags. Attendance set summer records with ticket sales for 2021 summer exceeding 2019 numbers substantially. This will show up in Q3 and Q4 numbers in a big way. Domestic travel has been strong and six flags has been tearing it up from an attendance standpoint.\n\nUGI - UGI Corporation is a large integrated natural gas supplier that most of you will know from the Amerigas brand. You know those bbqs that were firing up all summer now that we can see each other, yeah powered by UGI Corp. strong numbers coming in.\n\nVVI - Viad Corporation is the largest convention company in the country. Any large convention from video game conventions to medical conventions to Vegas anything, chances are it was put on by Viad. They own great tourist properties in Banff Canada as well which were very popular pre covid and stand to benefit strongly from an bilateral open border coming very soon. As conventions continue to open back up this stock will boom.\n\nGPMT - Granite Point Mortgage Trust is a wonderful technical play. It’s the gift that just keeps on giving. Real under the radar type stock that’s been steadily streaking higher day after day after day. They trade mortgages etc..\n\nSPR - Spirit Aerosystems, not spirit airlines, produces all of the composite wing tips and bodies for Boeing airplanes. They have government contracts as well locked in through 2035. Terrific company with extremely high barriers to entry. Do plenty of airline repairs as well.\n\nMCS - Marcus Corporation is the third largest cinema owner in the United States with a stellar presence in the Midwest. They own a series of high performing hotel properties as well and have a substantial fall coming up. Bond, Batman, Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Marvel etc… It’s the healthiest box office play by far. If you’re buying a theatre company for the business instead of the short squeeze, MCS is far and away the top choice over AMC and Edwards etc.\n\nJWN - Nordstrom’s has actually transitioned beautifully from just a big box retailer to an incredibly strong online fulfillment company. They blew people away by posting a profit in the depths of the quarantine and have started seeing numbers as high as 65% of all business being sold online and on mobile. Back to school shopping is already off to a record breaking start per CEO comments and JWN stands to profit further from a return to work shopping spree with many people having slightly different bodies than pre covid. Nordstrom’s also attracts substantial clientele from overseas travelers once borders fully open back up. Numbers also crushed Macy’s. Wasn’t close in mid summer reporting.\n\nNCLH - Norwegian Cruise Lines is the top cruise ship play with the strongest balance sheet as well as the most modern fleet of ships that require the least amount of updating for cruising in 2021. 2021 cruises have already sold out at higher prices than 2019. A lot of boomers are dying to get out there and travel and gamble their saving away on the open seas. Excited as recent bookings numbers that came in stronger than anticipated per CEO commentary.\n\nUAL - United Airlines is expected to see a boost from back to school travel and from reopened international travel. UAL was able to restructure advantageous fuel futures contracts during 2020 and stand to benefit from fuel synergies going forward. Pent up demand will take this sweet technical base higher in the short term.\n\nOk I’m out of breath. Good luck gentlemen and ladies, I wish you nothing but happiness in 2021-2022.

That Makes No Sense.\nBy Al Root\nAug. 5, 2021 6:35 pm ET\nA factory that makes lithium batteries for electric cars and other uses.\nSTR/AFP via Getty Images\nPresident Joe Biden wants 50% of cars manufactured to be electric by 2030. He wants America to be an electric-vehicles leader. He surrounded himself with automotive executives to discuss the initiative on Thursday. Curiously, Tesla, the undisputed U.S. EV leader, wasn’t represented.\n\nThey weren’t even invited—at least according to Elon Musk. Regardless of how investors feel about Tesla or how they feel about peers, it’s odd.\n\n\nTesla (ticker: TSLA), of course, sells more EVs than anyone in America. Between 2015 and 2020 there were 974,000 all-electric vehicles sold in the U.S. Roughly 730,000 of those, or 75%, are Teslas—they are the American EV market.\n\n(Tesla doesn’t report deliveries by geography, but they report sales by geographic region, allowing for a calculation of local volumes.)\n\nSo far in 2021, Tesla has sold about 386,000 vehicles. Roughly 165,000 were sold in the U.S. General Motors (GM) has sold only about 20,000 EVs over the same span.\n\n\nThe White House didn’t immediately comment on the decision, but Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said on CNBC, “We are moving toward a future where this is all across the market. I don’t want there to be a perception that this is just…a luxury thing or…or cars that you use to zip around cities.”\n\nThat statement is as curious as the noninvite.\n\n\nTesla does have luxury offerings. Its early strategy was, essentially, to start with a low-volume, expensive car and then expand into other segments of the market. It worked. Tesla is now the world’s most valuable car company. Gross-profit margins are better than BMW (BMW.Germany). Unit sales in the first half of 2021 are up 116% year over year. And the company has generated about $9 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months while building two new plants.\n\nIt has nonluxury offerings, too. Today, a new Model 3 starts under $40,000. That’s about $15,000 more than the base price of a Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, or Toyota Camry, but less than the base price of similar-size BMW or Audi sedans. The top-level trim in the Fusion-Camry-Accord class runs almost $40,000.\n\nAbout zipping around the city: Tesla also operates a global charging network of over 25,000 chargers with nationwide coverage in the U.S.\n\nTesla is a very American company. That can’t be the reason for the snub. All of its U.S. sales volume is made in the U.S. It has two of the top 10 cars in Cars.com ‘s American-Made Index. The Model 3 is first on the list and the Model Y is third. Both are assembled in Fremont, Calif. Later in 2021, Tesla should start producing its Cybertruck—which starts at $40,000—in the company’s new Austin, Texas, plant.\n\nThe Tesla snub has been good fodder for Musk on Twitter. And it doesn’t really matter in the long run, just so long as the federal government doesn’t play favorites—either way—as the traditional auto industry ramps up its EV effort and overall EV competition builds.\n\nThe noninvite didn’t seem to particularly Tesla stock, although with a 0.5% gain Thursday—the seventh consecutive rise—it still lagged the broader market. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Actually pretty well written", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, they got all of the facts right which is rare nowadays.

{"title": "VIAC God Tier Way Too Long DD - All Aboard the P+ Train 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "Most of the time on WSB, DD gets posted here AFTER a big move, retards pile on and YOLO near ATH's, the price eventually plummets and a new generation of ape bagholders are left behind with ruinous losses.\n\n**This is not one of those times.**\n\nAs some of you already know, VIAC flew 7% today after a fantastic earnings report that blew the doors off nearly every metric. I know what you're thinking: welp, missed the boat on another one. And yes everyone, I'm the guy who posted the [10k earnings FD Yolo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxalfx/preearnings_10k_viac_fd_yolo/) couple days ago (sold those today and rolled them into LEAPS). Today was a GOOD day - aside from forgetting to screenshot BEFORE I sold for once in my damn life, typically I do the opposite and then never actually sell and lose all of it.\n\nBut this party is literally just getting started.\n\nOn Monday, Discovery (DISCA) [drilled](https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Discovery-Q2-Earnings-Snapshot-16359685.php) to the center of the earth off of strong earnings but dismal growth numbers, **falling 6%** and taking Viacom (which trades similarly to Discovery) along with it on the ride down. Ever since the Archegos collapse (more on that later but all of you know the Bull Hwang story by now), algos have undeservedly tied these two tickers at the hip. Subtract that undeserved 6% from today's 7% gain, and it pretty much cancels out: VIAC is **basically only up 1% off** of a truly fantastic earnings report. In fact, this stock was literally higher as recently as a week ago - and that's when earnings were a huge question mark, but no longer. For once, fellow apes would be getting in on the **GROUND FLOOR**.\n\n**Q2 Earnings Highlights** (Don't feel compelled to read this part if you don't want to, TL;DR: they knocked it out of the park)\n\n* Revenue: 6.56B (est 6.52B)\n* Adj EPS: 0.97 (est 0.96)\n* \\+6.5M streaming subscribers (42M total between P+, Showtime etc)\n* \\+2.8M PlutoTV MAUs (52.3M total)\n* \\+45% watch time per user  (Roku's decreased)\n* \\+24% ad revenue yoy\n* \\+9% affiliate revenue yoy\n* \\+92% (!) streaming revenue yoy\n* Paramount+ [officially launched in Europe](https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/viacomcbs-sky-paramount-plus-europe-launch-1235035254/), expands in South America\n* In this market you really need to pitch a perfect game to not get sold off on earnings. This was a clean sweep across the board: Viacom, priced like a value stock, just blew out all the growth stocks in growth metrics (looking at you Roku). And the best is yet to come (more on this later)\n\nOk let's review what Viacom even does for those who don't know. If you do know, skip this next part.\n\n**1.** **The Business**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If you haven't watched something made by one of these brands there's just simply no way you live in America. ](https://preview.redd.it/k1j6my9sxmf71.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=69242a8e76eea2ce69f669d9d46ead5a9c0988cb)\n\nViacom basically owns every single TV channel you retards grew up watching. Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1, Comedy Central - from our childhood cartoons at Nickelodeon to the greatest comedy sketch show of all time (Chapelle's Show - no debate) to the shitty reality shows of the 2000's (Jersey Shore): Viacom owns ALL of it. It also owns Showtime which makes Billions, the unofficial TV show of WSB.\n\nIn a day and age where streaming content is at a premium, Viacom is sitting on an absolute TREASURE CHEST of content.\n\n**How They Make Money**\n\n* Advertising - Good old fashioned TV ads during programming (both traditional and streaming)\n* Affiliate - The cut Viacom gets from the boomer retards who still pay their provider for cable TV\n* Streaming Subscriptions - the 5 or 10 dollars a month from Paramount+ / Showtime\n* Theatrical Releases - Did you know a Quiet Place 2 (made by Paramount) is the third highest grossing movie of the year behind Fast 9 and Black Widow? And cost a fraction of those to make? But yes, people still buy tickets to see movies (just ask the AMC apes, they know what's up).\n* Licensing - Viacom doesn't keep all the content they make, they also license it out to others for LOTS of money. Much like a pimp that whores out prostitutes instead of keeping them all for his own sexual desires, VIAC is all about licensing money. HBO paid them half a BILLION for South Park. Amazon paid them 150 million for Coming 2 America, one of the shittiest sequels to a classic of all time. And as Netflix, Amazon, Apple all fight for content, fees are only going to go up. And all that money goes right back into fueling Viacom's sleeping giant: Paramount+\n\n**Paramount Plus**\n\nEven total retards know that traditional TV as we know is dying. Gone are the days where the whole family gathers around the tube to watch Modern Family at 9pm - these days everyone is on their own schedule, they mostly get their shows through streaming apps when they want it. More and more families are cutting the cable cord, opting instead to go with streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon - with varying degrees of success. Streaming is the future - nothing new here.\n\nParamount+ is the brand spanking new streaming app that Viacom is banking on to contend with the big boys. The market has basically valued this venture at fucking zero - and you know what that was somewhat understandable: it's a crowded industry, the app hadn't existed for even a full quarter yet, the street wanted to take a \"wait and see\" approach.\n\nWelp, Paramount just blew the fucking doors off all projections for their first full quarter and put to rest any doubts about the viability of the app. Between Paramount (and premium cable sister app Showtime), Viacom now has 42 million users, up from 36 when they last reported. And the biggest catalysts for growth are still yet to come!\n\nAnyways, back to live TV's alleged slow death. There is one MAJOR exception to this. Sports. While we can catch our Billions episode on Tuesday night because we missed it Sunday and have basically the same experience, there is nothing more useless than a rerun of a sporting event. We need that shit LIVE, and it's basically the only kind of TV that has to be.\n\n**Are you ready for some football?**\n\nDid you know that the NFL accounted for 71 of the top 100 most watched live broadcasts in 2020? That's almost 75 fucking percent! In fact the NFL was responsible for $4 billion+ ad revenue for host networks in 2020 - and guess who just extended their NFL deal? When fall rolls around, P+ signups are going to fucking FLY as the CBS team broadcasts every AFC matchup this year, conveniently located in some top TV markets - Kansas City, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and New England are all AFC / ViacomCBS territory, and all happy to look pretty decent this year unlike NFC teams New Orleans, Atlanta, and Chicago (but i'll save this convo for r/NFL).\n\nOh yeah, ViacomCBS also has the SEC college football rights too, the only conference in college football that even matters these days. American Football not your thing? They got the rights to real futbol too, including UEFA Champions league soccer and Serie A. More of a hoops guy? Guess who has the exclusive rights to March Madness. More of a boomer? Guess who has the PGA Tour.\n\nWith over 1000 live sporting events a year, Paramount Plus may actually be the most complete sports streaming app out there, surpassing even ESPN.\n\n**Boomers still watch TV**\n\nIf you're reading this, take a moment to wipe the jizz off your pants from Viacom's sporting dominance as we review their more traditional businesses and check out some of these stats.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wait, you mean to tell me ONE company has the top THREE dramas, top SIX comedies, #1 news show, and the #1 most watched show in the country on TOP of the NFL, SEC, PGA, NCAA, and soccer?! Even if you're not big on this stuff, you have to recognize how impressive that is. I for one don't watch a single one of these shows, but I know a lot of middle America \\/ boomer generation absolutely still live by this shit. They aren't going away any time soon, as much as we might want them to. ](https://preview.redd.it/c32ujr09umf71.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=9170cca3860c60b53f42980660de08668eabc63e)\n\nDon't believe this? Check out [Variety's report from May](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/most-popular-tv-shows-highest-rated-2020-2021-season-1234980743/) about the most-watched TV shows on TV. Sheer CBS DOMINANCE.\n\n[I'm assuming none of us watch any of these shows anymore unless it's to find new memes for WSB, but we all have a son \\/ daugher \\/ stepson as product of cuckery \\/ sibling who is right in the Spongebob \\/ Paw Patrol \\/ Peppa Pig age range. No one, not even Disney, controls THIS much essential IP for the children's market. For parents, Paramount+ isn't a luxury, it's an absolute NECESSITY to shut their kids up.  ](https://preview.redd.it/45mxntowumf71.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaca6e55ff23254f30066b0c035aac5eaf949465)\n\nThe order isn't specified, but out of the [most popular children's television shows in America](https://www.fatherly.com/play/most-popular-kids-shows/), Viacom through Nickelodeon produces the vast majority of them.\n\nAlright, enough about Paramount Plus. It's the key to VIAC's future, but we've covered enough of it. As P+ slowly begins to claim back it's IP it's licensed out to other streamers to bolster its own library and starts churning out some seriously great P+ exclusives (THE NEW [HALO](https://deadline.com/2021/02/halo-tv-series-latest-paramount-plus-move-1234698703/) TV SHOW for example) reasons to get the app will become more and more compelling over time - for sports fans, boomers, and parents especially. But what about for the poor people who don't want to pay even one penny for TV?\n\n**Pluto TV**\n\nLet me start this off by saying this: if you don't have Pluto TV, download that shit right now because it's free. Literally zero strings attached fucking free, don't even need to make an account with a fake email address, it's F R E E freeeeee. Whether or not you buy the stock, if you wasted all this time reading through all of this you will have at least gained the knowledge of the single greatest free cord cutting app ever invented.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v187qgwyvmf71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=55c2638210fbbfa7b1f2268e90dced25e9570566\n\nBut how does Viacom make any money by giving you hundreds of channels and not charging you? You guessed it: ads. This nifty free app is expected to generate [1 BILLION](https://deadline.com/2021/08/pluto-tv-reaches-1-billion-annual-revenue-milestone-streaming-advertising-1234809600/) in advertising revenue for Pluto in 2021, well ahead of schedule. I have this on 8 hours a day in the background because BloombergTV is included, and it's absolutely fucking amazing. CBSHQ is a great ESPN replacement too for the sports fans that can no longer tolerate the irritating sounds of Stephen A Smith. Check it out, it's sweet. And free, you cheap fucks.\n\n***TL;DR: Viacom is one of the most complete streaming TV stocks you can own right now, with something for everyone and strong competitive advantages in children's programming, live sports, and boomer television shows. It's the past, the present, and the future. They are taking the enormous cash flows that still continue to be generated from their linear TV business and investing the profits into the future of television: streaming - they're eating their cake and keeping it too.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **The Competitors (If you know the streaming space intimately, skip this part too)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Contrary to popular belief, the SVOD pie is still growing even as we come out of the pandemic, and Viacom's share \\(through Showtime and Paramount+, one of the only apps above to actually GAIN market share TWO straight quarters\\) is expanding as well. Notice the 4&#37; DECLINE from Netflix between Q4 and Q2 2021 while Hulu and Disney have actually SHRANK as well. Time for a new sheriff in town?](https://preview.redd.it/uozq7ze0wmf71.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=6650e06867cfa58da7fee6c24c52cf5cb6492022)\n\n**Netflix**\n\nThose of you who thought Netflix runs this shit like Don Corleone are severely mistaken. While an early entrant and pioneer in the streaming space, growth has been hard to come by for Netflix thanks to a declining library, a refusal to compete in live sports or news programs, and more recently, a truly [bizarre foray into mobile gaming](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings). As you can see, Netflix, while still #1, is in decline - as the most expensive app, they seem to be coasting more on the Netflix brand name. And on the off chance they make a show someone actually likes, it's probably [canceled](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-canceled-netflix-shows-one-day-at-a-time-daredevil-2019-6).\n\n**HBO + Discovery**\n\nYou're probably most familiar with HBO as the channel that fucked up Game of Thrones beyond repair, rendering a once global cultural phenomenon to being completely wiped out from the entire pop-culture consciousness. Discovery makes all the dogshit reality TV such as 90 Day Fiancee that is tearing down the fabric of American society. Other assets include TNT (home of Charles Barkley and I really don't know what else) and CNN (the world's leading purveyor of fake news).\n\nWelp, they're all joining together. As of [May 17th](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/att-to-combine-warnermedia-and-discovery-assets-to-create-a-new-standalone-company.html), Discovery is merging with WarnerMedia - a deal structured so poorly that it sent Discovery shares from the $41 it was at premarket that day down to a paltry $29.20 today. Not all mergers are created equal, and this [reverse morris trust merger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverse-morris-trust.asp) successfully transferred AT&T's HBO bags to unsuspecting Discovery shareholders, resulting in a debt-ridden entity that hopes to compete in the very long run.\n\nI'm not going to bash Discovery too much because I do think it has a chance to be relevant down the line, but this merger isn't closing for a WHILE and there's just not a whole lot of upside for the stock in the short term. The potential of being acquired is now gone.\n\n**Disney**\n\nDisney has deep pockets, and Disney+ combined with Hulu and ESPN is a strong portfolio. Their dual theatrical release + Disney+ streaming release combo business model is also used by Paramount, and may prove to be the standard moving forward. Disney+ has two of the world's most valuable IP of all time in Marvel and Star Wars, so you won't catch me talking shit about them here. They're a strong player here, and is the only one that could challenge Viacom's supremacy in children's content (although IMO Paramount targets the 5+ demographic while Disney is more in the 13+ space). Then again, Disney isn't a pure play streaming stock either (Disney World, Disney Land) so it's not a perfect comparison.\n\n**Amazon / Apple**\n\nBoth of these FAANG stalwarts have made half assed efforts to compete in the streaming space without really dedicating any sort of resources to it since they have so much other shit going on. Bezos at least pretended to care for a while, showing up to the Emmy awards and shit before getting bored and fucking off to space. Apple's AppleTV effort has been dismal to say the least, with a content library of around 50 titles and a userbase composed almost entirely of free trials that won't be renewed. More on this later.\n\n**NBC / Peacock**The only reason to have this shit app is for Office re-runs when you invite a girl over to Netflix and Chill. Ironically Netflix actually lost the Office to its original maker (just another L in a long series of NFLX L's) but Peacock and Chill does have a better ring to it anyways. Otherwise, this app is basically useless and is the least likely to survive the streaming wars independently without some sort of merger. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n**ROKU -** only a competitor to PlutoTV, not really a competitor to Paramount+. Have you seen their P/E multiple?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ok, I compiled the above myself and did my best to update through this quarter's ER's. It may not be ENTIRELY up to date or accurate, but I did the best I could since as far as I could tell there was nowhere else on the internet that had this info all in one place, I looked everywhere. Does not include Pluto TV, Tubi, Roku, or any of the free ad-based apps. ](https://preview.redd.it/hy2nnltqzmf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdd1116b95dad14ad5388422ae22b3cb28d531db)\n\n**VALUATION**\n\nOk, let's talk numbers, without which this is just paragraphs of drivel that no one is going to fucking read. If you apes made it this far by the way, I salute you. Here's where it gets fun. The below is sourced from a Google sheets template I built from scatch, sourcing from Google Finance and Finviz. I'll point out what I thought was noteworthy from each screen, but feel free to draw your own conclusions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Check out that 52 week high column for Viacom and Discovery vs. where they are now. If you know the Bill Hwang story, you know what happened. If you don't, scroll down for a recap. This stock can get back there, we've seen it happen. ](https://preview.redd.it/ujkzehxh2nf71.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=22f72af4802f60044764a58e33dc92d4906cb565)\n\n[Viacom's RSI yesterday was 34 before today's ER, while it's still basically trading below all three SMA's. While these numbers are terrible, you'll see they pretty much suck across the entire sector \\(check out the SMA stats on the streaming ETF\\). It's a downtime for the streaming sector coming out of the pandemic with money flowing towards reopening plays, while high growth tech has been mooning thanks to a second collapse of the 10 year yield. I expect this entire sector to recover H2 2021 via sector rotation back into communications when the 10 year yield goes back up \\(it's projected to double by year end\\). ](https://preview.redd.it/f6nictey1nf71.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=5770c797fbc24c8ffda3967c96ae80b07d7273b0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The important thing to note here is institutional onwership aka \\\\\"the smart money\\\\\". Viacom is a whopping 85+&#37; institutionally owned - asset managers, banks, hedge funds, pension funds, you name it. The short float number isn't high so I'm not going to lie to you about short squeeze potential. You'd have to be retarded to short here at 41 rather than back at 100 anyways.   ](https://preview.redd.it/pwc4c7ab4nf71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3f86afe54becb04fce814a784d500a8e2719047)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Yes you are reading this correctly - Viacom trades at a paltry 9 P\\/E and just 1 times revneue!!! Even compared to its peers in traditional TV, this is ludicrously low. Why should FOXA be higher despite not having a paid streaming app? Why does ROKU deserve to trade at a whopping 239 P\\/E and Netflix at 54 P\\/E? I'm not arguing that VIAC should be anywhere near those P\\/E's, but with everything it has going for it, 9 is ludicrous. You're not going to find better-hidden value than this ANYWHERE in the S&P 500. Run a screen and sort by P\\/E if you don't believe me.](https://preview.redd.it/e8jgc35v4nf71.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=1daf37f3492e539bb9db61202d35f5d26776bcbe)\n\n**3. ARCHEGOS aka Bull Hwang gets Margin Called (Skip if you know the history)**\n\nI don't want to spend too much time on this story because all of WSB knows it for the most part. Legendary fund manager Bill Hwang blew up his account in a matter of days in true WSB fashion by being levered 20 to 1 in names such as Viacom, Discovery, Baidu, Tencent Music, IQiYi, and other assorted hilarity. With the bath that Chinese stonks have taken lately and the precipitous fall from 100 to as low as 38 in Viacom, it's easy to dismiss good old billy boy as just another retard in over his head.\n\nBut this guy saw something in Viacom. Instead of telling the entire Archegos story, i'll lay out the sequence of events as relates specifically to VIAC's share price.\n\n[A lot of times, retards throw out random price targets that stocks will never hit in their entire existence. Here, we already know what VIAC is capable of. Sure it took a 20-1 levered Korean fund to get us there, but this glimpse to the past is actually a glimpse into our future. I'll hold off on naming an end of year price target myself though, I don't like doing that without building a full model which I just don't have the time for tonight. ](https://preview.redd.it/rul9xc7v6nf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=34643da441c29a25656d6a79683e40d63c08e2b1)\n\n[This chart would probably be more useful to reflect this week's price action, however since I made this whole thing from scratch it's going to take too long so fuck it. As you can see, streaming stocks have mostly all taken a breather since March. Getting in now is a classic buy low situation, something us apes really need to start trying for a change.  ](https://preview.redd.it/h48bqj886nf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=72cbacf88a2561531bf19d1685159119d8763346)\n\n**4. MERGER MANIA!!?**\n\nWSB might be composed of a bunch of retards that barely know how the market work, but everyone knows this: if you own stock or options in a company and it gets bought out, it is the FASTEST and most satisfying path to tendies. Strategic acquisitions are known to pay a [much higher premium](https://labusinessjournal.com/news/2021/jul/19/stamps-com-acquired-7-billion/) to what a company is trading for on the open market. There's no better way to exit a position than waking up to an alert that something you own has been acquired.\n\nAt least that's how Discovery shareholders felt the morning of May 17th before ***discovering*** they weren't getting bought out, they were getting CEO Zaslav's turd sandwich of a merger in which AT&T dumped HBO and all their associated debt on Discovery shareholders, who only get a paltry 29% of the new entity while AT&T holders get 71%. AT&T holders fared no better as the announcement accompanied the news that AT&T had to nuke their dividend to get this deal done, which was the only reason to own that POS to begin with. It was a rare deal in which everyone loses, except Zaslav himself.\n\nBut while DISCA owners were left holding their dick's, a world of possibilities were opened up for the remaining players in the streaming space to be acquired by the giants. Shortly after Amazon acquired the private MGM studios, which basically only has James Bond at this point. Much speculation ensued about whether the remaining players (VIAC, Lionsgate, AMCX, CURI) would be acquired by the giants of Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Disney etc.\n\nI'm not going to sit here and lie to everyone and say a merger is imminent, I have no fucking clue. What I do know is Shari Redstone, chairwoman and largest stakeholder, is finally [open](https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcast-ceo-brian-roberts-and-viacomcbs-chairman-shari-redstone-met-to-discuss-streaming-partnership-11626743478) to shopping Viacom, something her father would have never considered. With a complete portfolio of sports, children's, and boomer linear, no acquisition would fix Amazon or Apple's lackluster TV efforts than Viacom. However, I don't think Viacom needs to be acquired, I think they have a legitimate shot of being a player in this space on their own.\n\n**TL;DR We don't need to be bought out for tendies, but it sure wouldn't hurt. No acquisition would be more attractive than Viacom to immediately turn a tech giant into a streaming powerhouse. It's merely the difference between mooning sooner vs. mooning later. Either way, Shari's listening.**\n\n**5. Analyst Price Targets**\n\nUpgrades are coming. With earnings this good, we're already starting to see upgrades TODAY from analysts who weren't too lazy to pass in their work by EOD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bank of America also has a 53 PT from last quarter. I would expect further upgrades from the rest of the street tomorrow. ](https://preview.redd.it/mixl44gu8nf71.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=be78d48b7c413066e1372b36ce1a7646df207a58)\n\nEven Without accounting for the new upgrades from today or tomorrow, the average VIAC price target is still $50.34, representing a 21% upside.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nI wanted to get into some technincal analysis of this thing (cup and fucking handle anyone???) as well as risk factors but I'm out of time, I'll save those for a Part 2. Will be happy to answer any questions in the comments.\n\n**TL;DR: Viacom has been consolidating for over 4 months and is finally about to fucking blow the roof off after showing phenomenal growth in a space primed for industry consolidation. This is the best positioned streamer as far as IP goes, and an acquisition would moon this basically immediately (while not essential to the investment thesis, it would be nice of course).**\n\n**Forget the moon, forget Uranus, we are going to PLUTO.**  [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)\n\n**7. Position**\n\n[ignore the XBI, this was the easiest way to fit it all on one screen since RH still sucks ](https://preview.redd.it/0sqeaecqanf71.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf0b8bcfe3b13a6a8b80fe3937769b6e0870e1bf)\n\nEDIT: This blew up more than I thought it would. I've never posted DD here before but the overwhelmingly positive reaction I've received from this has inspired me to contribute more to the community. Now, initially I was going to make a separate Part 2 post but I don't want to be seen as spamming so I'm just going to put it as a comment and add it as an edit. Besides, it's probably important to have the risk factors of the trade as part of the original post.   \n\n\n**8. RISK FACTORS**\n\nAlright everyone. Some of you read the whole thing and YOLOed. Some of you didn't read any of it and still YOLOed. Most of you probably didn't do shit. And that's ok, because I want everyone to read this next part first before deciding. \n\n* **The entire market could crash** like the gay bears have been promising for months. This would of course take out everything with it, and VIAC is no different. The 10% Correction gets thrown out regularly, I'm not an economist so I really don't know if or when this is going to happen - although most of us will have way bigger problems than just VIAC if that does occur. \n* **The decline of linear TV outpaces the growth of streaming.** This is the worst case scenario for Viacom: advertisers pull their dollars out of linear which has been a cash cow and reallocate them elsewhere (i.e. NOT streaming), leaving Viacom underfunded for P+ growth. I must acknolwedge the potential risk of this even though I assign a very low probability to this in the short term since Viacom just completed the [best ad buying upfront they've ever had](https://deadline.com/2021/06/viacomcbs-upfront-paramount-pluto-tv-cbs-nfl-1234783415/). That article is a good read because it's not just Viacom tooting its own horn, it's the entire industry! If anything it paints a fairly rosy picture of where the money is flowing. \n*  **The P+ app fails to gain traction**. Paramount plus has seen two straight quarters of new user growth while Disney and Netflix have actually declined. However, it's certainly easier to gain new users when you're app is new. We don't know if something will keep growing at the rate it has. Reddit and Twitter do have their fair share of people bitching about the P+ app as far as content availability (some seasons of some shows are still [licensed out](https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2021/05/paramount-plus-missing-real-world-challenge-seasons/) to competitors and the short term) and bugs (the Playstation app is apparently abysmal while the other apps work much better - I've never had an issue on my Samsung or Fire apps). The bottom line is that while P+ has the same growing pains of any new app, the devs do need to figure their shit out, do their fucking job, and keep complaints at a minimum. \n* **Competition** \\- The competitors in this space have DEEP pockets. All 5 FAANG names have some sort of video platform, Netflix is of course the leader here, and Apple and Amazon have at least made half assed attempts to be players in this space. A strategic shift from either Apple or Amazon to suddenly start pumping cash into these efforts could prove to be a threat for the survival of Viacom as a viable independent player. The silver lining here however is that should they choose to do that (Apple especially has done basically jack shit) - the easiest way to suddenly increase their position would actually be to buy Viacom's vast IP.  \n* **Merger.** But wait, wouldn't a merger be a good thing like you said earlier before? Not always, and unfortunately Discovery already laid a very recent, very relevant blueprint for why not all deals are good deals are shareholders. I've seen a similar deal pitched in which Comcast unloads NBC Universal onto Viacom in a reverse morris trust merger; I would expect that to do to our share price what the Warner deal did to Discovery's. If we are going to get acquired, it better be all cash or all stock, and at a valuation that reflects our true value. I think Shari Redstone is actually our friend on this, she won't screw us the same way Zaslav fisted his shareholders. Conversely, if Viacom suddenly decides they want to be a buyer rather than a seller, history dictates that it's the acquiree's share price that moons while the acquirer's share price that takes a hit. There's no guarantee that the long-established 38 price floor will hold in the event of strategic M&A. Given the [ludicrous valuation](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/reese-witherspoon-hello-sunshine-sold-1235032618/) Hello Sunshine just got, I would much rather be a seller than a buyer in this market. \n* **Dividend.** In my infinite retardation I somehow managed to forget to mention this stock pays a fucking healthy dividend too, which is probably a factor as to why we have so much institutional ownership. A dividend cut of course would hurt the share price. I see the probability of this as basically near zero, the balance sheet looks pretty good right now. \n* **The Options Pinning Theory**. A lot of people are claiming this stock only exists to kill weekly options, but on most weeks I don't see enough open interest for that to actually be worth it for MM's. One thing is certain though, all calls bought after Archegos expecting a bounce to the 80-100 range got nuked. Thus far, call selling has been a more profitable trade than call buying MOST of the time. While personally I think shares and leaps look like the play here (my position currently reflects that also), any time this thing dips below 40 is when to go in with FD's as it very rarely spends too much time below there. For the more conservative investor, SELLING 38 puts is literally free money. \n* **Archegos -** Some say there is an Archegos curse, that nothing in the Korean hedge fund is ever going to moon again. I mean this is some voodoo shit but I feel like it has to be included here. The Chinese stocks he held are obviously down for entirely different reasons right now, and it just hasn't been a hot time for the value / comm trade, something I expect to reverse H2. \n* **The Growth Trade Never Fucking Ends.** As most of us know the tech trade was basically left for dead earlier in the year as shares of tech stocks tumbled as the ten year yield started to rise up steadily. This trade has reversed, and all the money has since gone back into tech, particularly the megacaps. The growth trade has been at the expense of the value trade, and make no mistake about it, ***VIAC IS A VALUE TRADE (LOOK AT THE P/E). It's listed on the NASDAQ, but don't call this a tech stock, it's a communications stock***. While it does look like the ten year yield has stopped drilling with today's nice bounce, there's no guarantee it doesn't once again reverse. However, I have a really difficult time seeing it going below 1%, and I'd be the whole house on the fact it ends the year closer to 2% than 1%. As the yield goes back up, they will shift the money from the growth trade back into value, which benefits VIAC. \n* **SPEAKING OF ALGOS** \\- What does it mean to be heavily institutionally owned? Share price movements are more algo-induced from the big boys. They'll trade many stocks together simultaneously in the same industry, which at times can be unfortunate if you're grouped together with subar competitors. Layer a VIAC chart over DISCA between May and yesterday and you'll see what I mean, when one goes down so does the other. Today's price movement has been encouraging though, I have never seen VIAC green while DISCA is red I think ever. A decoupling here would be fantastic. \n* **The 38 Price Floor I believe in might not hold -** for all the reasons I included above, shit could go south, but this floor has stood the test of time and all sorts of wild shit this year. If it can survive the greatest margin call in history, and every retest after that, then this 38 floor is safer than any other investment I can think of since I don't know the floors of any other stock. But something only works until it doesn't right? So I'm including this as a risk factor since much of the thesis is based upon it. \n* **TL/DR:** There are risks to this trade as there are with any trade, and from the above it's wiser to go with a longer term trade in LEAPS form as much of this stuff takes longer to develop. I'd only go FD's if it dips below 40 as it doesn't spend much time below it. But when factoring in the growth potential, the safety of the 38 floor, the dividend, and the acquisition potential, this play really does have it all for me. Trade safely apes.

Further, based on the company’s upcoming market launches, robust slate of content and new distribution agreement with Sky, we see upside potential to our streaming subscriber and revenue estimates, which we have increased. While supporting this momentum will likely drive higher near-term content investment (thereby limiting growth in EBITDA and FCF), we believe investors are increasingly likely to recognize the long-term growth potential of VIAC’s rapidly growing streaming business.\r  \nWe therefore reiterate our Buy rating on VIAC with an unchanged 12-month price target of $75.

I've never posted DD here before but the overwhelmingly positive reaction I've received from this has inspired me to contribute more to the community. Now, initially I was going to make a separate Part 2 post but I don't want to be seen as spamming so I'm just going to put it as a comment and add it as an edit. Besides, it's probably important to have the risk factors of the trade as part of the original post.   \n8. RISK FACTORS  \nAlright everyone. Some of you read the whole thing and YOLOed. Some of you didn't read any of it and still YOLOed. Most of you probably didn't do shit. And that's ok, because I want everyone to read this next part first before deciding.   \n\\- The entire market could crash like the gay bears have been promising for months. This would of course take out everything with it, and VIAC is no different. The 10% Correction gets thrown out regularly, I'm not an economist so I really don't know if or when this is going to happen - although most of us will have way bigger problems than just VIAC if that does occur.   \n\\- The decline of linear TV outpaces the growth of streaming. This is the worst case scenario for Viacom: advertisers pull their dollars out of linear which has been a cash cow and reallocate them elsewhere (i.e. NOT streaming), leaving Viacom underfunded for P+ growth. I must acknolwedge the potential risk of this even though I assign a very low probability to this in the short term since Viacom just completed the best ad buying upfront they've ever had. That article is a good read because it's not just Viacom tooting its own horn, it's the entire industry! If anything it paints a fairly rosy picture of where the money is flowing.   \n\\-  The P+ app fails to gain traction. Paramount plus has seen two straight quarters of new user growth while Disney and Netflix have actually declined. However, it's certainly easier to gain new users when you're app is new. We don't know if something will keep growing at the rate it has. Reddit and Twitter do have their fair share of people bitching about the P+ app as far as content availability (some seasons of some shows are still licensed out to competitors and the short term) and bugs (the Playstation app is apparently abysmal while the other apps work much better - I've never had an issue on my Samsung or Fire apps). The bottom line is that while P+ has the same growing pains of any new app, the devs do need to figure their shit out, do their fucking job, and keep complaints at a minimum.   \n\\- Competition - The competitors in this space have DEEP pockets. All 5 FAANG names have some sort of video platform, Netflix is of course the leader here, and Apple and Amazon have at least made half assed attempts to be players in this space. A strategic shift from either Apple or Amazon to suddenly start pumping cash into these efforts could prove to be a threat for the survival of Viacom as a viable independent player. The silver lining here however is that should they choose to do that (Apple especially has done basically jack shit) - the easiest way to suddenly increase their position would actually be to buy Viacom's vast IP.    \n\\- Merger. But wait, wouldn't a merger be a good thing like you said earlier before? Not always, and unfortunately Discovery already laid a very recent, very relevant blueprint for why not all deals are good deals are shareholders. I've seen a similar deal pitched in which Comcast unloads NBC Universal onto Viacom in a reverse morris trust merger; I would expect that to do to our share price what the Warner deal did to Discovery's. If we are going to get acquired, it better be all cash or all stock, and at a valuation that reflects our true value. I think Shari Redstone is actually our friend on this, she won't screw us the same way Zaslav fisted his shareholders. Conversely, if Viacom suddenly decides they want to be a buyer rather than a seller, history dictates that it's the acquiree's share price that moons while the acquirer's share price that takes a hit. There's no guarantee that the long-established 38 price floor will hold in the event of strategic M&A. Given the ludicrous valuation Hello Sunshine just got, I would much rather be a seller than a buyer in this market.   \n\\- Dividend. In my infinite retardation I somehow managed to forget to mention this stock pays a fucking healthy dividend too, which is probably a factor as to why we have so much institutional ownership. A dividend cut of course would hurt the share price. I see the probability of this as basically near zero, the balance sheet looks pretty good right now.   \n\\- The Options Pinning Theory. A lot of people are claiming this stock only exists to kill weekly options, but on most weeks I don't see enough open interest for that to actually be worth it for MM's. One thing is certain though, all calls bought after Archegos expecting a bounce to the 80-100 range got nuked. Thus far, call selling has been a more profitable trade than call buying MOST of the time. While personally I think shares and leaps look like the play here (my position currently reflects that also), any time this thing dips below 40 is when to go in with FD's as it very rarely spends too much time below there. For the more conservative investor, SELLING 38 puts is literally free money.   \n\\- Archegos - Some say there is an Archegos curse, that nothing in the Korean hedge fund is ever going to moon again. I mean this is some voodoo shit but I feel like it has to be included here. The Chinese stocks he held are obviously down for entirely different reasons right now, and it just hasn't been a hot time for the value / comm trade, something I expect to reverse H2.   \n\\- The Growth Trade Never Fucking Ends. As most of us know the tech trade was basically left for dead earlier in the year as shares of tech stocks tumbled as the ten year yield started to rise up steadily. This trade has reversed, and all the money has since gone back into tech, particularly the megacaps. The growth trade has been at the expense of the value trade, and make no mistake about it, VIAC IS A VALUE TRADE (LOOK AT THE P/E). It's listed on the NASDAQ, but don't call this a tech stock, it's a communications stock. While it does look like the ten year yield has stopped drilling with today's nice bounce, there's no guarantee it doesn't once again reverse. However, I have a really difficult time seeing it going below 1%, and I'd be the whole house on the fact it ends the year closer to 2% than 1%. As the yield goes back up, they will shift the money from the growth trade back into value, which benefits VIAC.   \n\\- SPEAKING OF ALGOS - What does it mean to be heavily institutionally owned? Share price movements are more algo-induced from the big boys. They'll trade many stocks together simultaneously in the same industry, which at times can be unfortunate if you're grouped together with subar competitors. Layer a VIAC chart over DISCA between May and yesterday and you'll see what I mean, when one goes down so does the other. Today's price movement has been encouraging though, I have never seen VIAC green while DISCA is red I think ever. A decoupling here would be fantastic.   \n\\- The 38 Price Floor I believe in might not hold - for all the reasons I included above, shit could go south, but this floor has stood the test of time and all sorts of wild shit this year. If it can survive the greatest margin call in history, and every retest after that, then this 38 floor is safer than any other investment I can think of since I don't know the floors of any other stock. But something only works until it doesn't right? So I'm including this as a risk factor since much of the thesis is based upon it.   \n\\- TL/DR: There are risks to this trade as there are with any trade, and from the above it's wiser to go with a longer term trade in LEAPS form as much of this stuff takes longer to develop. I'd only go FD's if it dips below 40 as it doesn't spend much time below it. But when factoring in the growth potential, the safety of the 38 floor, the dividend, and the acquisition potential, this play really does have it all for me.

{"title": "Microvast ($MVST) -The only DD you'll ever need", "selftext": "Listen up retards, this won't be short.\n\nThis was not meant for you apes; Seek ing alpha denied my article because they don't want recent SPACs merger on their website.\n\nSo instead of earning cash to spend it on stupid shit, I'm here wasting my time for you all because I don't want 50 hours and 4000 words of research to go to waste, let me tell you gamblers why Microvast ($MVST) is a Hidden gem.\n\nFirst of all, you retards probably came for the short squeeze potential, rumor has it, there's not many shares left to short sell and Microvast is down 60% from its peak (even after yesterday's 20%+ run), but I could not care less about that, MVST will trade significantly higher once decent analysts start coverage on it and this post will tell you why. You guys are so lucky to have found this now, I've been holding since November when it was $11, so the price right now is still dirt cheap (it was $15 two weeks ago...).\n\nQuick introduction for those of you who don’t know what Microvast is and what it does. Microvast is a technology innovator for Li-ion batteries that designs, develops and manufactures battery systems for commercial electric vehicles and energy storage that feature ultra-fast charging capabilities, long life and superior safety. Microvast believes the ultra-fast charging capabilities of its battery systems make charging electric vehicles as convenient as fueling conventional vehicles and believes the long battery life of its battery systems reduces the total cost of ownership of electric vehicles.\n\nMicrovast is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 87%, their estimates are justified by the growing desire for electrification as well as the growing demand for clean energy and the zero-carbon revolution.\n\nThe forecasted battery components revenues (see picture below) come from Microvast being vertically integrated. Their battery components are world-class, significantly differentiating and they are going to sell those parts to some key cell manufacturers in the passenger EV market (specifically their aramid separator and their gradient cathode). They currently ship to passenger vehicle applications (SAIC) but are also engaging with passenger OEMs that have made the announcement that they will manufacture their own batteries (with battery components)\\[1\\]. They also plan to do the same thing with consumer electronics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alqqdfwu0qf71.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=f607dd17a8b1c6817205d2e9b561ca0c22eb26dc\n\nMicrovast's projected revenues\n\nWhile their projections may seem optimistic, they were able to secure partnerships with industry leaders representing over $1.5 Bn in contracted revenue through 2027. $44 millions, $125 millions, $172 millions, $250 millions, and $355 millions for 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 respectively. Those numbers were before they recently announced a partnership with eVersum, a high-tech vehicle OEM, specialized in the design, development, and build of the most purposely engineered electric commercial vehicles for passenger transport. The deal has a potential volume forecasted to be more than 100 million €.\n\nThere’s a great interview on [cheddar news](https://cheddar.com/media/microvast-goes-public-on-nasdaq-via-spac) with Shane Smith, COO of Microvast, where he talks about why Microvast went public and raised more than $800 million: “We raised capital to support orders we already had in place. We’ve won more business than we’ve had capacity for”. It seems like Microvast has a great problem; the demand is bigger than the supply at the moment, which is great news as they may not need to spend a lot on marketing if customers are coming to them directly.\n\n\\- Microvast has over a decade of expertise in designing and manufacturing battery components (Cells, electrolytes, packs, separators). That differentiates them from most of the other battery makers who source their components from the vendors. It is important to note the cell makers do not have the right to produce the material that they did not invent or have the license for. “Microvast invented and manufactures the key battery materials to ensure unique performance and by also guaranteeing the leading time because the material patents are the strongest patents, legally protected and our success is founded on our deep technology portfolio which is wholly owned and protected by over 550 patents (and patent applications)”, said Dr. Mattis, Chief Technology Officer of the company.\n\n\\- They have more than 1800 employees including more than 500 employees in the R&D division.\n\n\\- They have 28000+ Battery systems in operation in 19 different countries.\n\n\\- More than 3.8Bn Miles of operational distance was covered with no major safety incidents.\n\n\\- Their Batteries can run at a high temperature for a long time and they won’t explode. They have this proprietary way for their Batteries to be 90% as efficient as brand-new ones after 10,000 charges.\n\n\\- Among all of Microvast’s products, two stands out that no one else in the world has: the 100% Aramid separator and the full concentration of the grading of the material.\n\no “One of the perks for the solid-state battery is on shrinking separators and with our Aramid separator, we are there”, Dr Wenjuan Mattis said in the Wedbush conference held on April 8th2021. For the fans of solid-state batteries, this could be a major catalyst incoming. Their Aramid separator has higher thermal stability than charged cathode material; 2X the temperature resistance of traditional poly-ethylene separators, enhancing safety and charging time.\n\no “We have almost 15 patents in solid-state batteries, it’s one of the three advanced technologies that we’re working on”, said COO Shane Smith. 15 might not look like a lot compared to QuantumScape, which holds over 200 patents and patent applications related to solid-state battery technology, but they operate in different markets, MVST in commercial vehicle batteries and QS more in the passenger EV batteries. Also, it’s important to mention that they are not really competitors at the moment, Microvast generated about $ 107 million in sales in 2020 and is expecting to generate more than $2 billion in sales in 2025 compared to QuantumScape, which will not generate meaningful revenues until 2026, according to the website “[barrons.com](https://barrons.com/)”.\n\n\\- The other material, the full concentration grid in the cathode, is a unique material made by Microvast. With this technology, they can tune the distribution of the transition metals across the particles, which allows them to maximize the capacity and maintain safety and at the same time minimize the cost and the risk by reducing the cobalt content. The material has a capacity 20% higher than the best material in the market and is 10% lower in cost. They have a production line that has been making 600 tons per year (for the past 3 years).\n\n**Partnership/Customers**\n\n\\- They have solid partnerships, including FPT (the global powertrain brand of CNH Industrial Group), Oshkosh (leading global innovator of mission-critical vehicles and essential equipment), Porsche, SAIC, and many more. Oshkosh also made a $25MM strategic investment in the PIPE, and signed joint development agreement highlighting future battery collaboration and integration. It is worth mentioning that Oshkosh received the USPS contract to replace its mail delivery trucks (the initial contract is. worth $482 million). Also, it is an open contract, meaning USPS will be able to order more vehicles throughout the 10-year contract ([they will order between 50,000 and 165,000 vehicles](https://www.oshkoshcorp.com/en/news/2-23-21-usps)). This is a lot of potential business for Microvast and could represent a serious catalyst in the future once more information is available. Oshkosh expects to start production in 2023, right when Microvast’s factory in Tennessee will be up and running. Remember, MVST went from $14 to $23 the day Oskosh got the USPS contract, this will definitely be a HUGE catalyst once we know more about it.\n\n\\- They can count as their customers some of the leading global bus OEMs including Yutong, Higer, Foton, King Long, VDL, and Wright Bus. Their batteries are being deployed across a broad range of commercial vehicles, including automated guided vehicles, port equipment, mining trucks, fork-lift trucks. They also have customer relationships with the likes of Kion, Kalmar, KoneCranes, Linde, PSA Singapore, and Gaussin. All of these names are recognized as leading OEMs in their particular area of focus.\n\n**Key advantages over its competitors**\n\nMicrovast is very unique in itself and it is hard to compare them with other public companies; some are fairly young compared to them and others are well established but operate in the passenger EV battery market and it is unclear when/if they will shift towards the manufacturing of commercial EV batteries.\n\nTheir closest competitor is probably \\*\\*\\* had to get rid of this competitor (market cap under 1bill) but the short answer is that MVST is 10 times better...\n\nIf we do a quick head-to-head comparison, we can see Microvast seems to have a clearer path to achieve its Revenue goals.\n\n\\*\\*\\* is headquartered in Los Angeles with a factory of 113K sq.ft compared to Microvast with its biggest factory in China (1.72MM sq.ft.), another one in Germany (170K sq.ft.), and one in the United States in 2022 (577K sq.ft.). In contrast, \\*\\*\\* has more than 200 employees and Microvast is expected to hire around 300 employees only for their new factory in Tennessee and they also have more than 500 employees working in the R&D division as mentioned before.\n\nIt looks like Microvast is better positioned to profit from global electrification with their factories established in three different parts of the world.\n\nThe picture below shows both their year-over-year revenues growth, which could be a bit misleading as they are not in the same business stage and operate in different continents for now. China and Europe lead the United States in electric commercial vehicles on the road, which could explain the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6wzhoey0qf71.png?width=297&format=png&auto=webp&s=77984dcaac9f5762f2edc3dd7fc971418dfa0ed7\n\nBut the point I want to make here is that they rely on different things, \\*\\*\\* miss on revenues is due to the short-term limited number of battery cell providers, producing safe, high-performance cells suitable for the commercial electric vehicle market. “We know, we, and the whole industry, need more cells”, said the CEO of \\*\\*\\* in their latest earnings call. Whereas Microvast produces their own cells, relying more on the primary resources. See the picture below for Microvast 2021 projected Revenues as well as \\*\\*\\* forecasted and revised revenues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbp0ee4x0qf71.png?width=253&format=png&auto=webp&s=23295bd6c127a150fb07bdfec94a2a814a5fc752\n\nOn the other hand, it is true that Microvast did not have earnings call yet to discuss their 2021 outlook but I believe they are in line to achieve their projected revenues. They had \\~ $107 MM in revenues in 2020 and if they keep the same YoY growth rate of 115% (Q1 2020 à Q1 2021), they will get to $230 MM by the end of the year. The key differentiator here is that Microvast manufactures their own cells, which ensures high quality, faster product development, greater customization to client needs, and tighter cost control as well as higher margins. The fact that Microvast has its own in-house manufacturing capacity is a clear competitive advantage to my eyes (see picture below, found on Microvast website).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nkrsbv1r0qf71.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=a77943b9313e8bdb0ce659885fc94ab870543332\n\nBoth of these companies are currently highly valued based on their potential and future expected revenues. At their current market cap, \\*\\*\\* is selling at an estimated 2021 P/S ratio between 23 and 51 and MVST with an estimated 2021 P/S ratio of about 12. Once again, these two companies are not at the same business stage and I believe they will both succeed and grow at an impressive pace, however, MVST’s growth perspective and business model seem less risky and more predictable.\n\nI have a conservative 2023 Price target on MVST of $25 (that was for Seeking Alpha, let's be real here $25 is legit fair value for Microvast, it should trade at a premium for all its potential not a discount), which is more than a 200% increase from its current price of about 8$ and $25 also happens to be their 52 week-high. My price target is based on discounted 2023 revenues and a P/S ratio of 12 (85% of forecasted 2023 revenues (85%\\*751MM) \\* 12 = \\~$7,5 billion market cap). Considering their direct competitor is currently more expensive (P/S between 23-51) and other companies operating in a similar sector are trading at high valuations: Tesla (\\~20 P/S), Pro terra (\\~11 P/S), QuantumScape (Market cap of 9.5B without revenues yet), and Nikola (Market cap of \\~4B without revenues yet), Microvast can be considered as fairly cheap and this price target of $25 as conservative. It could easily go to $40 is what I meant.\n\n**TAM is estimated to be $30Bn + in 2025**\n\n· Battery providers are expected to play a pivotal role in the EV value chain: \\~ 30-40% of EV value resides in the battery.\n\n· The rotation from gas-powered commercial vehicles to electric-powered commercial vehicles might happen quicker than the rotation from gas passenger cars to electric passenger cars because of government funding. Also, with the lithium shortage, the world will have to mine more lithium but it would not make sense to use powered-gas trucks to mine to then build electric batteries for a greener future, I believe the U.S government as well as the other governments, will make sure we use clean energy to mine lithium or any other natural resources, which would benefit Microvast.\n\n· The demand is bigger than the supply at the moment with battery cell production in the U.S. just below 40 GWh in 2020, while battery demand exceeded 42 GWh. For context, achieving President Biden’s goal of a 100% electric fleet of U.S. government vehicles will require 69 GWh of battery cells. I believe Microvast is well-positioned to become a giant in the industry with their new factories; they planned ahead, which could give them a competitive advantage over their competitors.\n\n· EV Battery market is believed to be at a key inflection point (EV is 1.5% of 2020 sales – 8.5% by. 2025), which equals to an expected CAGR of 55% (based on sales in key markets: U.S, Europe, China, Japan & South Korea). Source: [Microvast investors presentation](https://microvast.com/app/uploads/2021/07/investor-presentation.pdf).\n\nØ There is a profound energy transition toward renewable energy driven by governmental policies that are synchronized for the first time, according to Frederique Carrier in the [RBC Global insight May 2021](https://www.rbcinsight.com/WM/Share/ResearchViewer/?SSS_550F5749FFF0E40F2A81B69264610173).\n\no The European Green Deal refocused the EU’s COVID-19 stimulus package onto renewables -charging infrastructure, power generation, and green hydrogen projects (allocating up to $600 billion to green projects).\n\no China’s 14th Five-Year Plan called for electric vehicles to constitute 20 percent of overall new car sales in China by 2021 from just 5% now (spending up to $1.5 trillion).\n\no Joe Biden won the U.S presidential election with a sweeping infrastructure program (up to $2 trillion).\n\no Microvast is well diversified in these three growing markets with its biggest factory in China (1.72MM sq.ft.), one in Germany (170K sq.ft.), and another one in production in the United States (577K sq.ft., expected to start production in 2022).\n\n\\- According to Shelby Tucker, RBC Capital Markets, LLC Utilities Analyst, the global market for batteries has the potential to grow 100 times by 2050.\n\nAlso, great find by [u/Little\\_Objective\\_683/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Little_Objective_683/) : The U.S department of energy (DOE) asked Microvast in 2019 to build a Li-ion battery facility in the United States to fulfill Microvast's biggest order to date, which will make Microvast the largest American Li-ion Manufacturer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7n6py2q11qf71.jpg?width=315&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e40ba583ed4d5027fcb52d24d696a9eda469102\n\n**Global market presence**\n\nAfter primarily being focused on the PRC and Asia-Pacific regions, they are expanding their presence and product promotion to Europe and the United States to capitalize on the rapidly growing electrification markets. In 2021, they will be launching a marketing campaign to introduce Microvast to more potential customers in regions outside the Asia Pacific region and adding more headcounts to support business development ([source: Sec.gov; DEF14 form](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-035581/defm14a_tuscanholdings.htm)).\n\nThe European market presents enormous growth opportunities for electric vehicles, driven by higher emission standards, reduced total cost of ownership compared to gas-based combustion engines, and growing environmental awareness. In the United States, they believe a new political administration is likely to push the electrification revolution through regulation. In pursuing contract opportunities with industry-leading companies in the United States, they have seen how their potential customers recognize the lower total cost of ownership for commercial vehicles and are seeking alternative forms of energy for energy storage applications.\n\nAs they expand their presence globally, they will continue to invest in their existing partnerships in the PRC and the Asia Pacific region and continue to grow their business there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00irgk431qf71.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=49bb262a01b29c15a45b58813e286e382434220e\n\n\\- Revenues in Europe decreased by about 22% while Revenues in PRC increased by more than 260%\n\n\\- I believe the decrease in Europe is temporary and was caused by the pandemic, since it affected the whole industry, as Panasonic mentioned in their latest earnings report. and with the new factory in Germany, it will become more convenient for European companies to try and buy Microvast’s products. According to the website [iea.org](https://www.iea.org/), new electric car registrations were about 3 million globally in 2020 and for the first time, Europe led with 1.4 million new registrations followed by China with 1.2 million and the United States with 295 000 new electric cars.\n\n**Bear Case**\n\nI could not find solid bear cases anywhere on Microvast other than “it’s a Chinese company, stay away” or “insiders are dumping shares on you, get out”.\n\nLet’s talk about the latter quickly. As found on [the sec.gov DEF14 filing for THCB](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-035581/defm14a_tuscanholdings.htm) (SPAC that merged with Microvast),\n\n“Subject to certain exceptions, the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement further provides (1) Wu will be subject to a lock-up of one year with respect to 25% of his shares and a lock-up of two years for the remaining 75% of his shares, provided that, with respect to the 25% of his shares subject to the one-year lock-up, he can sell those shares if the shares trade at $15.00 or above for 20 days in any 30-day period and (2) the Microvast equity holders other than Wu are subject to a six-month lock-up. The Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement further provides that the shares owned by the Sponsor Group will be subject to a lock-up. Specifically, with respect to 75% of the shares owned by the Sponsor Group, (a) 2/3rds of such shares are subject to a one-year lock-up unless the shares trade at $12.50 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period and (b) the remaining 1/3rd of such shares are subject to a one-year lock-up. With respect to the remaining 25% of the shares owned by the Sponsor Group, (a) 50% of such shares are locked-up until the later of the one-year anniversary of the Closing and the date on which the shares trade at $12.00 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, (b) the remaining 50% of such shares are locked-up until the later of the one-year anniversary of the Closing and the date on which the shares trade at $15.00 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period and (c) all of such shares are subject to forfeiture if such trading targets are not met by the fifth anniversary of the Closing.”.\n\nIn other words, insiders are not “dumping shares on us” at a price of about $8 (now $10) because of their lock-up agreement.\n\nShould you fear Microvast because it is a Chinese company? Perma bulls will tell you it is not a Chinese company as it is headquartered and founded in Houston, Texas. In reality, it really is a Chinese battery maker coming public through an American SPAC, [according to Dana Blankenhorn](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tuscan-holdings-is-gaining-traction-but-where-is-microvast-coming-from-2021-02-10) (let's not argue about this fellow retards, it doesn't really matter; China is years ahead of the U.S in EV). If you were on vacation the past couple of weeks, here’s what happened with the Chinese stocks:\n\n\\- A crackdown on education has spread to Chinese tech stocks and the whole Chinese market (MSCI China index delivered negative returns of -14% in July).\n\n\\- Investors fear the unpredictability of the Chinese government, which could explain the 40% drop in MVST share price in a month.\n\nSo, the question is, should you be greedy when others are fearful as Warren Buffet said? Or should you panic sell after a 40% drop in a month?\n\nHere’s what UBS Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefel had to say on China:\n\n“For the tech sector, Beijing remains focused on its long-term goal of technological self-sufficiency and leadership on the global stage. We believe the regulatory risk will continue in the socially sensitive sectors of property. And healthcare, we don’t expect the government will push these sectors to non-profit either”. Another important part that Mark Haefel discussed is directly related to Microvast: “Offshore equities are pricing in a higher risk premium. This is likely to linger in the near term. However, we think Future returns will be largely driven by earnings growth (mainly from cyclical and value sectors) this year. We recommend investors cherry-pick stocks across sectors that are supported by earnings growth but have limited regulatory risk exposure. Our preferred sectors include consumer durables and services, energy, and Greentech.”\n\nIn the short term, who knows where the stock price can go, however, if Microvast delivers on their promises, we will most likely see abnormal returns. I understand the risk of companies operating in China, but what I particularly like about Microvast is that they are diversifying away from China with their factory in Germany and one incoming in the United States, they will be on three different continents, which is worth something to my eyes.\n\nLet’s summarize what has been said before with a SWOT Analysis\n\nSWOT AnalysisStrengths:\n\nØ Unlike competitors who redesign existing batteries to fit them in EVs, Microvast has designed its batteries from the ground up specifically to address the problems facing EV batteries. Every step of the manufacturing process is controlled by Microvast, leading to higher quality and lower-cost products.\n\nØ Researchers from Microvast have developed a novel high-power battery technology that has a higher energy density, longer life, and safer operation than any other state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery on the market. The system is built from four breakthrough technologies and could potentially be used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and fully electric vehicle markets. Because of its many benefits, the technology has the potential to also enhance the performance of lithium-ion batteries used in cell phones and other smaller-scale applications, as well as in electric grid applications.\n\nØ $ 1.5B total contracted revenue in Pipeline through 2027, which will help Microvast to grow revenue at an expected CAGR of 87% from 2020-2025E\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nØ Being a “Chinese company”, U.S investors might not like it as much as a U.S company.\n\nØ Portfolio Managers being scared of investing in SPACs or even the “deSPACs phase “after the SPACs controversy in the beginning of 2021.\n\nOpportunities:\n\nØ There is three substantial untapped markets that Microvast plans on expanding their products offering to; Passenger Vehicles (PV), Energy Storage Solutions (ESS), and Battery Components (Consumer Electronics), which could expand their TAM by $45B.\n\nØ 2021: Begin Battery Production in the area of Berlin, Germany\n\nØ 2022: Begin Battery Production in Clarksville, TN\n\nThreats:\n\nØ Susceptible to disruption, many companies are trying to improve EV batteries and might not need Microvast in the foreseeable future.\n\nØ The Prices of Lithium-ion batteries have been plummeting over the past decade, and that trend is expected to continue in the coming years, which could impact Microvast’s profit margin.\n\nØ Other companies are working hard on lowering EV battery costs, one or more of them could make a battery substantially cheaper than Microvast.\n\nTo conclude, I believe the growth opportunity in the commercial EV battery sector is impressive as well as somewhat predictable as it makes sense for companies to go electric economically, financially, and environmentally. Microvast is well-positioned to capture a great portion of the total addressable market of $30 Bn and has the opportunity to dramatically increase their TAM if they expand their business to consumer electronics, passenger EV batteries, and energy storage solutions market. The fact that Microvast went public through a SPAC merger less than a week ago gives retail investors an edge to generate alpha as analysts have not started to cover the company yet. Microvast also fits the criteria of sustainable investing, a trend that is not about to die anytime soon. Overall, Microvast has everything it needs to become a successful company; it now just needs to deliver on its promises.\n\nSo, the real question is: does the upside outweigh the downside?\n\nYou tell me.\n\n\\*\\*Disclaimer\n\nI own shares and warrants of MVST.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, this should not be used as financial advice.\n\n\\[1\\] Wedbush presentation 4/8/2021", "id": "oz4ka3", "created_utc": 1628248495.0, "score": 2497, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 687, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|22 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oz4gqk/microvast_mvst_the_only_dd_youll_ever_need/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oz4ka3/microvast_mvst_the_only_dd_youll_ever_need/) \n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sus af", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "First seen: 22 minutes ago 🤨🧐", "score": 19, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You should update and repost this DD.

If you’ve liked the recent price action on that, here's another EV supplier play that I believe has similar multibagger potential. Important bits bolded and tldr at the bottom if you can’t read too well.\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nI. Introduction\n\nII. Overview\n\nIII. Partnerships\n\nIV. Sales\n\nV. Advantage\n\nVI. Connections\n\nVII. The Plunge\n\nVIII. Financials\n\nIX. Growth and Long Term Strategy\n\nX. Conclusion\n\n**I. Introduction:**\n\nProterra designs and manufactures zero-emission electric transit vehicles and EV technology solutions for commercial applications. Founded in 2004, Proterra is a monster in electric bus manufacturing in the United States, with over 600 busses delivered, 750 million in backlog, and over 20 million miles of service[ already bagged.](https://www.proterra.com/) The company has a very bright future no matter what, but the Infrastructure bill makes that future a whole lot brighter.\n\nThe bipartisan Infrastructure Bill has about 1 trillion dollars for various projects and initiatives with WSJ reporting that it is expected to include “**$39 billion in new funding** to modernize public transit and[ replace thousands of buses](https://www.wsj.com/articles/infrastructure-agreement-on-major-issues-reached-by-bipartisan-group-gop-negotiator-says-11627487459) with zero-emission vehicles”.\n\nNow, the specific language of the bill has not been written yet, but even a fraction of this $39 billion would represent an **absolutely massive, and I mean truly gargantuan, increase in funding for electric busses**. Right now, the main way electric busses get funded is through the Federal Transit Administration’s Low or No Emission Vehicle Program (“Low-No”) [which has only given about $600m over the last six years](https://www.atlasevhub.com/data_story/more-than-2-6-billion-in-public-funding-for-evs/). No, that's not $600m per year, t**hat's $600m overall**. That means that funding for electric transit busses is about to jump from around an average of $100m per year to having access to a potential $39 billion. Even just $1 billion of this would represent a **1000% increase in funding**. This legislation represents a seismic shift in the electric bus market that would supercharge any companies in this particular sector, with analysts predicting this new money will balloon the US ebus market[ five-fold to $2.7 Billion by 2024 alone.](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/five-facts-why-electric-buses-are-key-bidens-green-agenda-2021-07-14/)\n\nTwo companies stand out in this regard: Proterra, and BYD.\n\nBYD is a Chinese manufacturing company that, among other things, manufactures a shit ton of electric busses. In China, they fill contracts ranging in the [tens of thousands](https://insideevs.com/news/521895/china-byd-plugin-sales-june2021/). In the US, their subsidiary has completed some of the largest electric bus contracts in the US and is aggressively moving to expand production, technical capacity, and acquire more contracts.\n\nThey have one big problem though. Politicians in both the Republican and Democratic parties have acknowledged the rise of China linked energy companies as a threat to US national security. Nobody wants to move from having OPEC hold us by the balls by controlling oil supplies to China suddenly having an undue influence on the very means of public transportation in our streets.\n\nDue to this, at the end of 2019[ Congress passed language](https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-wants-to-ban-chinese-buses-railcars-in-defense-bill-11575927925) in the National Defense Authorization Act that bars use of federal funds to purchase Chinese busses. In fact, they [explicitly called out BYD by name](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/lawmakers-slam-china-controlled-truck-maker-byd-as-threat-to-u-s) as a national security threat and prime target for blacklisting from taxpayer money.\n\nThis means that there is a relatively good chance that BYD will struggle to receive much of the proposed funding for bus electrification in the upcoming Infrastructure Bill. Even with them having a unionized, American workforce in 99% American factories, they still have not been able to convince politicians that they match the requirements for “Buy American” initiatives.\n\nTherefore, a sizable amount of the remaining money designated for electric bus adoption will fall to the other top electric transit bus maker in the United States: Proterra.\n\n**II. Overview:**\n\nBased in deep blue California with a factory in red South Carolina, Proterra is the ideal vehicle to advance Democrats' vision of enacting deep climate change fighting policies as well as providing good, well paying American jobs to boost local manufacturing industries. Indeed, Proterra has already been recognized by the current administration as vital to future Democratic political ambitions, with President Joe Biden[ touring their plant virtually](https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/greenville/2021/04/20/joe-biden-visit-greenville-sc-virtual-local-electric-bus-manufacturing/7300675002/) and Vice president Kamala[ touring their partner](https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10141979/thomas-built-buses-gets-visit-from-vice-president-harris-during-earth-week) Thomas Built Busses in person.\n\nTransportation in the US currently accounts for[ 29% of all US emissions](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions), making it the highest contributing sector to CO2 levels. A strengthening of public transit and an increase in electric bus adoption[ would make more of a difference than almost any other policy](https://mobile.reuters.com/video/watch/why-electric-buses-are-key-to-bidens-gre-id732925804) the White House could enact.\n\nDespite this though, only[ 2% of US busses currently are electric](https://electricvehicles.in/electric-bus-revolution/). Comparatively, China, at the end of 2017, was hitting at least[ 17% of busses being electric](https://www.sustainable-bus.com/electric-bus/electric-bus-public-transport-main-fleets-projects-around-world/) while, overall, [99% of electric busses world wide](https://content.sierraclub.org/evguide/blog/2018/05/when-it-comes-electric-buses-china-killing-it) are being produced in and for China. This is not even mentioning huge electric bus orders in both India and throughout Europe that easily outpace America's own efforts. The United States is badly losing the Green tech race, by almost every measure.\n\nThe Infrastructure Bill, however, promises to turn that all around. And a land where no one wears shoes is a prime opportunity for a shoe manufacturer.\n\nDue to this, there are many companies that will inevitably benefit. New Flyer, Lion Electric company, Vicinity Motors and other electric bus makers will most likely see significant upside from upcoming government subsidies and contracts. However, Proterra stands out as the number one domestic pure electric bus maker in the United States with extensive recognition by the US government.\n\nMore significant than any of this though, is that the main advantage Proterra has over other electric transit bus companies is that **PROTERRA IS NOT AN ELECTRIC BUS COMPANY**. Though most people, including the government, recognize Proterra as a leader in the US ebus market, their true potential and current market strategy is so, so much more.\n\nProterra has three modes of revenue: Powered, Transit, and Energy.\n\n* **Transit:** designs and builds the busses\n* **Powered:** develops and distributes electric powertrains and battery system for various commercial vehicle partners\n* **Energy:** offers full scale electric support infrastructure in terms of design, build, financing, operations, maintenance and energy optimization.\n\nThis means that while building electric busses is currently their bread and butter, their business is increasingly having to do with **Proterra Powered** and being more of a pick and shovel play: providing complete battery packs, technology, and powertrains to other companies looking to go electric. To simplify this, it means that instead of trying to build a whole new electric vehicle and market it to potential customers, Proterras strategy is instead just focus on the battery and electric parts while partnering with already established big name brands to let them build the actual vehicle. This allows for them to straighten profit margins and avoid competition with older companies.\n\nIn essence, this massively expands their potential market penetration and enables them to surmount being pigeonholed into one particular sector, like how many of their competitors are in the commercial transit bus market.\n\n**III. Partnerships:**\n\nAnd before you think this is some pie in the sky vision they have, the reality is that Proterra is already the #1 leader in electric commercial vehicles with a ton of key partnerships with established blue chip companies. These partnerships are the foundation to Proterras long term strategy, allowing them to expand into new markets for vehicles to electrify. As of now, they are involved with powering.\n\n* Thomas school busses\n* Van hool coach busses\n* FCCC stepvans\n* Optimal shuttle busses\n* Komatsu excavators\n* Volta delivery trucks\n* Bustech transit busses\n* Lightening commercial vans\n* And just recently announced partnerships with ROUSH CleanTech and Penske Truck Leasing to develop Ford Motor Co's F-650 all-electric commercial truck, as well as a new partnership with Taylor Machine Works Inc. to develop an all-electric material forklift handler.\n\nAnd of course, this isn’t even getting into how Daimler Trucks, which is the **leading heavy-duty truck manufacturer** in North America, is a[ major Proterra investor](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/daimler-trucks-invests-in-proterra-electrification-spac) and technology partner. This particular connection gives Proterra credibility with larger, more established corporations, giving increased opportunities for expansion such as how Proterra works through Daimler subsidiary Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation to build delivery trucks for companies such as **Fedex, UPS, and Amazon**. This massively expands their source of revenue, as yearly sales for this type of vehicle[ measure 200,000 compared to just 8,000 for transit busses](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/02/28/electric-busmaker-proterra-using-its-silicon-valley-tech-to-make-green-freightliner-trucks/?sh=511c1e06351c). In fact, they estimate that by 2025, the bulk of their revenue will actually come from these “secondary” sources of income as opposed to their so far main business of electric transit busses.\n\n**IV. Sales:**\n\nBusses are only the tip of the iceberg of what Proterra is aiming to be. Beyond just electrifying just about every other vehicle offered in the commercial market, Proterra offers something that I personally have never seen from any other bus company: end-to-end electric vehicle solutions including charging stations and Proterra developed management software.\n\nThe main appeal of Proterra is that they have developed an integrated technology ecosystem of different products that promotes sales that they describe as being “sticky”. **What this means is that once you buy one Proterra product, you're incredibly likely to buy something else as well**. Buy a bus - might as well buy their chargers - buy their charges - might as well buy their software system, and so on.\n\nImpressed with their transit busses? Well lucky for you your yellow school bus fleet is about to expire and the company you already have good relations with and have [a positive view of also makes that product](https://thomasbuiltbuses.com/bus-news-and-events/news/montgomery-county-public-schools-approves-the-2021-02-25/). Repeat business is a big plank of how Proterra operates. Currently, [80%](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PTRA-ACTC-Analyst-Day-Presentation-4.8.21-FINAL-1.pdf) of Proterras Transit customers end up making an additional purchase from their Proterra Energy division. A perfect example of this is how Miami recently upped its Proterra bus fleet from 33 to a total of 75 busses, and then went ahead and[ hired Proterra to install one of the largest fleet charging systems in the U.S](https://www.proterra.com/press-release/miami-fleet-electrification/). Reputation is king with emerging technologies, and Proterra has deep networks with almost every transit agency in the US.\n\nIt's also important to note, circling back to the infrastructure bill, that on top of whatever money ends up being designated for transit busses, that there is also **$7.5 Billion** **for developing charging stations** and $**2.5 billion for school busses**, both areas that Proterra can take advantage of, as they offer full scale fleet charging stations and their partnership with Thomas Built busses means they are[ actively working with the number one school bus maker in the United States](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2021/05/20210506-tbb.html).\n\nGoing even farther, Proterra is fully **vertically integrated** almost all the way down their supply chain, with battery cells as one of the only third party components that is not built in house. However, they have secured around 2 GW of cells through 2022 through LG Chem, and are **currently planning their own battery facility**. That means that not only can they tap into government money meant for EV producers, but they can also take advantage of any funds allocated towards American battery producers, [a part which most likely will make up](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2021/07/climate-and-clean-energy-policy-state-of-play) a sizable portion of the 3.5 trillion dollar reconciliation bill that is currently being worked on.\n\n**V. Advantage:**\n\nProterras main advantage over other competitors is their head start on research in this sector and data obtained that you can only get from over a decade of real world experience. Proterra is currently on their 5th generation battery design and their 5th generation bus, with a combined over 20 million miles driven over their various vehicles. Furthermore, the partnerships and connections they have (both business and political) already established emphasize their first mover advantage.\n\nProterra also holds over **81 patents** and offers unique services such as their **APEX Connected Vehicle Intelligence System**, which is a cloud based data platform that helps customers manage and monitor their fleets, allowing them to optimize ownership and operations as well as providing state of the art analytics. Working this **SaaS** approach into their overall business model is pivotal in differentiating Proterra from other companies. Additionally, there is also potential to use programs like APEX to **transform Proterra Vehicle charging stations into Utility Grid Assets** which would offer another avenue for revenue and make their systems more attractive to prospective buyers. Proterra is the leading competitor for this necessary next step for all electric vehicle makers and[ is leagues ahead of any rivals](https://www.altenergymag.com/article/2020/12/the-promise-of-v2g-technology-%E2%80%94-and-how-it-could-accelerate-the-clean-energy-revolution/34214).\n\n**VI. Connections: It’s all about who you know**\n\nI believe Proterras connections are **unparalleled** by any company and have established them as a preeminent force in both the **business and political world** that most other companies would be hard pressed to match. I won’t go through all of them, but to highlight a few:\n\nJack Allen: Chief Executive Officer and Board Chairman\n\n* Over three decades of experience in the driving core businesses at Navistar International Corporation (**one of the largest trucking companies in the world**) serving as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer President of their North America truck and parts division, President of Navistar’s engine group, and has also has served as Vice President and General Manager of the company’s parts organization.\n\nJennifer Granholm: Former Proterra board member (resigned to take cabinet job)\n\n* Current **Secretary of Energy** for Biden admin (the DoE is responsible for dealing out loans, contracts, and grants relating to electric busses and other vehicles.)\n* CNN political contributor (media connections)\n* Former Michigan Governor (deep ties with auto industry and championed auto bailout in 2008)\n\nRyan Popple: Co-founder and Executive Director\n\n* **Early employee of Tesla**, served as senior director of finance with a focus on strategic planning, technology cost reduction and corporate finance.\n\nDustin Grace: Chief Technology Officer\n\n* Nine years of powertrain development expertise from **Tesla Motors**\n* Worked R&D at Honda for four years.\n\nJosh Ensign: Chief Operating Officer\n\n* Vice President of Manufacturing at **Tesla Motors**\n* Led global operations in Honeywell International’s automotive and aerospace businesses\n\nJochen Goetz: Board member\n\n* 30 years experience and currently serving as Head of Finance & Controlling at **Daimler Trucks & Buses**\n* Lead positions at Mercedes-Benz Trucks, Powertrain, and Daimler Trucks North America divisions. He was the head of Planning and Reporting for **Mercedes-Benz Cars** and the Daimler Group. Since April 2016, Goetz has served on the board of directors of Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation.\n\nAudrey Lee: Director of Arclight (entity that took Proterra public)\n\n* Clean Energy for Biden co-founder. This council has been described as Biden's **bridge to the private green energy sector**, and has undoubtedly been the driving force behind Bides tour of Proterra and continued close cooperation between the company and government contacts.\n\nIn addition to all this, Proterra has also hired two Obama-Biden white house officials to lobby the government on Proterras behalf: Pete Gould who was associate director of government affairs for the Department of Transportation, and Christine Turner who held numerous trade-related positions throughout the administration, including on the White House National Security Council. Their lobby firm is also helmed by Brandon Hurlbut, who was chief of staff at the Department of Energy, a top energy adviser to Obama at the White House, and co-chaired Clean Energy for Biden.\n\nAnd lastly, notable investors in Proterra include the Generation Investment Management, (a fund partly managed by **Al Gore**), Tao Capital Partners (run by the Democratic megadoner, including the current governor of Illinois, Pritzkers clan), and BlackRock (which **current National Economic Council Director Brian Deese** previously worked at and who also just so happened to join Biden for his Proterra factory tour.)\n\nSafe to stay, Proterras leadership and connections are absolutely stacked with heavy hitters in the electric battery implementation sector, trucking and vehicle development industry, and in the highest echelons of our government. I have personally never seen a company so well managed with experienced professionals that is as tightly ensconced with government officials as this one. In fact, these connections make Proterra resemble Lockheed Martin or Boeing more so than just your average bus manufacturer.\n\nAnd when those billions of dollars start being dispersed from the Infrastructure Bill, it will be these connections, connections none of Proterras competitors can boast of, that will make a key difference in levels of funding and access to further opportunities.\n\n**VII. The Plunge:**\n\nDespite all this though, Proterra stock has cratered almost 40% the last month.\n\nWhy? There are four primary reasons for this.\n\nPipe dumping\n\n* Pipe stands for Private Investment in Public Equity, and essentially means that after a company files an S-1, the lockup period ends and these investors are free to sell their shares.\n* Proterra filed its S-1 around July 12th and the share price quickly started sliding downward.\n* While PIPE investors chose to capture a 70% profit in the sixth months, this does not reflect a wider feeling about the future prospects of the company.\n* As of now the PIPE selling is over and the stock just needs something to juice it back up into a positive direction (something like, idk, billions of new funding suddenly becoming available)\n\nSpac name being tarnished\n\n* Proterra went public via a special purpose acquisition company this year, and thus is often associated with other companies that went public through a SPAC\n* SPAC companies like Lordstown have been a fiasco, and Nikola,[ well we all know how that is turning out](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-charges-nikola-founder-trevor-milton-with-lying-investors-2021-07-29/).\n* This has really put a damper on any company even remotely associated in this space, and similar to Microvast, Proterra seems to be getting lumped in with more vaporware companies.\n\nToo many ipos\n\n* An incredible amount of companies are going public at the same time, and investors just can’t seem to settle on which ones to invest in. There have been[ over 400 ipos this year alone](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20there%20were%20407,as%20in%20the%20previous%20year.), twice as much as last year, and there's still five more months to go before the year ends.\n* “When you see a lot of companies coming public ... then that is a very bad sign for the averages because it means the stock market is getting flooded with new supply,”[ Mad Money](http://www.cnbc.com/mad-money/) host Jim Cramer explains.\n* Supply exceeds demand = low prices and dispersed attention\n* Big advantage of Tesla was that they were the only “shiny object” for EV on the market for a long time, which consolidated all interested in this sector into one single company. [That's no longer the case](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/14/tesla-wants-everyone-drive-an-electric-car-now-it-risks-becoming-niche-brand/).\n\nBad Press\n\n* There were a few articles either released or dug up last week that questioned the reliability of Proterras products. I won’t go too far into the specific issues though, as most if not all problems listed were with Proterras 1st generation busses. They are currently on their 5th generation of electric busses.\n* There was a singular issue with the bus chassis showing cracking in Philadelphia, but these issues are superficial and specific to one custom made model on a specific route that [does not affect Proterras overall designs](https://delawarebusinessnow.com/2021/07/dart-not-seeing-the-problems-that-idled-septas-electric-buses/).\n* Additionally, much of this bad press has spawned from conservative media sources, due to the fact that this is such a closely Democrat associated company.\n\nWhile detrimental to the stock in the very short run, these issues are thankfully not due to any inherent weakness of Proterras product or marketing strategy and thus, do not represent an undue threat to its future potential. I fully believe Proterra will rebound soon as it gets more attention and mainstream name recognition.\n\nAs for the specific issues raised by the conservative articles, [here is Proterras response](https://www.proterra.com/americas-transition-to-electric-buses/), as they can give a better rundown on how meritless these articles are then I can.\n\n**VIII. Financials: Significant Numbers**\n\nHere's a link to Proterras[ full financial breakdown](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf): I won’t put it all here but here are some highlights.\n\n* Current market cap: $2.22B\n* Current stock price: 10.70\n* 2017-2025 CAGR is 50%\n* 800m cash on hand\n* No debt\n\nProjections:\n\n* 2021E Rev: $246M\n* 2022E Rev: $439M\n* 2023E Rev: $838M\n* 2025E Rev: $2566M\n\nThe biggest thing to note here is that these projections were done before the infrastructure was even beginning to be considered, which means **it is highly unlikely that the insane amount of funds in the current Infrastructure Bill were factored into specifically in the early year projections**. The implementation of the bill will juice these projections to a degree I don’t think anyone can really expect.\n\nI do know for a fact that the partnerships announced in the last few months are not currently priced in, as they constitute more of the 2023-25 revenue. These moves being made recently, such as the partnership with Rouch and Taylor Machine Works  Inc. (**a partnership which by the way Proterra stole from BYD**) this early, will most likely move the projections up a bit.\n\nPart of the reason I won’t go too far into financials is that the passage of the Infrastructure Bill in its current form will **flip Proterras potential on its head.** It's already been steaming full ahead but new funds like this will of course change things.\n\nThe Infrastructure Bill passing and their first quarterly report as a public company on **August 11** is the prime catalyst for what I see as whether the potential for this company is real or not. August 11th will really give us a good look into whether the company is holding up to its projections and how the financials are looking going forward. More news on their battery factory development and announcements on more corporate/government partnerships are all possible, with the forward guidance going to be of critical importance.\n\nNow Citigroup does have a **PT of $16** for them, but as of yet the stock hasn’t gained much attention from Wall Street. I believe this is due to the fact hedge funds are **too busy looking at where the puck is, not where it's going to be**. Very similar to how the Morgan Stanley analyst for some idiotic reason only used Microvasts current factory output stead of including their factories under construction, most hedge funds are **too caught up in Proterras past that they are incapable of seeing where it is going.** The Infrastructure bill will supercharge Proterras bus business while Proterras Powered market strategy and big name partners have the ability to ride the infrastructure wave into unimaginable heights, a position few other companies are in a similar position to do so clearly and obviously.\n\n**IX. Growth and Long Term Strategy**\n\nProterra currently has a battery and transit factory in Industry, California and another transit facility in Greenville, South Carolina. Backlog dating to their initial January 2021 presentation will keep their factories going until early 2022. This does not take into account the multiple contracts and research partnerships they have announced since.\n\nThey currently have capacity to **produce about 680 busses per year** and are aggressively working to hire more technicians and engineers to reach this potential as soon as possible. They’re[ recruiting like crazy](https://recruiting2.ultipro.com/PRO1047PROTI/JobBoard/e33a1c2e-8d7a-4008-851e-f7bd1d7bf788/?q=&o=postedDateDesc&w=&wc=&we=&wpst=), with many positions being graveyard shifts, which reinforces their past statements of moving to a system where they’re pushing out busses 24/7.\n\nThis will allow Proterra to capture even more market share of emerging electric sectors while maintaining their dominance in the electric bus field, of which they already have **50% US market share.**\n\nSpeaking of their busses, **75% of total materials in the busses are sourced from the US**. This is significant as the Biden administration has[ just recently announced a proposal](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2021/07/28/biden-moves-increase-buy-american-requirement-75-2029/5395360001/) to raise the Buy American standard immediately from its current level of 55% to 60%, to 65% by 2024, and to 75% by 2029. The fact that Proterra is already operating at the 2029 level means that this will not affect their financials but will potentially cause disruption in other manufactures, forcing them to revise their financial forecasts.\n\n**How are they trying to Grow?**\n\nProterra, which went public just recently like Microvast, is using their current war chest of about $800 million to grow in three ways: **Research and development, Growth Capex, and Domestic Cell Capacity and co-investment**. R&D on battery tech and creating more efficient systems is easily the most important direction Proterra needs to double down on, so it's good to see them devoting significant resources (200-300m) to further developing their battery designs and energy storage devices. And as I’ve already said, developing a strong, steady, and hopefully fully in-house battery production chain will be key to bringing Proterra to the next level, an objective they seem to already acknowledge and are moving forward to.\n\nFrom this, it's helpful to view Proterra as not an electric bus company that does research to further that goal, but more of a research company that happens to build very good electric busses in order to support more research. **43% of their workforce is apprised of engineers and technicians and it shows**. This research will assist in continuing to streamline their production and build on their already lowering cost, such as how the **cost of batteries has fallen 85% since 2010**. The research has also instigated other developments that make their busses world leading in terms of technology and also in consistently[ breaking records](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/proterras-electric-bus-breaks-a-world-record-for-range).\n\nProterra is very forward thinking and is consistently looking for new ways to grow and expand. The **TAM of the electric commercial vehicle market is 260 billion** and the **charging market is 37 billion**, and Proterra so far hasn’t even come close to scratching the surface of what they can do. Construction diggers, dumptrucks, airport shuttles, forklifts, flatbeds, bucket trucks, cement mixers, mining transports and so much more are all prime targets for electrification and there just straight up isn't any other companies that are moving as aggressively as Proterra to capture this market. Leveraging their connections, reputation and capital derived from their eclectic transit bus foundation, Proterra can **outmaneuver** and **outcompete** any single competitor in a particular commercial vehicle sector through their holistic end-to-end full cycle product catalogue.\n\nAnd when I say Proterra is forward thinking, I mean really forward thinking. Back in 2017 (when most other bus makers were just beginning to shift to electric or hadn’t even made a prototype yet) Proterra initiated the [world's first autonomous bus program](https://www.masstransitmag.com/alt-mobility/autonomous-vehicles/article/21073560/autonomous-vehicle-technology-preparing-for-the-next-wave-of-innovation-in-public-transit). This tech will eventually allow them to increase safety, lower costs, and make every step of public bus transit more efficient. The fact that they are already actively working on such a revolutionary concept when most other players are still struggling to go all-electric demonstrates that Proterra not only thinks years ahead, but acts as the market leader in ebus technology\n\nAnd besides AI, Proterra also has their eye on another pretty futuristic goal, going so far as to engage in talks with the Pentagon about [​​electrifying military vehicles](https://freebeacon.com/biden-administration/proterra-founder-gets-one-on-one-interview-with-biden-pentagon-official/). Non-frontline vehicles, such as construction trucks, diggers and movers used by the Army's Corps of Engineers for domestic American infrastructure projects don’t run the risk of having to compensate for battlefield conditions and are **prime targets for electrification**. When these vehicles inevitably go electric, the fact that Proterra is already having these conversations with DoD officials puts them in a prime spot to secure future contracts. It also doesn’t hurt that Proterra has already partnered with Komatsu (who not only build construction equipment but has **years of experience building military vehicles**), its co-founder Ryan Popple is **ex-military**, AND that CEO Jack Allen formerly helmed Navistar who just so happens to **make a ton of vehicles for the military**. If any company is going to get military contracts, these guys are right up there able to compete with legacy players like Oshkosh, except Proterra actually has the required electric experience and is ready to hit the ground running.\n\nAnd of course, Proterra is also looking towards the environmental sustainability of its product down the line. This past spring, Proterra partnered with Nevada based Redwood Materials, created by **Tesla co-founder JB Straudel** to recycle its used batteries, [becoming the first publicly announced partnership between Redwood and an automaker](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/recycling-startup-redwood-materials-is-partnering-with-proterra-to-supply-ev-battery-materials-sustainably/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJzLFjFV-sVe4ZnZ_436pmkCz6pU7XtluBu607V1mJrh4rnlhtJbbnivUORpzzNYAeTn6vntRnjUdAatXHojjJRjae0WLrU7xigLai7ki40aUFuEGi5Ce2cAm361wdTyI79zueSnH2j6NC8zUd8Jyi5UMkUSfXPpUive2TMSYv5x). This not only further reinforces their Tesla connection, but also again demonstrates how Proterra is looking years down the road to ensure the wild profitability and success of their company.\n\n**X. Conclusion:**\n\nThere is a huge gap in the EV market as well as in how we are strategizing to fight climate change, and Proterra is the only company that can meet both needs simultaneously. While most attention is being paid to the potential of the consumer electric vehicle space, few are considering just how we are going to electrify all those other vehicles that make up our society. You can’t just take a battery built for a sedan and stick it into a bus or a tractor and call it a day. The process takes time, money, failures, and, yes, even more time.\n\nWhile the legacy automakers are each racing to develop their own battery tech and specific innovative technology for consumer cars, Proterra is positioning itself to leverage its almost 2 decades of battery research and powertrain experience to partner with almost every commercial vehicle sector to provide the real world tested technology they need before they even have a thought to develop it themselves. The potential of Proterra is absolutely massive and so far, few have truly realized this.\n\ntldr: Proterra has been able to leverage their position as an early pioneer in the electric transit bus market into partnering with the leading companies in each commercial vehicle sector -Thomas built school busses, Daimler stepvans, etc- to circumvent trying to outcompete legacy players and instead combine their technical, patented breakthrough technology with well established reputations to become the #1 commercial vehicle developer over the next few years. Coinciding with the release of the Infrastructure Bill, they are set to dominate this market and become a behemoth of industry with billions of dollars in revenue in only a few short years.\n\nPositions: August, September, and November 12.5 and 15 calls, as well as 300 PTRAW, and adding more every paycheck I get.

They're not legit, they're politically driven. This matters from a market perspective because it's not actually a force that would make JPOW do anything, and inflation right now is largely due to short term supply issues tied in large part to increased economic activity and reshuffling during the pandemic. A lot of the inflation actually happened in 2020 so is the definition of \"priced in.\" While actual inflation is elevated at 0.9% for the past month, that's in-line with inflation from the prior 4 months and the median is only about 0.3% above the baseline high watermark during the low inflationary period of the 2010s. While that's an increase of 50%, it's most specific sectors like auto and transportation and hospitality which are seeing situation increases due to high demand, and the actual impact to most people in most buying categories is currently low.  \n\n\nThis is important because \"inflation bad\" is an economically wrong statement as a blanket statement. Obviously, you want to restrain inflation, but the reason for inflation being bad is what really matters to the market over the term. In this case, it's not because of a collapse of the consumer market or a long-term insolvent commodities crunch, it's due to increasing demand for goods and services combined with short term supply issues, including lack of port space and other logistical problems relating to a massive increase in consumer and institutional purchasing combined with poor JIT production operations implementations... all of which will settle out once orders get back up and that's why you're seeing massive jobs growth.  \n\n\nIn other words. it's all growth, and inflation from growth is actually good because people have more money to spend. That's why we're getting sporadic freak-out red days and then green periods of massive growth... fear is outweighed by greed because people are still spending money. The fear is synthetic.

The market may have been over bought, but people pushing this story that the economy is fake are simply lying. Inflation is being caused by real demand more than money printing. Businesses are competing to get labor back by offering higher pay.\n\nThe bear case for next quarter / end of year is based on benefits falling off, the new surge in COVID cases, eviction moratorium ending and the fed tapering.\n\nIf we look at those one by one, there are massive job openings now, so there are jobs for people losing bonus unemployment benefits.\n\nThe people getting really sick from covid now, resisting vaccination, are the last people to request a lockdown. Even if there are lockdowns, businesses know how to operate in these conditions, with social distancing and PPE; the ones that don't all went under in 2020, so it's hard to imagine how there'd be a similar downturn even if cases surge again.\n\nEvictions could be a good thing.

Their valuations almost never depend on future earnings growth, so they don't grow as much, but they're less vulnerable to economic headwinds. Insurance companies that pay dividends are a good example of this. Their revenues are locked into annual policies so it's not like people can drop their car or homeowners insurance because the market is selling off. Conversely, they're not going to see big growth because how often does anybody ever go shopping for insurance?

{"title": "CLOV looks great heading into earnings next Wednesday.", "selftext": "I've both made and lost money on this stock and lord knows how many bag holders there are out of the \\~150m shares float.\n\nNow to my unironic apprehension, upon research into $CI earnings, $CLOV looks fantastic in r/R ratio here so here's a little pie for you donkeys.\n\n[50+day trend $CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/ao8s0olpzrf71.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f25ab24bd4880f91d6df7bee6068e49f553ea62)\n\nClover Health looks well poised for another strong breakout next week with earnings as a major catalyst. Extremely strong support at \\~$8. Volume has been fading hard (usually implies sellers and bagholders) - 50m 90day avg. and 15m 10day avg. Yet despite this, support has kept it even thru the red days above $8. Today, the trading volume is sitting at just under 6m with less than 2 hours left on the trading week. It's actually rising as I write this lmao.\n\nBut more than technical, my research into big dog rival in $CI - Cigna Corporation's earnings after talking to that dude in my history makes me very bullish for $CLOV next week. [They just posted earnings and beat with raised guidance, though with elevated costs.](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cigna-beats-street-1-5b-profit-for-q2)\n\n\\- Clover is well poised for earnings. Since the beatdowns of the recent past not exclusive to - Hindenburg report, Chamath snake oil salesman, market pullbacks, delta concerns, past earnings userbase growth miss etc., markets been pricing CLOV like complete dogshit. So why am I bullish?\n\n\\- Cigna Corporation, the rival big-boy boomer health insurance company, just had a positive earnings with huge growth in revenue but projected more claims costs which hit profit margins along with a slowdown of userbase growth. Why is that, in a time where the CEO says health services / biotech are booming? It's simple, boomers be losing market share to growth. \\*Bah gawd that's CLOV's MUSIC\\*\n\n\\- CLOV is constantly working to automate and expand their tech. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-130000166.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-130000166.html) boomers won't be keeping up with this company aimed at growth with millions of new subscribers.\n\n\\- CLOV CEO went and explained his case to dissolve some of the claims against the business from Hindenburg report / lawsuits a few weeks ago, caused a stock spike [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-health-ceo-speaks-out-for-first-time-on-hospital-controversies-142320948.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-health-ceo-speaks-out-for-first-time-on-hospital-controversies-142320948.html)\n\n\\- CLOV earnings are priced in to miss again, which I am not sure if that's accurate. Over the last few months of recovery and people going out, more people are going on Medicare and/or health insurance plans, including travel and all. The number of people in need of health services certainly didn't DECREASE thru COVID. America don't give a damn about COVID anymore, that's $ for business.\n\n\\- And yet, it makes me more bullish that Cigna, the household name for such health services, blamed COVID for the potential upcoming cost deficits as well as lowering guidance of user growth. I am sure they don't want to mention losing market share to competitors, a la Clover Health among others.\n\n\\- IV for CLOV is at/below 100 for the first time in a long ass time. Options are cheap and there's a lot of room for the upside.\n\n\\-  I'm expecting CLOV to beat/meet EPS estimates, but CRUSH Revenue as they continue their M&A and R&D expenses. Again, CLOV is growth. But even with the last Q, it's pretty clear they are growing despite missing initial subscriber growth estimates. They won't miss new targets. They are growing.\n\n\\- Cigna dipped 10% pre-market and since has begun to rally up, sitting at 2.5% gain today after an overall [Earnings Beat and Raised Guidance](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cigna-ci-q2-earnings-and-revenues-surpass-estimates-2021-08-05). Their guidance dropped not simply due to COVID, but competitors such as CLOV coming in to fight on the big stage, and I'm here to catch that ride.\n\n\\- I did not check short interest as I normally don't care but I assume this stock is forever shorted and with IV near all-time lows, gamma is cheap enough to pressure some degree of squeeze I imagine. Vanna is also cheap, considering IV usually rises before earnings. Likely it will all rise next week.\n\nTL;DR - CLOV looks cheap at 8 dollars and will likely have bullish guidance and growth with its' earnings report on August 11 due to factors listed above.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I don't hold a position.
