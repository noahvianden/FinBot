They are entirely mechanistic, which is the reason that so many backtest well then shit the bed when put into live trading.\n\nProgrammers try and design them to encode what we think is rational behavior for the situations which we can imagine happening, but they will execute their instructions regardless of the reality around them.\n\nThe flash crash in 2010 is a great example of this, no human would engage in that behavior, but what the algos were doing was 100% \"rational\" according to their instructions. Because they don't rationalize at all, they are mechanistic.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo be more specific and technical, being \"rational\" is the ability to dynamically assess *what* data is relevant at the current moment from *all* data which *could* be acquired. For instance, a human will almost never assign value to data about the zodiac when considering trades. However, suppose that the entire mass of autists in wsb all decided one day to base their trades on the zodiac.\n\nA human would identify very quickly that data about the zodiac has immediately become relevant, at least in part, to stock trades and option trades. Even if you didn't want to participate in their meme game, you'd know that things like volume and liquidity would be very different based on zodiac information.\n\nBut what algorithm would ever understand that? Certainly, it would identify the aberrant behavior in the trades themselves, but it would not be able to *predict* or *extrapolate* from that. Even an algorithm based on a neural network would be unable to incorporate this new data.\n\nBut humans can, because we are capable of being rational. Being rational involves being able to evaluate what information is relevant. Being *wrong* about what data is relevant is people behave irrationally, but it's only because we are attempting to be rational that we are capable of being irrational, and any system that was capable of being rational would also by definition be irrational at times due to this.\n\nThis is also why the idea of \"rational actors\" and \"rational self-interest\" are libertarian capitalist fantasy. Everyone and everything capable of being a rational actor and having rational self-interest will act irrationally, because they will misidentify the relevant information to their actions and self-interest at least some of the time.\n\nUs programmers don't create rational programs, we create *consistent* programs. Humans, because we are rational and thus capable of irrationality, often misidentify consistency for rationality, when in fact *rational* behavior is to continuously change and adapt as new experiences are had and new information is encountered.\n\nAlgos are more *predictable* than humans, they are not more rational.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Who made the algos?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Does a product from a person represent their whole character", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Does it contain their biases?", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Another algo?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Do you even understand algorithmic trading?

Like u/Tablspn said, The US is huge in population and geography (the size of all of Europe combined plus some). We're also a melting pot of a ton of different cultures, races, & ideologies. You can find people in the middle and on the extremes of pretty much every subject. The people on the extremes tend to be much louder than the people in the middle, but the people towards the middle usually represent a majority of the population. Winning politically on most issues typically means getting the people in the middle to take a small step in one direction or the other.\n2. Due to our democratic system, pretty much anything and everything can be and will be used for political gain or as a political weapon. Unions are no different. Public and Private labor unions represent 14 million workers in the US (about 10% of the workforce) and their families. This makes unions extremely powerful politically (again, try to get a big chunk of people to take one step or two in your political direction to win) and politicians pay a lot of attention to them. What you saw today with the press conference is a great example. Biden brought in the big 3 union automakers to send the message \"I support union workers and union automakers, your unions support me so you should support me\". The other part of it is getting these 3 manufacturers to stand up there as kind of a \"promise\" to support the presidents plan for sustainability. The reality of the 2030 timeframe is simple. The goal is well beyond Bidens future political career, so he can take credit for the great plan and bears no consequences for the results. Leaving Tesla out sends his Pro-Union message to 14 million workers and only pisses off a smaller number of Tesla fans (a net positive for him).\n\nThe reason people are pro-union or anti-union is typically a simple matter of personal circumstance. Unions aren't inherently good or bad, like anything else. Any large group has both the power to stop people from being exploited and the power to exploit others outside their group. Whether they use the power for good or bad or some percentage of both is all dependent on the will of the group. Over time some people have had their lives bettered by unions and some people have been hurt by them. If your life or your parents lives or grandparents lives have been made better by them, you're probably pro-union. If your family has been hurt by them you're probably anti-union. Everyone else is somewhere in the middle. As far as employees well-being, on the surface that is the mission of the union. But as i said above, any large group can be good or bad or some of both. While employees well being is a goal, ultimately the #1 goal of the union is to do whatever is good for the union itself first, perhaps what is good for individual members second.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the thorough reply!

So I have 24 titanium plates holding it all together. My parents paid for my orthodontics and the operation itself to be done privately. It was 8 hours long, and I had that operation with no nerve damage whatsoever. Then 1 of the plates began to show through my gum on my upper right in 2012. I had several consultations where they decided to remove it on our national health service. I never once met the operating surgeon even though I kept asking to. They kinda treated it like it was an everyday operation, and said I'd be bruised, have stitches etc, and didn't once mention nerve damage. I woke up in agony and my face felt numb. I asked if they had injected novocaine (which they had), but the surgeon said \"you may have some permanent nerve damage there\". It turns out they have damaged the middle branch of my trigeminal nerve, which causes it to misfire akin to trigeminal neuralgia.
