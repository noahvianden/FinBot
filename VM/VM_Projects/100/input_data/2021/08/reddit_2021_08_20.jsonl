All figures provided are purely for the sake of comparison.\n\n---\n\nThe mean return of the S&P from 1928 to 2020 is 7.78% without DRIP, and 11.89% with DRIP.\n\nHowever, factored into the mean are:\n\n2008 housing crisis crash (-38.49%/-37%)\n\n2002 dotcom/September 11th crash (-23.37%/-22.1%)\n\n2000 dotcom crash (-10.14%/-9.1% in 2000 and -13.04%/-11.89% in 2001)\n\n1973 fuel crisis crash (-17.37%/-14.66% in 1973 and -29.72%/-26.47% in 1974)\n\n1946-1948 postwar bear market (-11.87%/-8.07%, 0%/+5.71%, and -.64%/+5.5%, respectively)\n\n1939-1941 early war bear market (-5.45%/-0.41%, -15.29%/--9.78%, -17.86%/-11.59% respectively)\n\n1937 recession (-38.59%/-35.03%)\n\n1929-1932 Great Crash (-11.91%/-8.42%, -28.48%/-24.9%, -47.07%/-43.34%, -15.15%/-8.19% respectively).\n\n\nAs well as the 14 other years in which there was a bear market, correction, or returns were slightly negative or flat, for a total of 31 years of negative-or-no returns over the last 93 (i.e. 1 in 3).\n\nThis means there needs to exist sufficiently high returns in order to offset these numbers and still arrive at the 7.78%/11.89% mean.\n\n---\n\nWhen looking at averages, it's often better to look at the median - the middlemost number in a set - as it isn't getting skewed by outliers.\n\nWith every negative year in consideration, the median return comes out to 10.79% without DRIP and 14.31% with.\n\nHowever, if we only look at years with positive return, the median is 16.87% without drip and 20.05% with.\n\nThis means, since the median is the number in the middle, that half of all years have returns higher than these medians.\n\n---\n\nLet's look at the year that follows each crash:\n\n1933: 46.59%/53.99%\n\n1938: 25.21%/31.12%\n\n1975: 31.55%/37.2%\n\n1989: 27.25%/31.69%\n\n2003: 26.38%/28.68%\n\n2009: 23.45%/26.46%\n\nEvery single year after a year in which there was a crash has had a return substantially greater than the median *positive* return.\n\n---\n\nAt the beginning of this year, the S&P 500 was at 3700.65. Yesterday, August 19 2021, it was 4405.8, a 19.055% YTD return before DRIP.\n\nThis means, SPX has returned approximately 2.12%, non-compounded, per month. If it were to continue at exactly the same rate, it would close the year with a return of 25.41% before DRIP.\n\nIf this were to be the case, it would be the 20th highest pre-DRIP return over the last 93 years - barely in the top twenty percent - and still lower than all but one other post-crash year (that year itself being the start of the current bull run).\n\n---\n\nLast year's returns, from January 1 to December 31, were 16.26%/18.4%. While there was vigorous recovery from the covid crash - from a low of 2304.92 to 3756.07 EOY, an increase of nearly 63% - it is worth noting that other crashes have been precipitated by some sort of major economic crisis; energy, housing, etc. The most comparable crash to last year's, to my mind, is Black Monday 1987, which is [believed to have been caused at least in part by a computer error](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042115/what-caused-black-monday-stock-market-crash-1987.asp#:~:text=The%20%22Black%20Monday%22%20stock%20market,as%20well%20as%20investor%20panic.), and also recovered relatively quickly.\n\n---\n\nThe bull run we've been in since 2009 is not even the longest in history. From 1982 to 1999, or even 1994 if we want to avoid anything that could be reasonably described as part of the dotcom bubble, only two years - 1990 and 1994 - were negative or flat, at -6.56%/-3.1% and -1.54%/+1.32% respectively.\n\nCompare to the current bull run, in which three years have been negative or flat: 2011 at 0.00%/+2.11%, 2015 at -0.73%/+1.38%, and 2018 at -6.24%/-4.38%.\n\nLet's compare mean returns:\n\n1982-1994: 11.21%/15.44%\n\n1982-1999: 15.41%/19.12%\n\n2009-2020: 13.15%/15.53%\n\nAnd median returns:\n\n1982-1994: 12.40%/16.61%\n\n1982-1999: 16.02%/21.295%\n\n2009-2020: 13.10%/15.53%\n\nAn overall comparable performance in which the respective positive median isn't even always outperformed.\n\n---\n\nOf the top 10 years of S&P returns, only one year in the current bull run- 2013 - is in the top ten, and only three other years - 1975, 1995, and 1997 - have occurred in the last 60 years, the next most recent being 1958.\n\nThe top 5 returns by year are:\n\n1933:\t46.59%/53.99%\n\n1954:\t45.02%/52.62%\n\n1935:\t41.37%/47.67%\n\n1928:       37.88%/43.61%\n\n1958:\t38.06%/43.36%\n\nEven the lowest of which is substantially higher than the highest years (2013 and 2019) in the last 10.\n\nWhile average p/e is perhaps higher than in periods before, this is probably reflective of a shift from value into growth due to the rapid rate at which technology is improving.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**:\n\nWe live in relatively unprecedented times: technology has never advanced so quickly, people have never lived so long, the world population has never been so high, economies have never been so globalized, and emerging markets are becoming more developed. **It makes sense that we're in a period of robust expansion.** \n\nThis is not to say this bull run can't or won't ever end, or that there won't even be hiccups, but good years aren't a bad thing, they aren't necessarily a portent of bad times to come, and the last couple of years haven't even been *extraordinarily* good (thus far), at least if we're working based off of historical returns.", "id": "p85y6w", "created_utc": 1629468547.0, "score": 419, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "Good post, love the analysis.

Thanks.\n\nI'd just like to mention that something which is quite different from history is the unprecedented amount of monetary and fiscal support being pumped into the economy, since 2009 especially but to a lighter degree even before.  This is certainly an experiment, and a minority (although not necessarily fringe) of economists believe that we may in fact be \"due\" for a correction \n\nEconomist and central banker William White talks about it here: [Ultra-Easy Monetary Policy and the Law of Unintended Consequences](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjEuPDZusDyAhVwRUEAHYqFBogQFnoECAMQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2RnvpT2PuFVPBdG3wJHi-C)\n\nI'd also like to note that many of the same things you're saying \"this time is different\", \"good years are good\", etc. are typical before every collapse, first and foremost the Global Financial Crisis which was the worst in human history.\n\nWhat does that mean for us investors?  Well, it probably doesn't mean you should pull out entirely and try to time the market.  That's because you can't reliably predict when a crisis will happen, and as your analysis shows, the numbers themselves don't really tell the story (although other warning signs might).  Also, you'd be foolish to miss out on the gains while you're waiting.\n\nThat said, I do believe it's always wise to be prudent. The attitude of \"good years are good\" lends itself to excessive risk taking and an underappreciation of the underlying complexity and uncertainties of the stock market and economy. This is exactly what we saw in 2008, and a lot of people got burned. Fortunately for us stock investors, however, the Fed managed to get things back under control and pumping.  Even so, William White mentions (and provides data) that with time monetary policy becomes increasingly less and less effective with increasing possibility of the occurrence of unnintended consequences. \n\nIn summary, then, despite what your analysis shows, while it is most prudent to stay in the market, it is never prudent to be caught with your pants down.

Then if you take the geometric mean of n of these values, that'll be the nth root of their product.  Call that `c`.  Then `cⁿ` will give you the overall scale through the whole interval, as `cⁿ` is back to being the product of the individual input scales.  `c` is also a representative scale factor for any year in the input domain: n years with a scale of `c` would wind up with the exact same overall scaling as the input data.\n\nI'm not sure what you would be able to do with an arithmetic mean of growth rates, or of scale factors, so I wouldn't expect it to be a value that someone computes.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Could that be simplified at all?

It does expand on it, which might make it make more sense by making the various steps clearer.\n\nYou shouldn't have any numbers below zero for a calculation that makes sense (to me) here; that would mean that the S&P went from positive value to negative value one year.  Not negative _growth_ but where the investment is actually worth less than nothing … which didn't happen.  What makes sense is geometric mean of the scale factors, not of the growth percentages.\n\nI can give an example … you've been talking about annual growth rates, so suppose we have 5 years: +15%, +10%, -30%, +25%, +12%.  Obviously completely made up for the example.\n\nThen the scale factors would be 1.15, 1.1, 0.7, 1.25, 1.12.  Adding 15% is equivalent to multiplying by 1.15, and so on.\n\nThe scale factor over the whole five-year period would be 1.15\\*1.1\\*0.7\\*1.25\\*1.12=1.2397.  So $100 put into the fund at the start, left there for 5 years, would be worth $123.97 at the end.  Same as if we put in $100, added 15%, added 10%, lost 30%, added 25%, added 12%.\n\nThe geometric mean `c` of the scales would be the fifth root of the 5 values, or 1.0439106.  Another way of saying that is `c⁵`=1.2397, which we can recognize as the five-year scale factor.  So in this example, the representative annual scale factor is 1.0439106, so the representative annual growth is +4.39106%.  A scale factor of 1.0439106 for 5 years in a row gives you the same end state ($100→$123.97) as the varying sequence above, so it can be used to summarize the effect of a year in the sequence.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the growth rates would be their sum divided by 5, or 6.4%, and the arithmetic mean of their scale factors would naturally be 1.064 … but I don't know of a calculation that could be used in.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Gotcha, thank you for taking the time to explain it to me.

A clear path to superhuman FSD solved within this year.\n\nVisualizations are a solved problem as evidenced by the point clouds and simulation reconstruction of reality. The graph of autolabelling vs human labelers shows a complete replacement of labelling by humans with the autolabeller in a short span. Any risk I had regarding Tesla’s ability to scale labelling was cleared.\n\nThe time based memory showed that temporary occlusions were a non issue, which I was skeptical about before. However, I didn’t anticipate spatial memory, which alleviates concerns about long term memory. Meaning, if a Tesla is waiting at a stop light for minutes, and other cars are blocking the view for a long time, spatial memory means the Tesla can remember its local environment for a long time.\n\nPath planning shows Tesla can produce 2500+ different simulations of reality in any given moment. I was not aware how far they had gone with estimating other car trajectories. Tesla can project 10 seconds into the future for every projectile that is relevant. To be clear, this is still not solved because there may still be local maximums and 2500 different paths may not be enough. However, the strategy is clear.\n\nThe key risk which I am still aware of is Tesla running out of compute. They already have to use their scheduler to schedule different components at different times. What if, for example, the oncoming car swerves in the way, but the scheduler isn’t running new path trajectories. Instead, it’s running street light detection. If the scheduler doesn’t switch frequently enough, then the planner may not react in time. I need to see the frequency if switching. This may be a limiting factor which still carries some risk.\n\n2. Demonstration of the challenges with other self driving methods showing this will not be a race to the bottom.\n\nLidar is doomed. Lidar provides point clouds, but it cannot get color information from objects, which is very important for understanding what objects are. If Lidar companies could accurately project color onto their point clouds, that would mean they wouldn’t need the lidar to begin with! This means that Lidar-based self driving companies are likely using heuristics / imperfect color mapping onto objects.\n\n3. Tesla can sell actually create even better HD maps than Google!\n\nLidar based HD maps cannot provide color encoding. However, Tesla’s simulation shows they can entirely map reality into simulation! This can provide even better street view than Google offers and only requires a single drive by of the area by a single car. Tesla’s fleet of millions of vehicles could map almost the entire US in a VERY short time if they wanted. Tesla Street View!\n\n4. The world’s most powerful ML computer and preparing this for external customers.\n\nTesla is using a custom ISA. This is like the programming language specific to hardware. This means that even all specs equal, even if Google’s TPU can match Dojo spec wise, Tesla’s hardware programming language is likely even far more optimized for machine learning.\n\nAs a caveat, it will likely be very tuned for video based machine learning. Furthermore, their computers can only serve a subset of cloud customers who want to train AI. However, costs are a large limiting factor for AI work, and rapidly lowered costs will be able to expand the TAM of AI based customers massively. This is Tesla’s AWS moment.\n\n5. The robot is cool, although I reserve excitement until I see it proven.\n\nTheoretically, the Total Addressable Market of the robot could raise the global market cap by 10s of trillions.

If you look at most of their financial models (even the ones who have price targets above the current stock price) they maybe have Tesla growing anywhere from 5-20% p/a on average the next 5 years. \n\nYou also have to remember that most of the analysts who follow Tesla are Auto analysis. A lot of them still view Tesla through the lens of an 'automaker', rather than a battery + technology company that makes cars. This influences a lot of their models as they are trying to value them like Ford or GM. \n\nIf you think about the valuation of Tesla:\n\n* Forward P/E: \\~144.\n* Market cap: $673.47B.\n* This implies a \\~$4.7B net income for the next 12 months. \n\nTesla made $1.142B of net income in Q2. So Wall Street is projects no income growth for 12 months. \n\nIf we assume the market P/E is 20x, Tesla would need to grow their income 7x their forward 12 month earnings. At a growth rate of 50% in net income, it would take \\~5 years for Tesla to have a P/E of 20x, and that is with no stock price increase. For a point of detail, Tesla grew their net income about 11x in 2021Q2 compared to 2020Q2. It was from a low base, but it shows you how quickly these things can change when you have operating leverage. \n\nNow, a P/E of 20x is much too low for Tesla considering how fast they are growing. This is the real question that that market is trying to work out. How fast will Tesla grow and how sustainable are their profits. If Tesla continues to deliver 50%+ revenue growth (and probably faster profit growth) there is no way they will have a 20 P/E. Nvidia is growing net income \\~30% consistently and they have a P/E of \\~80x. \n\nSo if we assume Tesla grows like Nvidia, we need \\~2.2 years before Tesla has a Forward P.E of 80x. \n\nTesla is likely to grow faster than Nvidia and so what is a fair P/E? What if Tesla grows net income 50% on average for the next 5 years? A fair P/E might then be 120x. That means that Tesla is 3-6 months away from reaching a P/E of 120x. Once a company reaches their 'fair' P/E for the growth rate they have, if the growth runway continues, their stock will appreciate by the increase in net income. In effect, investors do not believe a company can continue to repeat high growth indefinitely and so reduce the growth in say years 5-20. If the company gets there are demonstrates continued growth, it will have strong price appreciation. \n\nI think what we are seeing is that Tesla is effectively slowly eating into its P/E ratio because the market does not think Tesla can continue to grow as fast as the last 10 years in the next 10 years. We have a contracting P/E ratio (because of expectations of slower future growth) and an increase in demonstrated profits. What happens when Tesla continues to exceed growth expectations, you have both an increase in profits and an increase in P/E. These effects compound each other.\n\nIt all comes down to your expectations of future growth.

That is then fed back into the training simulation as a fully parsed accurate environment to train the NN to more accurately recognize the intersection the next time it drives through.  \n\nEdit://. AND the reason why a competitor company isn’t going to be able to scale HD mapping, is that for them to map the same intersection, they need to drive through it from every direction, with no other traffic that can occlude important data.   That is an absolutely impossible task for a city, let alone the country.  \n\nAnd the hidden take away from that is, let’s say Tesla is unsuccessful at a novel non-HD NN approach to driving.

I do believe in the long haul.", "score": 89, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think we all wonder where the bottom is for $WISH. I’ve tried to compare past performance history and more DD, here are my findings:\n\n1) For Q1 earnings, the stock fell $3.95 to the bottom; this was 34% lower than the close price on the day of earnings.  For Q2 earnings, the stock has fallen $3.27 to the bottom; this is 35% lower than the close price on the day of earnings. The downside is that the price drop is lower than the fall after Q1, but the upside may mean that the stock doesn’t have much more to fall.\n\n2) On the daily chart, the stock is significantly oversold; same on all the other charts. Yesterday, the Bollinger Bands got pretty tight on the 2 hour chart and the stock broke down (partially in conjunction with a down market day). Now the stock is below VWAP - with a low RSI - indicating a bounce may be coming very soon (Friday or Monday would be my guess). The last similar downward trend on the 2hr chart was about five days long - over the next 2 days the stock jumped $1.87. \n\n3) It is wild to me that company’s current market value is very close to their annual revenue and cash holdings; that alone seems reason to expect upside from these levels. \n\n4) Potential is there for the stock to run again due to popularity - volume remains solid. Social media sentiment is still high. Could happen randomly any day.\n\n5) Biggest likely upcoming catalyst this quarter is the announcement of a new CFO; other possibilities include new partnerships, new Wish products / services, and an unexpected sale or merger of the company (I think that is probably unlikely)\n\n6) Largest concerns / headwinds include the same as before: improve products, experience, shipping; reduce expenses, grow user base and drive higher revenues from that user base. There are “market experts” on both the bull and bear side claiming that stocks will keep going up or come crashing down soon; nobody really knows what the rest of August and September will bring and it is easy to get emotional when money is involved - but at this current price level - the stock is less than 19% of the 52w high. \n\n7) The key for bulls will be support - tough to say where it is past $6.14 - but $6.00 would be a key psychological level to stay above. If the stock fell exactly $3.95 to the bottom like it did after the Q1 earnings - support would be at $5.51. It is s kind of hard to fathom it falling deep into the $5’s - and especially the $4’s as I would correlate such a move as meaning that Wish’s Q2 results and future forecast make the company worth half of what it was at market close on earnings for Q2. That seems a little much. The earnings report and presentation were not great - but they also weren’t wildly different from expectations going into the call. Wish is a growth company that always planned on 2023 being the year where everything comes together; it could be that the low expectations they set during Q+A will naturally allow for a real Q3 earnings pump with a results surprise, but time will tell on that front. \n\nEither way, there are a lot of trash talkers for $WISH but a case can be made here for swing traders and long investors; bears have to pretty confident / risky to play much further on the downside. Today - the call / put ratio for options for the next 3 expirations were 81% calls and 19% puts - indicating a general sentiment that higher stock prices should be coming. The key for tomorrow will be finding support at $6.14 and then $6.00 if that fails. Potential resistance (based on this week) appeared to be at $6.41, $6.80s, and $7.31. If $WISH can close tomorrow at the $6.50s level - that would allow a new test at the $7s for early next week. If the stock goes into the $5’s tomorrow, all is not lost - that could be the catalyst to start a stronger reversal / push upwards and key support may materialize at $5.83. If tomorrow runs hot and is a strong green day - $7’s are possible - my biggest question will be where the stock ends up for premarket. On the earnings drop, it opened at $6.79, fell to $6.69 and ran to $7.85. If the stock did something similar tomorrow - we could expect seeing low $6 open and $7.10 to $7.20 for a high.\n\nAll-in-all, those who are more conservative may want to wait until Monday to see what happens on the stock before investing; those who are bigger risk-takers could buy between $6.00 and $6.25 to try and catch a wave tomorrow. Asian markets are red - but they have underperformed US market all year; futures for US are minimally red as of 1am EST. \n\nI like the short-term swing and long-term investment potential still. No stock is without risk, but it didn’t take something like Zynga long to drop after earnings (to $7.73) and stabilize to closing at $8.37 10 trading days later. Wish is a bit more volatile and tomorrow will be day 6 after earnings. I don’t expect the same path as Q1 - where it hit roughly 2.25x the bottom in one day 18 trading days after earnings, but if the stock hasn’t already found the bottom - I think it is logical that it is only a matter of days.

Amazon had an earnings\\* (earnings is net income, not revenue) beat, reporting 15.12 per share vs consensus of 12.22... a surprise of +23.7% vs the street.

They've reached this wall where they've saturated the market with their current app and they won't grow any further.\n\nI say it's point 1. If you plot the revenue and plot the covid deaths on the same time axis, the covid effects are visually obvious. Q2 last year was supposed to be lower than Q1, instead it was about double where it should be. Being 40% down from that isn't too bad and still represents +30% growth per year from 2019.\n\nAmazon didn't have any such crazy surge in revenue in Q2 2020, I don't think it's a fair comparison.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Amazon didn't have any such crazy surge in revenue in Q2 2020, I don't think it's a fair comparison.\n\nOk, a few things. One, the 25% growth figure for AMZN Q2 2021 I provided was wrong, they grew online stores sales by 16%, which is still growth vs WISH's massive decline in their core marketplace.  Two, I never wrote WISH hit a wall  and saturated their market and in fact I believe there is a huge market of the type of customer they wish to bring online to their app.  I did write \"they suffered a lot in large part because of their business model, data science algorithms, and product selection\" which includes your 1. reason for the revenue drop. Three, your statement \"Q2 last year was supposed to be lower than Q1, instead it was about double where it should be\" makes no sense because there were no estimates on Q2 2020 because WISH was not a public company until December 16, 2020 (Q4) and thus had 0 analyst coverage for Q2 2020. If you did your DD, you would have seen in the prospectus for the IPO that Q2 2020 Revenue in core marketplace grew  67% (which is not almost double) y/y. Four, your statement \"Amazon didn't have any such crazy surge in revenue in Q2 2020\" also doesn't make sense. Amazon's online sales growth for Q2 2020 was 48% y/y or 49% excluding forex (this excludes subscription services, third party seller services, aws, physical store sales). That is massive and impressive considering how large Amazon is, and Amazon continued with those high growth rates for the next few quarters. by comparison, Q3 2020 WISH core marketplace rev grew 17% y/y vs the Q2 2020 67% y/y growth figure; Q3 2020 AMZN online sales grew 37% y/y... Q4 2020 grew 43% y/y... Q1 2021 grew 41% y/y.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Points 1 and 2 are fair enough. \n\n>Three, your statement \"Q2 last year was supposed to be lower than Q1, instead it was about double where it should be\" makes no sense because there were no estimates on Q2 2020 because WISH was not a public company until December 16, 2020 (Q4) and thus had 0 analyst coverage for Q2 2020.\n\nQ1 2021 Earnings Call, the CFO says: \"And if you look at our '18 and '19 quarters, you will see similar seasonality this year.

I didn't say that it had to be just the core marketplace revenue. Now I agree if you think I should be looking at core marketplace revenue instead of total revenue, unfortunately I didn't check on that to make that post, I just looked at the top line when checking my facts to save time and  because I knew revenue was too high. +67% is too high anyway.\n\nOn point 4 I'll concede partly, though I'm still right in that the surge is lower, so the hangover for wish is going to be bigger. Furthermore, Amazon doesn't have the advertising apocalypse to contend with in their business model. Amazon is not a fair comparison. \n\nFrom your other post: \n\n>WISH suffered a lot in large part because of their business model, data science algorithms, and product selection\n\nI agree on the first and last parts, they depend a lot on advertising for the current business model, and the advertising market has gone down the tube due to iOS update. I think the algorithms are really good, because they got that shitty app to such a scale with it.\n\nI think that the effects of advertising and of covid are temporary, and WISH has such a large cash pile they can ride this out and once the apps improved go back to growth in this niche, that no one has filled yet.

A “blockbuster” classification is viewed by investors as a growth opportunity for the company. As such, the market responds strongly by increasing that company’s stock price. There is also a favorable correlation between a Priority Review Drug classification and increases to a company’s stock price. However, as expected, a Priority Review Drug approval’s impact on stock price is not as strong as that of the blockbuster drug. Lastly, there was no observable correlation between a FDA approval of a Standard Review Drug classification and the companies’ stock price. The market exhibited neither a positive or negative stock price reaction to those “lesser drugs”. These results support the conclusion that FDA approval does indeed affect a pharmaceutical company’s stock price. The differentiating criterion is the classification level of the new drug, and how investors and the market in general perceive the value each respective approval to the recipient company. Drugs representing more significant advancement over existing therapies cause larger”\n\n\nhttp://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/182804.pdf", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is the COVID vaccine we’re talking about, it is not just an ordinary thing", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Nice calls then puts short term.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "PFE could come out with a cure for cancer and they’d only shoot up to $50", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Can you explain what that means?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I think it will go parabolic like MRNA then slowly chill the fuck down to slightly higher than what it is now.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is a large company.
