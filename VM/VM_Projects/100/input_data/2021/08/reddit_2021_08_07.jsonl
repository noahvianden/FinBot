{"title": "Charting the Jobs number: Almost a quarter were government jobs", "selftext": " This article first appeared on SchiffGold.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe BLS provides an employment picture of the US on the first Friday of every month. It estimates how many jobs were added or subtracted by sector. While some of the assumptions may be controversial (e.g. [the birth death model](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbd.htm)) and job numbers are prone to revisions, it remains the most widely anticipated statistic each month by the financial markets. Inflation is now coming in at a close second.\n\nConsidering its popularity, the job numbers are heavily analyzed by many sources. This article tries to use visuals and historical data to provide greater insight and perspective.\n\nRecent Trends\n\nThe latest jobs number showed an increase of 943k jobs, above expectations by 100k. Unfortunately, 240k gains came from government employment which are non-productive jobs and weigh on the economy. As shown below, 943k is above the recent trend, and the largest monthly gain since August 2020. Leisure and Hospitality continue to show the biggest gains, which is not surprising considering the massive layoffs they saw early in the pandemic and that unemployment benefits have recently been removed in some states. The unemployment rate ticked down from 5.9% to 5.4%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 1: Change by sector](https://preview.redd.it/l0qgvuf7vxf71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddb73671f483c02e3694b8e4d2ceaacfc935b8f6)\n\n \n\nThis next chart compares the current month with the trailing 12 month average. A few key takeaways:\n\n* Government was well above average. 240k added vs -2k avg\n* Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Health nearly doubled the TTM average\n* Construction, Professional Business, and Trade/Transport/Utilities were all below TTM average\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 2: Current vs TTM](https://preview.redd.it/5qgkztc9vxf71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e5460384532f457c80fbe3e7272ac776c494561)\n\n \n\nThe table below gives a much more detailed breakdown of the numbers and the entire labor force. Some key takeaways:\n\n* Government job increases were dominated by local governments (+230k) vs 18k in Federal and -8k at the State level\n* Leisure and Hospitality have seen the biggest 12 month rebound, averaging 196k a month. This has accelerated in recent months to 364k likely a result of expiring unemployment benefits as stated above.  \n\n   * Even with these gains, it is still down 7.7% from where it was 3 years ago\n* Mining and Logging is still down 14.6% but the recent recovery has doubled from 3.7k TTM vs 6k in the current period.\n* Trade, Transportation, and Utilities is the largest sector (27k) but growth in jobs slowed in the recent period to 47k down from a TTM avg of 97k\n* In aggregate the job market is still 1.5% smaller than it was 3 years ago\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 3: Labor Market Detail](https://preview.redd.it/vyh2bi3bvxf71.png?width=2895&format=png&auto=webp&s=71720ab4b68996af92184a32d9bf10f792e6560f)\n\n REVISIONS\n\nAs mentioned, this data is subject to revisions as new data becomes available. While the headline release gets a ton of market attention, the revisions get far less. The table below shows the impact of the revisions over different time periods. Please note this is as of the prior month since the most recent month has not seen any revisions. Important items to note:\n\n* The recent three month period has been revised up by 48.7k a month\n* The biggest upward revisions were seen in Leisure/Hospitality and Trade/Transportation\n* Over the last year, revisions have been positive of nearly 40k a month or about 500k in aggregate\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure: 4 Revisions ](https://preview.redd.it/666vu0zevxf71.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=337e43cc744c312e389ed75e8b2df3648591ad3e)\n\n**Historical Perspective**\n\nThe chart below shows data going back to 1955. As the labor force has grown in total aggregate numbers, the recessions along the way have caused dips in the general trend. The Covid recession can be seen as the greatest job market loss since 1955. The chart also shows how much work the labor market still requires to regain the employment level seen prior to Covid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 5: Historical Labor Market](https://preview.redd.it/j67frizqvxf71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=27b3c3d771fd476182a4a02435b78fa00ebde0ed)\n\n The distribution of the workforce has changes significantly over the last 65+ years. Although the unemployment rate has been sharply falling over the last year (chart above), the labor force participation (61.7%) is still well below 18 months ago (63.2%) and much lower than the 66% pre financial crisis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 6: Labor Market Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/z8w78aqsvxf71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dbacffe28d36080d9ede10fa9465917528113e6)\n\n \n\nThe stock market is hyper focused on the labor market because the Fed uses the data as one of its primary drivers for monetary policy. Although jobs data is seen as a lagging indicator, a strong labor market would more likely result in a tighter Fed. Weak job numbers allow the Fed to be more accommodating in monetary policy.

{"title": "How to use the $1T US Senate Infrastructure Bill to Place Bets this Fall and Get Rich w/ America", "selftext": "Sup Retards\n\nI am here representing the high-functioning half of RetardedHedgeFund LLC. I founded RetardedHedgeFund with my brother way back in 2021, when, one day, my brother came to me asking for help laundering $17 that he stole from some teenage boys. As has unfortunately happened many times before, my brother took the money after beating a group of boys senseless because they had made fun of his doll collection. Now, despite what some people around here seem to think about hedge fund managers, I am not one to typically take part in financial crimes such as money laundering, but the last time my brother had stolen money in this way, the State Police came to our door and demanded he return the cash. For whatever reason, the fact that the police asked for the money to be returned, ticked my brother off. He started kicking and screaming and punching police officers, until he wound up in the psychward and I was left with a rather large hospital bill. So there I was, stuck between my brother's insurmountable anger management issues, the State Police,  and the fact that teenage boys will never stop making fun of a grown man who sits on a public street in his underpants playing with dolls, especially when that man is well known for being a violent adversary to teenage boys. I digress.\n\nIn that moment, I thought the best way to avoid a similar confrontation with the police, would be to “launder” my brother’s $17 using a broker app and one of the fine stocks found in the Wallstreetbets portfolio. After helping my brother scour the first class market data available on WSB, we decided to go all in on AMC. As one might expect, in nearly an instant our $17 grew to over $1000. I told my brother we were selling, to which he started yelling “buy and hold” while punching me in protest, and then snatched the phone from my hand. For better or worse, during the scuffle, my brother fat-fingered Robin Hood and sold our call option right when AMC hit $69 and we were left with $1123 USD in our broker account. My brother wanted to put the money immediately back in AMC, but I slyly convinced him it would be better to reinvest after it was confirmed that resistance at $420.69 had been broken. That’s when we decided to take our $1123 and found our family-owned hedge fund, RetardedHedgeFund LLC.\n\nWith our freshly minted LLC, my brother wanted our first buy to be the cheapest GME calls available, and as many as we could get. However, I managed to convince him that since we were now officially big time Wallstreetbets players with our own hedge fund, we should take a look at the more mature memestocks of mememania round two. Eventually, we wound up 40% down on CLNE, which is why we are here on a Saturday morning reading a yet-to-be passed 2700 page US Senate [Infrastructure Bill](https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/e/a/ea1eb2e4-56bd-45f1-a260-9d6ee951bc96/F8A7C77D69BE09151F210EB4DFE872CD.edw21a09.pd), praying we find someway out of this god forsaken play.\n\nIn all sincerity, from what I’ve read thus far, I’ve found the bill quite compelling, especially in terms placing bets this autumn. I haven’t read a federal bill since I briefly taught Social Studies in what the US President had recently deemed an “urban disaster,” and a “complete shithole.” Luckily, none of my students could read, so they never found out that I can’t read either. My brother on the other hand, with his severe cognitive disability and far-below average IQ, is actually well-suited for the craft of US Law, and he has helped me sift through the gargantuan pdf to pull out a section that gave us enough hope to keep holding CLNE.\n\nI know that a lot of you reading this will have an adverse reaction to the mentioning of CLNE, and probably think I should cut my loses and load up on 0dte spy options or juicy AMC calls at the 140 strike, but that’s not what this is about. This post, which will be getting progressively less shitpost-y (unless you think the Infrastructure Bill is a shitpost), is about the $1T Infrastructure Bill presently being amended in the Senate and likely to, in some form, become law by September. There is a seemingly endless amount of provisions within this bill that could lend themselves to both bull and bear theses for the coming months. For instance, I considered posting about another play I am researching, Lithium Americas Corp (LAC). Everyone knows there’s some stuff in this bill about lithium mining, but it also has a surprising amount of legislating about Native Americans and “Indian Land” management. It so happens that a section of North America’s largest lithium deposit is also the site of an exceptionally haunting Native American massacre and Indian burial ground known as *Dead Moon,* which has presently entangled LAC in a lawsuit with local tribes and stopped them from breaking ground at Thacker Pass. I will probably dig through the bill for LAC related content after my brother goes to adult summer camp, but for now, much like teenage boys and the State Police, my brother has a seemingly irrational hatred for indigenous peoples, and so he insisted we research CLNE and not LAC.\n\nI’m not trying to convince anyone here to invest in CLNE—in fact the last thing I want is Wallstreetbets gangingbanging CLNE again. You (we) people brought the worst kind of attention to this stock, and instead of gliding gently up to $20 all summer like I originally imagined, the CEO Andrew Littlefair has been issuing shares and shaking us all down, and, even worse, after he hyped up the meme rally on CNBC last June. This sub got the PnD vibes all up on this pile of manure.\n\n**Infrastructure Bill** **& CLNE DD**\n\nFor those of you who know nothing other about CLNE other than cow fart emojis, *“Clean Energy Fuels provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions, primarily in the United States and Canada. It supplies RNG, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, the company offers operation and maintenance services for public and private vehicle fleet customer stations.*” They take methane from a biomass (cow farts) and turn into a gas that powers engines comparable to diesel, and they also are getting into hydrogen for fuel cells for private vehicles, buses, trucks, airplanes, spaceships, submarines, carbon neutral dollhouse electric generators, etc. A big part of it is a carbon emissions play, and since CLNE is expanding their infrastructure as fast as anyone in the field, the Infrastructure Bill has everything to do with them.\n\nI don’t know what other retard’s High School environmental science class experience was like, but I had this hippie, kind-of dyke-y but in way that was subtly hot, teacher tell me that California would be on fire by 2025 and Florida would be sinking if we didn’t do things like turn cow farts into fuel for Amazon trucks. That teacher was eventually fired after she was found in a locked room with my brother while he was wearing only his underpants, but the cow farts thing stuck with me.  This 10th grade level understanding of environmental science was the reason I originally bought into CLNE – that coupled with the fact that a lot of federal politicians today look and sound like my high school science teacher did back then, and more and more politicians of all stripes are coming around to the idea of at least cashing in on greenwashing. Greenwashing trending upwards with potential federal financial support is good for CLNE.\n\nOverall the bill looks incredibly bullish for CLNE. It appears bi-partisan support has grown for RNG, carbon emissions reduction, methane capture, fuel production from feedstock and biomass, and hydrogen fuel cells. There is massive amounts of money being boasted in this bill going to things like grants, loans, tax incentives, support for labor. It’s unclear at this point how much this is progressive pandering and an unattainable pipe dream, and it seems unlikely it will be nowhere near as far-reaching as the New Deal era infrastructure funding, but it might be coming at just the right time for many.\n\nHere are some highlights from the [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/08/06/clean-energy-fuels-corp-clne-q2-2021-earnings-call/) which we can compare to elements of the Infrastructure Bill.\n\n* Increasing supply while in talks with “dozens of dairies” sign on as partners. (Infrastructure will be needed to capture cow farts.) \n* The largest vehicle fueling infrastructure in the country, which provides the mechanism to generate the valuable environmental fuel credits.\n* Signing RNG supply contracts with third-parties to meet today’s growing demand.\n* Increasing customers in New York, Arkansas, Nebraska, California, and whatever state Amazon is.\n* Facilitating training classes with the Natural Gas Vehicle Institute for dozens of maintenance technicians who will be keeping the Amazon trucks on the road.\n* Electric \tand hydrogen-fuel cell trucks, albeit great, are perhaps limited by \tinfrastructure and mineral resources. Using the \"California Air Resources Board carbon intensity scoring, \\[an \texample\\] company would have to purchase over 6,400 electric heavy duty trucks, or 13,000 fuel cell trucks to achieve the same carbon reduction as only 1,200 trucks running a negative carbon RNG.\"\n* Recently submitted bids to build hydrogen stations for transit agencies that will be testing a handful of hydrogen buses.\n\nContent pulled from the bill to get an idea on language and numbers of provisions that might help CLNE:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* $20,000,00 wastewater grant for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, which includes funds for sludge (cow shit) collection, installation of anaerobic digester, methane capture, \tmethane transfer, facility upgrades and retrofits, and other new and emerging, but proven, technologies that transform waste to energy.\n* Some related grants have requirements such as must be “regionally dispersed across the United States and can leverage natural gas to the maximum extent practicable” which fits CLNE current business perfectly.\n* “Appalachian regional energy hub initiative”  The Appalachian Regional Commission may provide technical assistance to, make grants to, enter into contracts with, or otherwise provide amounts to individuals or entities in the Appalachian region for projects and activities, that will help establish a regional energy hub in the Appalachian region for natural gas and  natural gas liquids, including hydrogen produced from the steam methane reforming of natural gas feedstocks. (Grants to develop methane capture infrastructure, bullish sign for potential third-party contractors in new localities.)\n* $52,488,065,375 \tthrough 2026 per each to build infrastructure to reduce highway emissions.\n* Massive \tamounts of funding going to hydrogen found in Tittle III FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. The entire Title III may be worth a look through if you want a bullish feeling for CLNE, but especially “Subtittle 3--Hydrogen Research and Development,” as \tRNG can be used to produce zero emissions hydrogen, and it \tspecifically mentions getting hydrogen from biomass and bio fuels, so it’s easy to see CLNE taking advantage.\n\nWhether it’s intentional or not, a lot of Littlefair’s language on the call seems to come from having spent some time reading the bill. Big investors interested in CLNE are also likely watching the bill to estimate where state money is going.  Perhaps Littlefair is aping the bill's language in order to appeal to big investors, and if this is true, it would seem Littlefair was successful because there was a plethora of institutional buys on the day after the call.\n\n**The Present State of CLNE Stock and Retail Perception**\n\nI bought into CLNE in June when it was under $10. I had spent weeks staring nervously at exceptionally retarded calls on another stock and wanted to just park some money somewhere and let it drift upwards while I dozed through the summer, and CLNE seemed like a good buy at $10. Analysts had (have) it anywhere from $10-27, and it seemed like the recent changes in DC would lend to even more upside. Then Wallstreetbets started shouting about CLINE SI% (which barely made any fucking sense, by the way) the stock shot up to $15 on retail power and perhaps the relatively few shorts there exiting, all the retards, including my brother,  lost money on calls, and the mood about CLINE around here got very negative.\n\nInstead of drifting up to twenty, CLNE spent the summer drifting down to $6. I did not enjoy it, but I held the bag, believing it would have to go up eventually. When the earnings report came-out last Thursday night, and at the same time the stock slumped to its 2021 low, I was in despair. Where were the greenwashing greenbacks? What we’re the politicians in DC doing besides trying to figure out if their pants are on or not, shouting about a vaccine that half of the population refuses to take, and looking for their son’s laptop?\n\nAs culturally enriching as the president’s son’s DIY tweaker porn is, I thought perhaps there might be even more going on behind the scenes in DC when I decided to peak into the Infrastructure Bill. In all earnestness, I was very doom n gloom at 5AM the morning after CLNE earnings. I was smacked from sleep at 3:30AM with anxiety about a sell-off, and lying in a semi-hypnagogic state, I shit you not, I see floating above my bed, a funny looking man with big ears in a cow field, smile and say, You should just sell, son. The earnings report stated a decrease of 99.2% (yes, 99.2% decrease, just like your memestock calls). Supposedly this decrease was due to a tricky deal with Amazon, but I didn’t want to think about Rocketman blasting off with hydrogen, any more than I did Littlefair issuing shares. I wanted money. Furthermore, the news is blaring about Delta variant, people invested in 3rd world vaccines are shouting about the ineffectiveness of mRNA in the rage filled chatrooms of my broker app, and I start thinking I should cut my losses with CLNE and invest in a Playstation so I can try to teach my brother how to play *Last of Us* in order to prepare him for inevitable modern tribal warfare coupled with a zombie apocalypse.\n\nThe earnings were, in actuality, not nearly as bad this Amazon deal made them look. Although revenue decreased because of the deal, CLNE increased RNG sales by 13%. As Litlefair said in the call, “excluding the effects of the Amazon warrant charges and the commodity swap and customer fueling contracts unrealized losses, revenue for the second quarter of 2021 increased by 28.9% to compared to  for the second quarter of 2020.”\n\nThis is going to sound cheesy, but the Infrastructure Bill was a little ray of sunshine during what, in my more narcotic induced brain damaged moments, seems clearly to be the end of the world. My hedge fund does not participate in electoral politics publicly or privately; my brother is not allowed to vote (not because he’s retarded, but because he’s a convicted felon), and I find elections to have an adverse reaction with my relatively fragile mental health. I don’t think a political party is going to save Earth from the human race. I think it is just as likely California will cease to be a state the moment Andrew Littlefair’s cow fart machines explode and fire consumes the entire West Coast. But there is actually something in the bill that I have not felt from the federal govt probably ever in my life, but especially since the pandemic started, and that was some sort of expectation that there will be a future. Despite my better judgment, this sensation felt good to me. Furthermore, this sensation, to me, seems to be an excellent marketing tool for this particular moment and it will make the bill and it’s consequences at least temporally popular. People have indulged in their unchecked desires for societal collapse and death for the last 18 months, and I think perhaps we are sick of it. What people want to know now is that they can work (and yes, actually have jobs) to improve the world for a future with or without COVID.  The Infrastructure Bill is going to create jobs that some people (at least momentarily) will feel good about doing, it’s going to increase revenue in multiple sectors (and decrease it in some), it’s bi-partisan, 70% popular with voters, and in the end, it could probably pay for itself by not making the money printer go brrrr so much once everyone has a decent job again. To me, of course, all this gooey-oooey goody two shoes democracy hoopla is a load of BS, because ultimately what the bill will do is at last make CLNE drift gently up to $20. I believe it already may have begun to do that before the bill is even passed, in fact.\n\nAt 7.48 CLNE is a good to buy if you don't mind holding for months, possibly year for big gains. After skimming through the bill the last couple days, I don’t really see a limit to the upside. The Federal Govt. is going all in on financially supporting a phase-out of fossil fuels. Oil is likely to get tanked by another winter of COVID, while the govt is going to be offering grants, subsidies, loans, to companies like CLNE. With vaccines and better knowledge of the virus, CLNE is likely to able to continue increasing productivity. Retail isn’t really buying these days, but institutions greatly increased their holdings this past week, with the majority of big buys coming in the day after earnings were released.\n\nI’m now taking all of our incoming funds and investing them into CLNE shares, every time my brother beats someone up and steals their money. Risky options don't seem worth it here right now, because the stock price seems relatively in the control of big money, and big money will be the one selling you the options. The stock is largely owned by institutions, likely because it’s easy to imagine how revenues will be on a steady uptrend for many years to come, especially with this Infrastructure Bill presently making it's way through congress. That said I could see $8 by Aug 20, if I were to place a relatively placid bet.\n\nTL;DR: you all are retarded but maybe not as retarded as me bc I’m bagholding CLNE. I combed through the infrastructure bill, looking for bullish indicators. I found a lot of implications for CLNE but lots of provisions that could affect many stocks in very specific ways.\n\nThe Infrastructure Bill is worth paying attention for gambling purposes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: fixed the linked to earnings and fixed some writing mistakes.
