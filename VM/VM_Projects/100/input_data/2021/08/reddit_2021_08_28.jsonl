Bullish.", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Not that insane when you consider that the production value of what content creators create has steadily increased as better quality equipment has become more and more available to the average consumer.\n\nThe iPhone 13 is rumored to have a camera that can shoot at 8k 30fps, with last year's iPhone being capable of 4k 60. *This* is the mind boggling part when you consider that only 5 years ago 720p was considered good quality. And this is just the most accessible example of high-quality recording hardware and software increasing in accessibility. \n\nWhen you get to the upper levels of skill in content creation, a lot of what Youtube creators are capable of will often match or even exceed cable TV quality media. Netflix, due to only hosting media with hollywood-level price tags on production, are the bar to beat and Youtube with the aid of its content creators is gaining on them and fast. \n\n\\_\n\nAdditionally, here's the three other aspects that handicap Netflix and make Youtube (well, google by extension) the better bull case.\n\n1. Netflix, due in part to licensing issues, outright cancelled a number of shows that were incredibly popular in the US. Law & Order SVU being chief among them. Youtube on the other hand will offer full access to these shows, for a price, with no expiry date on when or if they'll be yanked from the platform.\n2. Youtube also caters to a much wider audience than Netflix does; primarily the education space. While they do host plenty of high quality documentaries, Netflix is and will always be an entertainment platform. Youtube on the other hand, while the majority of their platform is entertainment focused, because the bars for entry are functionally nil, you can find plenty of high quality educational content on Youtube that Netflix just will not have. You'll have PhDs presenting doctorate-level lectures in their given fields and uploading it to Youtube purely as a digital backup, but publically accessible. \n3. Music. This is one of the biggest reasons Youtube will do better 10, 30, 50 years from now than Netflix will, in my opinion. Consumers take for granted that Youtube offers same-day exclusive access to music releases by every artist from billboard-toppers to a guy sitting in his garage banging pots and pans together. Most notably though, this access is not paywalled. I can pull up the MV premier of any big-name artist's latest record often within days of the audio-only or visualizer versions of the track, for free. Netflix simply cannot compete. \n\n\\_\n\nIn essence, despite being two very different business models, Netflix would have to acquire Spotify, Tiktok and Discovery and provide access to all 3 at no additional cost to even hope to emulate the breadth of content Youtube is capable of. Breadth that directly translates to long term growth, as evidenced by Cable TV's expansion from just news to a bottomless pit of every kind of program you can imagine, and it's concurrent rise to being the most valuable media format up until the advent of the internet.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Another thing YouTube has that Netflix doesn't is live streaming.
