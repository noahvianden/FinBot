If it is made public the gains could be breathtaking.\n\nPosition - 8500 shares long. 120 Call options.\n\nI am sure you have heard of Lordstown Motors Corporation. Now ask yourself why you know so much about a company who was trading at less than a $1 Billion Market Cap just a few days ago. The media, using a narrative that Nathan Anderson of Hindenberg Research assembled, made sure to tell you the company was a fraud. Well, it turns out they seem to have had an agenda to try to kill the company in the crib and much of Anderson‚Äôs claims have been widely discredited. For instance, Anderson claimed that the company was 4 years away from bringing a product to market and in just weeks after that was published started their Beta program. The company plans on producing vehicles for final testing and to bring them to market early in the first quarter of 2021. Production is rumored to begin the final week of September and should be targeted as a major catalyst as many retail investors don‚Äôt even realize the company has an actual product.\n\nAs Doubling Dollars pointed out earlier on Seeking Alpha, the company has a number of organizations that seem to want to put roadblocks in the way. Donald Trump famously championed the company and staged a photo opp in front of the White House last fall. Mike Pence was there at the product launch last summer which gained headlines but his visit was frowned upon by detractors from Democrats and members of the LGBTQ community. So, there are some political headwinds. The United Auto Workers, National Automobile Association of America, Ford Motor Company, and Rivian backer Amazon seemed to want to give LMC a quick death after a coordinated campaign to discredit their company and their product.\n\nSo what could possibly save a company with so many bigger organizations wanting to see it‚Äôs quick death. One of the wealthiest people in the world who could be hiding in the shadows and very well could turn Lordstown from hero to zero on Wall Street. On Thursday, the Ohio company hired Daniel Ninivaggi as their CEO. The first thing that jumps out to anyone looking at his resume shows he has been the right hand man of Carl Icahn for years. Ninivaggi was the CEO of the Ichan Enterprises from 2000-2004 and then CEO of Ichan Automotive from 2017-2019. His most recent work for Ichan was as board member of Hertz which he stepped down from in July. The Hertz connection pops out at you as a Lordstown investor as the strategic business model of the company is to sell to fleets so the new CEO very well could be bringing some massive sales along with him from his connections.\n\nUpon the Ninivaggi hiring the stock shot up over 40% before paring some gains and settling down for a 15% gain which it held Friday. The heavy short interest kept the lid on the run but the sky's the limit to the upside. If Ichan discloses a position this could be similar to his Herbalife play which forced rival Bill Ackman, who was short the stock, to throw in the towel after losing $500 million. Like Lordstown, Herbalife was smeared in the media and under investigation by the SEC. They walked away with a minor penalty and their company is worth $6 Billion today. Icahn was of course President Trump‚Äôs Financial Advisor during his time in office so there are political advantages to make the company a viable success story if Trump decides to run in 2024.\n\nThere is a true bull case without Icahn‚Äôs presence as well. The company has affirmed strong demand in their signature product the Endurance which they seek to produce 30,000 vehicles thru 2022 which translates to $1.7 Billion in forward revenue. The problem is they are cash poor but with Ninivaggi‚Äôs connections odds are they will be able to do a capital raise without diluting shareholders and could get a loan on their former GM plant they own outright. In SEC filings, GM had valued the plant at $2 billion and left all robotics intact and invested in the PIPE of LMC and own about 5% of the company. GM want them to succeed to sell them batteries in their new Ultium plant that is across the street, sell them parts, and one can speculate that GM very well could use them as a supplier of parts in their own EVs that will be released in the coming years. The Lordstown complex the company owns is the third automobile largest auto plant in the United States.\n\nAt a market cap of $1.15 billion and trading at $6.50 a share there isn‚Äôt much downside risk at all with tremendous upside. Rivian, who still haven‚Äôt released a product after forming their business in 2009, filed with the SEC for a $80 Billion IPO Friday to show how low the valuation actually is despite the companies both entering the market at the same time. Would you rather own 1 share of a company who has links to Jeff Bezos or 80 shares of a company that now seems linked to the legendary Carl Icahn. I know where my money is at, and I hope you hop along the RIDE as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Endurance Starts Production In Less Than 4 Weeks](https://preview.redd.it/10ae938l5bk71.jpg?width=301&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dca45fb0e53afc76e673662955562e91b97673c)", "id": "pdwc9x", "created_utc": 1630247650.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "The dark side clouds everything.

Simply put, higher interest rates suck money out of the stock market.  Why? Because treasuries and many investment grade bonds (AAA) are less risky than most stocks (lower risk of principal loss and guaranteed return) so investors are more inclined to move into them as rates go higher.  The stock market historically produces a 6-8% return every year, and a bond hypothetically paying 4% is attractive under those circumstances.  The opposite is also true.  With today‚Äôs around 1% return on a ten year treasury, investors will make the logical choice and switch into stocks for capital growth and dividends (or go for other things like real estate, crypto, and other hard assets like collectibles). \n\nThe Fed has a direct impact on interest rates by 1) monthly purchases of MBS and Treasuries (overall higher bids at auction due to Fed bidding means lower interest rates); and 2) total control over the Fed Funds rate which is the interest paid to member banks with assets parked at the Fed.  \n\nSecond, holding all other things constant, when interest rates are low, companies are more profitable because their debt service is lower (on variable loans or callable bonds). If they don‚Äôt have debt, they can create debt at lower prices to expand operations, or buy back stock (increasing EPS).  Of course, the opposite effect is true with higher rates.  \n\nThird, with lower rates the USD will experience a devaluation (holding everything else constant).  However, versus other currencies, the devaluation is not as impactful when other countries‚Äô Central Banks are doing the same thing regarding low rates.  Nonetheless, domestically, the devaluation of one‚Äôs currency does have real effects.  It leads to price inflation.\n\nForth, some companies can pass on inflation better than others depending on the elasticity of demand.  Compare the ability of a restaurant to pass on inflation of a burger to customers versus a utility company or a medical provider charging for electricity or a necessary medical procedure.  With some goods and services, we just need them, and inflation is passed on with little customer push back or loss of demand ‚Äî think the price of gas.  So, some companies can pass on their inflationary inputs and others can‚Äôt. \n\nIn summary, yes, I agree that the Fed‚Äôs ability to control interest rates controls the stock market‚Äôs trajectory.

In 2018 they raised rates 4 times, and caused a market crash that was probably only alleviated by the Fed cutting rates 3 times in 2019 (pre-Covid) back to 1.50-1.75%. I think the writing is on the wall; either we have low rates forever, or we get a crash if they raise them high enough.\n\nI also wouldn't say QE has anything to do with inflation. As I said before, this has been going on for over a decade, and hyperinflation has not materialized. Yes, it's supposed to increase the money supply and encourage lending by banks, and borrowing by individuals, but this isn't a guarantee. From what we've seen over the past decade, the inflation has instead gone into investments, primarily housing and the stock market. Those are the assets I would call hyperinflationary.\n\nWhat I would've been worried about is the direct economic stimulus we saw, which is different from QE. These were the $1000 checks mailed out to everyone in the US. Well, it seems most people either used that pay down debt, saved it, or once again, invested it. Either way they didn't spend that money in an inflationary way, i.e. buying groceries. Or maybe they did, but either way that's not a recurring source of income for individuals. Transitory is a good word for that kind of income.\n\nA big factor in price increases we've seen are just from supply constraints. Last year, when the economy was being shut down by covid restrictions, a lot of production and shipping capacity was taken offline. Then we reopened, and suddenly there was nowhere near enough supply to meet the renewed demand. Look at the commodity boom we had for a few months. But of course, supply will catch up with demand (and already has, commodities are way down since earlier), so this is why I agree inflation is transitory.\n\nAlso when you're looking at a YoY inflation figure of 5% or whatever it is, it's good to keep in mind we're starting from a very low 2020 base level. A lot of prices tanked last year--look at oil. Now it's back to pre-covid price and everyone's losing their minds over inflation.

The market literally just needs to correct. The current market is a charade.

There will come a time where even 0% interest rates are not enough to keep the debt bubble going. There may even come a time where it's not about tapering QE, but increasing QE over time, and increasing how much it's increased by over time. And eventually that becomes the new normal, until hyperinflation. So you calculate now that hyperinflation isn't coming yet, and maybe you're right. But inflation is getting worse already, and I see it continuing this way.\n\nThe prices of store goods and food and commodities aren't everything for inflation.

An extended recession is preferable to hyperinflation, though painful\n\nI agree with you completely, the right move would've been to not cut rates after the market started correcting in 2018. It was healthy, we needed to get the economy and market off the drug of low rates. But as it turns out, the government didn't have the political appetite to stomach a prolonged recession in 2018, and the QE inflated bubble has only gotten ~~worse~~ much worse since then. You want to be at the helm when it goes down and people see their retirement portfolios and house value crash by 50-80%? Nobody has any stomach to bear responsibility for something like this, so they just continue inflating the bubble and when it bursts they'll blame it on retail investors' greed and tell us we had it coming.

To me this means I have to either live with my parents until I'm 30, split a tiny apartment with roommates, or move away. It gets even better though, because I only began to have the means to invest in 2020, so I also missed out on the massive stock gains many made just by holding since 2009.

Nobody could produce a picture of a Lowes/HD store that was empty, all that was ever blasted was pics of $$$ prices.  The narrative of a shortage for me left when i noticed at both of these places the prices on the racks are now digital tablets(check ot out) allowing for instant price changes via update.  Loggers were complaining of same price per deck of logs as the 80's.  Same a as single family residential housing starts were on par with the 80's.  Either way 5% inflation doesn't equal 4x or 5x pricing.\n    Used cars were our next hot item, people buying used for near new prices.  Auto companies are in it to make money!  So at 5% inflation a 85k new truck should be $89,250 next year.  Plant closures, new cars lacking chips(stored on lots), futures for steel still 2x trailing 1 year.  Dealer lots are near empty, when cars/trucks do come back after a 6-9 month near zero mew cars to shipped what are we gonna have the 2021 line up in addition to the 2022 lineup?

This is a hard pill to swallow, China's economy is tied to Taiwan, zero doubts(truth hard to find).  Hard to swallow as Taiwan is in the tropic of cancer(wet environment) and just a short distance (100 miles) away in China's claimed provinces where typhoons were causing flash flooding, loss of life ect.  Rona cases there to date are 16k thats it, no notable shut down of manufacturing.  Still we can't buy a video card or a new oven tho due to no chips.  Prices hiked.\n     Consumer goods i.e. food.  %5 inflation should be a nickel on the dollar, this in not the case.  For many the price of meat has doubled easy to gauge as it's in $$$/lb, these prices aren't rolling back.  Packaged goods prices are up too, in addition to being less per package not equal to 5%.  Apples alone we are nearing the glut of NW harvest, locally are almost $1/lb more than last year.\n        Any bottle-neck related Shortage that claims transportation as the cause is a lie, in the US all commercial transportation was deemed as critical infrastructure with essential employees.  Commercial drivers were boasting how great the roads were  NO TRAFFIC.  %85 of all goods are moved this way.\n      Shipping from China.  Commercial/merchant marine has near fixed costs for any vessel.  The design is a displacement hull= near same speed a container ship with 200 containers goes within a knot or two as a vessel with 500 or 800 containers.  Crew staff is static #'s, sail dates are regular set, you cant have a commercial shipper with varying dates.  Yet prices have 2x or 3x from China to US, as we are the main consumer i would doubt there is any cut price for europe/canada/South America.  It's not crude prices,  China isn't increasing pay for workers.\n     All these and many more boil down to the USD, other currency is involved as EU/Australia  and others have injected funds to float their economy.  Money velocity is a good measurement for economic health,  small business restaurants have been led to the gallows,  the only way to increase money velocity is to increase prices, increase wages.  In a large part USD is the world's reserve currency this is a known, the way the US wants it this way and is fighting to keep this the case.  Gold/silver futures contracts authorized by the SEC have been tripled to keep prices down and USD in your pocket.

Enterprise, in general, is still lacking the \"killer app\" to manage eV fleets to maximize profitability. It will happen in time and whoever makes that software will win because there is likely more money in that than selling the cars themselves. Basically we need software that calculates most profitable routes taking into account vehicle range (which changes based on weather, load and battery degradation), charging locations and times. This needs to be delivered via internet to the vehicle on the fly with live updates. I assume current software already accounts for traffic, weather and other obvious factors but maybe not and if so, then that needs to be in there too.\n\nEnterprise will also be about whoever offers the fastest service (the old companies win here).

Nothing against the product, simply economies of scale and absolutely no financial/mathematical way they child xfer to full production (even with further dilution).", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I've been researching the auto industry from the 1920s, and EVs are in a similar situation  \n\n\nI think your two examples aren't destined for pure bankruptcy. Rather, I think it's closer to a Fisker situation, where if they do fail, all of their work will end up somewhere else. My prediction, based again on how things went in the 1920s, where there were at one point literally hundreds of car makers, is that companies like Rivian, Lucid, Bollinger, Canoo, Fisker (again), plus the 3 wheelers Aptera, Electra Meccanica, and Arcimoto, if they all make vehicles that are actually sold, will be around for at least a few years. I'm not counting companies like Lordstown, as it seems likely they will go down soon, and any tech they have end up with GM.  \n\n\nAnyway, if history is any guide, if the above listed companies go down, they will either end up absorbed by their biggest investors, so for example Rivian ends up just folded into Ford and their tech incorporated into Ford products; or, if they are relatively successful but don't have good management, they could be absorbed into a bigger brand, I could easily see, for instance, Rivian end up being a full part of Ford, but as a separate brand, assuming they create a vehicle that doesn't really fit with the more conservative Ford buyer's desires.  \n\n\nDon't forget that there are niche companies, some sports car companies like Lotus and Rimac, but others like Lightyear, which was started by a group of solar challenge student who are trying to make the lightest possible EV that can run mostly on the solar energy it can generate, and they are testing a prototype now.  \n\n\nAnd of course, there are the Chinese manufacturers, which have a somewhat different system to determine success under the CCP rule of China. These companies will almost certainly buy up any company that has successfully sold cars but then is in danger of bankruptcy.   \n\n\nAnother company I would expect would buy up struggling companies with actual product is Stellantis. While they have a decent set of EV platforms, since they are more dependent on European sales which means stricter emissions standards, if any of these companies has something they don't have, I could see them being bought just like Ford or GM would do.  \n\n\nI would be surprised if VW, BMW, or Mercedes bought anyone else, though. I haven't heard much about them investing outside their companies, so I wouldn't expect any of these companies to be absorbed by them. Same for most Japanese firms, I know Nissan, Renault, and Mitsubishi have a partnership, but companies like Honda and Toyota are less likely; they will partner with other big firms like how Toyota partnered with GM, but I don't recall them investing in smaller firms. We could be surprised by someone like Subaru or Mazda saving an EV company, as those kinds of marques are just coming into EVs, and might see an advantage buying up or saving an EV company that has product.   \n\n\nThat all said, Lucid feels like a company that would either end up with a Chinese savior, or actually becoming a second brand for Tesla (since their founders were from Tesla). That would be out of character for Tesla, but the design and engineering ethos for both companies are similar.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">which have a somewhat different system to determine success under the CCP rule of China.\n\nno.

However, under Xi Jinping, the government, and as a result, the CCP, is using Chinese law to exert extreme control over private Chinese companies.  \n\n\nIn the auto industry, it is well known that Geely's current practices are being closely watched. Geely owns, for example, Volvo. This was unusual for the Chinese government to allow at the time, and its' then chairman Li Shufu, acknowledged that the Chinese government was supporting his state owned competitors by taxing his company:  \n\n\n[https://supchina.com/2017/04/13/geelys-rise-chinese-car-company/](https://supchina.com/2017/04/13/geelys-rise-chinese-car-company/)  \n\n\nThis was 2017  \n\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/a9fcd724-1bbc-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6](https://www.ft.com/content/a9fcd724-1bbc-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6)  \n\n\nThis article makes clear that the Chinese government made an exception for Geely vs. other companies\n\nSo while the consumer is definitely part of the equation, my assertion was that the Chinese auto manufacturer must also take into account Chinese government requirements in a way that companies in other countries don't. If there is a change in power in China, and an even more conservative leader replaces Xi, there is every chance they will shut down private Chinese companies if they want state companies to succeed at all costs. Alternatively, the CCP through the government has far greater ability to push Chinese companies to do certain things ‚Äì like for instance mandate they build and sell EVs ‚Äì¬†than is possible in countries like the US.\n\nIt would be an oversimplification, and not my intent, to suggest that the Chinese government tells Chinese automakers what to do at all times or even most of the time. My point was only that the math is a bit different, so you can't use the same rules to determine what will happen with Chinese manufacturers as you might use for those in other countries. The Chineses government reserves the right to take over private businesses as it see fit.  \n\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-xi-clampdown-private-sector-communist-party-11607612531](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-xi-clampdown-private-sector-communist-party-11607612531) \n\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2020/09/are-private-chinese-companies-really-private/  \n\n\nWhat's more, unless you are Chinese, if my understanding is correct, you can't invest in Chinese auto manufacturers anyway. That's not a dig on China or the CCP; the same holds true for example of many South Korean companies, although some research shows that both Kia and Hyundai are available to buy stock in OTC; they are unlisted, but do appear to allow non-Korean citizens to buy their stock.   \n\n\nIn reviewing to make sure my data was correct, it is clear that a lot of this is recent, in the last decade.

Companies like Lordstown will disappear if they don't make any product, but GM may buy up any tech they have that is valuable once they are gone.\n\nThis has happened again and again since the start of the automobile industry. If a company builds up any valuable brand recognition, but is just mismanaged, then either it will be bought up and kept, or the vehicles will end up being changed into renamed models.\n\nThe OP asked if Rivan or Lucid will just go bankrupt or not. I think not: Rivian is executing very well, has a nearly finalized product, and will only fail to deliver if something catastrophic happens. They've essentially done everything right, and have a lot of good IP and brand recognition. So I predict if they fail, it will not be the product, but rather brand marketing (which is already going pretty well). If people don't continue to buy their vehicles, I predict they will be bought out by Ford, and whatever patents or good design they have will be incorporated into future F-150s, because I have yet to hear anyone who's driven one say anything bad about them, and I watch a bunch of car YouTube.  \n\n\nAs for Lucid, they also have actual vehicles with a similar response from those who have driven them. They are following a hybrid of the Tesla model along with a bit of Porsche Taycan luxury. They could also fail, and there isn't an obvious partner that I'm aware of who would absorb them, but I think Tesla is a likely candidate as I understand quite a few of their higher ups are from Tesla. Lucid has a lot of good tech, they designed their own motor, so I would expect, unless there is bad blood there, that if they do go toward failing, Tesla is the most likely company to take advantage. But there are others like Mazda, Subaru, maybe Stellantis, who, if the tech is there but the management isn't, would buy them up either to get their tech, or possibly to add the brand (if it gets any traction) and then fix the management and marketing.\n\nThose are my predictions based on what has been happening recently in the industry, and how the auto industry in the US and worldwide has worked again and again. The only time when there was a tech explosion like this and there were a plethora of auto makers who all went bankrupt was in the late 1800s, and even then, most of those companies got bought by slightly bigger ones.\n\nAnd politics aside, I think it's pretty obvious that Chinese marks are buying up EV and other auto makers; any of these companies could end up as part of someplace like Geely, if there is anything of value. But I note that there have been some purchases that still haven't demonstrated their value, mostly thinking about  Faraday Future, which was on its way out, but news says it's recent SPAC was bankrolled by Geely. Geely is, in fact, the company most likely to buy up other companies. It looks like Nanjing also has some interest in buying failing marks, having bought MG which didn't have any well selling vehicles, but the MG name has brand recognition.\n\nSo I think that Rivian has a good chance to remain if it sells good vehicles for at least two years, as the name itself has gained some traction. Lucid is less likely, but I could easily see a Tesla Model L made from a buyout if that comes to pass out of the Air (wouldn't be Model A, because I'm sure Ford maintained the copyright for that name, much as they did for Model E, which never was even a thing, I assume they think they might use the name for an EV at some point).", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Fisker ($FSR) is intending to be a design firm.

Shorter DTE means less time to recover from a trade that goes against you and you have less buffer (lower premium) to absorb any shock.\n\nBut there is also the psychology/bias part:\n\n1. Reducing DTE (for me) means that my mindset is tilting more towards \"risk off\" mode. This causes me to put on less trades, lower my deltas, and close trades faster\n2. Mentally, I find it easier to do this with weeklies - with monthlies, my bias is to do more trades, increase deltas, keep trades open longer, which is exactly what I wish to avoid.\n3. Its harder to close a monthly when you see the premium you're leaving on the table, even if in absolute terms, you may be making more $$$ than on your weekly.\n\nIt's as though the right data (longer DTE is less risky) will bring out the wrong temperament (you get greedier when you actually want to be more conservative).\n\nI realize the contradictions here.

Also a look into the rise of passive investing.", "selftext": "So already as of March 2021, [passive funds have gained a majority share of the U.S. fund market](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/passive-likely-overtakes-active-by-2026-earlier-if-bear-market/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si6thz5vr6k71.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=39e138185ca3c645ff34418253624af42530ec89\n\nThis means that passive funds that track the S&P 500 and other diverse markets are now larger in market share than actively managed funds in domestic markets. This graph also shows the massive growth in fund market share by passive funds compared to active funds over the last 6 years.\n\nThis growth I think is being caused by widespread support for index investing. Nearly every news article, informational paper, and online forum are all repeating the same message of investing into passive growth funds/ETFs and just holding them no matter what happens, even during large downturns. Historical data supports this and many well known investing figures also share this message. Even most new investors it seems after small losses from active trading or trying to time the market are converted to this philosophy.\n\nWhich leads me to the question: how does it ever go down here? People are being indoctrinated to keep holding during every crash and even buy dips with excess money. Historically selling at the bottom is the worst possible situation and everyone seems to know this. The rise in 401k usage and passive tax advantaged funds with penalties for withdrawing from the market also supports this. So if retail investors make up [77% of the market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17), who is left that actually sells their equities?\n\nI guess market makers with HFT bots are the only answer. These bots will attempt to sell at the instant sign of bad news in order to try to shake out weak hands, start a crash, and buy at the bottom. The recent March 2020 crash is an example of how this sell then buy cycle is getting shorter and shorter as less retail gets shaken off.

Who knows?\n\nNow in 2008, a big part of the problem was Banks had a shortage of people to buy houses. In order to fix that shortage, they had to lower their standards and lend to just any damn person off the street.  Not a problem, when the bank can just take the house and resell it to cover the debt.

German media started photographing him and the market graphs behind him, making him \"Mr. DAX\".\n\nHe used his fame by portraying himself as a financial guru and investor, even tho he had no remarkable qualifications. Well.... some naive old germans believed him. \n\nSo Dirk set up an investment fond, the infamous \"Dirk M√ºller Premium Fond\". Since 2010 Dirk talked about a big crash coming up and so he started to hedge all his positions. The costs to hedge his positions are so high that they have been destroying all gains. (thats why id like to call him the WSB Antichrist, because he is absolutely protected against any risk) \n\nThis brings us to the glorious performance of his fonds: \n\n[Honestly i think its quiet remarkable to have a negative performance during the last 3 years.

Don't trust everything you read on here about bubbles, inflation, and the role of the Fed.\n\nThe Fed doesn't actually print money. All they do is take the money that the treasury has already printed and act as a lever to determine the amount that goes to banks. Once the banks have them, then it goes out to the economy, right?\n\nActually, no. Then it goes into their capitalization balance sheet, where the FDIC dictates a  capitalization requirement. The primary purpose of QE isn't dumping money into the economy directly, it's to anchor against the degree of toxic assets a bank holds. QE basically dilutes the risk on the bank balance sheets, meaning that if people default on their mortgages, the bank doesn't go tits up. This is how a lot of banks were saved during the post-2008 era, and then that QE money was used to create structure buyouts to combine good and bad banks and further dilute the assets.\n\nWhere QE ends up in the economy is the percentage that doesn't anchor toxic assets that goes to lending, so the banks act as a risk fulcrum and can both put money into the economy and take it out (through reduced new lending) and that relates directly to capitalization requirements. There's a lot more to this even beyond what I've just explaining, including the role of short term lending in payrolls, but the bottom line here is that the role of QE is mostly to keep the banks solvent.\n\nRegarding inflation, inflation at the level we're talking about isn't as much of a problem as people think and has far more to do with supply chain issues than it does the amount of money in the market. Money only competes on price if it's actually competing in the market, and it's not doing that in bank capitalization sheets. There's a common misreading of the inflation calculation which presumes that \"money in the market\" is the total supply of cash, and it isn't... it's the supply of cash actually in rotation, which is reflected in the PCE data. Personal spending took a dive in 2020 and only just recently recovered to the prior normalized curve, so contrary to popular belief, the inflation isn't caused by spending since you'd have to see a massive acceleration in spending to get there, and we're seeing inflation in the context of reduced spending. (continued)", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Regarding the amount of inflation we're seeing, 5-6% isn't a huge deal. Historical examples of catastrophic inflation reach 200-400%, and we're not going to get there because this isn't that kind of economic issue. What we have is now decreasing degrees of rising inflation after a pandemic market where some parts of the market deflated last year and some inflated because of issues with demand and supply constraint. So the numbers we're looking at YoY can't be directly compared to the inflation numbers from the past... but if we did, then we're comparing them to the 2% that was only the standard post 2010... before that it wasn't uncommon to see 3-4%. In fact, the current inflationary number we're seeing is on-par with the late 2000s.    \n\n\nBut wasn't there a crash in the 2000s? Yes, but it wasn't strictly due to \\*inflation\\* it was due to inflation with the features of persistent wage and spending power recession in the economy in the midst of a deregulatory regime. Basically, the lack of increase in overall buying power from the 1980s on for the consumer compared to the higher economic tiers in society creates an asset imbalance that, without seeing increasing wages or compensating policy created an event that had stagflationary facets combined with really poor risk assumptions on the part of the banks.  \n\n\nInflation by itself doesn't create crashes... inflation without solvency does, and right now we're seeing increasing wages, solvency exists, the reason for the inflation is completely different than it was in 2008, and we have MoM declining inflationary increases. The real danger isn't inflation... it's deflation. The lack of solvency in 2007 in the housing market was the canary in the coalmine, but ultimately it was \\*housing deflation\\* that created the actual systemic risk... because it resulted in \\*asset deflation across the board.\\*  \n\n\nSo here's the thing... if you don't get that deflationary event, you don't crash.   \n\n\nThat's why people are bullish. We're going to enter a growth period unless the market creates a self-fulfilling prophecy and freaks out and creates a deflationary bubble where one wouldn't have otherwise existed. The logic of \"it's too big, it has to crash\" is just a maxim which is basically constantly disproven every time the market extends and doesn't crash. Crashes aren't actually inevitable unless you take a Laissez-faire stance and allow bad dynamics to flourish in monetary and macroeconomic policy... and the Fed is currently doing the opposite.  \n\n\nSo if the money didn't make it to the market, how did the stock market fly up? Easy, aside from lending, the other thing that banks can do with capital is give it to their investment houses since those walls have been broken down. A lot of that money went to funds to prop up the stock market and keep that crash from happening, and a lot of it is still sitting in fund coffers as cash... over a trillion of it by some estimates, and that money will eventually filter into the stock market and largely stay with the funds themselves. Retail investor expansion was a factor in the market rise, but not actually the dominant one.   \n\n\nThere's a lot more to say on this, but the bottom line is that it doesn't really work the way many on here think it does.", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Holy shit.

This is a myth that has pervaded throughout history that comes from older economic models where valuation spikes against anchored currencies created massive bubbles that HAD to deflate because the anchor would force a crash.  \n\n\nThe mistake is in thinking that relative valuation for the dollar is the only variable. It isn't. The subjective value of the good in the market is also a factor.  \n\n\nLet's say that there's a TV shortage and you have an anchored currency, so you can't shift the relative valuation of the dollar... the amount of currency for the TV still has to go up because there's a shortage. The subjective valuation there creates a bubble, and since you can't leverage the monetary system to push money into/out of the economy you wind up with banking system pressure, and that leads to a larger assets crash as isolated inflationary spikes in those systems weigh down the rest of the system. The other way nations would influence the market was through influencing the supply of gold and creating problems that way. The idea that anchors stop bubbles is a myth spread in Libertarian circles.  \n\n\nWith a fiat system, you can extract/introduce money in the market to soften the curve of the bubble if a supply issue occurs.  It's not broken, it's working as intended.  \n\n\nAnd regarding gold, silver, crypto, etc... the valuations of these things are based on the economic subjective value they hold against the existing currency. All 3 are basically worthless if there were to be a real significant crash where the dollar was wiped out. The idea that gold was chosen as an anchor because of its inherent value is yet another myth. The Romans chose gold because it was soft and worthless. You couldn't fashion armor or weapons from it, and it co-existed with the metals they cared about, so they used it as a currency because having one coin have equal value was the only way to make their Imperial economy work at such distances. It's gold's complete lack of value that made it useful for them. Now we use it as a conductor, but aside from that, its value is purely subjective.  \n\n\nIf the market actually crashed to the point where the dollar was worthless, the only thing people will be doing with gold bars they're trying to trade with will be getting beaten with them as the people who invested in actual resources use that bar to knock them out and take their cans of beans.

It just isn't. I work with this data every day in one sense or another in my professional role and I can see the offsets as these numbers have flexed. The time to reduce QE will be when the pandemic finally ends, which I suspect will be after the delta variant because we're in the acceleration phase of the pandemic. Of course, nobody knows for certain which is part of the problem. The purpose of these programs is really to keeps the banks solvent, and when you have the kinds of economic cyclical impacts we're seeing from the pandemic, there's still too much risk in the system.  \n\n\nIt's far better to release that pressure a little bit at a time later on and accept from short term inflation than it is to potentially dive into a deflationary cycle, which is what you'll get because demand will spike as we slowly get out of the pandemic stage, and then it will settle down, but the supply chain will lag meaning you'll get inflation up front and then deflation in the back.

Many of these people are retail investors. They fear cash devaluation because they know the fed is pumping lots of money into circulation and don't really plan to stop it soon.\n\nWhat happens if it's true, and the federal reserve is removing their stimulus?

Sure, but a correction is not a precipitous crash. They call it the \"taper tantrum\" because it's purely an emotional reaction to what is basically a nothingburger. People cite the taper as the cause of the market correction in 2018, but they conveniently ignore that that was also the time of the government shutdown and the trade war that Trump started. The correction really matches the latter two items, not the tapering, and it didn't continue even though the tapering did.\n\nTapering is basically just reducing the rate at which the bonds are purchased... when the tapering starts, more money will still be flowing into bank balance sheets, but since it doesn't all get released and doesn't get released right away, the effect of a taper correction would be purely a psychological reaction, and as you can see psychological reactions in this market take days to recover from.\n\nThe same is true for rate raises. If they're smart, they'll make all of these choices and changes slowly and that will allow the market and the banks to adjust their ratios as they move along, which significantly decreases the impact. The real story of inflationary bubbles in economic history is that drastic moves are bad.\n\nIf they just cut the bond purchasing and hiked rates all at once, that would definitely cause a crash... but slowly over time? Nah.\n\nThe idea that we're beyond the point of no return on inflation simply has no meat to it. It's nothing. There's zero reason for you to believe that and a ton of reason not to. I'm gonna be honest here, I don't think you know enough about economic history to have a good opinion on what's dangerous here and what isn't... and that's OK. I get that change is a bit scary especially if you're new, but I think a little self-doubt purely to test your assumptions would be a good thing here, just because it would be the scientific thing to do.\n\nAnd regarding retail investors, the growth of retail investment is part of why the monetary policy isn't going to crash the market the way you think it will. Your premise is that it's the stimulus money that drove the rise of retail investment, and I'm not going to say that it's not a factor since obviously having some more money can enable that kind of thing, but the actual change in trend predates that and almost certainly tracks to the rise of no-fee or low-fee open trading platforms which reduced the barrier for entry for many, many people. You could argue that this increases and reduces stability in different ways... it's not a simple thing to model.\n\nDo I agree that this increases market risk in the average household? Sure, but keep in mind that the underlying economic realities will influence the market.
