As Rob discusses there is never a demand issue. There may be demand pockets that can be optimized as needed.  The other thing to remember is that there are many regulatory credits that they have contracted for in Europe and because they do not have enough supply from Fremont they can get those credits by maintaining supply from Shanghai. Europe needs to get steady deliveries to keep up interest in their cars.  Their main decision point is what factory is most profitable to ship cars from for Europe and now it is Shanghai which has the added benefits of maintaining higher asps in China than they would if they sold every car domestically. Once Berlin is fully online I expect that China asps will go down and there is nothing wrong with that.

This play will make you SO RICH you can finally fuck some strippers to satisfy yourself since your wife won’t.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEcovyst (ECVT) just announced a special dividend of $3.2/share, which at a share price of $16.2 is OVER a 20% return! Now I am not here to talk about a boomer 20% return, but more so how this news has not been priced into the stock/options and provides a perfect short-term options play\n\nOver the past few days ECVT has traded relatively flat, only really increasing over the past day or so. News of this insane dividend has barely made any headlines and no one seems to know about it. Once more people find out about this stock and buy in for that 20% return, the price will EXPLODE\n\nSince the announcement of the dividend, the stock has ONLY increased by 8 cents\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f183uk9eajg71.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e0709dc16b2dddb9d7e9256dcd6c3cadb1ac4e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stock ‘should’ drop around $3.2 after the ex. dividend date (efficient market hypothesis) which ‘should’ mean people won’t buy in just for the dividend, but people (and the market in general) are irrational and greedy so stocks generally have run-ups prior to special dividends (see price action on RKT, MCFE, AFG, SUTL ect.)\n\nSpecial dividends also signify to the market that the company is being successful\n\nIn addition to this, the stock has low liquidity with an average trading volume of only around 223,000 shares and an institutional ownership of OVER 69%. This means the stock will MOON if only a small amount of people buy in\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBesides the whole special dividend play, ECVT is actually a decent, profitable growth company. Y/Y revenues were up 47% and they posted a profitable quarter of $0.11/share. They manufacture and catalyze chemicals for green tech, which will be a growing industry in the future. I know this play is not about the viability of the company, but this being a decent company takes some of the risk away\n\nAdditionally, options have not priced in ANY pre-dividend volatility, the 8/20 $15C only needs to have the stock go up 0.92% to make money\n\nThe ex. Dividend date for the special dividend is aftermarket 8/11 so I would sell before then\n\nThe record date is on the 12th, so if you are feeling risky you could hold until 8/12\n\nMy positions:\n\n10 8/20 $15 C, 10 8/20 $17.5 C\n\nTLDR:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/574x9fncajg71.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b796c0334badd7a240741e16803395b45f7870f\n\nEdit: Turns out the ex div date was in the morning of 8/11 so I wish everyone luck, hope this doesn't fuck up the play", "id": "p1p0rx", "created_utc": 1628601589.0, "score": 1589, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 807, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|587|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Should have logged in earlier.

Because dividends take a month or two to kick in.\nNow, a dividends stock like MFA does it quarterly, so technically it may be best to have three dividends stocks (AT&T 🤮) and, uhhh, another REIT, or NVIDIA.\nThe key is to distribute the dividends so you get some every month, you need this to pay back monthly interest.\nFast forward to month 2, and you have:\n2 Months Of Personal Loan Interest\n2 Months Of Margin\nMaybe your first $3,300 of Dividends, which honestly I can tell you outside of maybe REITs, you won’t get much safely.\n\nYou need to figure out if your dividends pay more each month on both your personal loan and margin.\n\nI would argue, probably no.\nLenders are greedy, and probably will charge you more than you will make per month on dividends.\n\nDividends are boring but also mean the company is not taking their profits and investing in company (i.e. AT&T 🤮 is trending downwards for the past 5 years yet pays dividends). \n\nTesla, Google, and Amazon, however, wager you will make more money from just investing than you will make with dividends. Perhaps that’s even the case. Outside of buying REIT shares pennies on the dollar like I did in March 2020, I would argue the blue chip ones will outperform REITS and other dividends in the long run.\n\nIn addition, dividend stonks can actually halt dividends whenever the feel like it.\n\nAnyway, hope you enjoyed reading!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Don't forget the taxes OP has to pay tax on the dividend profits or from selling the shares...
