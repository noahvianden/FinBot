{"title": "AMD Options Calls Mistakes/ Lessons Learned", "selftext": "Hoping to get some insight around my AMD option calls and future strategies for success. I'm pretty new to options trading and have mostly focused on trading options targeted around earnings. \n\nI had been holding AMD for quite some time and decided to purchase call options about a week and a half before their earnings announcement. I bought several contracts ITM with a Sept,18 expiry I believe, the strike price was $93 or $94. Typically when I'm buying options leading up to earnings I am not holding through earnings and will sell a day or two before earnings are released. I've read many times to never hold through earnings and sell your contracts as IV will crush your profitability.  I usually will sell my underlying stock too leading up to earnings because i typically see a pull back and dip in the stock even if the numbers are great, such as Apple the last few quarters. I'll then buy back in a few days after earnings if I'm feeling bullish on the stock. I sold my options the day before AMD earnings up around 30% as well as the underlying stock.  I've then watched in disbelief as the stock has gone parabolic and hit 5 all time highs in the matter of days. If i would have held these contracts through earnings how how would the IV have effected the contract value with the stock shooting up at the same time? Should you not always sell leading up to earnings? Maybe this is just an outlier situation? I never saw a single price target for AMD above $100 at least not for this year. I'm really trying to get a better handle on how i can understand when my contracts are at or near their highest value, and when to exit, is there any indicators  that would help to time these better? Also, is the earnings call options strategy applicable broadly, or does it come down to a case by case scenario?

It is more like 80/20 if you are discussing a stock in the S&P 500. That is why the S&P 500 rises relentlessly. AMD, has had five down quarters in the last 13 (I miss-typed that number in the original response to OP) but the scale on the plus side is very large compared to the negative side. On the day before their July 2018 earnings report AMD closed at 16.05. At the time of the last strangle in my example, on the recent 27 Jul 21 report, they were trading at 91.88. Today they are trading for 119. And that is not unusual for a tech stock. \n\nMy example of SNAP from the last quarter was an example of tripling the bet was one of buying just before earnings and specifically NOT selling until after earnings. The IV crush argument is very misleading when you are playing a tail event. IV crush does NOT win 99% of the time in an earnings play. Where did you get that number from? Do you think that is true of AAPL? FB? NFLX? SNAP? SHOP? MSFT? AMD? Because it is not. I know because I have played earnings strangles or more than a decade in stocks like this. The strangle pays off about 45% of the time, but the payouts when a tail event hits is disproportionate to the losses - like AAPL a year ago when they announced their stock split during earnings - that has a 5X payoff which bested TSLA the week before, which had a 4X payoff. \n\nAs I've said on this sub probably a dozen times before, IV crush has almost no relevance in stocks that are big candidates for tail events, and that certainly includes AMD.\n\nOP's example was not even of an extreme AMD event! The last AMD earnings report was tepid, barely profitable for a strangle. \n\nOP was asking about a long-term hold and, of course, any advice to sell that was terrible advice.

Unless you have unlimited account balance, it's not wise to play YOLO. Yeah, YOLO is needed when market dips hard and you see a signal that it may rebounce, but current market trend is nothing like that (Or other way around that market is ATH, and you see a troubling signal that it's going to correction territory).

Intel's last earnings call was a huge sign. Literally every semi-company is reporting great numbers except Intel. Intel's last earnings call was not very positive. AMD's revenue has been growing rapidly over the last year. On top of the company actually hitting on all cylinders, the semiconductor industry as a whole is rapidly growing. Demand is severely outstripping supply. Then you have another positive catalyst with the potential of the Xilinx purchase.

Not everything is about options, greeks, IV, etc.\n2. \"Implied volatility\" is bullshit.\n\nStarting with #2, obviously an options trader needs to understand and monitor IV. What I mean by \"bullshit\" is that IV isn't some sort of objective output of mathematics & statistics, it's a measure of market demand. A high IV just means there's a lot of interest in the option. Consider AMD August 06 options: a week ago the ATM IV was 2.55%/day, today it's 5.25%. It's the opposite of the typical \"IV crush\" as options get closer to expiry. The same is going on with MRNA. These are indeed outliers.\n\nSo what do we do about these? For most trading, you just keep them in mind as outlier risks. (They are, for example, the reason we don't all just constantly sell a thousand OTM spreads that have a 0.05 risk/reward, because the few times they go against you, they destroy you. The big option sellers have enormous mathematical models to create hedges to avoid that, and they still make mistakes.) If you want to occasionally play bets on huge swings in price with a tiny amount of your portfolio, that's fine, just be prepared to usually lose.\n\nOn #1, there were indeed targets this high. On July 7, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari set a target of $111.00. On July 20, before earnings, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay set a target of $120.00. Immediately post-earnings, before the run-up, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann set a target of $150. Did you listen to these? LOL, probably not, and neither did I, because usually these targets are, at best, a guidepost for the next year, not some sort of short-term bet, so we skim the consensus number and that's that.\n\nA run-up this high was in the cards: on the day of earnings, AMD was trading at a P/E of 32.51, P/S of 8.34, EV/EBITDA of 37.39. All of these were near or at bottom for the past six months, and far lower than averages for the past year, past few years, etc. Maybe that's what attracted you to AMD in the first place. It sure attracted me, and so I've been playing AMD, though I missed this particular jump. If these kinds of numbers were a guarantee of a huge stock movement in the near future then we'd all be loading up INTC. And maybe INTC does pop in the future, that's not a crazy play, lots of hedge funds are doing it.\n\nBut here's the thing: 99.9% of the time, stocks with all these same signals do *not* suddenly jump up in price, and if you could regularly predict when that would happen, if you could even get it right a mere 10% of the time, you'd soon be a billionaire. The reality is, dumping your money into something on the hopes of a sudden change in price is no different from a WSB YOLO, even if we options traders dress it up in complicated math.

The IV that has fallen is the IV that is at or near the money, but you don't care about that, because of the tail event, you are very far away from the money and highly profitable.\n\nAMD has a history of robust tail events. In the models that I use to track and trade earnings I calculate the size of the earnings reaction as a log growth percentage and compare it to the Implied Daily Volatility of the 90 days prior to the day of research, and I call that ratio XSigma. So if a stock has a movement that is two times the scale of recently-estimated 90-day implied daily volatility, that is a 2-XSigma move. A rough rule of thumb is that any any move beyond 2 XSigma will offer a profit to an earnings strangle placed before market close on the day of earnings. Of their last 11 quarterly earnings reports, the report triggered a tail event (above 2XSigma) on 7 of those reports. (The last one was pretty much break-even for a strangle at almost exactly 2XSigma). Of the last 13 quarterly earnings reports from AMD, only ONE, the Jan 26, 21 report, triggered a negative response at -2XSigma. \n\nAnyone selling before SNAP's report this quarter would feel far worse than you. SNAP closed at around 62.50 on Wed July 22 just minutes before their earnings report, and the Friday expiry options were trading at about 4-sigma. A 62.50 Call was pegged at 2.79 at 12:17:51 with an estimated daily implied volatility of 0.1176, which was 4 times recent 90-day historical volatility. At market open at 6:37:13 the day after earnings SNAP was at 77.57 and the call had a selling peg of 15.47. (The 61.50 Put, originally priced at 2.58, was worthless). \n\nSo what was the after-earnings IV of the call that went from $2.79 per share to $15.47 per share overnight? I guess we don't really care, do we? \n\nFinally, these price targets and the \"expected prices\" based upon options that get published are largely worthless. They assume away tail events and tail events are everything in earnings releases, at least for big tech stocks.\n\nIf you were worried about your long-standing position in AMD, you could have hedged that with some cheap throw-away $80 or $82 puts.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Very insightful argument and I appreciate you dispelling the pervasive myths of IV crush.\n\nI humbly would like to employ your methodology of calculating log percentage growth of earnings reaction with 90 day volatility.\n\nIf possible, could you break down the process with examples , of course if you are ok in sharing your strategy \n\nThanks!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "IV will not crush your earnings unless you're buying spreads and long expirations.

Apollo Group (NASDAQ: APOL) is due to announce earnings after the close of trading on March 27. On February 26, a trader might have considered buying a long straddle or a long strangle in order to be positioned if the stock reacted strongly one way or the other in the run up into the earnings announcement. In this case, APOL was trading at $65.60 a share. The trader could have bought one contract each of the April 70 call at $5 and the April 60 put at $4.40. The total cost to enter this trade would be the cost of the two premiums, or $940. This represents the total risk on the trade. However, the likelihood of experiencing the maximum loss is zero because this trade will be exited before the earnings announcement and thus well before the April options expire.\r  \n\n\nExample Trade 2: Stock Earnings Release (Non- directional Trade)\r  \nDetermine the Magnitude of Post Earnings move with Straddles\r  \nAnalyzing options to make earnings predictions is to attempt to determine the magnitude of the anticipated move after the earnings announcement. Since most options appreciate in value when volatility increases, implied volatility can tell us when the market is anticipating a big move to the upside or downside. Luckily, straddles are designed to take advantage of implied volatility, so we can use them to calculate an exact magnitude.\r  \n\r  \nStraddles represent an options strategy that involves purchasing call and put options with the same strike price and expiration date. By purchasing an at-the-money straddle, options traders are positioning themselves to profit from an increase or decrease in the stock price. Therefore, looking at the price of the at-the-money straddle can tell us the magnitude of this implied volatility.\r  \n\n\nPractice Trade: Google\r  \nPrior to  the earnings announcement we purchase one at-the-money Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) call option for $1,200 per contract and one at-the-money GOOG put option for $1,670 per contract, then the cost of the at-the-money straddle will be $2,870 plus any commissions paid. With GOOG's underlying shares trading at $575.50 per share, this means that we can expect a move of approximately 5% or $2,870 / ($575.50 x 100): $2,870 / 57,550 = 0.0498%.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sometimes the best thing to do is to trade around a core position.

{"title": "The Coming Crisis.", "selftext": "**TL;DR at bottom.**\n\nHere's your obligatory bear post for the day/week/whatever.\n\nI'm not an expert but I do have some qualifications that lead me to believe that the global economy is in for some trouble.  I could be wrong, of course, and actually my entire theory is predicated on that fact.  Still, I feel I am sure enough in my convictions to the point where this statement is worth making.  You may disagree with the worthiness of this post, and of course, the premise behind it.  That's fine;  I'm just here to share the way I see things.\n\nWhat's certain is that, even if one may see the warning signs of a looming crisis, it's near impossible to tell when that crisis might be.  I have no idea.  All I know is I see some precariousness and warning signs right now.  So, without further ado:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Uncertain Nature of the World**\n\nThe world is uncertain.  Black swan events happen, and they happen frequently.  Again, some people may have some inkling of them, but it's hard if not impossible to predict these things with any degree of certainty.  Some examples that come to mind (please excuse the lack of chronological ordering): the Covid-19 pandemic, September 11th, the Global Financial Crisis, the John F. Kennedy assassination, Columbus discovering America, the Challenger/Colombia space shuttle disasters, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand leading to WW1, the Great Depression, the Black Death, the storm that destroyed the Spanish Armada, the Wehrmacht crossing the Ardennes, the smart phone / internet revolution, etc.  The last one is interesting if you ever saw *Back to the Future: Pt. 2.*  The most they predicted were flying cars, but not smart phones or internet.\n\nBut I digress.  These events are part and parcel of life, and the major events of history do not happen in a linear fashion.  Sure, we may be able to connect the dots after the fact, but when they happen it's almost unbelievable: we seem to be taken utterly by surprise.  Just think: apart from Bill Gates or someone like that, which one of us normal folk thought we'd be dealing with a pandemic this time 2 years ago?  I certainly didn't imagine it.\n\nAnd it happens in our personal lives too.  You meet someone.  You have a break up.  You get injured.  You get sick.  You lose a loved one.  You fall in love.  Who knows?  Life is very, very unpredictable.\n\nDon't get me wrong; that doesn't mean I don't think we should try.  Science helps. We can form hypotheses and test them.  This adds a lot of certainty to a world that is very uncertain.  But even Einstein would admit that some things are simply out of our grasp:\n\n\"What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Folly of Economics**\n\nI studied economics.  I was very interested in Econ 101 and decided to make that my major.  Later, however, I was disappointed in what I learned.  I don't know.  There was just too much mathematical formulating and analysis.  I didn't feel, really, that I had learned much of anything that was actually relevant and applicable to the real world.  To be honest, at the time I just thought I was an idiot and bad at math, blaming myself rather than the field (as a young, lost kid might be prone to do).  Looking back, however, I think there were serious shortcomings that I had picked up on but did not have the tools to express.\n\nI'm not saying that there isn't a place for that sort of analysis in the study of economics: I imagine there is.  I just don't think that it should be the singular focus of the whole field.  Indeed, while mathematical equations are imperative for pure math and even for practical applications like physics and chemistry, can they really be applied with the same rigorous veracity to the study of something so complex and changeable as the economy?\n\nFormer economic advisor at the Bank of International Settlements William White argues that instead of looking at the economy through equations and equilibria, we should be viewing the economy as a [complex adaptive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system#:~:text=A%20complex%20adaptive%20system%20is,the%20behavior%20of%20the%20components.&text=The%20Complex%20Adaptive%20Systems%20approach%20builds%20on%20replicator%20dynamics).  You know, like a garden.  You have an idea in mind of what you want to plant and where, but some plants die, some don't, weeds pop up, there might be an infestation.  The whole thing is quite unpredictable because it depends on an enormous amount of variables interacting with each other.  Well, that's a lot like the economy.  (Read more here: [Recognizing the Economy as a Complex, Adaptive System: Implications for Central Banks](https://williamwhite.ca/2018/04/22/recognizing-the-economy-as-a-complex-adaptive-system-implications-for-central-banks/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Folly of Modern Central Banking**\n\nThe folly here follows naturally from the aforementioned ontological error in the field of economics: we think the economy is predictable and controlable.  Cut interest rates here, buy assets there, and we're good to go.  If only it were that simple.\n\nLook at the data we're looking at right now.  Despite absolutely unprecedented amounts of liquidity being pumped by the Federal Reserve (and by other central banks around the world), we're still unable to get people back to work.  Check out the [ADP numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/private-companies-added-330000-jobs-in-july-according-to-adp-far-short-of-the-653000-estimate.html) today: 653,000 new positions were expected in July, but the actual result was a miss by just over half (330,000).  If you've been paying attention to the data in past months as well, you've noticed consistent misses in employment.  And how about inflation?  YoY inflation hikes are expected due to base effects from the pandemic last year, but MoM inflation has been coming in consistently higher than expected.  All of this makes you wonder: does the Fed really have things under control?  *Could* they have things under control?\n\nI would argue that you can't solve structural employment issues by throwing liquidity at the markets.  The problem is not liquidity, there's plenty of it: the problem is structural mismatches, as well as other factors like people preferring to take extended unemployment rather than working.  You can't fix that with more liquidity.  One of the most respected modern economists, Paul Krugman, would probably say \"well, it can't hurt\".  And according to their models, it can't.  Unfortunately economists and central bankers seem to do be doing their absolute best to turn a blind eye to obvious asset bubbles.  SPX is up nearly 48% since pandemic lows less than 18 months ago, while the Nasdaq is up nearly 58% in the same period. Meanwhile the real economy has been absolutely hammered.  The [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) is at 38.25 at time of writing - a level unseen since prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble.  It is clear that there is a severe disconnect between fundamentals and asset prices due to excessive liquidity in the system.\n\nIf the Fed manages a controlled walk down of interest rates, and earnings continue to grow into current valuations, then no problem, right?  Right.  It's possible.  But that would be hoping for the best.  William White argues that it's more rational to prepare for the worst rather than naively hoping for the best.  A long series of things would have to go according to plan for this bubble to be \"defused\", and any number of unforeseen events could arise in order to knock the whole plan off track.  Some examples come to mind (and these are just the ones that we can fathom... the whole point is that there are more that we probably can't): Delta variant or other Covid-related scares, geopolitical tensions with China/USA/Taiwan, inflation running hotter than expected, etc.\n\nAnd speaking of inflation, why in the world is the Federal Reserve so confident that inflation is transitory?  As I mentioned above, YoY and MoM inflation expectations have come in consistently higher than expectations over the course of the last few months, oftentimes to the tune of 70-80%.  If whoever is making these predictions is getting it so wrong in regards to the numbers, who's to say that they aren't getting it wrong in regards to it being transitory?\n\nLook, it very well may be: the supply chain disruption argument is a valid and strong one.  But nobody has a crystal ball. The Fed is not an all-seeing eye where they can simply predict exactly what is going to happen.  One might hope that the Fed would be more prudent and humble in their analysis of the situation.\n\nAnd certainly the Fed has a long history of getting things wrong.  In early 2007 Ben Bernanke famously declared that subprime was \"contained\".  Just a few months later, when the crisis did begin to arise, Jim Cramer called out Bernanke for \"being an academic\" and for being out of touch with the situation on the ground.  Look, I don't really like Cramer, but I do believe he was in the right at this particular moment.  This sub won't allow me to link it here, but I recommend looking up \"Cramer tells Bernanke to wake up\" on YouTube.  It's worth a watch.\n\nLet's not forget either that even before these two events the Fed absolutely failed to anticipate the crisis in the first place.  Later they would say that such a crisis was unpredictable, and totally based on panic.  But they forget the fact that people like Dr. Michael Burry, of Big Short book and film fame, did see it coming.  All of the people in that book saw it coming.  Even [William White saw it coming, and warned Alan Greenspan of it at Jackson Hole in 2003.](https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/the-man-nobody-wanted-to-hear-global-banking-economist-warned-of-coming-crisis-a-635051.html) The Fed, however, did not see it coming.  Bernanke would also claim that the crisis was nothing more than old-fashioned financial panic, and that if not for the panic it would have been the equivalent of merely \"a bad day in the stock market\".  This is a convenient view for him to take, as it alleviates him of all responsibility for completely bungling the situation.  Even [Paul Krugman challenges Bernanke's assertion that it was all related to financial panic and not at all tied to fundamentals in the housing market](https://www.google.com/search?q=Paul+Krugman+Great+recession+bernanke&oq=paul+krugman+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59l3j35i39j69i60l3.2811j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).\n\nOf course, Bernanke and those around him would hold on to their view that nobody could have seen the crisis coming, and go on to congratulate themselves for rescuing the country and the world from a crisis that they themselves had failed to prevent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where We Are Today**\n\nAnd that brings us to where we are today, with massive monetary stimulus coming from the Fed and all major central banks as a response to the Covid-19 crisis.  The response to 2008 was seen, rightfully in many ways, as a success.  By injecting liquidity into markets when they needed it most, the Fed and other central banks were able to stave off the next Great Depression.  Unfortunately, however, apart from their failure to prevent the crisis in the first place, central banks have also failed to take into account the limitations of their policies.  Not only have their policies become less effective, but they've also opened the door for a dangerous array of unintended consequences (William White talks about both issues [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf)).  William White also says that, contrary to what the Fed seems to believe, monetary policy \"is no free lunch\".\n\nRecovery since 2008 has been asymmetric: we seem to be trying to fix deep, structural problems via simple injections of liquidity. Meanwhile, [inequality grows](https://hbr.org/2018/09/research-how-the-financial-crisis-drastically-increased-wealth-inequality-in-the-u-s), the poor get poorer, and political and social unrest continue to grow as a result.  It's a dangerous path to go down, and rather than try to explain it myself, I would recommend reading the White paper I linked above.  One clear and present danger I see today, which White mentioned in the paper, is the presence of serial bubbles: the dot-com bubble led to the housing bubble, and the housing bubble has led to the current stock market bubble, only to be aggravated by the Covid crisis and the Fed's response to it (ironically causing a new bubble in the housing market as well).  If something unforeseen were to happen, these bubbles could pop, causing lasting damage to Main Street.\n\nAnother issue I see now is that, if we were to have another crisis, what more could be done?  How much higher can the Fed expand their balance sheet?  How much more deficit spending can the federal government engage in?  I believe that we are dangerously close to exhausting our policy options.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, it's possible that everything works out just fine.  The issue, however, may be in assuming that everything will go according to plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What To Do as an Investor**\n\nI'm not an expert at this, but I would not tell anyone to go cash right now.  I would say, however, that it may be wise to hold a larger cash percentage than you're normally accustomed to.  If you normally hold 5% in your portfolio, for example, then maybe you'd consider holding 10-15%.  This will provide for buying opportunities in the event that we do have a major correction, and it will also help to preserve capital.  That said, full cash does not seem to be the way to go.  If you're waiting for a crash, you may be waiting forever.\n\nWhat I would recommend, and this seems pertinent to a lot of what I see on this subreddit, is diversification.  I see people with dangerous allocations into overvalued tech stocks (\"buy Microsoft at any valuation\"), holding 3-4 tech stocks as their whole portfolio, a 2-fund portfolio with levered funds UPRO and TQQQ, etc.  I see people holding large allocations of ARK funds and other \"disruptive\" tech with unproven track records.  I see people recommending lump sums right now, because, \"on average\", they do better.\n\nIf it were me, I would diversify and play it more conservatively.  VOO would be infinitely better than UPRO, for example.  A diversified portfolio of blue-chips which very well may (and should) include stocks like Microsoft would be infinitely better than *only* holding Microsoft.  Patient dollar cost averaging would probably be wiser than dumping one's life savings into an S+P 500 index fund at the moment.\n\nI would also encourage people to look at fundamentals.  One should never, IMO, feel the urge to pay for a stock at 30, 35, or 50+ times earnings just because of \"future growth potential\".  It's a gamble.\n\nIn the end, all of these strategies that I am opposed to may end up working out and may even end up doing better than my conservative approach.  The problem, however, is what happens if they don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR, Summary, and Final Thoughts**\n\nAs humans we seem to have a problem with humility.  In some ways I think it's painful for us to accept our limitations and fragility.  Thus, it's easier for us to pretend that the world is predictable, orderly, and within our control.  This fallacy has made it's way into the field of economics and by extension into central banks and the Federal Reserve.  Current policies, encouraged by the \"success\" of 2008, operate under the fallacy that the economy is orderly and able to be controlled with surgical precision, rather than accepting the unpredictability of the economy as a complex adaptive system and taking measures to be prepared for black swan events which will inevitably occur.\n\nAs a society and as investors, we can certainly hope for the best, and sometimes the best does manifest itself, and in those cases such optimism does tend to lead to better outcomes for those who profess it.  However, perhaps a more prudent, realistic approach would be to prepare for the worst, or at the very least recognize our limitations and put measures in place in order to mitigate the damage which can be caused by unforeseen disruptive events.\n\nGood luck and best wishes to all.", "id": "oy57s2", "created_utc": 1628120007.0, "score": 1178, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 843, "comments": [{"body": "I see it coming but I can’t see it coming, type of way", "score": 640, "replies": [{"body": "I think the idea is that it *could* happen, which is more honest than the people saying that it won't and can't.

I intended for the message to be deeper.\n\nIn my experience with humans, first and foremost with myself, I have found that we have a tendency to hold on to ideas about ourselves and the world that may not necessarily reflect the reality.  That's why some people (not necessarily you) think I'm just some intellectual try-hard when really my only intention was to share something I enjoy talking about and think is important.  Their notion of me (intellectual try-hard) serves their limited world view, but it's not reflective of the reality of what's going on.  If they were open to a conversation with me like you are, they would potentially be able to see how they're wrong about me.\n\nI'm not saying that means they have to agree with me.  It just means that they might be forced to admit that, \"Ok, I don't necessarily agree, but I see where he's coming from\".\n\nThe same thing happened with Trump voters, which has been talked about elsewhere in this thread.  Progressives generally thought (and some still think) that Trump voters are just idiots who need to get their act together.  Now, I'm far from a Trump supporter, but the truth is that these people had actual grievances that for some odd reason felt that Trump was going to address better than any of the other options.  The limited, false world view is \"wow they're dumb\".  The more complex, humble view which is reflective of reality is \"well, they may have dumb solutions, but they know their grievances better than I, and they have them for a reason\".\n\nIt's the same flawed thinking that tells us \"Wow she's such a bitch\" when maybe she just had a bad day and couldn't hold it in anymore.  Boiling it down to simple terms like \"she's a bitch\" is a closed, overly simplistic view of a phenomenon that's much more complex than that.\n\nThe thing is, our closed world view tends to be more comfortable than an open-ended one that is more reflective of reality.  Why? It gives us something to cling to.  As human beings we don't like uncertainty.  It's scary.  It means we know a lot less than we think we do, and are a lot more vulnerable than we think we are.  We could have an aneurysm, we could die in a car crash, the Delta variant or some other disease could cause Covid pt. 2.  It's scary to admit that, so it's much easier to just boil things down to some overly simplistic way of viewing things.\n\nI had my notions challenged at a young age because my life was really on a bad path, and it was either challenge my notions and get humbled, or end up jail or dead or something.  It was that bad (drugs and alcohol related).  Life humbled me.  That's why I'm able to see lack of humility and guardedness in others.\n\nWhat I see, actually, is lack of humility and closed-mindedness in economic thinkers and the Fed.  And that lack of humility and closed-mindedness are dangerous ingredients that can lead to a crisis, just as they did in 2008.  \"Nobody could have seen it coming\", they said, but truthfully that's just because none of them were really paying attention.  They were too stuck in their own limited and incomplete world view.\n\nMaybe this was the wrong sub for this, but I'm constantly trying to find new platforms to communicate these ideas, and truth be told they permeate all aspects of our culture and society.  So really many forums are appropriate, including this one.  While admittedly the surface level advice of \"be careful and diversify\" may not be all that profound, I think there's a deeper message in here worth considering.

Like why we fall in love, or why a scene from a movie makes us cry.

The Zipfian distribution is one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions. It is related to the zeta distribution, but is not identical. Zipf's law was originally formulated in terms of quantitative linguistics, stating that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.\n \n**[Pareto_distribution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution)** \n \n >The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian civil engineer, economist, and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, (Italian: [paˈreːto] US:  pə-RAY-toh), is a power-law probability distribution that is used in description of social, quality control, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of observable phenomena.

It is one of the oldest philosophical theories, and has been ascribed to philosophers including Thales, Plato, Spinoza, Leibniz, William James, Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand Russell, and Galen Strawson. In the 19th century, panpsychism was the default philosophy of mind in Western thought, but it saw a decline in the mid-20th century with the rise of logical positivism.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "GOOD BOT", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Saving this comment and will do my best to respond properly when things cool down in this thread.

That's inflation. When you have inflation for 12 months or whatever it might be -- I'm just taking an example. I'm not making an estimate -- then you have a price increase, but you don't have an inflation process. And so part of that just is that, if it doesn't affect longer-term inflation expectations, then it's very likely not to infect -- to affect the process of inflation going forward.

The recovery is uneven  and impacted by government doing what it *should* be doing, which is looking out for it's citizens in a time where through no fault of their own they cannot look after themselves.  Employment rocketed up over the last few months but the US economy had been exploiting the shit out of minimum wage workers who have suddenly realized that they don't have to take it anymore.

I know the US loves to believe that the pandemic is over and everyone overreacted anyway, but it is still having a deep impact on the world economy and may of the problems it caused are not solved - for instance everything shut down in early 2020 so all the rental companies offloaded their rental stock, planning to buy when things reopened but they are the largest supplier of used cars to the market so because they did not buy new cars in 2020, there was no supply in 2021 causing a massive spike in used car prices. Another example is that containers are stuck in depots because they were not shipped back in early 2020, leading to a container shortage in the supply companies and causing rates for containers to spike. 10x normal container prices won't last forever, and neither will rental companies not selling cars into the used market.

Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  How do you know?

To clarify that by \"transitory inflation\" I, and most others talking about it, actually mean \"transitory rate of inflation increases\". I expect rate of inflation to look between 2 and 2.5 over a decade that includes 2020/2021.\n\nThe reason I'm so confident is that the the reasons for the current rate of inflation are fairly obvious right now, and they are all transitory themselves. The used car situation is based almost entirely on the total lack of fleet car purchases, something that will almost certainly not occur again. And this is one of the largest contributors to the inflation rate increase.\n\nOther causes include the container problem and the supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. It might take a while to sort these out, but they *will* be sorted out, which will drive shipping costs back down, removing this from the calculation. I don't see any specific structural reasons that would lead to a long term 5% rate of inflation for instance.\n\nThe discussion on this topic has been driven by dramatic YOY and MOM increases, but YOY comparisons are useless because of base effects (take the 2019-2021 rate and average it over 2 years, and you'll see what I mean) and MOM effects are distorted by reopening effects.\n\n>I don't live in the US and am aware that the pandemic is not over.  As for them missing the data, one would expect them to miss sometimes on the downside, rather than consistently on the upside IMO.\n\nI did not actually say you were from the US! Because the conversation on this board has been driven by large increases in the US rate of inflation and because rate of inflation increases were less pronounced in Europe and Canada it seemed a reasonable assumption that we were discussing the US economy. In my opinion the reason they have consistently missed on the downside is because they don't like what their numbers are telling them so adjusted down, and because they did not anticipate how frothy the used car and construction markets would get, and because analysts continue to underestimate the appetite from people to spend money after being constrained for so long.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You make very fair points all around, and you may well be right.

Did cloud computing exist to this extent? Just examples. \n\nThese are the largest and greatest businesses the world has ever seen for a reason. They cnstantly create and re-create products and whole industries, and usurp what others used to have monopoly on (AAPL moving in to BNPL for instance). And the network effects... They have a growth runway *because* they're large.\n\nThe 21st century is the age of tech giants. There will be many long term niche players that will do well to enable these (NET comes to mind).

Not one of the biggest ones, but one you’ve heard of.   So\none way that I follow the advice in your username is not to put all of my eggs in one basket by also investing heavily in tech.\n\nOn valuations, that was my ballpark estimate for big Tech.  I looked the numbers up just now and feel really good about them.   Here are the forward/trailing P/E’s for these companies:\n\nAMZN   59/58\nAAPL    26/29\nGOOG  30/31\nMSFT   32/36\nFB         28/26\nNFLX    50/54\n\nThis averages to 38, without even including smaller and less mature growth tech.  Much less Tesla.\n\nAnd I personally believe that those P/E’s are based on optimistically flawed macro assumptions, for reasons OP touched on.  \n\nI understand that P/E isn’t the only measure of value and can even be a dangerous one (clearly $ZIM’s 2021 P/E of under 2 is not sustainable).\n\nBut it pretty much boils down to what you’re paying for a combination of sustainable earnings and growth potential.\n\nI know these are considered the best and most revolutionary businesses ever.  But I also know that the same thing has been said about most of the biggest businesses in history.  It was definitely said of Cisco in 1999, but also of IBM and GE and GM and Standard Oil and the Pennsylvania Railroad.  I majored in the history of technology, I’ve always been interested in this phenomenon.\n\nThis week I have been reading David McCullough’s history of the Panama Canal.   \n\nThe French Suez and Panama Canal companies were each by far the biggest IPO’s in history. The same guy, Ferdinand de Lesseps, was the CEO both times.  The Suez was a legendary success, the Panama an abject failure.  A total loss for shareholders, who were still much better off than the perhaps 20,000 employees who died of malaria and yellow fever. \n\nThe French capital raises for the Panama Canal project in the 1880’s remind me a great deal of recent going’s on\n\nWe especially hear how it’s different this time late in each business cycle.  And we are very late in this cycle.  I believe we are in the 12th year of it, from the stock market POV, because 2020 only produced a tiny blip and it was off to the races again.\n\n$SPX has returned over 18% CAGR since the 2009 bottom.  The highest ever *rolling* 10 year nominal return is about 20%, and that was in a little higher inflation regime than we had in the 2010’s, along with much higher interest rates.  Thus I would posit that overall in the last 12 years we have seen the highest 10-year equity risk premium in history.  And roughly tied for the highest ever real returns.\n\nAnd that’s using $SPX.  The Nasdaq 100 has been considerably better.  Meanwhile small caps are much more overvalued than big tech, with a higher P/E ratio.  A fair number of straight up zombies litter $IWM.\n\nI could go on for hours honestly.  It seems obvious to me that the overall US stock market must mean-revert, at least in real terms.\n\nMeanwhile I expect commodities, which reached historic relative lows in early 2020, to eventually continue\nto mean-revert the other way as they have generally been doing since late 2020.\n\nI don’t know when it will happen.

But the more I thought about it, the more I reconsidered. \n\nWhat's interesting is that the bust cycle for tech already happened. That was Cisco. Every industry has done this. Renewables did a decade ago. Now there are fairly mature revenue generating companies (FSLR off top of my head). \n\nI think with big tech, it's had those growing pains already. MSFT AAPL especially came back from the dead after that that bust. These are no Cisco. That died basically. Or Standard Oil. Or GM (which I think is reinventing itself nicely, but that's another story). Or INTC (which is dying...). AAPL MSFT AMZN especially have huge dominating services across industries, own Washington and continue to curb any attempt at serious regulation, and continue to create and recreate entirely new industries. Especially with huge profit margins, sticky revenue streams, and TAM that continue to multiply as they suck in every other industry in existence (I'm not kidding: AMZN created and still owns the cloud, and that's not an easy yoke to throw off for clients. MSFT has bought out gaming, AAPL into cars, which may or may not be good idea, and services like banking and chip design). They are in part infrastructure companies, too. They can't fail. Or the increasingly digitized economy fails. One Google outage cost the world billions. For all of that, I'm happy to pay the multiples you put out. They're peanuts. AAPL also has enough cash on hand and the acumen to spend it wisely that the Swiss Central Bank bought millions worth during covid crash (it was huge). You're investing in with something that has the power and wealth of a freaking nation state. Dying? No problem. FB bought out Instagram. \n\nMoats upon moats, and network effects, and multiple industries all on lock. These are all something former giants didn't have, and not something that could be said of any former businesses that went bust. No one trick ponies here. \n\nNFLX isn't worthwhile in my opinion. Nor is TSLA. The ones I named are. For all the reasons I gave. NFLX and TSLA are problem children and will go down as Ciscos of our age, I'll concede. VIAC F GM all have cheap valuations and I like them, but they're still value stocks for a reason: they've yet to turn from legacy businesses into multi-revenue stream and service empires. So you do get what you pay for. It's a good bet to make, though.\n\nIf you're concerned about valuations broadly, though, you also need to consider interest rates. Both Schiller and Buffett have talked about how given persistent low interest rates in the developed world, the equity premium right now is, well, not a premium. They're the only way to generate returns. And may well remain so. As such, equities are cheap. Schiller PE model doesn't account for sustained difference in monetary policy coordinated globally. \n\nI also think that while yes, SP 500 is overvalued based on historical basis, it can also be the case that someting like AAPL is not. Also, again, I'm happy to pay the multiples MSFT and AAPL carry for what they are. Those two especially. Rotaion in SP 500 continues to happen daily behind the scenes: from retail back to tech and so on. All depending on current mood of market, and so the overall PE stays high while some sectors come down in value and others go up. It's not all a straight line up.\n\nHere's a guy that's been consistently correct for the past two years on valuations and overall market behavior. He's spot on about the numbers. Very good recent article by him: https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/is-the-market-at-a-top\n\nI don't disagree with you. But to compare something like AAPL to Cisco or to Standard Oil is to completely misunderstand the nature of their businesses and their staying power and what they've become.

Then I look at all the sovereign debt that is still yielding an above zero return like the 10year US-treasury bond and how it went from 1.7% to 1.2% in a couple of weeks basically. I look at the amount of money that is entering the system and if you put everything together, you end up with one question: where does all the money go once we enter the situation that no matter what you do, you have to pay someone else to hold your money? And in many countries, for many investment vehicles we are at that point. You have to ask yourself: would you rather pay someone 1% per year to hold your money or would you rather invest it into solid equities with a PE of 100. No one should invest into something with a PE of 100. But a PE of 100 essentially means 1% expected return p.a. which is > than paying 1% p.a. This whole situation is so absurd but it is happening as we speak and it is not going to turn around soon. So the real questions you got to ask yourself is\n\na) where does all the money go and\n\nb) how long will we have this situation where debt is essentially useless as investment. A solid 1% expected return on the S&P500 is way better than making 0% a year or even losing 1%. And the S&P500 allocation is at least somewhat protected from inflation. Money is flowing into TIPS as well so that yield is going to go to zero too, its already happening! Then another vehicle is essentially gone and the supply of money is increasing still.\n\nSo yeah, stocks are definitely very expensive historically, but when investing you want to look what's ahead of you and not what's behind you. And ahead of us is more of the same we have now. How long will this go? Because however long this may last, macro will stay the same and equities will keep going up. They can go up a lot more. Nasdaq can be 30,000 in 2 year no problem. It can be 45,000 in 5 years no problem. It could be 20,000 in 10 years so about 3% p.a. still way, way better than 0% yielding debt. I am not saying it is probably happening, nor am I saying it is improbable. I am saying that for current and future market conditions, equities and almost everything else is cheap. It wont be cheap if we apply 1960 or pre 2008 macro conditions for sure. Most valuations are so high they wouldnt be considered cheap even if they fell 75%. But then again, we dont look backwards. It is extremely tough right now. Holding cash is good but you have to consider the possibility that over the next 10 years nothing is changing and its not really about losing 1% p.a. on holding negative yielding debt; its about the opportunity cost and the fact that the cost of cashflow over the last 2 years was inflating 15-20% p.a. I mean that is crazy. Its absolutely nuts. Holding too much cash would essentially turn the little return on the rest of your portfolio to zero, meaning you would end up with creating zero wealth for the years to come. This is probably fine if you are 60 and want to play it safe. But if you are a young individual that is in his primary earning years and who wants to take risk this is a nightmare.\n\nThe best that could happen now for the long run I think is a massive crisis that completely resets the system. This would probably be very bad for many people over the coming years but at least it would at some point allow most of us to start over and build wealth in the long run. This situation now is unacceptable. The equity risk premium is going to come down a lot and I mean a lot more. We are at about 5-6% now depends on where you look at. And at some point if debt is yielding..what, -1%? -2%? -3%? Equity risk premium can come down to 1% and that is a PE of 100 for a broad index.

{"title": "$EDU: say what you will about Chinese stocks, but $EDU has no business trading at NEGATIVE $600m EV", "selftext": "EDIT: since you de-gens can't even read the first paragraph, this has NOTHING to do with China macro or the Chinese equity asset class. It's just a basic but rare market inefficiency. It's god damn accounting: $4b net cash shell trading at $3.4b. Save your expert opinions on the CCP's next move in education policy for the Hinge date who's gonna ghost you by tomorrow AM.\n\nRead on if your attention span is >5 seconds and IQ is above 12\n\n# Summary\n\nVery simple negative EV trade, these don't come up often and are hard to find, but [historically have been consistently lucrative](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/07/10/returns-on-negative-enterprise-value-stocks-money-for-nothing/), especially in a name as liquid as $EDU traded on the NASDAQ:\n\n* Price: $2.00 (8/3/21 morning)\n* Shares out: 1.7b\n* Cash + Equiv: $6b\n* Gross Debt: $2b\n* Negligible minority interest and prefs\n\n**That's $3.4b market cap and $4b in net cash = -$600m EV**\n\n**Positions:**\n\n* 10,000 shares EDU\n* 80 EDU call options (WSB doesn't let you say which exact contract but \\~4,000 total delta)\n* 5,000 shares HKG:9901 (same company but HK listing)\n\n# Thesis\n\nObviously mispriced asset. Say what you will about China stonks, Chinese education stonks, VIEs, yadda yadda that's all irrelevant: cash is cash. You're paying $3.4b for a $4b net cash shell on the balance sheet, regardless of what the company actually does. That doesn't make sense because it doesn't. In my 5+ years I've only personally stumbled upon 2 cases like this: $EVE.LN and $LK (yup, that LK). Literally any \"not absolute shitstorm\" news would make this pop WAY more than just the $4b of net cash on the balance sheet, which is available to you at $3.4b for no reason other than people are selling into shit-tier China sentiment they read on Twitter without ever taking an Accounting 101 class (see comments for this unfolding live).\n\nSo let's see what is behind the EDU covers, and learn from what happened to both LK and EVE when they went into negative EV land.\n\n# $EDU situation\n\nFundamentals don't really matter for this trade (it's just a mispricing trade), but anyway: New Oriental Education (EDU) is a Chinese company that has 7 business lines, the largest of which (75% of their $4b revenue) is private tutoring. Unless you live under a rock you'd know for-profit private tutoring has recently been banned in China because of several reasons (won't go into detail but mostly around cost of education, ethics, widening wealth gap, low birth rate).\n\nNone of the above is really that important. Here's what important:\n\n1. **87% of EDU ownership is institutional, and most of that is US institutions.**This is important because common shareholders are less likely to get completely screwed because of poor geo-political optics. EDU isn't the only Chinese edu co getting railed right now and this shareholder structure is not uncommon for VIEs and ADRs. Despite what American news tells you, American and Chinese LPs are both balls deep in each other and both care oh so very much about optics, particularly in high finance, so it's unlikely common equity gets TOTALLY screwed over.\n2. **25% of EDU's $4b of revenue is still legal.**Keep in mind tutoring is only 75% of EDU's $4b run rate revenue that's been outlawed, the other 25% (language, admissions consulting, school tours etc.) is still perfectly legal meaning you have a company that can make $1b revenue trading at negative EV...\n3. **EDU has a TON of residual assets.**69k employees, 10.6m student enrollments, 118 schools, 1,625 learning centers, 11 bookstores. They could start a god damn Nike factory or the biggest car wash on Earth tomorrow with assets like that. Point is, whatever this $4b cash shell becomes, it's not worth -$600m, or even remotely close to $0 for that matter.\n\nSo it's clear that EDU is not worth $0, much less negative $600m. What can happen from here on? [Here's the only study from the CFA Institute (albeit from 2013) I could find on negative EV trading performance](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/07/10/returns-on-negative-enterprise-value-stocks-money-for-nothing/):\n\n>**The average 1-year return of 2,613 negative EV opportunities over 40 years was 50.4%.**\n\nLooking good so far. But let's look to 2 recent examples I've traded through first hand for guidance:\n\n# $LK (up 15x from negative EV)\n\nNow trading OTC as $LKNCY. This is the best comparable out there imo: Luckin Coffee, a Chinese fraud that got exposed, got sold to negative EV at a low of $0.95 in May 2020, traded up to high of $15.65 (up 17x) and today on 8/3/2021 trades at $14 (up 15x in 15 months).\n\nCompare to EDU: a perfectly non-fraudulent Chinese co that got its main business regulated away, leaving a ton of residual assets and the ability to generate $1b of legal revenue, also in negative EV land.\n\n# $EVE.LN (up 6x from negative EV)\n\nEve Sleep. British mattress shitco trading on the AIM, the single worst exchange in the universe. Traded to lows of 1.15 GBP in May 2020 due to COVID and grazed negative EV land. It then promptly re-rated to 6 GBP (up 5x) by September 2020 and peaked at 7 GBP (up 6x) in February 2021. Still trading at 3.30 GBP today.\n\nCompare to EDU: NASDAQ listed with 70m average daily volume, also in negative EV land.\n\n# The $EDU trade\n\nSo what can happen to EDU? As exhaustively as I can brainstorm, I think the possible scenarios are\n\n1. Pivot to another biz with the same assets\n2. Spin off the tutoring biz\n3. Go private via buyout/merger\n4. De-list to OTC\n\nThe most logical valuation for all of these would be based off the remaining $1b of legal revenue, which should yield at the very very VERY least a billion or two or EV, which is \\~$3.50 per share. Again, at the VERY LEAST. Which is at least 50-60% upside from here with honestly, without sounding facetious, negligible downside risk--the cash on the balance sheet is literally worth more than what $EDU is trading at.\n\nIf you use LK and EVE as precedents then you're looking at 14x and 5x within a year. And if you use  linked study from the CFA Institute, negative EV trades average 50% return within one year.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt's a cash shell worth $4b trading at $3.4b. Doesn't matter what you think of China or what the CCP will do, it's mispriced.\n\nDYODD.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n* 10,000 shares EDU\n* 80 EDU call options (WSB doesn't let you say which exact contract but \\~4,000 total delta)\n* 5,000 shares HKG:9901 (same company but HK listing)", "id": "oxhnsr", "created_utc": 1628039681.0, "score": 118, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|4 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxhnsr/edu_say_what_you_will_about_chinese_stocks_but/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Has cash reserves more than what it's trading at.

This stands in stark contradistinction to the deliberative, telegraphed, and gradual process that marks US and European lawmaking and regulation, where statutes like the US' Administrative Procedures Act (APA) mandate public comment and interactive dialogue in regulated industries. The CCP's willingness to act in such a way is deliberate: the party moves swiftly and without warning not only to implement its goals as expeditiously as possible, but also to remind people--and especially foreign and US investors--who is in charge. Lack of reciprocity thoroughly characterizes the Chinese/Rest-of-the-World relationship, and this business with the edu companies here and the gaming stocks today serve as yet more examples of that lack of reciprocity; other governments do not treat Chinese investors like China treats its foreign investors.\n\nThis is the problem and the outsized regulatory risk that's laid bare once again by the CCP acting this way towards the edu companies.\n\nAnd, yes, the fundamentals are good, great even.

{"title": "AMD: Arbitragers are Closing out Short Positions", "selftext": "This is not financial advice and I don't know this for sure, I'm just looking at the charts.If you've been following me, I've been advocating AMD for a long time and put a $50k yolo down on the stock. Those that listened to me, grats. We made some serious tendies.\n\n[Arbitrage Action](https://preview.redd.it/bkzslisbxcf71.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8fe3569cb5f82703ec96b26ad0d7801787595b8)\n\nRight now, I believe Arbitragers are being forced to close out their short positions with AMD due to liquidity risk.\n\nI explain Arbitrage in more detail here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd\\_an\\_explanation\\_on\\_merger\\_arbitrage\\_and\\_how\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/)\n\nBasically, in this all-stock fixed ratio acquisition, the arbitrage play is to short AMD and buy Xilinx, then close positions when the deal is closed. However, they're not able to get to that point because AMD is up so much. Which means they have to close AMD short positions now and sell Xilinx to cover the costs. At least, that's what it seems is happening based on the charts. This is great for us AMD holders because it's driving the price higher. But I just wanted to impart some wrinkles on your smooth brain.\n\nTLDR: The more AMD goes up, the more Arbitragers need to close out short positions, which causes AMD to keep going up.
