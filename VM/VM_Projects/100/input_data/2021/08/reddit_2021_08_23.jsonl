Over the months, I've been selling weekly covered calls to offset that and lower my breakeven in dribs and drabs. I usually sell the most expensive call that TDA has has less than a 15% chance of finishing ITM, I figure if the price starts moving up again I'll sell near breakeven or at a small loss.\n\nToday, while my back was turned, the underlying suddenly gained about 25%.\n\nI foolishly did not have a stop set to buy-to-close if the price started to go up to far, and now my covered call, for which I got a $200 credit, looks like it's going to cost me around $3800 to close.\n\nI'm familiar with occasionally being able to \"repair\" trades with options strategies, by effectively moving the breakeven, although these strategies can be more risky if price moves further than you expected after you've opened them. And in this case, I don't know what to expect.\n\nThe call expires in Friday 8/27. I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do now to best minimize my losses:\n\n1.) Sell the option at market at open for a $3500-$4000 loss, before it gets even worse, and walk away?2.) Roll it up to a higher strike, which could limit my losses to between $2000-$3500 (depending on the new strike) if price continues to climb or even if it falls but not far, BUT, will lost me a lot more money if the price suddenly plummets again?3.) My first thought was to buy a put, but now, IV is so high that puts are ridiculously expensive and I'm not likely to break even on it.4.) I could definitely buy myself a margin of safety by selling some wide iron condors, but as always, the protection that affords depends on estimating how far the price is likely to move, and any setup that greatly reduces risk if you're right is more liable to cost you a lot if you're wrong. If we have a second day of extreme movement, it could wind up costing me a lot more than it already has.\n\nBasically, I botched this so badly that virtually anything I could do to fix it would carry substantial risk itself, in one direction or another.\n\nSo, what would a more experienced hand do if they messed up and found themselves in this situation? Any opinions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: Is there any conventional wisdom for a strategy to \"fix\" a badly botched CC, close to expiration, where spot price has suddenly rocketed up far past your strike?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If you can roll it out for the same strike for a net credit then this would give more time for the stock to drop back and actually lower the risk slightly, but this is about it.  You might be able to roll for many weeks waiting for the stock to drop back, but if the stock keeps going then you may not be able to get a net credit and be forced to take a loss.\n\nThe good thing about these meme stocks is the high premiums, but the bad thing is they often act erratically which causes losses.  If nothing else, they are not boring!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hmmmm. Good thinking all around. I can roll it up and out a few weeks, exactly as you say, and, looking at just the options, it pushes my breakeven up a little bit.\n\nWhat's totally fucking up my zen thing right now, though, is that I have to factor in that holding this options and waiting for price to drop back to my breakeven on them means also holding 100 shares of a depreciating asset.\n\nPardon me while I think out loud, this is easier if I write it down.\n\nRight this minute 100 shares of the stock are worth $21000. The call I sold has a strike about $40 under the current price.\n\nI can roll the call out a month and with the credit I'll get it ultimately pushes my breakeven $15 higher. So that means I'm hoping for the stock to drop $25 so I can break even on the option (IE, be +$4000 from where I am now.) But then the stock's value is worth $18500.\n\nWhereas, if I sell the stock at open tomorrow, and buy to close the option, that gives me $21000-$4000 = $17000.\n\nOk, so by rolling the covered call once, I can shave $1500 off my current $4000 drawdown. And I can theoretically keep rolling it, as long as some fool doesn't exercise it.\n\nBUT WAIT.\n\nSomething isn't sitting well with me about that, and I've figured out what it is.\n\nThe \"fix\" here is essentially: close the position and sell a very-deep-ITM covered call, continually rolling it forward if necessary.\n\nBut, really, it's not a \"fix\", it's another position, and either it's a profitable strategy or not. Whether I lost money yesterday doesn't affect whether selling a very-deep-ITM covered call is a good way to bring in profit.\n\nSo, really, it seems like the \"fix\" for this should be no different than whatever usually is the most lucrative strategy. And what's bothering me, is, you never really hear about people selling very deep ITM covered calls... usually they're OTM. Also, deep ITM calls don't have as much extrinsic value, so it's harder to recoup over time. \n\nGoogle has a lot of results for deep ITM CC strategies...

It doesn't even really matter how far ITM or OTM the call is, the premium pricing ensures that the R:R graph all works out within the same general ballpark no matter what. I do think price is going to dip again at least temporarily, but a few weeks from now, who knows where it will be.\n\nSo, without having any idea where it's likely to go from here, I think I'll just buy to close and realize a couple grand loss now, and keep on plugging. \n\nIt's not even really a \"loss\", since I only used about 2/3 of my shares to cover the call, so I'm actually still up, just by nowhere near as much as if I hadn't sold the call.

It's August already, GME is still in lower hundreds, and I feel obliged to make my next move. After several weeks of thoughtful consideration and research, I have finally made a decision to...\n\n[Double down](https://imgur.com/a/zlXWOOh) on my bet, like any decent retard residing in this cozy place would do.\n\nBut first things first, let's revise the original bet, [the underlying post and analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/).\n\n(I’m not a financial advisor, just a retard who enjoys writing big texts and making risky bets)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter I. The short, the squeeze, and the ugly manipulation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so a couple(ish) of moths ago I handcrafted that TA thesis (on which the beard bet is based) for GME price action and its potential move to lower thousands as the short squeeze progresses:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5sldutzq33j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=361a46ce8b8d54a87703e2409bc1896e50c9ae15\n\nThe thesis above was not a generic 'you are here' type of posts you got used to seeing occasionally here and there through the last half a year. Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:\n\n[VW](https://preview.redd.it/h7b6sm9t43j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1da13436e92326b0ec63688d81f39f17574acb8)\n\n[and TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/iz041qtv43j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1174f413961be8903377068f5e41ce538f115f23)\n\n[The OC post and analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.\n\n[by Pink Floyd is one of my favourite songs](https://preview.redd.it/ncwwuqz253j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=188c089eeef5aeb0308614caba55c538e84ccbe1)\n\nDoes it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:\n\n[AMCSS, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/58sg96eg53j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b9d97cdc553fe4645cd76576d26c8b0c73122ae)\n\nLooks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nltp4a1l53j71.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e9489b7944a802185db6adc69121f72b4e546dc\n\nThere are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.\n\nYou might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.\n\nFurthermore, take a look at this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/44m2qp2q53j71.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2c9f3297506328e1c0b4a5bd4f5cfa4105a29e8\n\nWhat you see above is the screenshot from [my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwub7d/gme_to_amc_and_bb_last_week_ladies_go_first_gme/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it’s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \\*\\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\\*\\*: manipulation.\n\nApes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:\n\n[GME daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/klztgzo563j71.png?width=1614&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e54f3009eaafcd3c4aa5f4d04ef0779fe69803a)\n\nAs you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a ‘memestonk’? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **σ (sigma)** and **β (beta**).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-19/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  \n\n\n>A “black swan” event — made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life — comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren’t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A “five-sigma event” is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.\n\nCategorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.\n\nFor example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47plfcth63j71.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90c6f9cfa07676ce106f2f111b12a557f09fd8bc\n\nOne of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets’ health, and it seem to have already begun.\n\nHowever, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u/Criand:  \n\n\n>2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.\n\nI strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.\n\nTo quote another brilliant mind, u/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  \n\n\n>The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!\n\n[Wow](https://preview.redd.it/enhgxe0773j71.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6839e329715d3c47d81048d7c21054b9f218b306)\n\n*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2pb2k9qv63j71.jpg?width=358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fe0cfb61c4db4c8c26fc5a464b8f25319b6e59c\n\nThis represents what Buffet called “A Time Bomb” in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,\n\n[And when I leverage like x1.5, I GUH straight away, so unfair!](https://preview.redd.it/xct7amb273j71.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=31b3738202cdc6b3cc7de9692d5b60643a906309)\n\nand the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.\n\nThanks God, they promised not to do that again!\n\n[The scene is from ‘Inside Job’ movie, a bright reminder of what’s going to happen again, soon.](https://reddit.com/link/pa03sf/video/1rflh5jy33j71/player)\n\n\\*\\*In Tyler’s voice\\*\\* So that was a fucking lie:\n\n[Sauce: OCC's quarterly report on bank trading and derivaives, Q1 2021](https://preview.redd.it/f9xgxitt73j71.jpg?width=2224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ccec798f35738ffb3435312c556fcd18646e6bd)\n\nThe figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn’t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what’s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang’s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.\n\nAnother important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I’m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: ‘Stonks only go up’. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zfh3tjyk83j71.jpg?width=1507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb308013aac7d7c65f8cbf5130cf7a5d7abf2373\n\n>Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.\n\n  \nNo wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can’t live without the always following stimulus “dose”. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we’ll find out really soon what happens then.\n\nTo conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u/peruvian_bull again:\n\n>**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity/bond prices continue to rise, and since there’s “no risk” of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  \n>  \n>**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**\n\n# \n\n# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)\n\n  \nWell, here comes the party pooper, or it’s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nw7vw0dk93j71.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=7add7132ece80231f1451c88ba69ed3edd3878c7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebo8be5r93j71.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d68afe9f815a7723b6058a24db193828b419282\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kqwqmy9t93j71.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=1618e8580829574b8f3df117d5e837287e043405\n\nConnecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man’s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it’s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there’s no tomorrow, things look like this:\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,\n* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\nThat was just a preview.\n\nLate January events are extraordinary, that’s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it’s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).\n\nAfter a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that’s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the ‘Butterfly Effect’ movie? Oh,  \n\n\n>It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...\n\n**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I’m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn’t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/pa03sf/video/m0gwzvob43j71/player\n\n**And here is why I’m so confident in my bet and its timing:**\n\n[SPY daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/w51ks5l2b3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c7374f9a4f3d991386a6fea8c6b66108354d8f4)\n\nI mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0fjdb/this_time_its_different/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.\n\n[VIX daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/mcg9etbeh3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=728359435209bdb792327427e3cea524528d6908)\n\n[GME daily chart, log scale](https://preview.redd.it/xbskfzdkh3j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c2451c6bc584e43f1497d8ca6acc141cb8e21d4)\n\n**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon.

{"title": "The Great Unwinding: Why Cash Is Still King and Boomers Will (Once Again) Steal Your Wealth", "selftext": "Time for some hot bear smut, but this isn’t your usual flavor of doom and gloom. Also, I’ll try to not sound like “David” in the following.\n\nYou. You are an individual. As an individual, you are a basic economic unit. As a basic economic unit, you are responsible for contributing economic activity, managing your personal resources, and maximizing utility. Utility means two things in being a productive member of society AND by being content with your lifestyle. This has been studied for generations and is taught as personal finance or even home economics.\n\nAs an individual or a family, it is in your best interest to ensure you have adequate liquidity. This liquidity will allow you to meet your short term financial obligations and even your long term financial obligations. Most people talk about an emergency find which should be 6 months to 1 year of your complete living expenses. For most adults in the U.S. this figure is a minimum of $30,000 per individual in cash, either physical or in a checking account that can be quickly accessed. Most of you probably do not have these resources available. If you do not, then you should immediately stop gambling and save every red cent.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the total value of the US stock market was approximately 100 Trillion USD...maybe more. However, the total circulating supply of USD in the world was approximately 20.4 Trillion USD. That means that 80% of the total stock market value is illusory and nonexistent. This is why during 2008 and 2020 there was such a run on financial markets. Everyone was cashing in to get raw cash! The problem then, and the problem now, is that there isn’t enough money to go around. When the next market meltdown happens, it will be far more pronounced as everyone tries to convert their funny money assets into real money. This is one of the reasons why there is such a growing disparity between the rich and the poor. The poor give their money to the rich and then wonder why they are poor. \n\nAnyway, everyone knows that stock prices are super overvalued, bond prices are super overvalued, real estate is super overvalued. The only thing that is not yet overvalued, is USD.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5bx2k3qr4j71.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=dad697253b5a9eba7a28172cc27600faf853dbcd\n\nIf you are less than 30 years old, you do not get to have an opinion on inflation or the value of the USD. You simply have not lived enough to know what the fuck you’re talking about. Period. All of the “precious” metal bugs are getting their shit pushed in by JPow’s green dildo. There is inflation, but it’s in every asset class from bond prices, stonk prices, and real estate prices…not in cash. Cash is the only thing with intrinsic value because that is what we all use as a medium of exchange. It’s also what each and every one of us care about at the end of the day. Period. Every other asset is only made up of extrinsic value nowadays which is why meme stocks have been in the the driver seat. Finally, the only way the USD will stop being of any value is if the United States collapses. If that happens, you will have bigger personal issues to deal with than literally ALL of your assets going to 0. Moving on.\n\nBoomers hold most of the wealth in the United States. They also have most of their wealth tied up in the stock market and real estate market. Most boomers will be retiring en masse and as they do retire, they will be converting their mutual funds and stocks into cold hard cash. This will have a ripple effect that will make equity prices go down. While you’re stuffing real money into the slot machines of the stock market casino, boomers are gleefully taking that money from you and putting it in their pockets. The boomers didn’t take your money…you gave it to them. Further, as they begin retiring, and they have already begun, they will keep taking your money as they sell their shares to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prx326k6r4j71.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=b44b947e2be2b306a0b81f19852d510af95dc80e\n\nAlso, look at the velocity of money. The velocity of money has been in decline since the GFC and has dropped from 10.6 in 2008 all the way down to 1.18 in 2021. Shit is going to get crazy as the real economy is still fucked and there will be a reckoning soon. Soon means anywhere from a few weeks to a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball but anyone that looks around can see it. Make no mistake, it IS coming. Make sure you are properly positioned so you don’t get fucking rekt when it does. You recently saw how the market sold off over 1% last week at just the hint of the Fed talking about thinking about tapering asset purchases. That doesn’t even address the fed funds rate. Interest rates will have to go up soon. When they do, even by .25%, it will make EVERYTHING lose value. Burry was right when he called this the greatest speculative bubble of all time and that the market is dancing on a knife’s edge. Do not let yourself get fucked by the idiocy of those in power.\n\nIDGAF what you think about this, because at the end of the day, YOU and YOU ALONE have to live with yourself and your personal circumstances. It’s no skin off my ass if I see you on a street corner begging for change. I’ve already met some of you who’ve YOLO’d it all right into homelessness. I warned you. If this saves one idiot from gambling their live savings away on this negative sum game, then that is enough for me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cenmhgatt4j71.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=66a1ab0ead88b290b06c5a9409084701a6a17b06\n\nTakeaways: sell all your shit now and convert it all into USD. Hold it in money market funds or your checking account. As long as you have quick access to it for use in your personal life. If you have dependents, then get the fuck off of WSB and get your family financially prepared. I’ve seen too many deadbeat dads on here who have financially ruined their families. Don’t be that guy. If you’re single, then make sure you don’t have to move back in with mom n’ dad. Take care of your shit.\n\nAlso, make sure your career is stable and unfuck yourself if you’re on a PIP or something. Find a new job because right now wages and salaries are higher and it’s a bull market for job seekers. Start a business or a side hustle, with bonus points if it targets boomers and their wealth.\n\nPositions: 90% USD and 10% in brokerage account to gamble on OTM options. Most I can ever lose is 10% of my wealth. \n\nTLDR: Cash out your retirement, cash out your stonks, bonds, and everything. DUMP IT before Boomers do it first. Cash is still king and you will need the liquidity to personally weather the storm during the coming crisis. Only gamble 10% of your total net worth in risky stonks or options at any given time. DO NOT YOLO. Gambling on the stock market is fine as long as you’re using money that you can literally afford to lose. e.g. no more than 10% of your net worth at any given point\\*.\n\n\\*Don’t use the 10% rule as an excuse to chop yourself up into bits before ending up broke. This means if you’re only worth $10,000 then the most you can gamble is $1,000. If you lose it, then you’re done until you save another $1,000 to then gamble. It does not mean lose $1,000, then take 10% of $9,000. Again, this is all on you. If you fuck yourself then you have to live with it, not me.", "id": "pa33xi", "created_utc": 1629735352.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.56, "num_comments": 241, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|362|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pa33xi/the_great_unwinding_why_cash_is_still_king_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/modtjd/facebook_an_undervalued_gem/) \n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 178, "replies": [{"body": "Seriously I’ve met a fuck ton of rich boomers in my time and every single one of them would rather die than sell their assets off all at once haha", "score": 141, "replies": [{"body": "Seriously, I know boomers that would go to a part time job over selling during a downturn.", "score": 61, "replies": []}, {"body": "Boomers own so much property we may as well call them M’Lord", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Lol..this was one doomsday scenario that is not well thought out. \n\nSo one day i decide to retire.

This is like the retarded cousin of the Buffet indicator (market value to gdp).\n\n Market cap is based on stock price, which is based on trading.  Even value investors accept price to earnings multipliers,  and more importantly, forward earnings for valuation. The Buffet indicator recognizes that the value of the company is based on earnings plus assets. \n\nI think you should read the chapter in wealth of nations about money. The cash in the economy is like a river that flows in the opposite direction of value. People trade money for things they value, so they get the value and send the money. Even during the era of precious metal currency, banks invented cash (notes) to provide liquidity *as a means to promote commerce*. The amount of money is arbitrary and the value adjusts to how much is needed to move value through the system. If there's not enough money in the system, prices go up because the money itself becomes too valuable. Bit corn is proving this right now. \n\nYou also have a bad fact... in 2005 velocity was 2.01, not 10. So velocity has slipped from 2 to 1.1. It's hard to say what the right number is, but it was 1.8 from around 1960 to 1990. An era that saw both stagflation in the 70s and a market boom in the 80s. The high interest rates of the 80s might suggest there was a money shortage, and that the real estate industry could have done better if the fed had a larger balance sheet. \n\nPennsylvania tried to mandate that gold and cash be treated as equal pre revolution, but the cost of goods went up accordingly, because the cash wasn't backed by enough gold.  They literally deflated gold, thinking it would help their currency.  The ISM isn't showing that this time,  though.  We're seeing real production shortages driving up prices and labor demands paying higher wages. The dollar, relative to other currencies isn't making big moves. It would be very concerning if supply and demand was constant, but prices rise anyways. The data just doesn't show that right now. \n\nMoney printing isn't a good thing, but to say it's bad it's incredibly difficult because valuation is based on money moving through the system, not how much there is.

They're so stupid they make [u/1R0NYMAN](https://www.reddit.com/user/1R0NYMAN) and [u/ControlTheNarrative](https://www.reddit.com/user/ControlTheNarrative) look like a bunch of undergrads gambling with their rent money.\n\n\"Why should I care? I can already lose money very nicely on my own\". Well because, learning a bit more about the history of the market probably won't hurt, since you're probably still wondering how shorting a stock work and the greeks are just an old civilization for you. I also want you to pay attention to the mistake these gamblers made, so we can all stop writing off our donations to our favorite Market Makers.\n\nAnd it's also a nice story to tell the Goldman intern you met at your local bar. Maybe you'll impress her maybe not. I'm not sure your wife's boyfriend will find much interest in it, though. He's still trying to file a lawsuit against RH, we'll see where that leads him. Anyways, if you'd rather max out your credit card to double down on MVST that's your choice, for the other's let's dive right in.\n\nToday we'll talk about Baring's Bank. Founded in 1762 Barings bank was an English institution associated with class longevity and strength so much so that even the queen of England had an account with them then in 1995 this grand banking legacy was destroyed single-handedly by **one trader, Nick Leeson.** First, we need to quickly talk about futures.\n\n**Futures 101**\n\nI'll be quick this time. Essentially, futures are like options but they **oblige** each party to buy or sell random garbage at a pre-defined price and date. With futures, you have to deliver the goods or cash on the settlement date. In some cases, futures contracts will require physical delivery. In this scenario, the investor holding the contract upon expiration would be responsible for storing the goods and would need to cover costs for material handling, physical storage, and insurance.\n\nAssume two gamblers enter into a one-year Crude Oil Futures contract at a futures price of $58.40 (think of it as the strike price). Regardless of the commodity’s spot price on the settlement date, the buyer is **obligated** to purchase 1,000 barrels of crude oil from the seller. If the spot price on the agreed settlement day is below $58.40, the long contract holder loses, and the short position gains. The long can just buy on the open market for less than 58.40$. Just like for a call, why would exercise a 100C if the stock trades for 90$. If the spot price is above the futures price of $58.40, the long position profits, and the seller records a loss.\n\nWhy does this matter? When you buy an option, you have a limited loss, you can only lose your premium. Futures are a **lot riskier.** Futures are highly leveraged. Indeed, when buying a futures, your broker only asks you to put a fraction of the value of the contract up front. Usually between 1/10 and 1/20 of the value of the contract, but sometimes even less! You could be buying. You could be trading a futures worth 100'000$ with just a mere 2'000$ depending on the contract. What you put upfront is called initial margin.\n\nYour position is then adjusted daily. Whatever you win is added to your 2'000$ balance, but whatever you lose is deducted from that. In our case, just a 2% downward move is enough to wipe out your 2'000$, when that happens you get the dreaded \"margin call\" (I bet most of you are familiar with that) and you have to put more money upfront to cover your losses and keep your positions open. Otherwise, you can say goodbye to your house and your vintage Pokemon Card collection.\n\nIt gets a lot more complex, I don't want to see a wannabe nerd in the comments flexing about his Investopedia knowledge, let's have a proper intellectual brawl in the DMs.\n\n**An English Man With Big Balls and a Small Brain**\n\nOur degenerate trader was born in England, an unimpressive student, with an average educational performance. Our degenerate was desperate to become a trader, so much so that he quit Morgan Stanley because he didn't get promoted to trader there.\n\nBaring's bank was stupid enough to give him a job. Leeson was an OG Savage, the dude said he never heard of the bank before applying and deeply despised them. Barings was no ordinary bank, it catered to the most affluent class of people in the banking industry. The Baring's name was respected, it was a very safe bank and they could raise capital very easily. Behind the scenes, its operations were struggling to keep up with the modern banking world. Think about RH vs a real broker like IBKR, just a totally different environment\n\nFrom his position as one of the bank's bookkeepers it didn't take him very long to find flaws in how the bank operated Baring's bank was crumbling during a time when most other financial institutions were thriving. Feeding on the good standing that comes with two centuries of global trading, it would survive though much like it always had. What bearings wouldn't survive would be hiring Nick Leeson, quite a flex.\n\nBarings offered him the position of a trader. He would be in charge of a newly founded futures division in Singapore, and losing money **professionally**. This was the opportunity that Leeson had been waiting for and quite possibly the worst decision that Barings had ever made. Barings shortly got the approval to trade in Singapore and it was go-time. Trading primarily on the Nikkei (the S&P in Japan) Nick thoroughly enjoyed the stress and pressure of futures trading.\n\nOn behalf of his clients, Leeson was primarily trading futures on the Nikkei, the primary index in Tokyo. Leeson should have been managing a **cash-neutral business**. This strategy entails managing an investment portfolio without adding any capital. Unlike, your broke-ass trading account, banks don't like adding cash to parts of the business that lose money.\n\nIn Leeson's case, if money was made or lost on the trades, it would have belonged to the clients. Let me be clear, most of you think traders at banks are just fancier versions of yourselves with a suit and a degree, but no. At banks, 99% of the transactions are traded **on behalf of clients.** There's no smarty pants Garry who risks the banks money because he has a Bloomberg Terminal and a fancy suit.\n\nBarings' only compensation on the trades should have been a commission, and only a small amount of the trades were meant to be proprietary, or on behalf of the bank itself. However, Leeson was no ordinary banker. Foods Stamps or Lambo, he quickly began making unauthorized trades. At first, these risky positions made large profits for the bank: as much as £10 million, accounting for 10% of Barings' annual profit in 1992.\n\nBecause Barings had given him the responsibility of double-checking his own trades, rather than reporting them to a superior, Leeson was able to hide the losses from his bad trades in a secret account...\n\n**Account 88888 and the beginning of the downfall**\n\nUnlike you and me, when we YOLO our family's savings into SPY calls or AAL lotto's (thinking of [u/luhkyskills](https://www.reddit.com/user/luhkyskills)), and we take a big fat L, well we just have to suck it and go to our weekly shift at Wendy's. Leeson, however, was too good for that and he chose another strategy to hide his losses.\n\nOn July 3, 1992, only two days after Barings was granted membership by SIMEX, Leeson opened Account 88888, and that same day, the first transaction was booked in this account. Apparently, Lesson asked one of his Chinese co-workers what her favorite number was, she said 8. In China, 8 is known to be the luckiest number of all, so Leeson said we might as well get all the luck we can get, let's name the account 88888, we'll see how that worked out for him.\n\nOn Baring’s system, this account was described as **an error account**. It is common for traders to set up such an account for the purpose of netting minor trading mistakes.\n\nThe net position should be closed each day and the net value of gains and losses incurred in negating the position should be recorded as part of the unit’s daily profit Leeson. However, already during the first month of its existence, a large number of transactions were booked in Account 88888, which shows according to the Singapore Report that it could never have been intended to serve solely as an error account. As a matter of fact, Leeson gave specific instructions around July 8, 1992, to ensure that his actions would not be transparent.\n\n*“The first time I do anything, I’m not expecting to survive more than two days,”* he later recounted. But head office kept sending the funds needed to cover margin payments and Leeson began to understand that he could successfully hide his mistakes. *“As you get past the two-day period, then you start to get more confidence because it isn’t being found. To me it’s obvious, if they can’t see it after two days then they are not going to see it after 200 days, 500 days, 1,000 days. It’s easy.”*\n\nDuring 1993, the main focus of Leeson’s unauthorized speculative positions in Account 88888 was the generation of profits in the ordinary trading accounts for their clients or proprietary traders. This enabled Leeson to gain a reputation as a star trader on SIMEX and enhanced his intra firm executive standing. However, by the end of 1993, the cumulative losses in Account 88888 were over ¥4 billion about US$35.8 million, which made the situation much more complex. Leeson’s main problem became the management of the flow of funds to support the margin calls from SIMEX.\n\nAn important way to arrange the funding was by manipulating the trading and accounting records. This was done in a number of ways. First, most transactions booked in Account 88888 were initially booked in the accounts of Barings. If these positions had been correctly reported to management, it would have been clear that risk limits had been exceeded, since such transactions were not hedged.\n\nHowever, Leeson would execute offsetting trades about 30 seconds before market close to place transactions from Baring's accounts into Account 88888. With these so-called transfer trades, Leeson avoided disclosure of unhedged positions in the reports to Baring's. The prices of these transfer trades were later adjusted to favor Barings, at the expense of Account 88888, in order to confirm his reputation as an exceptional trader.\n\nThis would often require complicated alterations between different sets of records. A second way to manipulate the records was to record fictitious trades between the accounts of Barings and Account 88888 in the daily list of transactions when no transfer trades had been executed. The effect was that unhedged positions were transferred from the Barings accounts to Account 88888, so that no unhedged positions were reported at the end of the day.\n\nFinally, Leeson often instructed his settlements staff to record fictitious trades in the accounting system. These fictitious trades were reversed at the opening of the market on the following day. The purpose was to reduce end-of-day open positions in Nikkei and JGB futures, in Barings accounting records, and consequently, in the SIMEX computer system. This practice effectively reduced margin calls from SIMEX.\n\nDespite the manipulations of the books, the funds needed for SIMEX’s margin calls steadily increased. Leeson used a number of methods to convince Barings' management of the necessity to transfer large sums of money to Singapore, and it worked pretty darn well, I wish I had the same success when asking my grandma for more gambling money.\n\nIn addition to the funds transferred from London, Leeson sold options on the Nikkei index through Account 88888 from the start of 1993. From January 1994, the position in Nikkei options increased significantly when Leeson set up a large series of short straddle positions\n\n**Positions in February 1995**\n\nThe total monthly trading volume through Account 88888 increased from 2051 in July 1992 to a peak of 96,121 in September 1994. In January 1995, the total was 90,000 contracts SR3.14 or about 7.5% of total trading volume. There had been a similar growth in the trading of JGB futures. By November 1994, the volume of JGB futures transacted through Account 88888 represented 24% of the total volume on SIMEX. The volume of Leeson’s unhedged JGB position in the 88888-account also increased, in particular during the 2 months leading up to Barings’ collapse. Eventually, his short position was over 28,000 contracts. Leeson started to trade Euroyen futures through the 88888-account in October 1993, but after that month, his transactions in this market were limited to certain short time intervals only. The eventual loss on these Euroyen positions was ‘only'£3 million BoE,\n\n**Selling Straddles**\n\nLet's say you're on RH and have used up all of the money you borrowed on FD's. That's quite a bummer, as you've just read an awful DD on a pre-revenue company and you'd love to buy some illiquid calls on this garbage stock. What can you do to get some funds?\n\nThe largest part of Barings’ losses came from a massive long position in Nikkei futures. Until October 1993, Leeson’s losses were always recovered. After that, losses increased gradually but accelerated in the final 2 months leading up to the collapse of Barings. During that final stage, Leeson expanded his long position in Nikkei futures to 49% of the open interest in the March 1995 contract and 24% in the June 1995 contract.\n\nLeeson earned revenues to pay his margin calls by selling short straddles. A short straddle is a strategy a short put option and a short call option with the same strike prices are simultaneously combined. The only way a short straddle can earn profits is if the price of the underlying asset does not move substantially in either direction. A short straddle looks like a mountain or an iceberg, with most of its mass underwater (i.e., below zero). Notice how little of the straddle is above zero, compared to the total profit-and-loss profile. The portion of the short straddle that is above zero depends on the size of the premium relative to the total exposure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Profit and Loss of a Short Straddle](https://preview.redd.it/i0r04nuzx4j71.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=df85eaea19c70637ab639b94f09da0e469a109a1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Profit and Loss of a Futures Position and a Straddle](https://preview.redd.it/a5tjk1xey4j71.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=2943eb973e4e7b8b2a26676d1c36577fa1f1404e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Combining a Short Straddle and a Long Futures Contract**\n\nIt is important to remember that the short straddle positions taken by Leeson did not occur in isolation. Leeson combined his short straddles with long futures positions. For every straddle he sold, Barings got cash, and Leeson used the cash to pay the required initial margin deposits on new trades and also to meet the mounting margin calls on his existing stock index futures positions.\n\nThat's like next-level stupid, I hope most of you understand that you shouldn't use the credit you get when selling naked options to take even more risk.\n\n[Profit and Loss of One Long Futures + One Short Straddle](https://preview.redd.it/0yhkg8thx4j71.png?width=1029&format=png&auto=webp&s=2214a4687836038de3346bd4c424812142e08cd8)\n\nAs you can see, to profit from the long futures position, the stock price had to rise above the futures price, but if it rose too much, every yen of gain made on the futures position would be offset by losses on the short straddle (on the short call portion of the straddle). On the downside, the situation was much riskier. A decline in the stock price caused simultaneous losses on the futures position and the straddle position (the short put portion of the straddle, because when you buy a put you happy when stock go down, so when you sell put you sad when stock go down). The only thing standing in the way of losses at almost every price level was the premium that was collected upfront, at the time the straddle was sold shows the profit-and-loss profile created when the short straddle and a long futures position (see Exhibit 7.5) are combined. It is similar to a short put, except that the downward-sloping portion of the pro-file is even steeper than usual, because the long futures contract incurs losses as the underlying asset’s price falls below the futures price, and the short straddle incurs losses as the underlying asset’s price falls below the strike price. As you can well imagine, the combination of his short straddles and long futures made it more difficult, but certainly not impossible, for Barings to audit Leeson’s net exposures.\n\nshows that the gains from a short put position are capped. By contrast, the potential losses could be enormous if the asset price (e.g., the Nikkei 225 index) fell\n\n**Combining a Long Futures Position and Numerous Short Puts**\n\nThe profit-and-loss profile from combining a short straddle and a long futures position (see Exhibit 7.6) gives the illusion that Leeson had a viable trading strategy, and he just guessed wrong in terms of the price movement shows a large span of prices to the right of the strike price, which offers, at least, a glimmer of hope that profits could be earned. Unfortunately, we will find that this was not the case. In fact, Barings would have been lucky if Leeson had put the bank in such a position. The illusion is revealed once you realize that Leeson’s need for large sums of cash to fund his margin calls forced him to sell disproportionate numbers of short straddles for each long futures position he took. Exhibit 7.6 shows the results if one long futures contract is combined with one short straddle, but this one-for-one combination was not what Leeson did. Rather, he combined numerous short straddles with each long futures position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis figure shows the profit-and-loss profile when numerous short straddles are combined with a long forward contract. The hybrid payoff profile looks, again, like an iceberg, because 90% or more is underwater. The only outcome that could have been even slightly profitable was if Japanese stock prices hovered at or near their current levels, in which case the stock index futures contracts would have generated small gains, and the put and call options would have expired out of the money. If stock prices rose too much, the gains on the futures contracts would have been overwhelmed by the losses on the mountain of short calls. If stock prices fell, the losses on the long futures would have been amplified by the losses on the mountain of short puts.\n\n**The unavoidable happened**\n\nBy 31 December 1994, Leeson had accumulated losses of £208 million. Japanese stocks never rose above 19,000, there was an earthquake in Kobe on 17 January 1995, and Japan’s long-awaited recovery was pushed farther and farther into the future. He was left holding a massive bag.\n\nAfter the earthquake, the Nikkei Index fell to 18,950, forcing Leeson to engage in an even more frantic and massive operation that looked, in retrospect, like a single-handed effort to hold Japanese stock prices at the 19,000 level. The dude tried to P&D himself, quite successfully at the beginning, but that didn't last.\n\nOver the next five trading days, Leeson bought a total of more than 20,000 futures contracts, and by 22 February 1995 his aggregate position was over 61,000 futures contracts. Despite his frantic buying, Japanese common stocks fell sharply, and on Monday, 23 January 1995, the Nikkei index fell 1,000 points to 17,950. For Leeson, theend was near. By February 1995, his losses had reached an astounding £830million.\n\nAs enormous as his losses were after the stunning drop in Japanese stock prices, Leeson’s strategy could still have worked if he had been able to buy enough contracts to pull the index back up above 19,000, and it was for this reason that Leeson continued to sell straddles. As Exhibit 7.8 shows, if Barings could have held on until December 1995, Leeson’s spectacular losses would have turned into gains, because the Nikkei 225 stock index prices rose by more than 5,000 from July until the end of the year. Leeson continued trying to raise Japanese stock prices through the last weeks of January 1995 and into February 1995, but the wave of selling was too great, and he was unsuccessful in his attempts. Yeah you heard it correctly, this mf was about to diamonds hand and make gains big enough to buy his employer. Imagine being able to buy RH with your gains.\n\n[Buy High Sell Low](https://i.redd.it/fbywlccdx4j71.gif)\n\nThen Leeson went on vacation with his wife, they ended up fleeing Singapore on February 23, 1995. In the end, his losses accounted for £827 million (or $1.4 billion), twice Barings's available trading capital.\n\nLeeson was arrested in Germany and, after a failed bailout attempt, Barings went bankrupt on February 26, 1995. He was sentenced to six and a half years in prison in Singapore. While he was in prison, Leeson wrote his book, \"Rogue Trader.\" In 1999, Leeson's book was made into a film of the same name and starring Ewan McGregor and Anna Friel.\n\nUp until the year 2008, Leeson held the record for the most losses due to unrestricted trades. In 2008, the French bank Société Générale announced that a rogue trader named Jerome Kerviel had lost more than seven billion dollars by conducting a series of unauthorized and false trades.\n\nThat's all good but what is the main takeaway we can get out of this horror story.\n\n**Doubling and Managing Losses**\n\nThat managers take additional risks to escape from a threatening situation is a well-known theme in the field of managerial decision making. For example, it is known that people will take greater risks to escape losses than to secure gains. As a consequence, people’s behavior tends to change in unexpected and unattractive ways when they are confronted with increasing losses.\n\nThus in finance, the fear of falling is constantly in the background and sometimes can lure people into disastrous activities. Individuals can become gripped by a frantic panic and may try to conceal these losses or double up their bets like crazed gamblers trying to punt their way out of their mounting debts. This is the classic gambler’s fallacy.\n\nIn the case of Leeson, we clearly see a degenerate who seeks to become the master of the universe, managing to gain a reputation as a star performer. Leeson tried at all cost not to lose that image. When losses were mounting, he followed a strategy of continuously expanding his position. A quote from Leeson 1996 may illustrate our point:\n\n*\"I felt no elation at this success. I was determined to win back the losses. And as the spring wore on, I traded harder and harder, risking more and more. I was well down, but increasingly sure that my doubling up and doubling up would pay off . . . I redoubled my exposure. The risk was that the market could crumble down, but on this occasion, it carried on upwards . . . As the market soared in July 1993 my position translated from a £6 million loss back into glorious profit. I was so happy that night I didn’t think I’d ever go through that kind of tension again. I’d pulled back a large position simply by holding my nerve . . . but first thing on Monday morning I found that I had to use the 88888-account again. it became an addiction.\"*\n\nAn important attribute of doubling strategies is that the inevitable and devastating loss is preceded by a period of high returns with low volatility. Conditional on the bad event not having happened yet, the doubler’s investment performance appears to indicate significant **investment skill.**\n\nThis to me is very similar to the feeling we get after taking a big loss in a position.

{"title": "My Bearish Bet on Lucid Motors", "selftext": "Hello everyone, some of you might know me from my prior DD. It's been a minute since my last DD. To preface this, after this bear bet, I've decided to largely go back to long(er) term options plays. I'll be writing about those later.\n\nNow, without further ado, I have been bearish on Lucid for awhile now in private conversations. I'll speak about the fundamentals later on in this post, but I wanted to focus on short term micro-trends for a bit. As you may well be aware, Lucid had a division whereby 69% of its equity was rolled over under the terms of the SPAC and 10.5% went to PIPE investors at a heightened offering of 15$ per share. The rest went to spac holders.\n\nThe reason for the heightened price was because unlike the roll over equity which has a 6 month lock up period, the PIPE investors only have a 1 month lock-up period which expires on the 1st of September. Traditionally, firms that have paid higher IPO prices have done so because they then scalp retail investors on the first day of an investor by selling it at a mark up. I see no reason why at current prices, these investors would not do so. As it stands right now, it would be a 43.33% mark up to what they paid for a month of waiting.\n\nThe market understands the volatility this will bring, which is why options are so high. Initially i wanted to get January 2022 or 2023 calls, but the IV is significantly high for even these companies. Furthermore, the price has been trending down as investors in the know exit in preparation of the severe buying pressure. While some may argue that the names behind the PIPE wouldn't sell, the truth of the matter is that they are likely eyeing the deteriorating share price and each other with concern. The way that I would most likely categorize this is a Texas standoff, which would soon devolve into a turkey shoot. You need not look far to see the effect this would have as the severe selling pressure, and small float relative to the selling pressure will have strong downward pressures on the stock which will likely compound as stop losses and retail investors head for the exits after bearing significant losses. SOFI comes to mind.\n\nI'll briefly speak about the fundamentals of the company, even though this isn't really a long term bearish play. This company does not have economies of scale like GM, Ford, or Stellantis. This means that it doesn't have the ability to absorb high commodity costs as well as them, or so easily source chips. More specifically when I refer to commodity costs, I am especially looking at steel and aluminum. Furthermore, I look at the supply chain and logistics issues, and can't help but feel they do not have economies of scale there either. In short margin compression will be real, and they will not have the economies of scale that their competitors do to negotiate better bulk rates.\n\nTo add to this, they do not have the first movers advantage that Tesla had, nor its free marketing which allowed them to have virtually no advertising spend. They also need to produce vehicles to get regulatory credits to sell to other car companies, except those car companies are rapidly going green which means they need to buy less regulatory credits (with that said, they're more likely to buy those credits from Tesla than Lucid).\n\nI also don't believe that they will be starting to manufacture the cars anytime soon this year (if they eve do). If they actually keep to their H2 schedule for the start of production, I believe that it will only be in late November/ early December. Their goal of 20,000 in sales for their luxury vehicle in 2022 would significantly outperform the Mustang Mach E (Which outsold the Model s), the Porsche Taycan, and every other electric sports car out there. While they may get sales to SA considering it's investments in Lucid, the logistics costs (Spot container shipping costs) and manufacturing costs would be extravagant and deeply cut into margins. Not to mention figuring out how to source the chips.\n\nFinally, I don't think that this company is being realistic in its goals (1.689B in net income by the end of 2026, I mean come on) and considering the 1.62B shares outstanding (not including warrants) and the share based compensation that will accrue, I can't fault myself for thinking that the companies EPS even if it matched them would be unappetizing for the amount of risk involved. It would leave them with an EPS of roughly 1, which would give them a forward P/E valuation of roughly 21.5 for 2026. GM has a p/e below 5.7, while having a proven CEO with a solid vision. With that said, let's not kid ourselves and think there will not be delays to their various product lines, and other various hiccups.\n\nIf you want to invest in electric cars, do what the smart investors of old did. Invest in people that win if the sector wins, not those competing within the sector. Battery makers, lithium/nickel miners, chip manufacturers and designers, and other assorted things that go into -every- car.\n\n[Lucid Motors to Go Public in Merger with Churchill Capital Corp IV, Bolstering Lucid’s Vision to Redefine Luxury, Performance and Efficiency in the Sustainable Electric Vehicle Market | Lucid Group, Inc.](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lucid-motors-go-public-merger-churchill-capital-corp-iv)\n\n[4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063 (lucidmotors.com)](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/static-files/4b5537f8-4529-4bb4-8572-0eb2c41b3063)\n\nMy position is on the smaller side relative to my long term positions: [LCID $21.5 Put - $2.72 | Robinhood and 17 more pages - Personal - Microsoft​ Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/a4623dac2c917f2370fb22073eb3b8aa)\n\nI might open a parallel short position, but i'm undecided.

In the fiscal year 2019, Apple's services business posted gross margins of 63.7%, approaching double the 32.2% gross margin of the company's product sector. As a whole, Apple's subscription business (including subscription apps) grew 40% year-over-year. This revenue comes from selling a range of services, such as iCloud storage services, Apple Music subscriptions, and AppleCare warranties. According to Apple, there are over 450 million paid subscriptions on Apple’s platform.  \nIn 2010, Apple's services business revenue generated only $5.2 billion in revenue. Over the next two years, it nearly doubled to $10.2 billion. Quarterly services revenue has skyrocketed since then, and Apple's CEO Tim Cook has made it a goal to speed up that growth. Recently, there have been several additions to Apple’s services business, including a streaming movie and TV service, a new video game subscription, and the Apple Card, which will compete against other financial payment giants.  \nThe performance of some of these new services, such as Apple Arcade and Apple TV+, are reflected for the first time in the financial results for Q1 2020.\"\n\n\"Apple’s services business is led by the App Store and Apple Music. In May 2019, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson claimed that Apple had evolved its service business so much that it was worth $502 billion, using an analysis that assesses the value of each business unit and then combines them together for an overall valuation estimate. At the same time, Olson estimated that Apple's hardware business was only worth $398.8 billion.

I'll speak about the fundamentals later on in this post, but I wanted to focus on short term micro-trends for a bit. As you may well be aware, Lucid had a division whereby 69% of its equity was rolled over under the terms of the SPAC and 10.5% went to PIPE investors at a heightened offering of 15$ per share. The rest went to spac holders.\n\nThe reason for the heightened price was because unlike the roll over equity which has a 6 month lock up period, the PIPE investors only have a 1 month lock-up period which expires on the 1st of September. Traditionally, firms that have paid higher IPO prices have done so because they then scalp retail investors on the first day of an investor by selling it at a mark up. I see no reason why at current prices, these investors would not do so. As it stands right now, it would be a 43.33% mark up to what they paid for a month of waiting.\n\nThe market understands the volatility this will bring, which is why options are so high. Initially i wanted to get January 2022 or 2023 calls, but the IV is significantly high for even these companies. Furthermore, the price has been trending down as investors in the know exit in preparation of the severe buying pressure. While some may argue that the names behind the PIPE wouldn't sell, the truth of the matter is that they are likely eyeing the deteriorating share price and each other with concern. The way that I would most likely categorize this is a Texas standoff, which would soon devolve into a turkey shoot. You need not look far to see the effect this would have as the severe selling pressure, and small float relative to the selling pressure will have strong downward pressures on the stock which will likely compound as stop losses and retail investors head for the exits after bearing significant losses. SOFI comes to mind.\n\nI'll briefly speak about the fundamentals of the company, even though this isn't really a long term bearish play.\"\n\n[https://gyazo.com/57e3e212076a7a9664ee23c776c41b64](https://gyazo.com/57e3e212076a7a9664ee23c776c41b64)\n\nAnd it's starting to look ripe for another bear DD, but I'm going to wait before I re-enter until they do that factory presentation.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "🤡", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The bigger the rise, the harder the fall.

You should view them as wild guesses.\n* I'm long SLQT via a basket of options and shares.   Something something.  Ok, I think I've exceeded the attention span of the average ape, so I will begin my analysis.\n\n# Background on SLQT\n\nSelectQuote (SLQT) is an insurance agency that specializes in selling healthcare to seniors, life insurance and home/auto insurance.   Yeah, I know, it's not a mattress company.\n\nOne of your key drivers in a business like this is your ability to attract and retain licensed insurance agents as most of these policies are sold over the phone.  Retention is key as most revenue happens during the annual October 15 - December 7 Medicare open enrollment period.   During the rest of the year, the goal is to keep you agents happy and productive any way you can in order to have them ready for peak season, as agents are your limiting factor.\n\nAugust 25th PM is annual earnings, which means we get our annual forecast as well.  SQLT's fiscal year ends June 30.\n\n# May 3 Pharmacy Announcement\n\nIMO, what makes this play interesting is that the core business in undervalued AND there is a new adjunct business (pharmacy) that should power a solid FY2022 that was announced on May 3.   There was a [press release](https://ir.selectquote.com/news/news-details/2021/SelectQuote-Announces-Expansion-Into-Healthcare-Services-With-Launch-of-Population-Health/default.aspx), [an investor presentation](https://s23.q4cdn.com/545595037/files/doc_presentation/2021/05/Population-Health-Launch-Slides-v30-FINAL.pdf), and [an investor conference call](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3106081/0357ACC54E4B22493CE855E7B85D87DF).   I highly recommend you review all three.   All of this should become apparent with annual guidance in a few days.\n\nSlide 19 - May 3 Investor Presentation:\n\n[You can fit so many Boomers in this pharmacy!](https://preview.redd.it/gcu3hxeel6j71.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=789578151237042350f1b70d5492e82996e73843)\n\nSlide 20 - May 3 Investor Presentation:\n\n[Numbers, numbers, numbers](https://preview.redd.it/0qzgpsjil6j71.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=e95ba2dcb177b82de31330d189e1f86bbeb46310)\n\nWe learn from the investor conference call and the recent earnings call that SLQT had an 80% opt-in rate and 30,000 members sign up for Population Health in about the first month of operations.   We also learned that they are going back and contacting previous sales with this initiative with an 85% successful contact rate, in addition to pitching Population Health to current sales (500k policies per year per slide 19).   Population Health is a free advisory service that they use to advise people to use their pharmacy:  SelectRx.\n\nI took their low estimate of 50k members using the pharmacy and straight lined it to 100k members over FY 2022 to create my own estimate of direct incremental impact to the business from their pharmacy.   This assumes a 10% attach rate growing to a 20% attach rate on 500k policies sold--far lower than the 80% of people opting into Population Health.   We also don't know how successful their historical outreach will be in terms of pharmacy conversions (they only stated an 85% contact rate--which is way high... old people have nothing better to do than answer their phones...).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Drug dealing is very profitable.](https://preview.redd.it/djhg13ell6j71.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8041055a6a42d6b6aec395958c68230e030dc9b)\n\nSo, I'm forecasting a 320.4M increase in revenue due to the pharmacy and 32.4M increase in EBITDA, which in this case should largely flow to net income.  I add these to my forecast for the core business.\n\n# Core Business\n\nFY 2022 Quarterly Forecast - Low Growth\n\n[My \\\\\"low\\\\\" forecast](https://preview.redd.it/s8cqaq0tl6j71.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=f84ec83409bf7e48c5fdbaf6c2aa7d8b4e2b2dc4)\n\nFY 2022 Quarterly Forecast - High Growth\n\n[My \\\\\"high\\\\\" forecast](https://preview.redd.it/zyds77gvl6j71.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f858b842edc4a0b32cccb556db3a6ff39f0293a)\n\nThe core business has been growing at quite a clip.  As of this moment I'm writing, the stock is trading at $13.57, which is a measly 16.35x trailing twelve months Net Income, when you assume the midpoint of guidance for calendar quarter Q2 2021 (which is FY Q4) that was provided on the last earnings call.  This is very intriguing when you look at recent growth rates of the business over the previous quarters (90.54% YoY, 103.22% YoY, and 79.62% YoY).\n\nThe yellow highlight is a discrepancy I found between reported EPS (which was reported massively negative) and net income (which was reported massively positive).  Since we don't believe in math or fundamentals around here, I simply put the EPS based upon the Net Income divided by shares reported and highlighted it in yellow to make me look like I have something intelligent to say about it, but I really don't.  I'm going to pull a Biden and say that something that happened 4 or 5 quarters ago just doesn't matter.\n\nThat being said, the reason for the drop after the May earnings call (the May pharmacy announcement did pretty much nothing to the price action) was the guidance that showed deceleration in growth to 27.70% for Q2 2021 CY (the number in a red box).   We had a second drop off in the last few weeks when GoHealth had a train wreck of an earnings call.   I'm betting SLQT goes the other way, especially when you consider the guidance for FY 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My FY2022 range of forecasts](https://preview.redd.it/1zuypbgpl6j71.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b93f829c8969fa67d258380f67da8d20ebe67d)\n\nClearly to get an understanding of where this business is going, we need to accurately predict YoY sales growth on a quarterly basis for the core business (YoY by quarter is going to be a decent representation given the seasonal nature of insurance sales).\n\nI proposed two different sales growth scenarios on the core business:\n\n1. On the high side, growth decelerates to 80%, 80%, 80%, & 25% (a strong Q3 will be an anomaly due to a special enrollment period that ended August 15, but it is present nonetheless in the forecast)\n2. On the low side, the QoQ growth deceleration into CYQ2 represents the beginning of the collapse in growth:  25% YoY for all four quarters.\n\nIn both cases, these are forecasts for the core business of insurance sales.   I layer on pharmacy sales based upon the forecasts provided by the company on the May 3rd presentation, but rather than taking a midpoint, I straight line member growth over the year between the low to the high, and I assume the lower number of 6 Rx's per patient.   For Pharmacy gross margins, I use the forecasted ratio (the worst one).   I assume no marketing, as this is what they said in their pharmacy call.\n\n# Stock Price Predictions\n\nYou can see from the above chart, if we keep the low P/E ratio of 16.35x for a fast growing company, we end up with a price target between $18.74 to $28.45 based upon forecasted Net Income.  My low estimate of $1.15 is lower than the [Marketbeat consensus](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SLQT/earnings/) of $1.23 for next year as well.\n\nA few key points on my prediction:\n\n* I believe that market will adjust the price of this stock abruptly in the next few days due to FY2022 earnings guidance coming out and then gradually over the coming quarter.\n* I believe the market largely ignored SLQT when it started discussing pharmacy on May 3rd and the conference call a few days later.   This is a key strategic push for them, and according to the CFO on the last call, is one of three key drivers for FY22 (in addition to LHA and Senior).\n* I believe the market has mispriced the core business as well.   The GoHealth driven drop was a bad sympathy play that created a great entry.   Without that drop, the market was pricing in a total collapse in the growth vector of this company, which I just don't believe.    The insurance sales market is very lumpy with its seasonality.   Some quarters aren't going to grow as strong as others due to timing of open enrollment periods and market potential (or, in better words, lack thereof).   I expect previously strong growth quarters to decelerate, but not so drastically as a reduction to 25% YoY across the board.\n\n# My Positions\n\n[Via Excel](https://preview.redd.it/9w2pi3m3m6j71.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d01480c5e8335757acc7677aa28bd5009f606a0)\n\n[Via Thinkorswim](https://preview.redd.it/649k93xem6j71.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce4412e29ff4b593046fbfbdf3afce92a5c5977a)\n\nI played my positions according to my thesis.  I believe we have an immediate correction back up to where we were before GoHealth.   And then I believe we have a gradual rise to $20 over the coming quarter.\n\nI bought some Sep 20c as well because I'm a degenerate.\n\nEDIT:   Sorry guys.   I totally screwed up.

{"title": "Why Upstart Will Make You a Millionaire.. in 5-10 years", "selftext": "Ok, maybe not a millionaire, but the upside potential here is ridiculous... hear me out.\n\n### Executive degen 🚀🚀 TLDR summary:\n\n- New IPO (Dec 2020).\n- Seeking to disrupt a huge market ($4.2 trillion).\n- They have the best tech in the space, with a 9 year lead in lending AI/ML (very good moat).\n- Exceptional leadership, with founders being high level Google execs who left to start the company.\n- Incredible financial results reported in their Q2'2021, growing +10x as much as the likes of TSLA.\n- No fear of regulation as they have a \"No Action\" letter from US government body.\n- Still at the very tip of their growth journey, having only 4% market share of the unsecured personal loan space = massive growth runway.\n\n\n### For visual learners:\n\nI've also made a video about this review, if like me you're more of a visual learner, and can get over my monotonous voice feel free to watch my video on [Why You Should Own Upstart](http://youtube.com/watch?v=rartz8VcWjw).\n\n# Intro\n\nI've been heavily reading up on [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/) for the last few months, and I believe we're looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here (despite being up [362.37%](https://www.google.com/search?q=upst&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB885GB885&oq=upst) since IPO already). From everything I've read about the technology, leadership and market and competition, I think we're looking at a future tech behemoth currently hiding in plain sight. \n\nI've compiled my notes in the report below, if you need the *executive degen TLDR*, or prefer visual notes you can head straight to the bottom.\n\n# Company History\n\nBorrowing & lending is a practice as old as time. Our economies are based on borrowing be it at government level, institutional level, or even at the individual level. Whats mind-blowing is that borrowing and lending remained largely the same for the last [5000 years](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230554511_1). The problem Upstart set out to solve is the question of how to quantify the borrower's risk of defaulting. In simple terms, there are a lot of \"[good borrowers\"](https://www.upstart.com/about#credit-limits-2) out there, but lenders generally have a hard time identifying them using current systems which are [old and dated](https://www.fico.com/25years/). So just like shopping (AMZN, SHOP..etc), EV (TSLA) and consumer tech (AAPL),  consumer lending, a [$4.2 trillion market](https://www.notion.so/361e12bb766a4ad0bd38ffbd2ce37169), was due a massive tech disruption (UPST).\n\nKey dates:\n\n- Founded in 2012\n- [Pivoted](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/05/23/why-upstart-abandoned-education-crowdfunding-to.html) from its initial niche (crowdfunding loans) to the larger [$84b](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2021/08/13/upstart-can-ai-kill-the-fico-score/) market of personal loans in 2014.\n- Entered the auto-lending market in [2020](https://www.upstart.com/blog/introducing-ai-enabled-auto-loans?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_LfWzrC0S2PevMQ6xYcT2HwpIxXCbBEE0HeX9COT3a78-1629740458-0-gqNtZGzNAyWjcnBszQ-R)\n- [IPOed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/upstart-prices-ipo-at-20-for-market-cap-of-1-45-billion-11608092379) late 2020\n\n# Leadership\n\nThe story of Upstart is quite unusual. The company was founded by three people with diverse backgrounds expertises, and even generations. Dave Girouard was the [former head of Google Enterprise](https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/16/googles-president-of-enterprise-dave-girouard-is-leaving-to-launch-his-own-startup/), and before that he was an executive at Apple. His co-founders are Anna Counselman, the former [manager of Online Sales & Operations](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/12/06/silicon-valley-40-under-40-anna.html) at Google and Paul Gu, a university student who dropped out of the computer science program at Yale to start the company (also a [Thiel Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship)). For a founding story, its unusual for three people to come together and decide to build a company on the spot. But 9 years later, they are still at the helm of a profitable and disruptive company. \n\n# Upstart's Business\n\nUpstart's business caters to two distinct segments: [Individuals](https://www.upstart.com/personal-loans) and [banks](https://www.upstart.com/for-banks).\n\nTheir offerings to individuals consist of a variety of personal loan products, examples of these include:\n\n- Credit card and Debt consolidation loans\n- Home improvement loans\n- Medical loans\n- Wedding loans\n- and Moving loans\n\nFor banks, Upstart offers its AI technology as a way for banks to improve their archaic lending processes. This is kind of genius because instead of competing with banks, Upstart [partners with them and complements their services](https://vimeo.com/489878274). Studies completed with several  US banks suggested that Upstart’s model [could approve almost three times](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_52250deb9dc2f9889c94cd45e31c286d7522a9f8-1629210053-0-gqNtZGzNAuKjcnBszQvO#results-to-date)  the number of borrows at the same loss rate as traditional models, as well as make a reduction of 75% in defaults at the same approval rate, this is unprecedented in the lending business.\n\n## The Problem\n\nAt the moment, [90% of the top lenders in the United States use FICO scoring](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-fico-score/) to assess credit-worthiness, this is a scoring system first developed in 1989 which is comprised of five components:\n\n- Payment history\n- Amount owed\n- Length of credit history\n- How many times someone has applied for new credit\n- The variety of credit products you currently have\n\n## The Solution\n\nThis old scoring system prevents many people from getting loans at a reasonable rate. By comparison, Upstart leverages [1600 different data points](https://vimeo.com/492637158) [fast forward to 05:35]  that have been trained on more than 10 million repayment events to reach decision within seconds. This machine learning model continues to get more effective as it processes more repayment data [!!]\n\nAnd this is Upstart's competitive edge. Their AI and machine learning models facilitate *better* borrower selection and provides both *higher* approval rates as well as *lower* interest rates for customers. The numbers here are staggering: tested Upstart models were found to approve [26% more borrowers than traditional models whilst yielding 10% lower average APRs for approved loans](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_cDRNu2tNRiO1uogDDmRKdDE3YeeO2hfOn4Xr6m5gmrU-1629741551-0-gqNtZGzNAuWjcnBszQzR#results-to-date). This expands access to prime credit, which is great for customers (but its also great for banks as they would approve almost **twice** as many borrowers with fewer defaults). This is a [win win](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/hybridized-banking-system-jeff-keltner?page=2) [start at 03:00] situation for both lenders and customers seeking credit, absolutely mind-blowing!\n\nUpstart's AI also increases automation throughout the lending process for banks and institutional buyers. To illustrate this point they recently reported that [71% of their loans were instantly approved and fully automated](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) -[page. 4] - with no need for document uploads, calls or waiting! \n\nUpstart is using state-of-the-art AI technology to disrupt:\n\n- [$84B unsecured personal loan market](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) [p.6] (already working product, ~4% of the market).\n- $635B auto-loans market [also p.6] (just acquired Prodigy, a leader in this space).\n- $4.2T US consumer credit market [also p.6]\n\n## How Upstart makes money\n\nFrom page 101 of Upstart's [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1647639/000119312520313385/d867925ds1a.htm):\n\n> Upstart’s revenues are primarily earned in the form of three separate usage-based fees, which can be either dollar or percentage based depending on the contractual arrangement. We charge our bank partners a referral fee of 3% to 4% of the loan principal amount each time we refer a borrower who obtains a loan. Separately, we charge bank partners a platform fee of approximately 2% of loan value each time they originate a loan using our platform. These fees are contracted for and charged separately, although they are generally combined for accounting purposes as they usually represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge the borrowers on our platform any referral, platform or other similar fees for our loan matching services.\n\n> We also charge the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) an ongoing 0.5% to 1% annualized servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. Taken together, these fees represented 98% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we earn a small portion of our revenue from interest income and our securitization activities.\n\n## The Competition\n\nAnother point that makes the case for Upstart's future growth is just how far ahead they are from the competition. As an example the scoring methodology used by Goldman Sachs, the underwriting partner of Apple responsible for Apple Card, has been the subject of much public scrutiny and criticism in a number of recent high profile cases. One example being the case of David Hansson the creator of Ruby on Rails who in late 2019 received [20x the credit limit of his wife despite sharing the same financial ability](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/how-the-law-got-it-wrong-with-apple-card/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE57fF0YBl-DFkXQ2li8zbbzDR75qwiW-PyKPzfrssfgJSecSj9o_GV8iZ5SNYQlRythx0XAAqN5CTuqpV6sAoDun3fsn4ohmiBUHrqN6ooT-_fgbOIcVN4wr9C4fQrbE26BqXrhl6ttnT1xTpUKj2GUkFzf4dKoCaNFGjiOSL1t). Another more recent example is when the CEO of Cloudflare, Mathew Prince [applied for an Apple card and received credit limit of only $4500](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1426552810896871435?s=20) at a rate of 21.99% APR, [despite being worth $4.2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/profile/matthew-prince/#:~:text=REAL%20TIME%20NET%20WORTH&text=Matthew%20Prince%2C%20CEO%20of%20Cloudflare,Microsoft%2C%20Baidu%20and%20Qualcomm%20Ventures.)!\n\nThese examples may appear trivial, and they are.. after all we are discussing billionaires being denied credit, but they are high-profile examples of the competition's inferior AI offerings. Besides, the questions and concerns around lending and borrowing in the age of artificial intelligence are very much real, and touch upon very important questions about access and fairness, an aspect of Upstart's offering that is quite compelling. [Listen to Jeff Keltner](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/digital-lending-sam-sidhu?page=3) [47:20], Upstart's head of Business development touching on Upstart's effectiveness as a fair lender:\n\n# Financials\n\nTo better understand how the business of Upstart is doing, lets take a look at their [most recent earnings report of the second quarter of 2021 published just about a week ago on August 10](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347), I will preface this by saying that its one of the best earning reports I've ever read! \n\n- **Revenue:** In the 2nd quarter of 2021 Upstart reported revenue of **$194 million**, this is an increase of - get this-  **1,018%** from the second quarter of 2020 [!!!]. I can not stress how impressive this is, even by growth stocks standards, you simply dont see numbers like this everyday!\n\n    To illustrate just how out of this world Upstart's revenue growth is, lets look at revenue growth reported by other more popular degen-type growth stocks for the same quarter: \n\n    - **[Tesla reported revenue](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22) of** $11.69 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of **98%**.\n    - **[SoFi reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/SoFi-Earnings-report_FINAL_081221_4.pdf) of** $231.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of **101%**\n    - **[Shopify's reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_presentations/2021/07/Shopify-Investor-Deck-Q2-2021.pdf) of** $1.12 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 57%\n    - **[Palantir reported revenue](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q2%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf) of** $376 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%\n    - **[Fiverr reported revenue](https://s23.q4cdn.com/749308338/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2_2021-Fiverr-Shareholder-Letter_FINAL.pdf) of** $75.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 60%\n    - **[Etsy reported revenue](https://s22.q4cdn.com/941741262/files/doc_presentations/2021/08/[FINAL-NAP]-Etsy-2Q-2021-Earnings-Presentation-V2.pdf) of** $529 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 23%\n\n    ...etc etc, I can go on. \n\n    Even if you account for this improvement being partly due to COVID, looking at the results sequentially you still see an improvement of 60% from $121 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $194 million in the second quarter. No matter how you look at it this is an incredible result.\n\n- Transaction Volume Growth was up **69%**\n\n    Upstart's bank partners originated 286,864 loans, totaling $2.80 billion, this is up 1,605% from the same quarter of the prior year. Conversion on rate requests was 24% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 9% in the same quarter of the prior year.\n\n- **Income from Operations:** Income from operations was $36.3 million, up from ($11.4) million the prior year.\n- **Contribution Profit:** Contribution profit was $96.7 million, up **2,171**% from in the second quarter of 2020, with a contribution margin of 52% compared to a 32% contribution margin in the second quarter of 2020.\n- **Adjusted EBITDA**. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.5 million, up from ($3.1) million in the same quarter prior year.\n\nIn terms of financial outlook for 2021, Upstart expects:\n\n- **Revenue of approximately $750 million (they have essentially raised guidance by $150 million since their previous report guided for $600 million)**\n- **Contribution Margin of approximately 45% (vs prior guidance of 42%)**\n- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 17% (vs prior guidance of 10%)**\n\n***Sirs, do you get it?***\n\nI cant overstate how incredible these results are. As I was listening to the earnings conference call, I caught an amusing moment when the Director of Equity Research for Bank of America could not help but address the fact that he has never seen a four-digit growth figure reported in his career.. [have a listen yourself](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gn5dbj7b) [35:40]. \n\nWhat the bank of America analyst correctly pointed out was that Upstart managed to achieve such incredible levels of growth at a time when the personal loan market across the United States was actually down.\n\n# Risks:\n\n- In terms of risks to investing in Upstart, one of the main issues facing the company is business concentration. Cross River Bank is Upstart’s most significant partner, [with fees received from the bank accounting for 60% of revenue](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edgjPy-jXuIhvLSFLkuvTMXxMDt_Kq0R/view) [p.9]. Having a single customer generating such a big portion of your revenue is a serious risk for any business. The good news is that Cross River’s concentration of Upstart’s business has come down meaningfully over the last year from 79% to the current 60%. The hope is that, increased Upstart partnership with other banks will diversify its funding base and thus reduce concentration risk.\n- Another risk is increased [regulations](https://gfycat.com/coldcanineeyas-nate-dogg-regulator-warren-g) or legal scrutiny that can stop or restrict Upstart's AI models. This is obviously a real risk, particularly given how new AI lending is. The good news is that Upstart received a [no-action letter](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-issues-no-action-letter-facilitate-use-artificial-intelligence-pricing-and-underwriting-loans/) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that essentially guarantees no supervisory or enforcement action against Upstart for the next few years.\n\n## Future\n\n- In terms of Upstart's future plans for expansion, the company plans to target the $635 billion Auto lending market. [They've already expanded to 47 states](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) (up from 33 states last quarter), thus having access to more than 95% of the US population. They've also increased their dealership footprint by 24% sequentially this quarter.\n\n    But their biggest move in the auto lending space has to be the [acquisition of Prodigy Software](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-03-17/upstart-to-acquire-prodigy-software-a-leading-automotive-retail-software-provider) which is a leader in the automotive retail software space. Paul Gu, the co-founder of Upstart describes **Prodigy as the\" Shopify for car dealerships\"** .\n\n    Through acquisition of Prodigy Upstart was able to generate vehicle sales of over $1 billion this quarter, another very impressive result. They also already have five bank partners signed up for auto lending on their platform.\n\n- Recently, Upstart filled a newly created [General Manager of Mortgage position](https://twitter.com/saxena_puru/status/1426859770833637380). This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category.\n\nTo conclude this section on the future of Upstart, I will leave you with [a short clip](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1697077/8693359-investing-in-ai-episode-10-dave-girouard-from-upstart?client_source=twitter_card&player_type=full_screen) of Upstart's CEO discussing how the company is setting out to be the biggest player in AI lending in the world. My main takeaway from this interview was just how early we are to the Upstart story [23:45].\n\n# Putting my money where my mouth is\n\nIn short, [YES](https://streamable.com/73pefs). I am a mere mortal so no over the top yolos. I mainly invest in growth stocks and have recently been adding to my Upstart position like crazy, taking it from 11% to around 30% of my portfolio. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nUpstart reminds me so much of Shopify at the beginning of its growth-spurt, in the sense that it is a future giant hiding in plain sight. Do your own due diligence on the company before making any investments, but after many many hours of consuming every bit of data I can get on the company, I believe it will a massive success over the next 5 years, and we will all look back and wonder why we didnt invest enough.\n\nThis is a once-in-a-life-time opportunity imho.\n\nIf you've read all of that I salute you friend!", "id": "paami8", "created_utc": 1629758443.0, "score": 229, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 200, "comments": [{"body": "Lost me at 5-10 years", "score": 194, "replies": [{"body": "How do I buy 10yr leaps?", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "You looking to buy the $5000 FD for 2031? 😂", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "I was thinking more of wasting it than buying but sure buying.
