Suggesting AMZN brings in twice as much profit as BABA. (This is a second of google search so don’t kill me if these aren’t accurate)\n\nInvestors may also see more growth potential in AMZN, especially since it has had more growth than BABA over the past 3 years, percent-wise. And, AMZN has a more diversified business than BABA and, in my opinion, a more innovative one. AMZN’s AWS is an especially valuable business, with insane growth potential.\n\nBased on that 30 seconds of googling AMZN being worth 3.5 times as much as BABA is more than reasonable. IMO it could be worth even 5 times as much as BABA.\n\nEDIT: Oh, also, buying shares of Chinese companies in the US, even if they’re listed in the US, like BABA, has inherent risks.

The advantage is that there is a lot more native compatibility for apps in operating systems that does not require software emulation.

That was inevitable.\n\nOn top of that, it's kind of welcomed. Intel was the only data center chip in the game at all for years, ever since AMD just completely boned themselves out of that market a long time ago.\n\nSo you have all these companies around the world that only have one source for their chips; Intel, and those companies absolutely hate that. If AMD came out with a chip that was worse in performance and cost more, AAPL AMZN etc would still buy it just to have that second option. They do not like Intel having a grip on things.\n\nAs you may know, Intel are working to become a Foundry and make chips for other players in the market.

So Intel has made some poor choices in the past that have to be corrected over time.\n\nSo yeah. Maybe the Foundry works out right and they print a whoole lot of money. Maybe the world courts don't allow AMD to buy ARM in the end, which is very possible, and the dynamic changes drastically.\n\nBut I think there's something to be said that in the strongest bull run in recent history, INTC couldn't even hit their ATH.\n\nThe GPU could be cool but again nothing comes close to the big boy chips.\n\nJust some thoughts.

Insofar as there being any hope of a recovery, the same could be asked of any company not running on all cylinders. It's not as if Intel is the only laggard company out there. If you are familiar with their product line, their plan ahead, and believe they have a way forward, then you have your investment thesis. And like any idea or plan, it may or may not pan out in the end. I personally think that Intel has drawn the ire of new retail investors as they have neither the momentum (as you indicate) nor the swagger that AMD and NVDA bring to the table. And it's standard these days for market dregs to put out the occasional hit piece on punching bags like Intel--see this article, for instance: [U.S. near deal for Nvidia supercomputer as it waits for delayed Intel machine](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-near-deal-nvidia-supercomputer-190754396.html), which beneath the headline and the typical punishment despite market-scale supply chain problems essentially says that the Intel machine will, in the end, be the better performing machine against AMD and NVDA for HPC purposes:\n>The $500 million contract called for Intel and partners to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance, or the ability to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second. Now, the first exascale computer in the United States will likely be a different machine at a different lab - Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee - built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co with chips from AMD expected to be delivered later this year. The Polaris machine at Argonne will not be as powerful as the Intel machine, the sources said. Based on Nvidia's A100 chips and AMD's Rome and Milan chips, the Polaris computer will be able to make some exaflop calculations but mostly work at slower speeds.\n\nI think Intel has a legitimate shot at building on what they have, and it is valued cheaply compared to peers on the belief of others that it doesn't. Even as a laggard in cutting-edge design, it enjoys regular business with the US government and provides HPC services and infrastructure. Outside of Gen-Z'ers and Millennials, I doubt the flair of AMD or NVDA will cut through the sticker shock when Intel components will do work just fine. To put it simply, I think rumors of Intel's demise have been greatly exaggerated. Top insiders at [Intel](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-intc/intel/news/who-has-been-buying-intel-corporation-nasdaqintc-shares) seem to be either holding or buying more of their own stock, save for tax/bill purposes.

It's clear that Intel insiders think their stock can be bought cheaply in the assumption of future appreciation, while its competitors are cashing in on their own holdings while the sun is shining brighter than ever.

Their architecture is a step beyond Nvidia's GPU based stuff, but Nvidia is pretty entrenched now.\n\nThat makes Nvidia the incumbent, and the new pure NN oriented architectures the would-be disruptors. So it's one of those stories. In particular: A pure NN oriented architecture doesn't seem like it would be able to map to the other things Nvidias stack does, which leaves Nvidia with three choices:\n\n1. Stick with their own stuff (the original Intel play)\n2. Bet on both old and new stuff (the Itanium Intel play)\n3. Ditch the old stuff entirely and jump to the new stuff (the Apple 6502 -> 68k, 68k -> PPC, PPC -> Intel, Intel -> ARM play(s))\n\nWe all love a good disruption story, but in reality we hardly ever hear about the failed attempts. Time will tell. But it will probably tell rather quickly.\n\nI think it's encouraging that Tesla is doing what they are doing. They have an internal need for this so they are their own business case, and you know, if they can do it, many other AI oriented companies can. The big story these days (that you for some reason hardly hear of) is that designing very specific silicon for your workload is becoming a viable option for many companies for lots of reasons. Apple and Tesla are just some of the first movers here.\n\nNB: This does not in any way mean that Tesla will sell the D1 hardware to others. They may cloud-rent it out, but I expect they will be best served here by working with a partner (like Azure).\n\nAlso: For all the fancy words that were said about the D1 at the AI day, it seem to me that it's actually a fairly SIMPLE design, from an architectural point of view. It's almost like a repeat of the old RISC vs. CISC days.\n\nFor those who weren't around for that. There was a sudden realization that by doing away with a bunch of complexity in CPU design and focusing only on the core workloads, you could actually build a CPU that beat the crap out of the state of the art. A BUNCH of companies that used to use off-the-shelf CPUs built their own, and some that had their own classical archs abandoned them for the new wave. Among the former were Acorn (6502 -> ARM) and Sun (68K -> SPARC). Among the latter were DEC (VAX -> Alpha). The major chip makers tried to hedge their bets (several times). In the end Intel stuck with their guns, and Motorola bet the farm on Power PC.\n\nToday all major CPU architectures are kind of a hybrid between RISC and CISC, so perhaps that will be the final outcome of this AI war?\n\nEDIT: Notably, [Jim Keller](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16762/an-anandtech-interview-with-jim-keller-laziest-person-at-tesla) worked at DEC during the RISC days, then took his experience to AMD, designed the HW3 chip and most likely had a LOT of influence, perhaps even input, on the D1.

{"title": "$BB BlackBerry the sleeping giant (Potential $2 Billion Facebook Settlement Coming + Amazon IVY connect car) 🍇", "selftext": "**My fellow APES** 🐵 **just remember that DIAMONDS 💎 are made under PRESSURE  🖐**\n\n[Cyber Security Competitors \\(BlackBerry VERY undervalued\\)](https://preview.redd.it/4jgrcdko9ej71.png?width=1793&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbadfb002e309d49dfbec98eb27d21a4de228409)\n\n**Facebook Patent Settlement/Partnership Catalyst**\n\nBlackberry filed a lawsuit against Facebook for Patent Infringement (and won). Technology in WhatsApp Messenger apparently is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of court, Blackberry got a positive judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a halt on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users.\n\nOnly the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail.\n\nJohn Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech company and can't disclose more.\n\nI strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. (This might be huge as Salesforce bought Slack). Blackberry also gets free advertising on FB Instagram.\n\nPatent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing.\n\nFacebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM\n\nMark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology.\n\nJohn Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares.\n\n**IVY Connected Car (IoT Internet of Things) + Amazon Partnership**\n\nAs we all know AWS has entered a multi-year, global agreement with BlackBerry (BB) QNX to develop BB IVY.\n\nIvy benefits the whole value-chain\n\n* IVY enables automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences by allowing for a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights. AKA feed OEMs MORE DATA that is actionable.\n* The developers won’t need specialized or automotive software skills.\n\nModern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data. With BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages, hardware variations, or proprietary sensor data formats.\n\n* The consumer (driver) gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performance/experience along with safety of their data\n\nData is the new Gold/Oil\n\nBB has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago.\n\nIn a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says the following in regards to BB Ivy “By the way this project, we’ve been working with Amazon has taken us probably about 2 years - we started this whole program 2 years ago at CES. We demonstrated a little piece of technology at that time, obviously not as elaborative as today..”.\n\nHe goes on to say that this creates a recurring data business for BB. This point should not be overlooked! As a Mckinsey & Co report  ([https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/unlocking-the-full-life-cycle-value-from-connected-car-data#](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/unlocking-the-full-life-cycle-value-from-connected-car-data#)) connected cars (the new iPhone) will allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.\n\nChen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:\n\n1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the “plumbing” or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)\n2. BB secures all endpoints in the Internet of Things\n\n[Take us to the MOON, Papa Chen!  🚀  🌙  📈  ](https://preview.redd.it/o2hnpx27jej71.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=f182596657194328fc93a5534ba08c80643d5d09)", "id": "pazmes", "created_utc": 1629849803.0, "score": 2057, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 293, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|48|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwsj7y/wkhs_workshop_still_413_short_interest_apes_let/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pazmes/bb_blackberry_the_sleeping_giant_potential_2/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzbarf/tomorrow_mindmed_mnmd_kicks_off_the_psychedelics/) [x](https://zolmax.com/investing/perceptive-advisors-llc-invests-10-32-million-in-clover-health-investments-corp-nasdaqclov/6044342.html) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncaasu/mnmd_mindmed_about_to_take_off_monday_lsd_for/) \n**Account Age**|10 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/moneymonster420, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Obvious shill activity.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Super long on bb", "score": 130, "replies": [{"body": "Why?

Reaching returns of over 100% since March lows, it is time for this baby to start a correction. Looking like \"sell in September\" is going to be a real thing for all the boomers real soon. Looking at the chart below, it is only a matter of time before SPY decides to dump its pants. I'm not saying a recession type of drop, but at least a small correction. My target would be the blue zone marked below, but I would expect at least a retest of 400 at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/otk9bws3bej71.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=e308ef6d7b168dcf9c1d3bb4c94c8d4ec80c5d7d\n\nNow on to our memes. BB (Blackberry for all you newbs), has been patiently consolidating, waiting for an outflow from boomer equities back into the memes. If you have been paying attention the past few months, you notice that any time the market starts to fall, the memes start to pop a little. It's almost like people are treating the meme stocks as safety for their cash because they have been pretty consistent with basically having a negative Beta.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsnvy5bocej71.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=d29185f1559ae2ef9819853b4f9bcb5a5890ccde\n\nIf you look at the chart below, this is the weekly chart showing the first and second meme pumps casually lifting off the long term trendline marked. The selling has dried up, and volume managed to enter at the right time to maintain our trend. Now if this holds and BB manages to break above our recent high ($28.77), $40 per share could be possible given that the current market situation develops as I imagine it will, with SPY falling at the same time the memes are catching significant inflow.\n\nCurrent position in BB:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2rcqrj6scej71.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=459d81e090de32f6a06af99303d7ca11fcf12764\n\nCurrent position in SPY (lottos):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35c84pkvcej71.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=f703a336d834c7143a689d881bf7d0db063d1d9a\n\nBB, AMC, GME, lets fuck the hedgies once again.\n\nEDIT: Edited for clarification on recent high.\n\nYou can also follow more of my bullshit at TheStonksDaddy on twitter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "pazvqo", "created_utc": 1629850697.0, "score": 749, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|11|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|169|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0i7x9/dm_i_know_everyone_is_balls_deep_in_gme_but_its/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 283, "replies": [{"body": "Stock that is going up may continue going up.

They have actual binding contracts? The company made no such claim.\n\nFactory Audit - And? If the factory is worth so much and so easy to get borrowing, why did they have a going concern the last two quarters? The factory is not worth nearly as much as you think.\n\nNorth American Fleet - I can also go to a trade show to sell a nonexistent product. I am sure fleets are jumping to buy a more expensive truck than their competitors say they will offer from a company on the verge of going bankrupt, meaning no warranty coverage and difficulty getting service.\n\nDon't forget they are diluting the stock to raise funds and it is not going to be enough to make it to regular commercial deliveries. They are going under quick and your bags will just get heavier.\n\nAlso, don't forget, hub motors on a truck, per RIDE's own response to Hindenburg, apparently require adding weight (bad for EV range and adds wear and tear to the tires and suspension), extra suspension work (perhaps means more service issues and a more complex manufacturing process), and strengthening the frame (more complex manufacturing process). You need four hub motors (otherwise you have a 300 HP truck with max 150 HP at each of the rear wheels, which might not be that great) versus one or two chassis mounted motors (with a simple differential, using braking on the opposing wheel, you can transfer much of the power to either wheel, which means more torque on the wheels with traction than hub motors can ever achieve), but you eliminate your CV shafts. If this sounds like a winning formula to you, I have a bridge to sell you. Oh, also unsprung weight is not great for efficiency as greater energy losses on the bumps on the road.\n\nOne last thing... Market cap of this scam is under 1B as of now. Guess mods are being nice and still allowing it to be talked about here.

{"title": "$ASTS: Universal 4k Porn streamed from anywhere on the planet Sea, Air, and Land!", "selftext": "^(I'm  not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a position of my portfolio in $ASTS.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\nRoughly 40-47% of the world doesn't have access to online Porn or the internet, a **Trillion** dollar market untapped. Imagine more than **3 Billion** horny people limited to only masturbating to their imagination!!\n\nASTS is a potentially once in a decade investment, one to the likes of Tesla at it's beginnings... A service which has no competitors, not even StarLink(as per the CEO). The one investment which could offset all the previous losses...\n\nASTS is developing the **First and Only** Space based Cellular Broadband network, **SpaceMobile.** SpaceMobile will be **compatible** with all currently existing 5G and LTE smartphones without the need to do any modifications to your phones hardware. It will provide connectivity **at 4G/5G speeds** **everywhere on the planet – on land, at sea and in flight.** In addition, 5 Billion phones move in and out of coverage all the time, SpaceMobile is planning to bridge the gap of connection loss without the need of specialized equipment!\n\n# The Technology (Too Technical and can be skipped):\n\n**TLDR;  The tech has been proven to work on smaller scales but has yet to be done at the scale ASTS is aiming for. Additionally, it's 6G forward compatible!**\n\n***OVERVIEW***:  AST & Science (“ASTS”) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct-to-device’ service to normal phones using a low earth orbit satellite array to directly connect to mobile phones anywhere on Earth.\n\n***Hardware***\\*\\*\\*:\\*\\*\\*   ASTS’ satellites are \\~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a [900-square meter array](https://preview.redd.it/sk0cpuxbfnd71.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=f57703695f83ed465a1912b1ae546a4c04c4852c), the system is a large **“loud”**  system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones are just “listen hard” whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones.\n\n***SOFTWARE:***   ASTS’ system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial(on Earth) spectrum and telecom networks. The “magic” of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible.\n\n***BACKHAUL***:   Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back  on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier’s terrestrial spectrum.\n\n***CAPACITY***:  Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area.\n\n# Business Model(Can be skipped):\n\n**TLDR; ASTS brings the satellites and execution while their partners bring the customers.**\n\n***The Model:*** ASTS has chosen to partner with preexisting telecom giants to acquire a large customer base with essentially 0 acquisition costs per customer for ASTS. They have agreed to a 50/50 revenue split with its partners who are going to provide the customers. The 5g connection will be offered as an add-on to preexisting data plans provided by their partners or as a standalone purchase.\n\n***How Does it generate Money? :***  With its current carrier partners, Vodafone and AT\\&T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide  significant operating leverage and cash flow.\n\nIn-place there are binding agreements with carriers to provide ASTS with access to  >1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn). Phase 1 will  target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people. In subsequent phases, it's planning to expand into Europe and N. America by 2024.\n\nThe company is expected to generate >$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user.\n\n***ASSets:***  ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage(no competitors yet). Moreover, Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market having ATT, Vodafone, American Towers and Rakuten in it's pocket.\n\n# Timeline(can be skipped):\n\n**TLDR;** **They have broken up their plan into 5 different phases spanning multiple  years with the intent of slowly expanding their satellite constellation until full global coverage is achieved.**\n\n* Phase 1 - Equatorial constellation, 20 satellites by 2022\n   * Cash flow from phase 1 will support the following phases\n* Phase 2 - NA/Europe/Asia, 45 satellites by 2022\n* Phase 3 - Full global coverage, 45 satellites by 2023\n   * At this point ASTS expects to start turning a profit\n* Phase 4 - Full global MIMO coverage (increased data capacity), 58 satellites by 2023\n* Phase 5 - Scaling network globally, 16 satellites by 2028\n\n# Management(Can be skipped):\n\n* CEO Abel Avellan\n   * 25+ years of space industry experience\n   * Track record of building a successful global satellite communications company\n      * EMC Emerging Markets Communications\n* CFO Tom Severson\n   * Former CFO of EMC\n* CTO Huiwen Yao\n   * 30+ years of experience in satcom\n* CCO Chris Ivory\n   * 25+ years of experience in satcom\n\nEmployees:\n\n* 236 full-time employees\n* 13 part-time employees\n* 161 scientists and engineers\n   * 24 of whom are PhDs\n\n**The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm,  NASA, and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom  are PhDs.**\n\n# Catalysts(can be skipped):\n\n**The most important catalyst is the BlueWalker 3 satellite launch which will be taking place sometime in Q4  2021.**\n\nThis will be a bigger satellite than any previous ones created but it still is not the biggest they plan to make. However, a successful launch and connection to BW3 would definitively prove that the tech works at larger scales.\n\nOther smaller but still significant catalysts include:\n\n* Government approvals for servicing in each country\n* The launch date for BW3\n* Acquisition of a portion of the federal 5g fund\n\n# Risks(Can be skipped):\n\nEvery play ranging from 0dte to year long investments come with some amount of risk and this is no exception.  While some may simply be setbacks they are still worth knowing.\n\n* Delays\n   * Satellite construction and launch delays.\n* Execution\n   * Building, launching and deploying the satellites.\n* Regulators\n   * Need governmental approval for satellite operations from each country they wish to provide before they can service them.\n* Tech\n   * Satellite to phone connection still unproven on a large scale.\n* Funding\n   * Not fully funded (Need to raise \\~1.5 bn) however phase 1 is fully funded and is planned to help pay for the subsequent phases.\n\n# Valuation(Most important part):\n\nThe current market cap of ASTS is only 1.71 Billion for a stock with an extremely high potential, endless possibilities, and no competitors.\n\nSpaceX's Starlink(If we want to compare apples to oranges), will provide **FIXED-POINT(Doesn't connect to mobile)** broadband to customers at very high costs with unclear quality. Moreover Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices. It depends on Dish Satellites.\n\nStarLink is valuated between 40-50Billion Dollars! **Which equals around 222$-277$ of ASTS!!**\n\nJust like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE** and Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices.\n\n***Deutsche Bank most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 35$ and they added this nice comment **“If management executes on plan over the next five years, the company's intrinsic value should ultimately be \"significantly higher\"** than the $35  price target.\"\n\n***Barclays Most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 29$.\n\n**And Most importantly my coverage:** Well, you cannot really valuate this rare breed, because it's like trying to valuate $TSLA in the early days when it was just 50$(post split). ASTS is in a very similar situation right now having no competitors with a massive lead in the industry(A proven product on a small scale with well established partnerships with Vodafone, ATT, American Towers and Rakuten).\n\nRight now, it should atleast have a market cap of 10 Billion, which is 1/4 Starlink, and there's actually no competition.\n\nPrice target will be illustrated with crayons bellow:\n\n[ASTS Price Target illustrated with Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/cew62pdeqjj71.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=43c5882e02595f60ed2d0f59646ad1e58605c2bf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(Special thanks to /oceanice and /thekookreport for their great DD)", "id": "pbh91f", "created_utc": 1629916224.0, "score": 1755, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 497, "comments": [{"body": "Gosh....I own a lot of ASTS, but I didn't buy it as a porn play 😂", "score": 522, "replies": [{"body": "Lol ASTS should have had a gap up on the Only Fans news today", "score": 148, "replies": [{"body": "I’d pay for an Abel Only Fans.", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "A loop of Abel saying that they cracked the code...
