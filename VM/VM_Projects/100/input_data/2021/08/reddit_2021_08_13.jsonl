Stocks are not wives or girlfriends. They do not get jealous if you look at another stock and invest in other stocks. Stocks don't know your timetable and they don't know your particular circumstances. They are not stable even though they look as stable as a mountain.  (Apple might be on the losing end of the Epic Games lawsuit and get a nifty pullback if that happens. Yes Apple will be worth much more in the future in the years to come, but that doesn't help if your account value drops 20% and your calls only covered a 2% drop.)  So diversify. Look at maybe 4 or 5 stocks and that way you can also get a better feel as to how they behave and you can employ other different time horizons.  \n\nBTW, if you can move some of the money into a Roth or tradional IRA you'd be better off with doing so since taxes won't be an issue and you won't have to worry about the \"Wash Sale Rules\" regarding disallowance of losses under certain circumstances.  \n\nHope this helps.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Some people suggest selling CC at least 10% out of the money and 45 days out, optimally.\n\nNot as much premium but less likely to have your shares called away.....\n\nAnd if the stock moves enough for your calls to be in the money, you can buy back the call - you have a short term loss, and roll into a higher call next......", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Why would your shares be called away if you sell in the money 30-DTEs?

And even if it does not evolve enough and stays mostly the same (form factor-wise), smartphones are getting very competitive right now, and Apple's market share can start decreasing significantly.\n\nApple knows this, that's why they are doing AirPods, Apple TV, and all those subscription services, because they know their stake at the smartphone game is increasingly at risk. And if the iPhone starts going down, everything else will go down with it. That's Apple's biggest issue.\n\nNo, I don't think they will go down deep, I'm not saying that.

{"title": "How is DoorDash a 62 billion company?", "selftext": "I am interested in hearing a bull case for doordash. I've seen many youtube videos, reddit posts, articles on why this stock is overvalued at 18 price to sales ratio which implies at least 20-25% sales growth (sales growth 6-9x) for the next 10 years based on my model. Even Uber, which I consider to be massively overvalued, (because of its unprofitable low margin,no moat, slowing growth business) is trading only 17 billion marketcap more for postmates, uber eats and most dominant ride haling service.(63 vs 80 bil)\n\nWith earnings miss, i would thought that this stock would go down, but doordash ended the day up 3.5% while airbnb is barely up on better earnings. Even Disney stock, which crushed earnings, is only up 1%, and trades at a more reasonable valuation. In my opinion, you cant miss earnings, and expect to go up, yet DoorDash did and the guidance wasnt that great either.\n\nSo why did doordash go up today on earnings? I didn't see any reddit post on doordash earnings, in fact I rarely hear anyone talk about this stock which is surprising considering its a 62 billion growth company. ( i hear more people discuss corsair which is a 2 billion company) Yet, despite the earnings miss, analysts kept upgrading the price targets for this stock today yet they never explain why they upgraded doordash.\n\nI would like to hear your thoughts on why this stock is worth the price, I always like to hear bull cases, on companies I find overvalued (i enjoy reading opinions on crowdstrike, nvidia, moderna so even thought I find those stocks are overvalued I understand the market valuation is so high on those companies.) Alot of stocks that I believe to have positive sentiment isn't really moving higher, like sofi, disney, shift, alibaba, amazon while stocks that I see have more negative sentiment on youtube/reddit like doordash, carvana, zoom are performing relatively better?

The shopper/ driver is risking their health and the health of their family during this pandemic.  I quit the two platforms I'd worked before the pandemic.  But here's some insight you may not be aware of.  Your order could have been delivered to a wrong address.  In that case, your groceries were not stolen by the delivery person and you cannot possibly prove it.  It's rare, compared to other scenarios.  The delivery fee is disproportionately allocated to the company, not the driver.  \"Tip\" is the most abused component of this system.  The company is able to take any amount of the tip.  The only way to ensure the driver gets the full tip is handing them cash.  \nBiggest problem with tipping practices is these companies encourage customers to offer a high tip and then change the amount upon delivery, tip-baiting.  The companies also encourage low tips for a premium, luxury service.  Let's be real here :  grocery delivery is a luxury and should include a tip commensurate with that ideal.  One or more people are taking time and effort to pick and deliver each item.  This is much more complicated and time-intensive than delivering pizza or Chinese food.  Yet the old school standard for food delivery (order from XYZ pizza and XYZ pizza employee driver delivers it) is 20% of the bill.  Grocery delivery standard is 5%.  The shopper / driver only gets a portion of the 5%.  How does this make sense?  \nJust so you know and it really sets me off when customers complain about delivery fees without all the facts.  Yes, they should complain.  They should complain that the desk jockeys are getting all the money plus free food, snacks, beverages, pool and ping pong tables in the offices.  The shoppers and drivers carry the entire burden of costs for gas, insurance, car maintenance and trashing the brakes, tires, suspension...while doing all the heavy lifting and getting paid less than minimum wage, more often than not.

That is, if they fire all the coders and middle managers, their margin would be 48%, which is plenty good. if people are hooked and they get rid of coupons and start squeezing restaurants and drivers, they'll make even more.  \n>  \n>Or another observation: if they return to the same proportion of cost of revenue from 9/2020 (43% vs. 52%), but just stay the same size, they'd have broken precisely even, even with all their inefficiencies.  \n>  \n>When your face is pressed close to the glass, it can be hard to see economies of scale at this size.  \n>  \n>Disclosure: I wouldn't touch the stock, long or short, with a 10 foot pole.

I've had representatives doge my questions constantly and simply end the communications because they didn't want to deal with the problem (again, have screenshots ofall the correspondence and can post them via Imgur if thats what people want). Knowing that there was hair in my food I was still told by all 5+ representatives that \"I have done my best to challenge the system on this order,unfortunately I am unable to process due to the amount of recently processed compensation on your account.\" When pressed further, I was told that\"We run a series of automated checks on our customers’ accounts, and your account did not pass one of these checks. It is our policy to not process requests for compensation in this case.\" Now, I am pretty sure that this is a measure door dash has taken in order to either A. Make sure that there bottom line is not impacted by too many refunds, and if the customer has issued too many refunds within a period of time or maybe in general they won't take refunds (which is NOT a legal way to enforce customer service policy) or B.Just a way to make it so that they can pay there customer service reps nothing or C. both.

My goal is to get pretty close to a 20 delta width with my short leg sitting >50 delta and my long leg >70 delta. \n\nExample, 9/17 vertical 200 short and 185 long.

If my long leg gets tested I can either just leave it as is and hope the stock will come back up, or I can cut my losses and roll my strikes up to get whatever credit is available. Additionally, you can shrink your width to get a credit if you are getting close to expiration and are underwater. It doesn't make sense to sell debit spreads that are underwater since you can always roll up and/or shrink width for a credit. the credit might not be much, but it'll be more than you'd get from selling the spread. \n\nAs a note, all of this is assuming you are keeping the same DTE with all of your rolls.

This is before they do any business.\n\nOk their revenue was up from $9.89 million to $18.4 million and they will get an additional $11 million in Q3 from Inner spirit, whatever assets Inner spirit owns will be added to this pile and their lending revenues from their latest two deals. $25,000,000 @ 5% APR and $103,000,000 @ 11.9% APR combined this is another $4.5 million per quarter in revenue. So Q3 revenue so far is at $33.9 million or estimated annual Revenue $135.6 million (to be reported Q3 2022, based on what’s already in the books and assuming no growth).\n\n$135.6 \\* 10  = fair market value of that revenue of about $1.3 billion (CAD) converted to USD =  $1.083B or another $0.53 per share \n\n$0.53 + $0.52 = $1.05 USD per share in hard assets and without growth that they are currently earning in today’s markets and it doesn’t include INSHFs assets or deploying the remaining $450M committed to lending (at 5% is another 22,500,000 in Revenue or at 11.9% is $53,550,000) multiply this times 10 and fair market rate for that revenue = $226M to $535.5M or another 11.1 to 26.4 cents per share.\n\n$1.05+ $0.1875 (midpoint of 11.1 and 26.4) = $1.2375 per share estimated value before adding any assets INSHF may have.\n\nTLDR: If share price is below $1.2375 then you are buying at a steal based on income they can reliably capture today and in the near future. This is prior to any growth that may be available. That means the $0.78 price AH closed at today 8-12-2021 is 58.65%  lower than fair market value. Literally you just have to buy and wait for the market to figure this out to gain 50% without even thinking. If a squeeze happens you can potentially net more gains. If not well profit is profit. Also, this doesn;t even account for potential growth if USA legalizes.\n\nFull disclosure, unless it squeezes I will be buying more tomorrow. I’m a stupid ape, not a financial advisor.
