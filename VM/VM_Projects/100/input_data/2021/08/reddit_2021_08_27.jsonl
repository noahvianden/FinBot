Hope the numbers can assist. Obviously, these numbers are highly simplified, and don‚Äôt account for things such as taxes, opex, depreciation (all of which are definitely important). The implicit assumption here is that Tesla can keep their opex relatively constant, which is somewhat historically verified by Earnings reports. However, it should give you a baseline to do calculations and you can run your own numbers. üòá\n\nIn Q2, automotive margin MINUS regulatory credits was 25%. \n\nThis is 25% even given:\n1) no US EV tax credit\n2) FSD take rate is low 15%ish because it currently isn‚Äôt worth it\n3) no 4680 cells which are 50% cheaper\n4) no giga casting which is cost saving on 30% of vehicle structure\n5) chip shortage forcing tesla to use less optimal chips\n6) Giga Shanghai and Giga Fremont aren‚Äôt fully scaled up, artificially inflating cost of goods sold (until it fully ramps).\n\nGiven all this, Tesla still had 25% automotive margin excluding regulatory credits.\n\nWhat happens now to the margin if those above pass?\n1) A 7500 dollar tax credit would boost margin by around 10%, assuming you give half to cost savings to the consumers.\n2) If Tesla can bring FSD Beta public with V10 (ETA 4 weeks), even without robotaxi, if take rate increases to 75%, thats another 15% margin / vehicle.\n3) Assuming 4680 can reach volume production in early 2023, thats extra ~ 5000 dollar cost improvements assuming current batteries cost 10,000, resulting in 10% margin improvement.\n4) Not clear the dollar value to Giga Casting, although that margin increase is substantial. That will come out in Giga Berlin and Texas end of 2021.\n5) Chip shortage could swing either way, not going to make guesses on this.\n6) Fully ramped up factories results in lower cost of goods sold on the balance sheet. No exact figure, but substantial.\n\nWith all those improvements, you can probably add 50% margin to the already 25% margin to get to 75% margin, although as you lower vehicle cost as you scale up, it will likely be pushed back down to around 50% short term, then 40% long term (in line with Tesla‚Äôs goal).\n\nLet‚Äôs project to short term, end of 2022. Assuming 40% vehicle margin with those improvements in place, at 50k ASP (currently it is ~55k), and 1.5 million vehicles sold, that puts their vehicle profits alone at $30 Billion (obviously, theres other opex cost im not considering, but historically, they haven‚Äôt scaled up linearly with profits, but a lot slower). At $30 Billion in profits, assuming the stock price didn‚Äôt move and stayed at 700B, that‚Äôd be a 23 P/E ratio, which is very low for a fast growing company. For reference, Amazon is growing slower at 1.7 T and still has a P/E of 57.\n\nNow, project out to 2030. Let‚Äôs assume 10 million vehicles (20 million is the target, but just be conservative). 30% margin at 35k ASP. That puts the profits at 105 Billion. On cars alone, at a P/E of 20, thats a 2T market cap, or about a 3x. If you do numbers in line with Tesla‚Äôs target at 20million / year at 40% margin and 40k ASP, that brings you 320B annual profit, or 6T at a 20 P/E. This is cars alone, excluding robotaxi, excluding Tesla bot, excluding energy.\n\nIf you add in robotaxi, assume 50c profit / mile (Uber currently cost riders 3-5 dollars per mile, so this is a big undercut), and you have 10 million Teslas doing 100k miles / year, thats 500 B in profit / year, or a 10T market cap addition at a 20 P/E.\n\nThere are other lines of business difficult to model right now, such as energy, Dojo, Tesla Bot. However, cars and robotaxi alone are already very good.\n\nWhy‚Äôs this different from other autos who already sell high volume vehicles? Reason: they sell high volume, low margin, low ASP. Tesla can command high margin higher ASP because of autonomy, software in the cars, and being first mover in scaling EVs.\n\nBut what about competition?\nCompetition is having difficulty scaling.

The switch to electric is inevitable, and legacy auto is not ready for it - more growth for Tesla ahead.\n\nNow try thinking about Tesla as more than a car company.

I have 2/3 TSLA and 1/3 TLG in my account, so be aware my opinion is biased.\n\nTalga is an Australian company specialized on natural graphite mining and advanced chemical manufacturing. They have the largest and highest concentrated natural graphite source outside china (and probably including china as well) and is on track to start producing in 2024. Graphite is the anode in ALL lithium ion batteries, sometimes doped with silicon, but its in all of them. I found them through The Limiting Factor (hats off to Jordan).\n\nTheir product is comparable to synthetic anode, so even though it is a natural anode, its consistency and quality is as good as synthetic graphite. At the same time, its cold weather performance is better than synthetic and its far, far greener. Its the greenest anode in the world.\n\nTLG is super undervalued right now, poised to ~20x by 2025 (roughly). In the last earnings call, they made the statement that the demand for their product is about 50x their planned production capacity for 2024. If scaled up to full potential, they could supply all the graphite for all of Europe by 2030, which would >100x their current share price. Obviously, that is VERY optimistic, but its possible, and the battery market is about to become VERY hot. Also, they dont have meaningful competition in Europe.\n\nIt does come with some risk, as it still needs a mining permit in Sweden, where their deposit is. They also need a JV with a local mining company LKAB and help supply the CapEx for their mine and chemical plants, potentially from Mitsui. Also, no binding offtake agreements as of yet, but their chemical plant is right next to northvolt, with production targets align pretty nicely. There is also a rail line directly to Germany, including Teslas Berlin battery plant. Tesla stated they want to source their battery materials for the Berlin factory locally. Again, the only local anode producer of meaningful potential to scale up is Talga in Europe. Europe does not want to import battery raw materials from china, as this would be equivalent to being dependent on Oil, and no one wants that.\n\nTalga is traded on the ASX name TLG, ein Germany with ticker TGX and in the US at the OTCBB with ticker TLGRF.
