Then practice selling covered calls against an index (if you don’t have $40k to do it with SPY, use SPYG [~60/sh] or SPYV [~35/sh]) until you get really good at it. \n\nThis is mostly safe (if you believe Bogle) and will teach you patience, and make you value the stock you have more (which will make you trade safer). \n\nIf you have the patience to, keep doing that until the premiums cover some of your monthly expenses (assuming not too high if you are making around 50k).\n\nOnce you have a good chunk, then start wheeling if you are still into individual stocks. Don’t use margin, only sell cash secured puts or covered calls. \n\nIf that’s going well, then start buying options, and only buy options with premiums you made selling options. It will keep you safer, and should minimize any major losses. The heuristic will also keep you from over allocating into assets that go to zero. If you really are a baller at buying calls, just use those profits to buy more. If not, wait until you generate more covered call profits to gamble more.\n\nOverall it boils down to patience and restraint. \n\nHope that helps.

Now, Block is penning some rare words of his own.  \nBlock just sent clients his first shareholder letter since starting a hedge fund in 2015. In the letter, obtained by DealBook from a source familiar with the fund, Block, a longtime critic of Elon Musk, Tesla’s C.E.O., said that his firm’s multiyear bet against the electric carmaker had been sent to “heaven,” with no plans to revive it.  \nBlock said Musk’s “narcissism” drew his disdain and stoked the belief that Tesla’s business would crater. But Block added that he underestimated Musk’s ability to raise capital in huge amounts, reinvent himself and captivate shareholders.  \n“The market cap, the luster, the élan of Elon, is still there,” Block wrote, in explaining why his bets against Tesla have gone away.  \n“Tesla shorts have focused on Tesla’s lack of scale to compete in EVs with GM, Ford, VW, etc.,” Block wrote. “They are correct in that lack of scale would have been the death of Tesla. But they were looking at the wrong scale. Tesla is here not because it has scale in terms of manufacturing base or unit sales. It has scale because of its capital base,” he said of Tesla’s $700 billion market cap. He added:  \nOne could look at Tesla’s market cap and think it’s fragile — that reality will shatter it. However, Tesla should be able to raise many billions before its cap becomes sub-scale — and keep in mind that Tesla equity raises tend to push the stock higher. (Those “dumb money” investors actually knew that capital base scale is what mattered all along.)  \nNegative publicity about short-sellers during the meme stock rally has cost hedge funds, Block wrote. His firm’s latest fund, which launched in February, raised only $30 million, or less than half of what he expected, because the “carnage spooked some investors.” Nonetheless, the fund is up nearly 11 percent since it started, at a time when the market has been rising, which aren’t conducive conditions for outspoken short-sellers.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">Tesla is here not because it has scale in terms of manufacturing base or unit sales.

They consider it one of the most definitive signals of a bull market and, therefore, a strong buy signal. However, there are also analysts who question the validity of the Cross pattern.

It would actually stop running if the call volume was mostly hedging. E.g. They sell you a call at a .2 delta, then with that premium they buy 4 calls at the .05 delta and pocket and difference in premium. As the price increases the calls they're long in increase their delta beyond what their short call increases by. Now they have to sell shares to remain delta neutral and that increases selling pressure and tends to dampen price increases.

{"title": "$RIDE - Why Lordstown Motors is Headed to Zero", "selftext": "I think after the last earnings call there is a lot of incorrect information or straight out distortion of facts being put out by people and analysts alike here and would like to set the record straight with what I believe the facts are.\n\n**Production:**\n\nThe company in their earnings call said they are on track to start production at the end of Sep 2021. If you actually listened to what they said, they said this is for test-builds that they hope to validate in Q4 and to deliver a few to some special early customers in Q1' 2022. They further said or implied that they expect regular commercial deliveries to start in Q2' 2022. Previously, they said on the Q1' 2021 call they had enough cash to ramp production to produce and deliver 1,000 vehicles this year. Now delivery (ignoring their special test-builds delivered to early customers) is pushed back to Q2' 2022. Maybe the word PRODUCTION is being misused to imply something other than what they are doing. I would suggest the correct term for what they are doing now is PRE-PRODUCTION. In any case this is semantics as revenue requires deliveries, not production.\n\n**Equity Line of Credit (ELOC):**\n\nThere have been claims that there is a \"Line of Credit\" providing up to $400M in financing in place. In fact this is a complete misrepresentation. Below is the link to an SEC filing describing the agreement between RIDE and YA. Here are some key points and how the $400M is computed and why it does not mean anything.\n\nOn 7/23/2021 they entered into the agreement with YA to purchase up to $400M of their Class A Common Stock over a 36 month period at RIDE's discretion (that should be a red flag there. As why would YA agree to this... well all will be explained). Per that filing, \" The net proceeds that we may receive under the Purchase Agreement cannot be determined at this time...\", which means that while RIDE can potentially receive up to $400M, they might receive far less but can't predict that amount, as it depends on the stock price.\n\nThe agreement says that RIDE can only sell YA, up to 35,144,690 in shares, UNLESS, (1) they obtain shareholder approval to sell more or (2) the average price they sell the shares to YA at is over $7.48 per share. The price of the shares is 3% less than the \"simple average of the daily VWAP's for the three trading days following notice to YA\" There are also daily limits on how many shares RIDE can sell to YA at any time.\n\nSo assuming 35M shares, at a current share price of about $5.8 that is about $204M before the 3% discount to market price that RIDE nets. For RIDE to net 400M, with selling 35M shares they need a share price of $11.4. Alternatively they need shareholders to approve selling much more than 35M shares (so just more dilution) or they need the average price to be over $7.48, which will allow them to increase the shares they sell, so also more dilution.\n\nIn sum, at current market prices they net about $200M under this \"Equity Line of Credit\" or share offering. However, as selling shares will likely depress the price, they should net far less.\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001558370-21-009222/](https://sec.report/Document/0001558370-21-009222/)\n\n**Further Dilution:**\n\nPer the SEC filing below, it says that Mr. Burns can sell 50% of his shares by 10/23/2021. Steve Burns owns 46.4 million shares, so assuming he sells when his shares are unlocked he can sell 23.2M shares end of Oct 2021. While in theory not \"dilutive\" the end of lock-ups tend to have a similar impact by flooding the market with more shares than demand for them.\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-090313/#tSTTR](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-090313/#tSTTR)\n\n**Cash Position:**\n\nPer their Q2 earnings call and reports they have about 366M in cash on hand at 6/30/2021. In their earnings report they suggested about 200M in operating expenses for the rest of 2021 and about 215M in CAPEX. While they suggested they can time some of the payments in Q3, this comes to about 415M in cash needed to get through the year. That is about 50M cash short.\n\nGoing back to their ELOC, at current share price they can raise about 200M, so assuming they raise the funds without dropping the share price that leaves them  with 150M at year end. It is reasonable to assume that their quarterly cash needs will only increase as they attempt to get to production (this has been the case so far for them and has been the case by every other auto maker as far as I can tell) means that for Q1' 2022 they will need over 200M.  The conclusion is obvious, that on top of the current share offering, if the share price does not go up, they must issue more shares. Further, they project regular commercial deliveries in Q2' 2022 so the money they need will not be insignificant.\n\n**Other Sources of Funds:**\n\nThe Company suggested that they are getting a valuation on their plant and equipment in order to possibly borrow funds against that. They suggested that the value is much more than the book value of about $300M. The fact is, a lot of their equipment will be installed and modified to their specs and will not be suitable without additional cost to another manufacturer. This means that fire sale value, or what someone might actually lend against it, will likely be far less than the book value. Perhaps to Lordstown, the value is higher, but to a third party that is a very doubtful assumption. As to the factory itself, it was an old plant that GM shut down. This is not something people are looking to buy. For EV's, you see with Tesla, Lucid, and others they are looking or building new factories with layouts designed for EV's and not ICE vehicles. I would again doubt the factory has much value for a lender. Hard to know what they can borrow using their plant and equipment as collateral, but it clearly will not be much.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the dilution and share unlocks coming and their downward pressure on share price, as it stands now the company will have difficult raising sufficient funds to get to production. For the company to be viable, it must have its share price go up first to enable them to raise funds favorably. As evidenced by today's price action, this company is not attracting substantial shareholder inflows, so it remains unclear how the share price increases first to enable them to raise sufficient funds. So based on the current share price, I don't understand how this company, even if they do everything right going forward, can succeed.\n\n**Some Other Thoughts:**\n\nNone of the above analysis is dependent on whether the in-wheel tech works or not or is a good candidate for a commercially viable electric truck. I have for several months expressed substantial doubts about the tech and RIDE's ability to execute and have no reason to assume otherwise. In any case, even if it could work, structurally RIDE is not in a position anymore to commercialize it.\n\nI actually also have an issue with Price Targets analysts are setting here. Either you have to have a high price target or a near-zero one. An in-between target makes no sense as current share price means they are headed to insolvency before they can produce anything. This company is either a $10+ investment or a <$1 investment, there is no in-between.\n\n**TL,DR price-target <$1 and bankruptcy in Q4' 2021 or Q1' 2022 (if they are lucky they push it off till Q2' 2022).**\n\nPositions: a bunch of $5 Puts for Jan 2022 that are currently up about 20%.", "id": "p36ywi", "created_utc": 1628796556.0, "score": 91, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 263, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1948|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p36ywi/ride_why_lordstown_motors_is_headed_to_zero/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "As soon as you buy puts, GM will purchase them, Cathie Woods will add $800M to her portfolio, and Elon Musk will tweet \"The cyber truck is dead but Lordstown is pretty good.", "score": 91, "replies": [{"body": "I would be more concerned with the Messiah showing up and demanding an Endurance to lead his flock than your concerns, but yeah, makes sense that this will happen (although Elon tweeting that would probably cause me to go into uncontrollable hysterics).", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Then you just buy PUTs and CALLs.
