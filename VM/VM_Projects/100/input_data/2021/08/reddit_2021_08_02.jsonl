They then pay the current premium (may be higher or lower than the original buyer paid) and then they simply let it expire worthless (since they don't need to buy the stocks from themselves).\n\n\nFor example, you sell a call with a $30 strike price for $1. The buyer pays the premium ($100) to you. As the seller, there is nothing left to do, you just sit back and wait for them (or whoever they sell it to) to either purchase the shares at the strike price or let it expire worthless.\n\nIf you want to close the position before then, you will have to buy the call back. If it is now listed for $1.50, you have to pay $150 to close it ($50 loss). If it's listed for $0.50, you only pay $50 to close it ($50 profit).\n\nIf you don't close it (and it's fine not to), the holder can exercise and buy the shares from you at $30 (you'll get $3000, since you are selling 100). They will typically only do that if the price is above $30 though (so you theoretically lose out on a bigger profit that you could have gotten if you hadn't already committed to selling at $30). Or, if the price is lower than $30, the buyer will likely just let it expire worthless and you keep the premium and the shares (in this case, $100).\n\nBasically, the only reason to close a position would be if you think it is actually going to go above the strike price and you don't really want to sell the stocks at that price. Otherwise, you don't need to close it, it will automatically close when it expires without paying to do so.\n\n*EDIT: In summary, there are basically three things that can happen when you sell a call. Again, let's use the above example ($30 strike price, $1 premium).\n\nA: The call expires and the stock price is higher (let's say $35), the buyer will exercise the call and buy the shares. You get $100 from premium plus $3000 from selling the 100 shares. You now have $3100 but no longer have the shares. Hopefully you paid less than $3100 to buy them, the difference is your profit.\n\nB: The call expires and the stock price is lower (let's say $25), the buyer will not exercise the call, you keep the $100 and still have the shares (so you can sell another call if you want).\n\nC: You decide to close the position early. You then have to buy for the current premium and, as I said above, it depends on the price. If it is higher than what the buyer paid you, you will lose money, if it is lower, you still get a profit, but not as much as you would have gotten if it just expired on the expiration date.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "A counter party, perhaps selling their call to you, closing out their long, or a part of their spread, or a market maker.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Hi\n\nSo I had LB puts who got transformed into  BBWI1 puts.\n\nThe issue is I can't trade them (webull); in their paper it does say shares become BBWI and options BBWI1 and that 1 BBWI1 option will execute for 1 BBWI + 0.33VSCO.

It's important, but not the only thing that is important, particularly if you plan to sell to open options.

That's what most credit traders do. The theta decay curve is one of the only reliable trends in option pricing -- extrinsic value **must be zero** by expiration, and that relentless decline to zero is represented by theta. That overriding fact means that you can make bets on theta with a high degree of probability of success. Short selling/credit trading is all about sell high and buy back low later. And the price will be lower in the future as long as theta is non-zero. The risk comes mainly from delta, as the intrinsic value may rise faster than the extrinsic value declines.

What I'm saying is that there are many ways to achieve that goal and LEAPS calls are not even in the top 3 with respect to balance of risk/reward.\n\nYou are not limiting your losses. You are expanding your potential losses by paying more up front. Simple example: Would you rather pay $2000 up front one-time for a 2 year hold, or $200 for each of 8 consecutive 3 month holds? The cumulative holding time is the same, but the second strategy only costs you $1600 if your win rate is 0% (worst case). Plus, as a bonus the second strategy lets you collect profit along the way, while you don't plan to do anything with your LEAPS call until it expires. True, it also means you might realize losses along the way, but as this is a taxable account that might have tax benefits to compensate somewhat.\n\nAs for the exercise to own in 2 years, the second strategy lets you buy a few shares several times a year, every time you close/roll the 3 month calls for a profit.

Theta decay is just about the only thing in options that has some measure of predictability. Extrinsic value **must be zero** at expiration. So if it is greater than zero at the time you open the trade, you know with 100% certainty where that extrinsic value is going to end up at expiration.

How much better depends on PR and regulators.\n\nAnther point is that to me it's clear that Tesla Robotaxi is far in the future. All companies are now focused on ADAS for personal use, to monetize it, and Robotaxi comes later.\n\nThis means you just need L3, not L5.\n\nWhy ? Because I see zero effort from Tesla in making the necessary infrastructure for Robotaxi. Where are the SW teams to develop the service? Where are the custom mini-vans with 9 seats, as Elon said?

I've also seen and heard of Tesla owners talking about or even showing on YouTube... the misjudged speeds and cornering angles FSD was experiencing ... These things happen more often than people would like to believe but it's ok because we're not yet at level 5.\n\nSo if we extrapolate this... Its not hard to imagine that FSD could potentially and very easily (assuming absolutely no human intervention and driver is not observing from the rear seat)...

I'm simply saying and have reiterated here is that we are not yet at level 5.  That's why many people here (including myself) would currently trust a 16 year old human driver over FSD.

And they would use their own judgment any day over FSD. \n\nBut as for myself, I'm more confident that FSD will reach a point where it will become much safer (even than a human driver) because we don't have 7 eyes around our heads.  What we're currently more superior at is experience and judgment, and it remains to be seen if Software (AI) can match and exceed that type of wiring that we have in our brains (which has taken hundreds of thousands of evolutionary years to arrive at what we are capable of doing today...

Going from 4-5 seems a little easier than going from 2-5\n\nIt is possible that going from Level 4-5 (for Waymo) may be more difficult than from Level 2-5 (for Tesla), depending on the engineering approach.\n\n[https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/assets/cm/content/blog/sae-j3016-visual-chart\\_5.3.21.pdf](https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/assets/cm/content/blog/sae-j3016-visual-chart_5.3.21.pdf)\n\nLevel 5 requires that:\n\n* This feature can drive the vehicle under all conditions (practicality)\n* feature can drive everywhere (practicality and scale)\n\nSome engineering paths result in a dead end.  They reach a certain point but cannot progress further for a variety of reasons.  Examples are Apple's original MacOS (discontinued in 2002), and Intel's Netburst architecture (replaced in 2006).  At some point, no amount of hacks and workarounds could keep these products viable, because the basic approach to solving the problem was flawed.  In Intel's case, the company managed to beat AMD to general levels of CPU performance around 2002-2003, but Intel's basic strategy of designing extremely high clocked processors hit a thermal wall by 2004.  Extremely high levels of power consumption and heat output from Netburst chips of this era prevented Intel from continuing to scale product performance further, and they were forced to scrap Netburst entirely for a different, more power efficient microarchitecture.\n\nWaymo's use of HD maps and a complicated array of different sensors may ultimately prove to be unworkable.\n\nIt's impossible to say ahead of time what will happen with complicated systems.\n\nYou stated that Waymo is \"at L4 directly because of their impracticality\", but what if that impracticality is the result of a fundamental flaw in their approach?  They may hit a wall at L4, just like Intel did with Netburst in 2004.\n\nThis is why I am skeptical that Waymo will reach Level 5 first.  That doesn't mean I think it is impossible.  Also, people should consider that there are other companies competing in driving autonomy, like Mobileye (Intel) and Cruise.  It's not a 2-horse race between Waymo and Tesla.

It's worse than worthless.\n\n-----------------\n\n**Competition**\n\nYou're arguing that competition is going to tank TSLA's share price — but how? By competitors stealing market share and cutting into Tesla's sales?\n\nOK. Let's put aside the facts that no company has announced any models that compare favourably with a directly competing Telsa model on price/performance, and that no company plans to approach Tesla's current EV production capacity anytime soon.\n\nLet's assume that Tesla's share of the global BEV market will fall drastically from the 25% it owns today. \n\nBEVs [are only about 4% of the global car market](https://www.jato.com/q1-2021-ev-global-sales-at-the-same-level-as-2017-full-year-figures/) today. They will become ~100% of the global car market by 2030 or 2040, depending on whose estimates you believe.\n\nThat means BEV sales will grow from ~2.5 million per year to ~100 million+ per year in 2030 and keep growing. If TSLA loses 80% of its market share by then (down to 5% of the global market), its unit sales will still grow from 500,000 per year to 5 million.\n\nThat's 10x growth even *if* competition wipes out Tesla's market share.\n\nIn reality, competition won't dent Tesla's growth, because production is the primary constraint in the BEV market. \n\n[This chart](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7tB-bVXsAEvofO?format=jpg&name=large) illustrates the global demand curve for EVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars.\n\nTesla and every other carmaker will be able to sell every half-decent EV they can build, and still only meet a fraction of the demand for EVs over the next decade+.\n\nChevy will keep selling every Bolt it makes, even though nobody actually wants a Chevy Bolt.\n\nUnfortunately for traditional carmakers, their EV sales won't make up for the much greater losses in their ICE sales. They have so much capital tied up in their declining ICE production, they'll struggle to build enough EV production capacity to stay afloat.  \n\nTesla is aiming to build 20 million cars per year by 2030, and the primary limiting factor will be battery supply. It's planning to build or source 3 TWh of batteries per year by then. \n\nVolkswagen aims to overtake Tesla as the world's biggest EV maker, but it [only plans to use 300 GWh of batteries by 2030](https://driving.ca/auto-news/news/volkswagen-hikes-battery-cell-demand-in-aggressive-ev-expansion).\n\nHow is VW going to beat Tesla's EV sales with 1/10th the battery supply?\n\nHow is competition going to be a problem for Tesla if demand far outstrips supply for everyone? \n \n------------\n\n**Side note on ARK's holdings allocations**\n\nWhy are you criticizing ARK for making TSLA its largest position as it outperforms its other holdings?\n\nDon't you want your largest position to be one if its best?

{"title": "Once In A Lifetime Hog Future Opportunity In California", "selftext": "As the beginning of next year, California will enforce new animal welfare law for breeding pigs and other farm animals. But only 4% of the hog operations currently can comply. According to one farmer, to meet the new standard, he needs 3 million for the upgrade to raise just 250 hogs. Restaurants owners are worried because bacon is one of the most popular breakfast items and bacon helped their business survive the pandemic. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect?srnd=premium)).  People love bacon from all backgrounds. \"You know, I work and live with a lot of Asian and Hispanic populations in the city and their diet consists of pork bacon. Pork bacon is huge,\" Kim said. \"It’s almost like bread and butter.\"\n\nBacon love is ingrained into our soul and genetics and therefore an inelastic demand. A small change in bacon supply can lead to a drastic change in price, as explained by graph below.\n\n[Inelastic Demand Price Action](https://preview.redd.it/huc5pz6xoue71.jpg?width=570&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcea15c61d5e19157c1cfb07d1e9684142bf67c2)\n\nAccording to consulting firm Hitamiya Group, if half of the pork supply was lost, bacon price would jump 60% which means a $6 package could rise to $9.60 cents ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect?srnd=premium)). If 90% - 95% of the supplies are gone, the fair price should be at least 2.5 times the current market value. And that means **1 package of bacon is $15 per package.**\n\nYou must wonder, how do I profit from this? A very ancient trade technique - BUY LOW SELL HIGH\n\nI am not talking about buying 10 packs of bacon from Costco and resale them later. I am talking about doing it at scale. Go big or go home.\n\n**Step 1 - Install Freezers in Your Garage**\n\nLet’s figure out how many freezers you can potentially have. First park your cars on the street and empty the garage. The average garage size is 12 feet \\* 22 feet \\* 8 feet. So 12 \\* 22 \\* 8 = 2112 cubic feet.\n\nThe below fridge dimension is 37.25 x 20.75 x 33.25 inches and can storage up to 7 cubic feet items.\n\n[ Ideal Fridge to Keep Bacon](https://preview.redd.it/yfk3jbp3que71.jpg?width=1282&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=731f5da26e2187ec37b1dbd4fbabc5b7789ebd15)\n\nLet’s do more math to see how many fridges your garage can potentially store.\n\n2112 (volume of garage) \\* 1728 (1 cubic feet is 1728 cubic inch) / 37.25 \\* 20.75 \\* 33.25 (volume of fridge) = **142 fridges**\n\nObviously you can’t just stack all of those fridges in the garage. Let’s say we can achieve 80% of that. And that means you can have around **110 fridges.**\n\nRemember to use Amazon FREE SHIPPING. Very important to save cost.\n\n**Fridge Cost with Tax**: 110 \\* 229 \\* 1.1 (Uncle Sam wants the tax) = **$27709**\n\n|**Item**|Cost|\n|:-|:-|\n|110 Fridges|$27709|\n\n**Step 2 - Buy Bacon in Bulk and use FREE SHIPPING**\n\nAccording to USDA ([https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/meat-price-spreads/](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/meat-price-spreads/)), one package (1 pound) of bacon in  June 2021 is about $6.67. We can get this much lower by buying from Costco in BULK. As you can see below, **our one package cost is $4.53** AFTER tax including delivery. Again, very important to use free shipping to save cost.\n\n[Bacon Price From Costco](https://preview.redd.it/4a12382erue71.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f5dacba1eb055847e3b266aef24fb5abcee393)\n\nIt's time to calculate how much to buy. The size of one package of bacon is about 10 inch \\* 4 inch \\* 1 inch so 40 cubic inch. And the volume of our fridge is 7 cubic feet which is 12096 cubic inch. So one fridge can store around 300 packages or pounds of bacon. With 110 fridges, we can store 33000 packages or pounds of bacon. Each pound of bacon is $4.53, so the total cost of bacon is $149,490\n\nTotal Cost So Far\n\n|**Item**|Cost|\n|:-|:-|\n|110 Fridges|$27709|\n|33000 packages or 2200 cases of bacon|$149,490|\n\n**Step 3 - Factor In the Electricity Cost**\n\nRunning 110 freezers in the garage is apparently very energy consuming and electricity is expensive in California, at about 20 cents / kWh.\n\nThe freezer is 150 watts so running 110 freezers for let's say 6 months will cost $14256. You can check my math below:\n\n150 watts \\* 6 (month) \\* 30 (days) \\* 24 (hours) / 1000 = 648 kWh (one fridge running a year energy consumption)\n\n648 kWh \\* 0.2 cents / kWh \\* 110 = $14256\n\nTotal Cost So Far\n\n|**Item**|Cost|\n|:-|:-|\n|110 Fridges|$27709|\n|33000 packages or 2200 cases of bacon|$149,490|\n|Electricity|$14256|\n\nStep 4 - Sell High And Take Profits\n\nDon't diamond hand bacon, you are in 2022 and it's time to sell for a profit!\n\nThe cost of bacon per package factoring in everything so far is **$5.8.** And we unload each package for $15.

Taking sliced bacon and placing it in a seasoned salt water solution and you basically have instantaneous marketable bacon because the bacon can cure in transit.\n\nSo depending on how committed we are we could just purchase the dry cured bacon and then resell it into the California market per OP’s original plan. Again because this is dry cured refrigeration is not required. Recall that OP was only seeking one inventory turn over the course of one month.\n\nI suppose if we were enterprising and wanted to make a sustaining business we could do it all from pork belly (which we can buy futures and take delivery of. I mention this because this is WSB and we like things like this.) Anyway, dry cured bacon on the other hand is prepared using the salt, seasoning, and nitrites in a dry environment using the large cut of meat. This curing can be done at room temperature. And it is this that allows us to circumvent the purchase of freezers. Then we smoke it, slice it (or cut it) and ship it. For this we could just ship in batches because we would be preparing it in batches. No refrigeration is needed.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "But you can't do batches without shipping in batches, which you can't do because it won't meet CA requirements, so it has to be all up front before they go into effect. Which is also why a sustaining business and pork futures won't work, they either won't be compliant or the profit margin won't be there.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You are correct I would not be able to do batches without shipping in batches. You are further correct in that I would not be able to use pork futures. I made this mistake due to insufficient homework on the matter. I own that. Furthermore, pork belly futures ceased to be a thing back in 2011.\n\nSo I didn’t detect much in the way of your comment here about the scalp using the dry cure. So let’s focus on the sustaining operation. As I said before, I had not done sufficient homework. But let’s discuss it further.\n\nI will say that you are correct the profit margin will be greatest at the beginning. However, I think that outsized margin compared to the current environment could still be obtained, because it would take a long time for the corporate pork to adapt. The key is to be operating in that period of time when no further extensions are granted and big pork has not completely adapted their supply chains to be compliant. Given that California accounts for -15% of pork consumed (and here we will assume that it is consistent for all cuts), it is too big of a market not to comply with their specific regulations (see California emissions, Prop 65, etc).\n\nSo the California requirements don’t hit until January of next year. I would have 5 months minimum to operate my business in the existing regulatory environment. Probably more, due to the likelihood of compliance extensions being granted.\n\nAs I said earlier, you are correct futures would not work. Because of the standardized delivery mechanism. That error is completely my mistake, I had not done sufficient homework for this thought experiment. A further error I made again through insufficient homework is that pork belly futures are no longer traded: they ceased in 2011.\n\nAnyway, a forward contact would be the correct way to go. Since these are customizable, I could stipulate good delivery of the pork belly for California. Obviously, I would necessarily have to pay a premium over the standard lean home g contracts not only due to the good delivery location specification, but also the specificity of the meat cut. So early on in this enterprise, it would be difficult, but customers, particularly large customers may be willing to pay a premium knowing that they will have a supplier capable of delivering when the new regulatory regime is put into place. So I initially would be unlikely to be a primary supplier, but my customers would have an interest in keeping me in business due to the uncertainty in the implementation of the regulations. Every business in this post Covid era has had to deal with supply chain uncertainty. There will be some and perhaps even a great number that will pay for some supply chain certainty.\n\nEdit: well I learned a couple times of things in the process of this thought experiment. Have couple of karma on me for that. Also, at this point, I think I am going to leave this be as I have no true interest in this endeavor. Cheers.

{"title": "U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and Congressional Budget Office release reports proving the economy has taken massive downturn Q2, and admits inflation and GDP growth will surpass \"unsustainable levels\" by the end of the year. 2011 CBO projections v.s. 2021 actual numbers", "selftext": "2011 Congressional Budget Office projections V.S. the actual 2021 Budget numbers for Jan-July 2021\n\nIn August of 2011 during the debt ceiling crisis, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the federal budget would show a deficit of close to $1.5 trillion, or 9.8 percent of GDP. \n\n8/1/2021 we are entering a new debt ceiling crisis with congress on a 6 week vacation, combined with an expired rent moratorium where 6.2 million renters face evictions, the homeowners of said tenant's houses will likely never receive back-pay for rent owed possibly causing record high bankruptcies akin to 2008 or worse, and without taking this into account, CBO projects a federal budget deficit of $3.0 trillion this year as the economic disruption caused by the 2020–2021 coronavirus pandemic, while the legislation enacted in response continue to boost the deficit (which was large by historical standards even before the pandemic).\n\nAt 13.4 % of gross domestic product (GDP), the deficit in 2021 would be the second largest since 1945, exceeded only by the 14.9 % shortfall recorded in 2020.\n\nFor the period of economic expansion from the second quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of 2019, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.3 %.\n\nFor the period of economic expansion from the second quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 14.1 %.\n\nWhich in my opinion and as shown below by these reports is due to the insanely high level of newly printed money and covid stimulus payments.\n\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/publication/21999\n\nCBO estimates from 2011 would be heaven in comparison to the reality we're facing, which is a crippled economy, and stock market on the verge of collapse. Evident as follows;\n\nIn 2011 CBO projected the 3 month Treasury bill to be worth 4.4% in 2021.\n\nThe actual 3 month Treasury bill rate for July 2021 is worth between 0.01 and 0.06%.\n\nIn 2011 the projected 10 year Treasury note bill rate was projected to be 5.4% for 2021\n\nThe actual 10 year Treasury note bill rate is 1.24% In July 2021\n\nhttps://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/year-yearforecast110125.xls\n\nPart 2 of 4\n\n7/29/2021 Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Beureau of Economic Analysis, on the Gross Domestic Product, Second Quarter 2021\n\nA report by the Beureau of Economic Analysis, BEA, shows that the 2nd quarter of 2021 has been a bloodbath in terms of loss of income, savings, and increased expenses for the average American.\n\nPersonal Income: \"Current-dollar personal income decreased $1.32 trillion in the second quarter, or 22.0 percent, in contrast to an increase of $2.33 trillion (revised), or 56.8 percent, in the first quarter of 2021.\" -\n\nThis means that income literally was cut by nearly 22% on average in 2nd quarter of 2021.\n\nDisposable personal income decreased $1.42 trillion, or 26.1 percent, in the second quarter, in contrast to an increase of $2.27 trillion, or 63.7 percent (revised), in the first quarter. - Again all fake gains thru the stimmy.\n\nReal disposable personal income decreased 30.6 percent in Q2, in contrast to an increase of 57.6 percent in Q1. - and again Trump & Biden Bucks.\n\nThis means that (money considered as non-essential, 🙄) decreased by over $890 billion for Americans in Q2 of 2021 alone.\n\nAT THE SAME TIME, Personal outlays (expenses) increased $680.8 billion in Q2, after increasing $538.8 billion for Q1. - This means that expenses have increased by $150+ Billion in average from Q1 2021 to Q2 2021 for Americans! Can you say inflation?\n\nPersonal savings was $1.97 trillion in the second quarter, compared with $4.07 trillion (revised) in the first quarter of 2021\n\nThe personal saving rate—personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income—was DOWN 10.9 percent in the second quarter, which was already DOWN 20.8 percent in the first quarter.\n\nThis means Americans have lost $3 TRILLION in savings Q2 2021 ALONE.\n\nWhere does it go? Banks and lenders?\n\nInflation seems to be the only thing that's going up this quarter.\n\n\"The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 5.7 percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent (revised) in the first quarter...   The PCE price index increased 6.4 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent in the 1st quarter.\n\nhttps://www.bea.gov/news/2021/gross-domestic-product-second-quarter-2021-advance-estimate-and-annual-update\n\n5/1/2021 Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, on GDP and the Economy for Q1 2021\n\nThe acceleration in real GDP growth reflects artificial economic strength.\n\nThe GDP is primarily based in the continued economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as government assistance payments were distributed to households and businesses. An acceleration in consumer spending and upturns in federal as well as state and local government spending more than accounted for the acceleration in real GDP.\n\nThese were partly offset by downturns in private inventory investment and exports and by decelerations in residential fixed investment and nonresidential fixed investment. Imports slowed.\n\nThe US Economy by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis says;\n\n\"The acceleration in consumer spending reflected an upturn in spending on goods and an acceleration in spending on services.\n\nWithin goods, all components of both durable and nondurable goods contributed to the upturn. The leading contributors were upturns in spending on motor vehicles and parts as well as on food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption.\n\nWithin services, the leading contributors to the acceleration were upturns in spending on food services and accommodations and on transportation services.\n\nAn upturn in federal government spending was the second largest contributor to the acceleration in real GDP. The upturn primarily reflected an upturn in nondefense spending on intermediate goods and services purchased by government. In the first quarter, the processing and administration of Paycheck Protection Program loan applications by banks on behalf of the federal government added approximately $13.2 billion ($52.6 billion at an annual rate) to nondefense services. Federal government purchases of COVID-19 vaccines for distribution to the public contributed to the upturn in nondefense goods.\n\nThe upturn in state and local government spending reflected an upturn in consumption expenditures, led by compensation of employees, that was partly offset by a downturn in gross investment, led by a downturn in structures.\n\nThe downturn in private inventory investment was led by a larger decrease in retail trade and a downturn in manufacturing. Within retail trade, the largest contributor was a larger decrease in inventory investment by motor vehicle dealers. Within manufacturing, there were downturns in both durable and nondurable goods manufacturing inventory investment.\n\nThe downturn in exports reflected downturns in both goods (led by a deceleration in industrial supplies and a downturn in foods, feeds, and beverages) and services (led by a deceleration in transport and a downturn in royalties and license fees).\n\nResidential fixed investment slowed, largely reflecting a slowdown in new residential structures, notably single-family units, and a downturn in brokers' commissions.\n\nNonresidential fixed investment slowed, reflecting a slowdown in investment in equipment that was partly offset by a smaller decrease in investment in structures. Investment in intellectual property products grew at about the same rate as in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe slowdown in equipment investment was more than accounted for by a slowdown in transportation equipment that was partly offset by an acceleration in information processing equipment.\n\nThe smaller decrease in structures was more than accounted for by a smaller decrease in investment in industrial structures.\n\nImports slowed. As a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, imports contributed to the acceleration in first-quarter GDP. The main contributor was a downturn in automotive vehicles, engines, and parts\"\n\nCan you say they're taking our jobs overseas?

Inflation rises in 2021 to its highest rate since 2008 as increases in the supply of goods and services lag behind increases in the demand for them. By 2022, supply adjusts more quickly, and inflation falls but remains above its prepandemic rate through 2025. As the economy continues to expand over the forecast period, the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes rises, reaching 2.7 percent in 2025 and 3.5 percent in 2031—still low by historical standards.\"\n\nBut unemployment hasn't decreased at all.\n\n7/21/2021 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released report states, \"The national unemployment rate, 5.9 percent, was little changed over the month\"\n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2021/unemployment-rates-lower-in-49-states-and-dc-from-june-2020-to-june-2021.htm\n\n...\n\nPart 3 of 4\n\nThe Debt Ceiling Dillema\n\n\"A two-year deal to suspend the debt ceiling lapsed at midnight (7/31/21) following inaction from Congress and President Biden to give the U.S. more borrowing authority. The Treasury Department will now begin taking what it refers to as \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its debt.\"\n\n\"Republican leaders have told Democrats that there can be no bipartisan debt ceiling agreement without a slate of debt reduction measures targeting the roughly $28 trillion national debt. Several GOP lawmakers have floated a deal similar to the 2011 Budget Control Act, which ended a debt ceiling standoff shortly before the U.S. suffered its first ever credit downgrade.\"\n\nCBO says, \"the Treasury would probably run out of cash sometime in the first quarter of the next fiscal year (which begins on October 1, 2021, most likely in October or November, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for its activities, default on its debt obligations, or both.\n\nThe timing and size of revenue collections and outlays over the coming months could differ noticeably from CBO's projections. Therefore, the extraordinary measures could be exhausted, and the Treasury could run out of cash, either earlier or later than CBO projects.\n\nYellen has also said uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic and the federal government's fiscal response has made it harder to pin down exactly how long the U.S. to avoid a default.\"\n\nYellen stated that the default could happen as soon as early September.\n\nThis means we could see the US Treasury's ability to pay almost all bills completely crippled well before or after Congress' return to duty as they just began a 6 week vacation on 7/31/21.\n\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/finance/565745-missed-debt-ceiling-deadline-kicks-off-high-stakes-fight\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-07-29/the-federal-debt-limit-political-drama%3f_amp=true\n\nOur GDP is a complete farce that was being held up by stimulus payments, government covid spending, Repurchase/Reverse Repurchase Agreements of Treasury Bills to the tune of now over $1 Trillion per day, imports and exports are down huge while sea ports are more severely congested than ever before as are airline cargo carriers. Mortgage applications, sales, and broker commissions are down heavily, trucking rates are at all time highs with minimal availability especially for ocean and rail drayage, warehouse storage for said freight is at maximum capacity with available space at all time lows & prices at all time highs due to supply and demand, retail trade and manufacturing are down significantly as well in Q2. Consumer spending is down as well as savings to lows not seen in many years as well.\n\nEssentially the bubble from stimulus has already been popped. It's only a short matter of time before we see the effects on our country and it will be reflected on the stock market first and foremost as it is already being seen by the banks unwillingness to invest in long term stocks/bonds/treasuries using the record high $1 Trillion per day Repurchase / Reverse Program to prevent the dollar and market from collapsing together.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD\n\nA 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office analyzing the 2013 debt ceiling standoff found that \"investors reported taking the unprecedented action of systematically avoiding certain Treasury securities,\" which are considered almost as safe as cash, causing widespread issues across credit markets.\n\n\"Industry groups emphasized that even a temporary delay in payment could undermine confidence in the full faith and credit of the United States and therefore cause significant damage to markets for Treasury securities and other assets,\" the report said.\n\nThe last 2 times the debt ceiling crisis occurred in 2011 and 2013, rating agencies to re-evaluate the rating of US government debt.\n\nOn October 15 2013, Fitch Ratings placed the United States under a \"Rating watch negative\" in response to the crisis.\n\nOn October 17 2013, Dagong Global Credit Rating downgraded the United States from A to A−, and maintained a negative outlook on the country's credit.\n\nIn 2013 while lawmakers and the Obama Administration came to an agreement on the debt ceiling, from September 19th to October 9th, the S&P 500 moved below its 50 day moving average and the SPY lost 5.2%.\n\nOn 8/9/2011 during the Debt Ceiling Crisis The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 634.76 points as approximately $2.5 TRILLION was erased from global equities.\n\nThat's $2,500,000,000,000.00 in one day.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index lost 6.7 percent to 1,119.46, its lowest level since September, as all 500 stocks fell for the first time since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1996.\n\n----\n\nPart 4 of 4\n\n7/30/21 -Federal Reserve announced commercial bank asset and LIABILITY numbers release H8\n\nThe Liabilities have grown big time since last year.\n\nFederal Reserve released COMMERCIAL BANK ASSET & LIABILITIES numbers for July 2021 and year over year losses have increased tremendously in the tens of trillions of dollars, a large majority of this is based on derivatives, options calls/puts, mortgage back securities, swaps of all kinds, rehypothecated shares, naked shorts, synthetic shares up the ass... See screenshot for explanation of subsection 22 losses description.\n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/\n\nAll of the 11 Tables provided shows an increase of losses.\n\nThe only table pictured is TABLE 2 showing an increase of $1.54 Trillion in unrealized losses in the form of derivatives, securities, swaps, etc...\n\nOn Table 2 (of 11) alone, their RESIDUAL Assets (less liabilities) <minus expenses> increased only $40 Billion compared to the $1.54 Trillion increase in losses.\n\nSo even though they had huge increases in revenue (covid stimulus), the net gain was hugely diminished by the losses in these sectors.\n\n6/28/2021\n\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency released report stated that 4 large banks held 89 percent of the total banking industry notional amount of derivatives, a total of 1,385 insured U.S. commercial banks and savings associations held derivatives at the end of first quarter 2021.\n\nAdditionally,\n\nderivative contracts remained concentrated in interest rate products, which represented 72.7 percent of total derivative notional amounts.\n\nthe percentage of centrally cleared derivatives transactions increased quarter-over-quarter to 38.2 percent in first quarter 2021.\n\nhttps://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities/index-quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities.html\n\nIn 2011, gridlocked House Republicans and the Obama White House came within days of a drop-dead default over the debt ceiling. The S&P 500 fell for five days in a row leading up to the weekend that lawmakers finally struck a deal. Over 4% of the entire stock market was lost in those 5 days.\n\nTLDR; \nI plan to invest heavily in stonks who's beta runs inverse to the market, such as good old movie and game stonks because when the market goes down, they'll come up.

Double dipped on GME - Jan and Feb)\n\nAMC - like $120k\n\nLMND, AMD, DPZ and some other base hits of like $35 to 50k.\n\nRight now I am down like $130k on CLNE, but waiting for it to recover. I hit $1.4M again on CLNE in June but didn't close out and lock in gains of about $350k.  Some other plays I am down like 50% on that I think will recover include HNST, SOFI, ROOT, Twtr, NVDA (PUTS).\n\nYou have to know how to sell the big winners and when not to sell CC.\n\nBiggest win was GME the first time. Sold a bunch premature and had over 8k  shares locked in Covered Calls that cost me at least $2 to $3M in upside. Learned that if Options go deep ITM you want to roll the strike up. I had some April $15 that I rolled up to July $85C and it probably made me an extra couple hundred k (deep itm calls have a delta close to 1 so they act almost exactly like shares).\n\nMy best win was $20k in option on GME I bought around 2/19 to 2/23 that I sold on 2/25 for $170k. If I would have waited until 3/12 it would have easily been 2.5x that.\n\nWild ride. Manage your position size. I rarely have more than 10% in any one position now. Clne is about 30% now as I think it is at the bottom and consolidating to rocket up.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}
