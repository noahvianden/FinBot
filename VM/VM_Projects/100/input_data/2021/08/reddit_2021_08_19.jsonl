Return on capital can be 50%, 100% or even 1000% if you get your strike pinned on a butterfly spread, so to let the odds play out and hamper equity drawdowns based on random price movements, you risk lets say 2% of your account to double it or lose it, add to that the potential adjustments you can make and options trading gets statistically better.\n\nand to address the other guys point on turning 1K to 20T, I'm gonna assume that you were joking but if not then, let me explain why you can make alot but not 20T, simply put the market isn't big enough for that, but earning modest gains can compound small accounts especially if you use leveraged instruments with proper risk managment ie; diversifying. If you diversify you keep your capital intact and are less likely to lose a major Chunk of it. By using leveraged position you can diversify better by owning a lot of assets for a fraction of the price, use the discount in price to buy other assets. and boom this is the formula that hedge funds use to turn a few million into billions of dollars, they don't lose much when they are wrong because they are diversified and when they are right they make as much as they would have owning the same asset at full price (example being buying ATM AAPL call for lets say 2000 dollars two years, this has the same affect as owning 100 shares of AAPL so currently 14600 dollars worth of it.\n\nTo simplify think of a pie chart with each slice being an individual asset, if you use leverage to diversify some slices may grow a-lot or shrink a-lot, when some slices grow they grow faster then other slices can shrink since your losses when you buy you are limited to what you paid and when you sell I'm sure you have contingencies in place to prevent infinite losses. Overall the pie grows over time, sometimes exponentially since you can use profits to allocate to your trades. returns alone is meaningless, since compounding can drastically accelerate gains.

My broker doesnt offer paper trading of options so i started with just normal shares. I recommend starting with these anyway. With options, you need to learn about strikes, expiration dates, the greeks, etc; but the most important thing is to learn to read the charts. This is the same for shares or for options. Find a strategy that works for you. What works for day traders may not necessarily work for swing traders and even within those sub categories, what works for one stock or trader may not work for others. When you find a stock you like work out an entry and exit point and make the paper trade. At your entry point, make a note of where your strike price would be if you were buying an option and where your expiration date would be. Remember for a call, your strike needs to be below where you think the stock price will reach (why would someone buy the contract off of you when they could just get it at market price and save themselves the premium). This will help you learn the direction and magnitude of the movement in the underlying before you even look at the options chain.  \n\n\nNever look at a stock in isolation. Always see how the market it belongs to is performing and how its competitors are performing. My most successful play of the last couple of weeks was an earnings play on UAA (Under Armor). I noticed that NKE (Nike) gapped up after earnings by $20ish on June 25th and saw that UAA had earnings on August 3rd.  Looking at UAA's chart, I saw that it had been on a downtrend since the last earnings report so there was plenty of room to the upside. NKE had also been in a slight downtrend before its breakout. I was expecting a big jump at earnings up to around $23.50 (previous resistance, it was trading around $20 pre earnings I believe) and then to climb higher to $26.50 within a couple of days which was post-COVID highs, and then on higher. What actually happened was UAA closed below previous resistance so I knew the rise wouldn't be as high as I expected. I went in at close with a call for $23.50. Reasoning was, I now expected a day 2 break and then retest that resistance before climbing to $26.50. I was sick that day so didn't follow closely but looking at the daily it appears to have done that. I ended up selling just below the highs on August 10th. I then saw it bounce off of the $26.50 post-COVID highs and entered puts expecting to sell at the previous resistance of $23.50, which I expected to turn into support. It didn't and we fell through. I'm still holding these and will be selling at the 100MA unless there is another massive sell off. \n\nThe reason why I think of this as one of my most successful recent plays is because I got the direction of the underlying right, the time frame right, entry and exits almost perfect and (even though I got the magnitude wrong) my strategy of buying conservative OOTM calls meant that I was able to make money on a move, even though I wasn't 100% correct.  \n\n\nYou wont really be able to use safer strats like covered calls until you have a larger account.

Purely mathematical options pricing is based on the volatility of the underlying - the more its magnitude and speed of movement, the more the options up and down the chain from the spot price will cost. This effect of volatility in the underlying's price on the option's price is quantified in an option's vega.\n\nDelta alone is not nearly the whole story; for example, theta causes options price to decay over time, all the way to zero by expiration (for OTM options). Not understanding this is probably the most common source of losses for new options traders. And the prices for options a different strikes along the chain don't all go to zero at the same rate; theta is highest ATM and decreases the farther you go OTM, but as time goes by, those OTM options, which have the least value to start with, will go to zero before expiration -- this effect is most pronounced in the last few days before expiration, and on the last day of the expiration term, you can watch the OTM options prices go to zero during the day, inwards towards the spot. Theta keeps increasing as you go deeper ITM, but will start decreasing as extrinsic value begins to comprise less and less of ITM options prices.\n\n(For that matter, simply understanding intrinsic and extrinsic value seems to elude many new options traders -- virtually every single question about early exercise of an option stems from not understanding this fundamental aspect of options pricing).\n\nSince options are traded in an open market, demand dynamics and bid/ask action will affect options prices (if everyone wants Aug-20 SPY 440 calls, the price for that option will naturally rise, and likewise, if everyone is selling them, it will fall). Another aspect of demand shows up in put/call price skew -- since market participants generally hold long positions, they want downside protection for their longs and therefore puts generally cost more than calls -- there's more demand for them.\n\nAnd then you have other time-dependent \"greeks\" such as charm and vanna -- charm is a measure of how an option's delta decays with the passage of time, and vanna is the change in vega with a 1% change in the underlying's volatility.\n\nThese sorts of things are useful to know before entering a position; this sub sees way too many questions like \"I bought some calls before ER and the stock went up, but my options are down 50% -- why?\" If the trader understood the risk (in this case, IV crush) before entering the trade, they wouldn't have to ask this question, but more importantly, may have elected not to enter the trade in the first place.

Since mortgages, student loans, financial derivatives, and other financial products often rely on Libor as a reference rate, the manipulation of submissions used to calculate those rates can have significant negative effects on consumers and financial markets worldwide. \n\nHere is the court document, with the defendants.\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364555/gov.uscourts.cand.364555.1.0_2.pdf\n\n> INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE, INC., INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE HOLDINGS, INC., ICE BENCHMARK ADMINISTRATION LIMITED, ICE DATA SERVICES, INC., ICE PRICING AND REFERENCE DATA LLC, BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, BARCLAYS BANK, PLC, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, INC., CITIBANK, N.A., CITIGROUP, INC., CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS, INC., COÖPERATIEVE RABOBANK U.A., CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG, CREDIT SUISSE AG, CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES INC., HSBC HOLDINGS PLC, HSBC BANK PLC, HSBC BANK USA, N.A., HSBC SECURITIES (USA) INC., JPMORGAN CHASE & CO., JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., J.P.

Declaring, finding, adjudging, and decreeing that the unlawful conduct alleged  \nherein be adjudged and decreed to be an unlawful restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the \nSherman Act and Section 16 of the Clayton Act; \n\n> B. Declaring, finding, adjudging, and decreeing that the unlawful conduct alleged  \nherein be adjudged and decreed to be an unlawful restraint of trade in violation of Section 2 of the \nSherman Act and Section 16 of the Clayton Act; \n\n> C. That  Defendants,  their  subsidiaries,  affiliates,  successors,  transferees,  assignees \nand the respective officers, directors, partners, agents, and employees and all other persons acting \nor  claiming  to  act  on  their  behalf,  be  prohibited  from  continuing  and maintaining  the  conspiracy \nalleged in the Complaint; \n\n> **D. Declaring,  finding,  adjudging,  and  decreeing  that  any  agreement  that  includes \nUSD LIBOR as a component of the variable interest rate charged is illegal and void under the \nantitrust laws of the United States;**  \n\n> E. Prohibit the Defendants from enforcing any agreement for USD LIBOR-based \nvariable interest rate consumer loans or credit cards, in whole or in part;  \n\n> F. Prohibit the Defendants from combining and conspiring to agree upon another \nso-called benchmark rate to replace LIBOR\n\n> G. Awarding to Plaintiffs treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Antitrust \nAct, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26. \n\n> H. Awarding to Plaintiffs costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee as \nprovided by Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26. \n\n> I. Granting to Plaintiffs such other and further relief to which they may be \nentitled and which the Court finds to be just and appropriate.\n\nWhat does all that mean? Well, of particular interest to me is D - I /THINK/ that means that if the injunction is granted, all loan agreements that use USD LIBOR as a component will become null and void. I have no idea what that means overall - if any legal wrinkle brains could verify, I would appreciate it.\n\nBack in June the judge denied a motion by the defendants to move the case to New York - which I interpret as refusal to move to a court more friendly to the defendants, but could be wrong. \n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364555/gov.uscourts.cand.364555.263.0.pdf\n\n>Defendants have moved to transfer this action to the Southern District of New York.  Dkt. \nNo. 34.  The request is denied.  Defendants’ request for administrative relief in connection with \nplaintiffs’ most recent injunction application is granted in part.  Dkt. No. 261.\n\nDoes this actually have a chance of happening? The Federal Reserve seems to think so. \n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364555/gov.uscourts.cand.364555.282.0.pdf\n\n> The Board of Governors and New York Fed seek leave to file this amicus brief to provide \ntheir perspective to the Court that the injunction Plaintiffs seek—including immediately \nenjoining the publication of the U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmark reference rate (“LIBOR”) and \nvoiding variable interest rate contracts for consumer loans which include LIBOR as a reference \nrate2—if granted, would pose a risk to financial stability and will likely harm numerous \nnonparties, including everyday consumers and businesses.  The requested injunction would also \nundermine years of global planning by the Board of Governors, New York Fed, and other \nfinancial sector regulators in the U.S. and abroad, and threaten key progress currently underway \non an orderly transition away from LIBOR.\n\nCourt case is scheduled for September 9th.\n\nhttps://apps.cand.uscourts.gov/CEO/cfd.aspx?7148\n\nSeptember 9th\n> 3:20-cv-05832-JD - McCarthy et al v.

Object detection for things like stop signs, pedestrians, traffic lights and all other objects relevant to full self-driving\n4. Predicting object position if object is partially or fully obstructed\n\nThe chip is for training the machine learning models. Machine learning models, specifically the ones shown today like regnets and transformers require training.  \n\n\nA model consists of large numbers of parameters, many millions or billions. In the case of deep learning, these parameters are simply numbers that are multiplied by the input (or the output from a previous layer in the network), which in this case is the pixel values of the images. There exists a configuration of these parameters such that the error of the model is minimised. When I say error, I mean the model's ability to predict a line on the road accurately, or detecting a car or pedestrian accurately, it depends on the purpose of the model.   \n\n\nIn order to reach confiurations that yeild good accuracy, you need to train the models. The training requires large amounts of data. The way it works is you have a large amount of data which is labelled. Labelled data is an input which also contains the target class. For example, an image of car, as well as flag which says \"car\".   \n\n\nThis data is fed into the model and through a training algorithm, predictions that result in \"car\" when the label really is car, will update the parameters such that that prediction is strengthened. Conversely, if the prediction is not car when the label is car, the parameters will be updated in such a way that penalises this outcome.  This is repeated iteratively until the total error is minimised.   \n\n\nYou can represent these parameters and the input through vectors and matricies, which is why dojo has been optimised for matrix multiplication.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Awesome explanation.

It will never work at scale.\n2. Mobileye and Comma.ai - Probably limited by data and/or talent. You need very large amounts of data to solve full self-driving. It is a requirement. Tesla has the ability to query the fleet for examples of disengagements and then train the model again once they've got the data which will hopefully solve the issue that caused the disengagement.

The diagonal turd color line represents the three lowest points in the last 3M for spy. The other thin greenish line above that represents the 50-day moving average, notice how they almost coincide together. Every time SPY hits the 50 day EMA it hits the low of the month. ](https://preview.redd.it/432c3555v7i71.png?width=1366&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2db6d0660dd0fa6ff4eefea22cdc6faee05e9b4c)\n\nAre you tired of losing money on weekly options because you cant read a chart? Yeah, I know you are.\n\nHere's one simple trick: learn to read a chart. Yes, these crayons seem to just be lines over a chart and spy only go up haha brrr. That is not the case. Indicators tell a story on when money will move in nd out of a security. SPY is a great chart for TA, because it works. SPY breaks ATH's every other day but yet you're constantly -80% on your 3DTE 450C.\n\nAs you know spy got absolutely hammered today, but if you go back the last 3 months SPY has drilled to earths core. On the 18th. Every single time. For the last 3 months. Last month in July the market was not open the 18th, so we drilled on the 19th. You get the point though. \n\nMay 18th: SPY Open: 415.80, Close 411.94\n\nJune 18th: SPY gapped down from 421.97 (6/17 Close), Open:  417.09, Close: 414.92\n\nJuly 19th: Open: 426.19, Close: 424.97\n\nAugust 18th: Open: 442.96, Close: 439.21 \n\n\"So, what you're saying is every 18th MM's, Algo's, JPOW, Bears, or the Taliban seem to push it down?!\" No. Retard. It seems every 18th (or next trading day if 18th is a weekend) SPY tests its 50-day MA. (moving average). \n\nI wont get technical, but basically the 50MA is the closing price of the last 50 days added up divided by 50. \n\nToday was the 18th, yet we did not test the 50 day moving average. So, of course that means it will get tested tomorrow, today was rough enough. Buckle up for tomorrow. Do not rush to buy 2DTE 443 calls tomorrow at open. \n\nThe currents 50-day MA seems to be hovering around 433-434. (50-day Simple MA= 433.37) (50-day Exponential MA= 433.91)\n\nSo it is possible we will see SPY drop to 433-435 before rebounding to ATH and printing calls as usual. This would be a great time to get into calls. but make sure it bounces off of this moving average first before getting into calls. If it manages to drill right past that 433-434 area, it is possible we could see SPY trading around 425. If you have calls and would like to save yourself from your  ~~asshole~~ Portfolio being gaped, I suggest you wait for this level to be tested. I'm getting rid of my calls at open, buying puts to make back the gains from my calls that will gap down tomorrow, sell at the bounce, and purchase more calls. \n\nMy positions: 4x 08/23 444c, 2x 08/23 444c, x2 08/27 445c, 1x 08/27 BABA 167.5p (not related, but BABA puts have been free money since July). Edit: I sold 446/447 calls against my calls so I had downside protection.\n\nWill be getting rid of my calls, day trading puts down to that level, then switch to calls once I see the rebound: or alternatively we break the 433 level and drill to the 420's and I ride the puts down.  \n\nTomorrow at close you will come back and thank me from saving your portfolio, from none other than yourself. When you see that I am not a retard, you will enjoy my next post on why PFE will put me in a Ferrari next month.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Stop being a retard and learn to read a chart. don't buy calls tomorrow until SPY tests the 50-day Moving Average at 433.37-433.91, then get into calls. If SPY manages to break 433, load the boat with puts and hold on to your tapered shorts, shit will get messy tomorrow and you will be forced to ask your boss for an advance on your paycheck.", "id": "p75p5h", "created_utc": 1629339211.0, "score": 366, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 224, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1089|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "haha spy go brr\n\nalso bers r fuk", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Long $COCK short $HOLE", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "HSI declining.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Age like milk so hard it's become cheese", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Wow looking at this chart its super obvious that spy will either be going up or down very soon", "score": 307, "replies": [{"body": "I've been told it may even go sideways!", "score": 29, "replies": []}, {"body": "Confirmed", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Found a non-50A tester from 1/27-1/29.
