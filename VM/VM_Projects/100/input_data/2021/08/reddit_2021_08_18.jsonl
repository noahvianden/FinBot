Well, if one were to try and build a model to value Tesla on a per share basis five years from now, it would be important to use the diluted share count.  Most warrants, notes, and options expire in 10 years or less, and a majority would likely be exercised.  E.g., 15% of Tesla's outstanding options and warrants at the end of 2020 have already been exercised and added to their basic share count in 6 months.  Diluted share count is especially important if the analysis says the price is projected to go significantly higher, as none of those instruments would be settled in cash.\n\nSay a multi-billion dollar, growth focused investment firm released such a valuation model that failed to consider the diluted share count.

With shares so valuable now, future stock awards will likely be smaller, and the rate the share count grows will reduce drastically. \n\nI'll also note Tesla was unusual in their stock based compensation.  Most companies set their option strike prices very low.  Tesla gave out huge awards at a -once- high strike price.  Musk's 2018 compensation package, for instance, has a $70 strike.   \n I'm sure that looked expensive when the shares traded at $40 in mid 2019.  Not so much today.
