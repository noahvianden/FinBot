But that trend has been disproved as a talking point for years now. Xbox isn't even the most competitive console on the market and the cross platform principle of the Game Pass just gives more value to PC since they too get the exclusives... for the other games, PC can't be beaten in term of game pricing and sales.\n\nTo come back to the remote gaming, you again seem to start from the assumption that cloud gaming will cannibalize PC growth which is a rather pessimistic assumption and it fails to understand the reason why people build pcs.\nAgain, remote gaming will likely only increase the size of the PC player base by opening the ecosystem to new gamers with less means which only translate in higher PC peripherals sales.\n\nSome games (massive and competitive) are nowhere near a transition to console as keyboards are essential. LoL, WoW, Minecraft, Roblox, Valorant, CSGO, the list goes on.\n\nFor remote gaming unless we see a perfect storm of both server power at way lower cost AND a drastic increase in the connection speed and reliability all over the world at ever lower costs, cloud gaming will not overtake anything.

Every provider wants to be on Marketplace given the aforementioned massive market share that AWS has, more market share, more customers, more buying opportunity. Amazon is now brokering a lot of these purchases to run natively in AWS and customers WANT to purchase through them because it ties into their commitment. Amazon is now pocketing that margin (not saying 40% but they’re making money on these technologies that they previously did not sell or distribute.). This ties customers even deeper into their infrastructure, opens up additional revenue streams with minimal overhead, and from what I’ve observed they’re getting resale capabilities on emerging SaaS offerings well before traditional resellers.

Bank reserves are held as cash in the bank or as balances in the bank's account at a central bank. The country's central bank determines the minimum amount that banks must hold in liquid assets, called the \"reserve requirement\" or \"reserve ratio\".

Everybody thought the government was paying attention to the speculation going on with the subprime mortgage stuff - or so I’d thought as I was hearing about it and the news was saying all was well. I think it’s because there was some belief that greed wouldn’t override a persons willingness to screw over the global economy (that’s the nature of an unfettered free market per Adam Smith at least). It turns out that we had to invent “too big to fail” to justify the scam that the US government allowed the hyper wealthy investment class to get a pass to preserve the current state of things. I still think it was a blindside and I hope the federal government has more tools today than 2008. I hope. \n\nFlash forward to now, I think there is a perception (I am included in this) that the US government is working behind the scenes to prevent another collapse and hopefully just create a controlled dismantling of whatever the problem is. \n\nFor instance when you read all these DD’s, investors are, in my opinion, thinking this risk is symmetrical (like the short positions on GME) and there will be a great “reckoning” as the balance must be maintained.  They are all apparently bullish on the idea that this invisible force is monitoring and maintaining the symmetry - like myself, but we were all fooled in 2008 as the world saw.\n\nThe problem is we can’t predict the future and don’t know what and if there is a black swan event in the making or if there is a grey swan that we’ve misjudged its probability.\n\nThis said - my stance is the same as always. Keep a pool of money to cover your expenses liquid (mortgage, rent, whatever debt you have), have some camping gear and supplies for extremely short term things like power outages or even scary conflict stuff (not like you’d leave your house - I’d not), don’t sell low (so avoid selling stock if it collapses), and try to keep your a job. Add in extra medical supplies if you need it, keep your car topped off of gas, and be ready to stay positive as people are throwing themselves off buildings because they had too much risk in their portfolio.\n\nGoing through this stuff, just like corona, if you are safe and well planned, can be an opportunity to reassess what’s enough and come out better than you entered it.\n\nEmbrace the chaos with a plan and watch the world around you act like you expect, idiots and more idiots.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It was awful.  the market just slid day to day, endlessly.

Over $5-$7 a gallon (Cali) so a lot of people wanted electric cars and that industry took off from pipe dream. Oil industry was booming. Commodities in general did well. Gold got to 2k an ounce. It doesn’t sound like a lot now because we have more or less stayed in touch with that but it was a big jump. (Learn: once things go up, they kind of don’t come back down in any real sense. Maybe by 30%. But not all the way back down.) People were going into abandoned homes and taking all the copper plumbing and wires to resell. They even started taking the huge aluminum poles holding up highway lights. (They’re doing the same thing now with catalytic converters. Should tell you something). They even stole a metal sculpture we had in a park up the street. \n\nSuicides for 50 year olds skyrocketed. Age discrimination is real. Super real during a recession. \n\nFacebook got super popular then. You’d see people posting about offers of “gleaning” fields and pictures of thousands going out. Don’t know if it was true or not. Occupy Wall Street took off because of FB. It was way smaller than blm though. The social media companies got better at manipulating people since then. There was also a “move your money” movement-pull it from big banks to credit unions. It wasn’t successful. Banking is sticky apparently. Even if you have a shitty bank. Obama upped the capital reserve to lending ratios back then, but they have since been cut way back again. Lots of “friends” on FB gaming the system back then too thought they were being smart (like they are with rent moratoriums now) playing cash for keys, etc. thinking they would let their house go back when they didn’t need to and they’d come out ahead. The only people that come out ahead in these scenarios are the people on the winning side of asset distribution. \n\nForeclosures yes…but oddly after a pretty short while you couldn’t buy them. Obama, the banks and hedge funds made a deal for them to be bought en masse. Banks just wouldn’t talk about short offers anymore, so not a lot of people benefited from these affordable assets except Blackstone (Blackrock? Can’t keep those fuckers straight) People in new build areas suffered with builders going bankrupt and leaving developments mostly not completed. Even with a 800 credit score and 20% down it could be hard to buy. \n\nThe election gave people hope, but Obama didn’t have the justice department prosecute a single fucking crooked soul except for the Wamu guys. Within a year Wall Street was making huge bonuses again. \n\nCredit lines were cut. Thought you had a 20k credit limit and we’re paying your bills? Didn’t matter. Banks suddenly cut your limit to your balance (just like Wells Fargo just did). Worsened your credit score, inhibiting your ability to leverage into a cheap home. \n\nThings recovered. Mostly people forget. Some smarter people have lived all these years since like you can’t trust anyone still and be ready to cover your ass. The FIRE movement was born-with emphasis on FI part of it. Prepping got real and more mainstream. \n\nI can’t remember any more anecdotes but there were a lot on WSB with GME when it began. People recounting what their parents went through, so it had a generational effect. I was young, but not as young as you I guess I remember these things. I also talked to my great grandma about the depression a lot when I was little. I was intrigued for whatever reason. She was young but had stories. Rye whiskey was drunk more than water after the WWI. (Michael Pollen?) The army had an excess of alcohol fuel after the war they pushed on the population.

Tesla has more cars out there, so they get more data than competitors do\n  * In a sense Dojo is about being able to capitalize on this, as it seems they have more data streaming in than they can fully consume with a reasonable rate of iteration.\n1. Tesla has been building electric cars for longer than the competitors, and seem hell-bent on continual improvement to capitalize on this\n\nThese two things have a certain synergy, which will only get stronger. If, and that's still an if, self driving cars are actually possible on a reasonable timescale and the general public actually embraces them.\n\nAs for \"secret sauce\" and having a better approach (in an architectural sense): In most engineering there are usually several paths to a goal, and many of them will get you there in roughly the same amount of times/resources, at least if the goal is somewhat complex. What really matters is not just your approach, but also your execution. Great ideas are actually a dime a dozen, but capitalizing on them is hard. \n\nAnd being a first mover is super important, if combined with continued improvement. But being first mover isn't everything. It's an opportunity, and opportunities can be squandered.\n\nGoogle is a great example.

But they executed well and pushed forward at a time when the competition acted like this was over and done with, and so... the competition got crushed. Google was at least as good as the others, and did. not. stop. and found ways to build virtuous circles. Google's success feeds Google's future success. Googles size feeds Google's growth.\n\nAzure is another example. It sure looked like AWS and Google would own that market, but Microsoft entered and just did. not. stop. and found ways to build virtuous circles, some of which are not available to the competition (Amazon does not have an office/productivity suite, and Google's stuff is a privacy nightmare and can't or shouldn't be used by companies and governments and schools).

Hence, your downside is capped compared to shares.\n\nHowever if AAPL hit 200 bucks/share (up $50/share), your shares would be up $5k in capital gains, which means you had 33% return on your 15k capital (ROIC). \n\nYour leaps on the other hand, would be up $4.5k (90% delta movement). This means you gained $4.5k  on a capital outlay of $7.5 k which is a massive 60% return on invested capital. \n\nIn other words, the leap has actually protected your downside, while massively levering your upside.

The decision to suspend the IPO came after Shanghai exchange officials said the exchange would halt the listing due to the company's inability to fulfill conditions amid changes in the regulatory environment.\n\nBABA stock crashed another 8% on Nov. 10 after Chinese regulators announced new draft antimonopoly rules for China online platforms like Alibaba and **JD.com** (JD), among others.\n\n**Alibaba Stock Fundamental Analysis**\n\nIt's hard to find a company with a more impressive track record of growth than Alibaba. The company has a five-year annualized earnings growth rate of 29%.\n\nExpectations were high for Alibaba's Singles Day annual shopping event in November, China's biggest shopping day. The company didn't disappoint as sales nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $74 billion.\n\nThe company has been able to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.\n\nAlibaba's business in China looks a lot like Amazon's in the U.S. Alibaba’s cloud-computing business is showing solid growth, just like Amazon's booming web services business.\n\nFor its current fiscal year 2022, Alibaba is expected to earn $9.58 a share, down 4% compared to 2021. But growth is expected to ramp higher in 2023, up 23% to $11.79.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nAlibaba keeps having an astonishing growth while the price declined from the previous high. Regulation will weigh on future performance but long-term growth will remain and the current price looks like a bargain.", "id": "p8zj11", "created_utc": 1629580759.0, "score": 362, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 384, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p886gh/nio_a_cheap_alternative_to_tsla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p88irt/nio_a_cheap_alternative_to_tsla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p88lri/nio_a_cheap_alternative_to_tsla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p88tou/nio_a_cheap_alternative_to_tsla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p8zj11/alibaba_baba_free_money/) \n**Account Age**|8 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/Beautiful-Ad-8447, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I just posted a Yolo on BABA about my position", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The question isn’t whether BABA is undervalued or not.

I notice already you know a lot about the situation. Alibaba has a P/E of 19 and growth rate of 45% annually with pretty much the deepest moat of any company I know. Yeah thats not a value play at all. It will probably keep growing but the stock will just stay low and the P/E will get to 1. Sure you already get 5% per year back in buybacks every year at current prices but that will just keep going up and still noone will want it. \n\nAnd ah yes the regulatory risk. I mean heck they did something that would have been illegal in the US and EU  and got a $2B fine, less than 1/5th the max amount for their crime and now they even got taxes decreased by only 0.5% when they otherwise would have decreased by 1.5% but they lost a couple deductions and lost tax benefits on 1% of their profits. This totally changes the investment thesis. If they dont get that extra 1% in subsidies and if they got fined for $2B and only have $75B left in cash and only make $23B per year (more than Amazon) then clearly they are a very bad investment. \n\nBut oh what if the CCP starts targeting them even though they specifically want to develop their industries and both domestic and international e-commerce are on a government issued list of encouraged industries for foreigners to invest in (guess if DiDi and the tutoring industry were on the encouraged or discouraged list? Did you even know those exist and are update annually?) Along with cloud computing where they dominate the market in China. Let's imagine they are targeted so hard revenues immediately plummet 15% and their growth rate HALVES to only 22% in the coming 5 years. Then they would ONLY 2.3x their profit in the coming 5 years (btw I took the growth rate just for the Core commerce business, cloud computing is growing at 60% per year and international sales at 100%, I also didn't account for their abnormally low current profit rate due to reinvestments being particularily heavy and their fastest growing segments having higher margins meaning they will expand their margins in the future.). Clearly paying a P/E of 19 for something with a bad case scenario they only 2.3x their profits is the ultimate risk taking and best way to lose your money.\n\nAnd all the above is why Charlie Munger, Buffets lifetime partner at Berkshire Hathaway who has to approve any purchase Buffet wants to make, that he calls his mentor and smarter than him, and who actually got a better lifetime annualized return on investment than Buffet has 20% Alibaba in his portfolio.

Lets dig into that P/E. On a gross profit of 48 billion, they spent 9 billion on R&D.  On a gross profit of 180 billion, amazon spent 48. These numbers are subtracted from earnings, but are an asset to the company. However, they are not required expense, and could be stopped if they want to make earnings look better. If both companies quit their R&D entirely and just counted that as earnings, their P/E would be roughly the same. As it would with google. So Ig kudos for them for not actually trying to develop new tech, I'm sure thats great for growth. Amazons gross profit is 180 billion,  Baba's is 48 billion. BABA does not make more than Amazon LOLOL that there is just a strait lie.\n4. As for regulation, you are just ignoring something you don't want to see. Jack Ma was disappeared. I heard this exact same china regulation retardation about DIDI, and EDU, and TAL, and LUCKIN. China ENDED and entire for profit industry over night. That doesn't happen in the U.S. Keep pretending that the 1 billion dollar fine is the issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sure there is some value for the stock, and it can't keep falling forever, but its not as great as you are pretending.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit - Forgot to add, JD and Pinduoduo are both threatening that baba moat in e commerce, tencent is competing with ali pay, and tencent and baidu are for their cloud, and if they get too dominant the CCP will just start to fuck with them", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "This entire response is idiotic. \n\nI never said Munger had 20% of his net worth in it.

These people arent day trading retards, they are long term investors. As am I, if it goes down to 1$ per share that is awesome. Not only can I average down they can do more buybacks, they are spending $15B on that just in the coming year so the more it drops more as a % of total stock can they buy back. Alibaba the actual company the stock represents is doing great and has grown almost 20% just since Charlie bought it. If you think the stock price falling is bad for investors all I can say is go invest in index funds lol \n\nGross profit doesn't matter lol, I was talking about net profit and Alibaba has a higher net profit than Amazon. Walmart has a gross profit of 24%, and a net profit of 2%. So I suppose you think they are extremely undervalued since their gross profit P/E is 3.55? And yeah Amazon totally doesn't need their R&D to keep growing or try to catch up to Alibaba in logistics efficiency. They are just wasting their money for fun, what an idiot that Bezoz guy is, give him a call too if you have time after the calls with the so-called \"superinvestors\" I mentioned earlier. And yeah you found out on Alibaba having such a low R&D, there is probably no reasons behind that.... say Alibaba being purely a platform and not actually having a logistics network to build out and being a pure software company with a much higher profit margin than Amazon. They are just getting the 45% annual growth out of pure luck. If only they spent their $75B in cash on researching how to make their website look better that would probably have great return on capital. You seem well suited to be CFO, maybe Amazon can hire you after you teach Bezoz how to run it properly. \n\nJack Ma isn't involved in Alibaba whatsoever lol. It seems you just ignored everything I wrote about you being wrong on the regulation stuff so let me be even clearer. They didn't just make the education sector non-profit out of the blue, it has been a political goal for the CCP for years, it's literally listed as a prioritized policy in the CCP handbook since over 2 years ago, Xi has been talking about making them non-profit for much longer than that and THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY IS ON THE GOVERNMENTS OFFICIAL LIST OF DISCOURAGED INDUSTRIES FOR FOREIGNERS TO INVEST IN. I am sorry you lost your Mom's pension savings on a $TAL YOLO but that's you being stupid going against the CCP and having done 0 research not China being uninvestible lol. In DiDi it was even more obvious, you didn't even be able to read a list to find out they were a bad investment, the CCP literally warned people not to invest in them 1 day after the IPO. If you could read you also didn't need to find a government list, DiDi mentioned they were warned by regulators and could be subjected to a data security investigation in their prospectus released before the IPO. The management was literally told by the CCP to delay the IPO and just ignored it and decided to screw investors and now they are being retaliated against and they passed a new law making it so you need approval to IPO via the VIE structure so it won't happen again, purely to protect foreign investors from being retarded like with DiDi.

Amazon needs more R&D to grow because their revenue is already many times higher and their market isn't growing as fast and they need to buy thousands of trucks, airplanes and storage warehouses for each new country they go to, the streamlining of that process and error management is what they spend over 90% of their R&D money on, Alibaba doesn't have any of that, they are just the platform and hire delivery companies to do all that for them and then use CAINIAO networks to log the data of all the transports and streamline it. Alibabas logistics hubs are already 2x as efficient as Amazons on average thanks to that data. They have $75B but spending that much on improving their website isn't going to give them good returns on the investment so it's better they don't. They will still get stellar growth. \n\nEbay used to be in China, Amazon is in China and has no special rules against them by the CCP. Alibaba can compete just fine, which is why they are winning market share in Europe, Asia and Africa against Amazon and are slated to dominate global e-commerce, their segment for it grew by 100% last year alone and already stands in the 100s of billions annually. \n\nThey arent a knockoff they got started before Amazon was even an e-commerce platform lol. And they don't sell their own products unlike Amazon, like I have told you many times by now they are a software company, not a retailer. \n\nI do think Amazon should spend what they do on R&D because they aren't a software company like Alibaba and have products and logistics which are very capital intensive. I think Amazon will do great in the US and EU over the coming 20 years. But they need to spend that R&D to keep growing, they can't just stop spending it and expect the same P/E of a growing company like you imply when you count their R&D to their profits instead of as an expenditure in order to secure future growth and profits. \n\nAnd Jack Ma isn't involved at all, he is literally kept hostage by the CCP and got kicked out of the company and their board of directors as a result of his comments lol.

Through applying existing technologies and gaining trust in the Chinese e-commerce market, as well as expanding through dominating the market at a loss before making a return on additional services, Alibaba's subsidiaries outperformed eBay in the Chinese e-commerce market, claiming a growing percentage of consumers from eBay. Alibaba subsidiary Taobao would later force eBay out of the Chinese market, with eBay closing its unprofitable China Web unit, though the two companies would break even six years later.[26][28][29]\"\n\nEven if they were kicked out later (havent seen it before and didn't see it on Wikipedia but might be true) Alibaba kicked their a** without it before they were kicked out.\n\nAlibaba was founded in 1997 not 1999, and it was based on an earlier government program that all the 18 cofounders worked on together, not based on Amazon.

But instead seek to buy, merge or takeover others smaller companies***  (See the discussion on this topic by Sosnoff and Ratigan, in the second half of their latest podcast [https://youtu.be/eTfFEq8hOMg](https://youtu.be/eTfFEq8hOMg). For those of you who don't know who they are, stop reading right now, and please look for them, and then come back)\n\n\n**That is why I consider it inevitable that acquisitions of smaller companies will increase,** *and im supported by data* *(M&A typical accelerates toward Q3 and Q4: See Price Waterhouse Coopers report* on that [*https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/deals/trends.html*](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/deals/trends.html)*),* **as way to manage balance sheets overloaded with cash,** *in order to maintain growth in an inflationary environment and prevent devaluation of retained earnings.*\n\nAs a consequence of this **The plan is to find a good probable acquisition target soon enough and ride the momentum up using in the money calls with 45 or more days to go.**\n\n\n**IN SEARCH FOR THE TRADING VEHICLE:**\n\nWithin this universe of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) we must be clear that the first companies to be subject to acquisitions will be those that can have **high growth, low debt, and generate profits**.

They uncover leading-edge stories, risks, and opportunities associated with M&A and more.\n\nIn takeovers scenarios, **the trade is to buy the target** and sell the one doing the takeover.
