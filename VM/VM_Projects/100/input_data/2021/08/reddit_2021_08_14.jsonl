{"title": "2nd Post on \"Selling Options: Could it be this easy\"", "selftext": "The original post was gettin too long. There have been a few other long threads on selling PUTS far out for \"free money\".\n\nSo starting this one with my take and invite others to provide your perspective.\n\nFIRST, I agree with majority of responses - It IS picking pennies in front of a steamroller. It is easy money for a few weeks and then BAM. Wipe out!\n\nHere is what seems to work for me (started over 10 years, current system working ok for last 5 years with 8% to 18% annual return - yes those pennies!)\n\nMy situation: I have 30% stocks; 10% bonds/commodities and 60% cash. Feel market has moved up too far and hence not so much in stocks. So I have plenty of cash and ready to buy.\n\nI monitor Quality/Dividend paying companies. Well known names. Also look for earnings dates. Here is a link for upcoming week [https://i.redd.it/pjyvtisbz8h71.png](https://i.redd.it/pjyvtisbz8h71.png)\n\nI pick one, Walmart (WMT $149.53) - it is reporting on 17 Aug. On 16 Aug I can sell Aug $144 Put for around 68 cents. That is commitment to buy WMT at $144 on 20 Aug if it gets to $144 or below. In return I get $68. And tie up $14,400 cash for a week. On Tuesday morning, pretty much we'll know if WMT is headed below $144 or not. Either I have to buy WMT at $144 even if it tanks to $135 or the 68 cent premium reduces to 3-5 cents. Honestly, for me either option is fine. WMT is fine company. I have Cash. WMT pays dividends. If I buy $144 - I will start selling weekly CALLS. If I don't get to buy WMT - I keep the \\~$60 by tying up $14,400 for a couple of days (close the PUT on Wednesday or Thursday).\n\nThere are 75 high quality, dividend paying companies - just like Walmart that are safe buys at a discount. I have this list and would add in a subsequent response. That is pretty much all you need for a full year of trading for generally 10-15% safe returns. Using 30-40% of your cash/portfolio for this type of return is viable, with contained risk. NEVER GO MARGIN!!!\n\nFinally, I will also give a recent example where the steamroller did hit me while picking pennies!!!\n\nClorox (CLX):\n\n2 Aug: Sold 1 CLX 6-Aug $172.5 put for 90 cents. Got $90.\n\nEarnings were announced. BAM. CLX tanked to $161. I sold another 6-Aug $157.5 Put for $1.70 and got $170 for that commitment. On Friday 6-Aug, CLX closed above $157.5 but below $172.5. So I was forced to but 100 CLX shares for $172.5 ($17,250).\n\nWeek of 9-Aug: I sold 13-Aug $170 Call for 10 cents and sold 13-Aug $162.5 Put for $1.0. Both expired yesterday and I got to keep the premium.\n\nToday 14-Aug: CLX has climbed back up to $168.45. My cost basis for the $172.5 purchase is now down to $168.8. And because I like CLX - I sold 20-Aug $170 call for $1.51. You can figure out the outcomes on 20-Aug. Whatever CLX price - I am either reducing cost basis or making a decent 3 week profit. And I don't mind holding CLX (2.78% dividend) that has 52-week range of $159.32 to $231.11\n\nSUMMARY: (1) Picking pennies in front of steam roller is not for everyone, but 10-15% annual returns can be safely had from a portion of portfolio. Stick to Quality, Dividend names, perhaps with weekly options. Play around earnings call for a bit more excitement. NEVER GO MARGIN. For retail traders, the only strength we got is TIME. Hedge funds don't have luxury of time, they have to show performance quarterly, if not monthly. Margin sucks time out of retailers defense. GOOD LUCK !!!\n\n================  SUMMARY OF RESPONSES  ===================\n\nThanks to all who provided great feedback and different perspectives. This board is great (especially when compared to lot of other MBs out there). Key takeaways:\n\n1. What I described is commonly called Option Wheeling. I've been using this for a while and did not know it had a name! Simple explanation here [https://www.thewheelstrategy.com](https://www.thewheelstrategy.com) \n2. It's been a raging bull market for at least past 5 years (minus the brief 2020 covid dip). A lot of trading strategies will look like work of genius. Option Wheeling no different. Just holding Quality/Divy stocks and perhaps selling Covered Calls - would likely yield better results. In a retreating market - this method won't perform well.\n3. Trading with Indexes (or eMini) are paths that can reduce effort (& worry) vs individual stocks. \n4. Option Wheeling is most suitable for stocks that a trader was intending to buy anyway (perhaps already holds a position and looking to add at lower price point).", "id": "p4er10", "created_utc": 1628970403.0, "score": 153, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 136, "comments": [{"body": "I don't disagree that playing the wheel on high quality companies that pay dividends and are actually established is a reasonable method. 10-15% annual return can be possible for sure. The only thing I want to ask you is what about just holding vanguard or spy all year reinvesting dividends and selling far otm CC calls on whichever you're holding.  You're basically going to hit 10-15% and it requires almost no effort by comparison and honestly is probably less risky. \n\nNot shit talking theta plays or the wheel it's just if you're not getting more alpha and it requires so much constant effort and monitoring so to me if I'm not able to get to 20-30% returns I have a hard time seeing why more passive strategies aren't objectively better and just as safe.

However, remember, if the underlying increases the option trade is more profitable as well. You can always close the option and capture profits early as well.\n\n>Margin or collateral/cash secured?\n\nIf you can handle your leverage-why not? \n\nOtherwise stick with cc and csp-there isn't enough return for the risk on naked options imo.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for sharing your thought", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Spy has averaged 13% returns for the last 3 years and around 7% in the last 20 years.

I've done them before but I would usually find I was better off just holding a few good stocks and looking around for entry points.
