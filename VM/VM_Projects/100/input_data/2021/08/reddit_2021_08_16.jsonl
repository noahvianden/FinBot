The market can price strikes differently, which we call IV. While there is no guarantee that an ITM spread will be max loss before expiration, there's also no reason why it can't be. The point is more that the value will be in some range, not just max loss and nothing else.\n\n> Is your point about more risks at expiration for a credit spread only if the position was open through expiration?\n\nNot exactly. More that it remains open long enough for the short leg to be assigned. That usually happens on expiration day, but could happen sooner.\n\n> Can you elaborate on this scenario being greater than Max Loss?\n\nSure. Say you open a 45 DTE put credit spread at $113/$110, so $3 wide, when the stock was at $120. You get a net credit of $1, but let's break that down a bit more. The long leg costs you $2 and the short leg credits you $3, for net of $1.  With me so far?\n\nAt 30 DTE the stock tanks to $100. What is the value of the spread? Max loss says it should cost you $3 to close, so you net a $2 loss, right? But what if the long leg is worth $13.90 and the short leg is worth $10.10? The net value of the spread might be closer to $3.80 instead of $3, so your loss in that moment might be bigger than max loss. The market doesn't have to price the two legs exactly $3 apart, each can have a price that makes the difference larger or smaller than the strike width, due to variations in extrinsic value/market pricing.\n\nThat is why max loss and max profit only apply at expiration, because at expiration all extrinsic value goes to zero. The different legs can't have different prices than their strike vs. underlying price would indicate. In other words, only at expiration is the width of the spread *guaranteed* to be identical to the net value of the legs.\n\n> I assume this could only happen in a debit spread?\n\nCorrect.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "ROI on collar vs vertical spread\n\nNet credit collar - long underlying, sell ATM covered call, buy a cheaper OTM put for some downside protection and a net credit overall - does this have the same profile as a simple ATM bull credit spread?\n\nIf no why not?

Driver assist systems could in principle keep a vehicle centered in its lane and a safe distance from vehicles in front of it. However, GM chose not to install these systems in their cars to safe costs. This decision ultimately was responsible for countless injuries and deaths among drivers, passengers and innocent bystanders, according to data released by the agency.\n\nGM and other manufacturers warn that drivers without any assist systems must be ready to intervene at all times, even during experiencing a heart attack, a stroke, giving birth or while dead. GM's vehicles have crashed into semis crossing in front of them, stopped emergency vehicles, a roadway barrier, bicyclists, mothers with children, school buses, the list goes on. These crashes were a direct result of the missing driver assist and safety features, which could have prevented them. These technologies exist since decades, yet GM refuses to include these as standard safety features in all of its vehicles, ultimately causing untold harm to innocent Americans, horses, cats, dogs, squirrels and immigrants.\n\nA message was left early Monday seeking comment from GM, which has disbanded its department of common sense ages ago.\n\n“The investigation will assess the technologies and methods that could be used to monitor, assist and enforce the driver's engagement with the dynamic driving task during vehicle operation,” NHTSA said in its investigation documents. \"Not installing these systems is at best negligent homicide at a massive scale, or mass murder at worst.\"\n\nAn investigation could lead to a recall or other enforcement action by NHTSA. A criminal charges investigation against GM's upper management could be launched as a result. A conviction could be punishable with 42069 years in prison while watching their own companies advertisement without the option to switch it off.\n\nShares of GM, based in hell, rose 5% before the opening bell as shareholders realized that missing safety features has increased GMs profit per vehicle compared to competitors.\n\nThe NHTSA further noted that an equal investigation into other manufacturers like Ford, Toyota is being prepared as we speak.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Well put sir", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "thx, most people will not read because they think its the text from the article LOL", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I’m curious who bought the steak dinner for the schmuck editor at abc news. 😂", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "No idea what they are smoking but the constant repetition of what was essentially a 2 line news item put me over the edge of taking their article to a new level :)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": ">ultimately causing untold harm to innocent Americans, horses, cats, dogs, squirrels and immigrants.\n\nnice", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "In better news for this bad day, Elon Musk is getting close to 60 million followers in twitter, making him the 17 most follower account in the platform.

We had to bring tupperware to take the leftovers.  All the other kids always ate the food on the spot, I always took it home to let my mom eat first because of how happy she'd be to eat food that I cooked\n\nAfter high school, I'd already been investing in the stock market for a few years, and played many years of MMO's.  Every game I played I ended up being extremely rich in.  Sometimes server/market breaking levels of wealth because I monopolized everything.\n\nSo, I had to decide on business school or culinary school.  I ended up picking culinary school since I knew it'd eventually become a business.\n\nMy cooking career from 17-24: I did 5 years in culinary school (2 years of competition representing Hawaii). Did a bachelors (3 years of cooking) but dropped out on the 4th year which was business classes since I didn't feel I needed them.  Worked at many of the high end restaurants in Hawaii for close to minimum wage, saving and investing what little I made (I lived at home). Also staged (work for free to learn) in 10+ of the restaurants I didn't work at.  I've been in and seen how atleast 20 restaurants operated. At I was working at one of the best restaurants in Hawaii.  My mom has a fish stall in chinatown and a business partner sam, they wanted to open a thai restaurant I ate sam's food and said don't do it you don't know what you're doing.  They did it anyways and failed miserably.  I quit my job and bought the restaurant from them.\n\n24-27: My first restaurant, having no management level experience.  I learned really fast and really hard about every aspect of the restaurant business.  The main goal was survival and to get better every day.  My second restaurant just opened 2 weeks ago.\n\nWhat do I like about being a chef:\n\nWhen I was younger, it was to feed people and to make them happy.\n\nNow, I do it to be able to take care of more good people.  Many years in restaurants I've seen that kitchen staff have one of the best work ethics with the lowest pay compared to other industries.  So many other restaurants pay like crap and overwork their employees.  I want to open more restaurants so I can take care of more employees.  All my staff are in the top 1% of salary for their job position.  Some aren't even on the chart when you google salary of a \\_\\_\\_\\_ in Hawaii.\n\nStacks of money is the byproduct of what I do, not the reason.

{"title": "Pubmatic Extended DD", "selftext": "Hey Retards, Autists, and Apes; I have spent the past week finding and researching the best play to make you as much money as possible while fucking over the shorts.\n\nPubmatic is an amazingly well run, undervalued company with the second highest short interest of any stock!\n\nI am so confident this will work that I have refused to sell any of my positions for at least 2 weeks! (besides positions that expire before then obviously)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Intro\n2. About the Company\n3. Short Sellers\n4. Options\n5. Technical Analysis\n6. Conclusion\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**About the company:**\n\nPubmatic (PUBM) is a digital advertising company primarily focused on ‘programmable advertising’. They are essentially the middle-man between sellers of ad space, advertisers, and consumers. Traditional digital advertising has generally been done by teams of people on either end buying and selling ad space which is super slow and costly.\n\nWhat makes programmable advertising different (particularly Pubmatic) is the speed and efficiency it gets by having ad spaces grouped together into ‘nodes’ of similar content and having an algorithm decide which node an individual ad should run on.\n\nThis approach makes it so much simpler for people to sell ad space and for advertisers to reach consumers. With the vast amounts of data these algorithms get each day, they are becoming more and more effective over time at matching ads to nodes. The process of grouping ad space to nodes gives smaller advertisers a way to reach people and small creators a way to sell ad space effectively.\n\nWhat generally happens is publishers will use multiple of these platforms to buy/sell ad space so they can reach as many people as possible. Because of this, there is room for multiple companies to succeed and little risk that PUBM will fail\n\nThis area is poised for MASSIVE growth in the future as the internet grows and more advertising becomes digital and programmable. Programmable advertising spending has been rapidly increasing and is now over $155B per year!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41oburgtxph71.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9abdec777e8d0820dc1925fefdbb4156c743e4f\n\nPUBM is also perfectly positioned for the whole individual creator and contractor movement as their platform gives creators a way to monetize their websites\n\nPubmatic’s approach has been yielding results with them garnering over 211 BILLION daily ad impressions and over 2 PETABYTES of data PER DAY! For context, that’s 2,000,000 gigabytes of data processed daily\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Financial Statements (based on Q2 data):**\n\n* $49.7M revenue (just in Q2)\n* 88% y/y revenue growth\n* $9.9M net income\n* Net income up %1419 y/y\n* Adjusted EBITDA of 18.6M\n* Ebitda up 278% y/y\n* Gross margin of 74%\n* 63 P/E\n* 0 debt\n\nThis is a company who is growing rapidly and, even at this rate of growth (88%), is profitable. Once most of the infrastructure is finished and algorithm processes are streamlined, this company will be even more profitable.\n\nPUBM has a 63 P/E, which for that rate of growth is outrageously low. A company growing at this rate should not be priced this low\n\nPUBM literally has ZERO debt and is taking market share away from competitors, while still trading at way lower multiples than most, if not all, of them\n\n[This was made before Q2 earnings, now it is even more grossly undervalued](https://preview.redd.it/pkv8tomvxph71.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbf912e6384a8deb769230ce05f5b85f0c91b4e1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to this, Wall Street has underestimated this company by only assuming they will make around 38 cents/share this year.\n\nPubmatic has literally done half of that in the second quarter alone and beat estimates by 100%! Q4 has historically been much better for them then Q2 anyways so they should  reach at least 85 cents/share or so for 2021.\n\nThis leaves the stock room for growth as they consistently beat estimates causing analysts to  raise price targets\n\nThe only reason I could see why the stock is this low is shorts over shorting and causing FUD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Data Centers:**\n\nPubmatic has a global network of 8 data centers allowing it to give better transfer speeds, gather higher amounts of data, and be more secure\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yoo3ijzxph71.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=179d9d32ed55f6eb5b2020d916633d19ca3abd5e\n\nWhile many of its competitors have data centers and/or offices in China, PUBM doesn’t. This means the Chinese tech crackdown will not affect Pubmatic in any way, while it may to their competitors\n\nAll of their data centers and most of their offices are in politically stable countries with a strong rule of law and a wide international reach\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Impacts of Covid:**\n\nCovid has transformed how both businesses and consumers produce and consume. It has forced all of us to change how we work and shop to be more online. By most estimates, covid transformed this space by over 5 YEARS\n\nPeople and businesses have found the internet to be much more convenient and productive in many situations. Online advertising will continue to grow as e-commerce and the internet in general grows too.\n\nPubmatic is benefiting heavily from this digital transformation in our economy\n\nIndependent work has also seen massive growth due to covid induced layoffs, unemployment checks, and improved technology. Pubmatic allows independent creators to monetize their work, so they will benefit from this movement too\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Management:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oon4s6o1yph71.png?width=1883&format=png&auto=webp&s=142360d38cae17d7e5ad861c0a0ac5fe552837c8\n\nThe management team is solid and is boosted by their board members. Ashish Gupta is the person who really sticks out to me as he was key to Amazon’s early-mid growth. From the interviews I have seen, Rajeev Goel seems smart and invested in the success of the company\n\nWith this kind of leadership, Pubmatic is positioned to secure more and more of this growing market\n\nPubmatic has a bright future ahead with some analysts predicting Y/Y growth above 35% up until 2025. They are in the right place at the right time\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Short Sellers:**\n\nDespite this company doing so well, short sellers have taken onto the stock and made it the second most shorted stock on the ENTIRE MARKET. The current short interest sits at around 37%, increasing M/M by 0.77% despite great Q2 earnings. Shorts haven't sold, they have doubled down!\n\nWhat makes this company especially primed for a short squeeze is the low liquidity due to the voting structure of shares\n\nThere are around 11M class A shares and 38M class B shares\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1422930/000162828020017283/pubmatic424b42020.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1422930/000162828020017283/pubmatic424b42020.htm)\n\nShares issued to investors pre-ipo are class B shares and get 10X the voting power of class A shares. The thing is that if an investor or institution sells their class B share and re-buys it, it instantly turns into a class A share which gives them way less power over the company\n\nThis voting structure incentivizes anyone holding a class B share to not sell, which leads to a lower liquidity in the stock. This causes buying and selling shares to have a higher impact on the stock's price, which means a bunch of retards buying in will send the price to the MOON!\n\nIf we take away the 77.5% of shares that are basically locked away, the short interest rises to around 177.5%! Realistically some of that 77.5% will still sell, but the point still holds.\n\nShorts are so fucked because of this, most insiders will NOT sell. That's why most of the shorts haven’t covered even when the stock dipped into the $20s, because they physically can’t without sending the stock to the MOOON!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Options:**\n\nSince options are a derivative of the underlying stock, they are generally forward looking.\n\nLooking at option markets is a great way to see market expectations on which way a stock will move. Market sentiment drives stocks, so a bullish options market goes a long way.\n\nEnough call options can also trigger a gamma squeeze. Market Makers are forced to purchase shares when calls they sold become closer to being ITM, which leads to a feedback loop further increasing the stock price\n\nPUBM has one of the most bullish options markets I have ever seen\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7shrnq3yph71.png?width=1235&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0e119fed5f43a18f3372d04639fa2df3ac5e66\n\nThe call/put ratio is about 3, which is insanely bullish\n\nIf the stock price manages to get close to 40$, MM’s will be forced to purchase up to 450,000 shares! On a low liquidity stock, that type of purchasing will send the stock to the MOON\n\nThe 35$ C options have high open interest and could end up pushing us up close enough to reach the 40$ option chain\n\nThis is before WSB has even gotten their grubby hands on it, I can imagine even more call options will be purchased\n\nWith the power of one options contract being worth 100 shares, I bet that WSB can manage to make this thing moon and force short sellers to cover\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nI am still new to TA’s so take what I say with a grain of salt\n\nThe three key indicators I normally look at are the RSI, MACD, and the Aroon indicator\n\nThe RSI (AKA Relative Strength Index) tracks current vs historical strength or weakness of a stock based on closing prices. It is generally used to track the momentum of a stock. It also helps us know if a stock is overbought or oversold.\n\nIt is measured from 0 to 100. Generally overbought is any number above 70 and oversold is any number below 30\n\nHow it is calculated is average gains/average losses over a specific period of time. I normally use a 1 month time period to track this.\n\nThe MACD (AKA Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is based on the behavior of moving averages. The MACD indicator is great to track bullish/bearish trends\n\nThe Short term MACD line is generally calculated by subtracting a 26 period EMA (exponential moving average) from a 12 period EMA\n\nThe long term MACD line (aka the signal line) takes a 9 period EMA of the MACD line itself. The signal line is a more smoothed out version of the MACD line which allows people to see medium to long term trends easier. When the short term moving average is above the long term one, this signals an uptrend\n\nThe Aroon Indicator identifies trends in asset prices and the strength of that trend. It essentially measures the time between the highs and lows of an asset.\n\nA score above 50 indicates a bull trend and below 50 signifies bearish trends\n\nIt is calculated by tracking the past 25 market days and finding the number of days since the last high and low\n\nThis is then plugged into the Aroon formula:\n\nFor Aroon up\n\n(Number of periods - number of periods since highest high) / (number of periods) \\*100\n\nFor Aroon down\n\n(Number of periods - number of periods since lowest low) / (number of periods) \\*100\n\nNow that you understand the indicators, here is the chart of PUBM over the past 3 months:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pc0z43f5yph71.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=198d097bf1196bee155a991a9917df69a363ced9\n\nThe RSI is 46.47, which is a little below average, meaning that according to the RSI, the stock is slightly oversold\n\nThe short term MACD line has crossed the long term MACD line signaling a slightly bullish momentum. The MACD has been measured in 12, 26, and 9 days\n\nThe Aroon indicator sits at around 30 but has had slight upward momentum recently. This signals a slight up-trend but still bearish sentiment\n\nThis TA shows a slightly oversold stock which is beginning to have upward momentum.  I am sure that with the right catalyst and/or a bunch of retards buying in, we can set new all time highs!\n\nEventually short sellers will be forced to close their positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to Profit:**\n\nPersonally I would recommend buying a mix of 25% 8/20, 50% 9/17, and 25% 10/15 call options all around $30-40 strike prices. Picking up some October calls also wouldn’t hurt. 8/20’s will be affected by theta decay a lot more than 9/17s, but they are cheaper so you can get better returns.\n\nIf you want to be safer, you could also pick up some shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Positions:**\n\n2 8/20 $30C, 9 8/20 $35C, 1 9/17 $30C, 5 9/17 $35C, 5 9/17 40$ C\n\n32 shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvb6fpq55qh71.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=45da27636866e1c87f51fd3cc2193c077cf74dd7\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "p5fq2n", "created_utc": 1629119316.0, "score": 600, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|654|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is a tough call.

I wouldn’t be posting or throwing money down on calls unless I had a good amount of conviction that this pays out.\n\n**Here’s the tldr summary for what’s up**\n\n* **Solid financials.** Ex: 52% gross profit margins (Square is 28%)\n* **Near-100% institutional holdings** (equals highly restricted float)\n* **Major warrant dilution cancellation** catalyst (Sep 10)\n* **Multiple** **major valuations** at a 60% upside.\n* **IV is dirt poor** at 40% .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xv7ygo5z3rh71.gif\n\n# Part 1: About + Financials\n\nPAYA is a payment processor that has done close to $35bn in payments in 2020, projected $40bn in 2021 and is growing at a fast pace. They work through vendors, resellers, independent sales organizations, developers, etc, etc, etc., and have a bunch of different offerings depending on the sector of business, while their projected upward revenue is intense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjk2kyc56qh71.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf695bba611658736f9ff16108ddb03467a3299\n\nPaya has the lowest price per sales of all its competitors at 5.0 (SHOP is at 48.67 and INTU at 16.51). Gross profit margins are insane at 50.9%, compared to 23.2% for Square (SQ), and 48.4% of Paypal (PYPL). In fact, PAYA has the highest Institutional ownership of all competitors and the highest short interest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[competitors: SQ, PYPL, INTU, SHOP, FISV, PSFE](https://preview.redd.it/laeb3lrz5qh71.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2209fb2c19e080ee82420328257e74dc8db8bb4)\n\n*EDIT: btw PFSE one of PAYA’s closest competitors got totally fucked on ER today*\n\nThere’s a lot to deep dive into, but it’s solid company. So solid that institutions are picking up as many shares of PAYA as possible. [Their recent Q2 ER presentation](https://investors.paya.com/static-files/3769846b-2d2c-4e7a-946f-5b25b6911e93) showed off their stellar earnings growth. It’s hard to name other companies with permanent relevancy that have **over a 50% gross profit margin**.\n\nCouple highlights\n\n* $135mil of cash on hand\n* $244mil revenue expected in 2021\n* 25% revenue growth year-over-year realized and projected\n* 42% gross profit margin growth year-over-year realized and projected\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1374z8av5qh71.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ca302256976abc6b71c597de9b835ae95dc8ce6\n\nSince the economy has reopened, PAYA’s profit margins have only been growing. Unlike most tech companies, they are not a one-and-done situation but will have permanent relevancy in the post-Covid world. In fact, they are a top-20 payment provider in the US.\n\n[BTIG](https://www.investing.com/news/btig-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-paya-holdings-2439931), [Truist](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/06/21740210/truist-securities-initiates-coverage-on-paya-holdings-with-buy-rating-announces-price-target-of-15), [Cannacord](https://m.investing.com/news/canaccord-genuity-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-paya-holdings-2344676), and [Credit Suisse](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/05/20983489/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-paya-holdings-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target-of-1) have all given PAYA bullish targets with an average 56% upside. Meanwhile, institutions have just been pouring into this stock and buying more while increasing price targets.\n\n# Part 2: Institutional Holdings: +128%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v5n2ftpq5qh71.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=a847826730208a10840fa2904da409b965f2911a\n\nOkay, so this is getting good. So institutions obviously can’t hold more than 100% of shares - this is probably a small error in delayed reporting and maybe some brokers miscounting a handful of tranche locked up shares.\n\n**However** **it is very likely that institutions hold near-100% of all shares**. The entire volume over the last 6 weeks since Q2 reporting was only 28 million shares. The largest holder, GTCR didn’t sell a share, Blackrock bought 150% more, and every single other major institution holder that reported for Q2 so far **increased** their positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6if7s03l5qh71.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=82494deabe785695e978574970f5ab9408a213a7\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that institutions and funds think this is a valuable AF company and they are holding nearly all outstanding shares. They are jacked. **And remember: if nearly all outstanding shares are being held by institutions**, **that means the effective float is tiny**. This is very important in relation to short interest\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nFiguring out just how small the float is relevant to figuring out what kind of corner shorts have put themselves in. Luckily we have some good pieces of info to guide us-\n\n* [PAYA tells us](https://investors.paya.com/static-files/3769846b-2d2c-4e7a-946f-5b25b6911e93#page=10) there are 121mil shares outstanding in their recent ER.\n* [13Fs/Ds tell us](https://fintel.io/so/us/paya) that most institutions are holding and only small funds are trading in and out.\n* [FINRA tells us](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/paya/short-interest) that ***there are 7.2mil outstanding S***I.\n* [Price tells us](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-PAYA/) that only 28mil shares were traded in the last 6 weeks since June 30 Q2 reports have been filed with only a net 2.1mil share sell.\n\n**If nearly all shares are held by institutions,** then obviously the float is highly restricted. Since we know the exact number of shorts via FINRA, we can figure out real short interest in relation to the float at different institutional holding levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4tr1aiqg5qh71.png?width=1252&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1f97755849332293e3e86f843368256782e7bf2\n\nAfter all my time in highly illiquid stocks like NEGG and others that can’t be named, it’s obvious PAYA’s float is super tight, and it seems pretty plausible institutional holdings are likely around the 90% range, if not higher. **This would correlate to a 60%-118% short percentage of the effective float.**\n\nAdditionally, from the FTD viewpoint you see a spike in [FTDs with the price bleeding up](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=paya). To me this indicates tight short constraints, and combining with what we already know leads me to the belief that there may be a supply issue. SI doesn’t have to be balls to the wall for it to matter, sometimes supply-side issues are there but not reflected in the raw SI data (e.g. NEGG, AMC). I believe that this is why it is labeled as \"Hard-to-Borrow\" on TdAmeritrade and Charles Schwab rn.\n\nThese shorts don’t realize that their positions are ticking time bombs due to the illiquid nature of the stock. They probably don’t even have a fundamentally negative view of the company and are just actively trading in and out of the stock. Spoiler: it won’t end well\n\n# Part 3: Canceled. Warrant dilution\n\nA lot of negative price sentiment came from market pricing in an 18mil eventual share dilution via warrant exercises. This would have been a -**15% share dilution** of current shareholders.\n\n[Surprise](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and).\n\nTurns out PAYA is doing well enough that they are **forgoing $200 million** to protect share value by buying back their warrants. This is pending a vote due on Sep 10 where they already have 63.5% of “yes” votes.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the process here, I’ll explain. Since PAYA was originally a SPAC, it has warrants. A warrant is basically a call option with a strike price of $11.50 and a 5 year term. [As stated in their S1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001819881/000121390020035622/fs12020_payaholdings.htm), PAYA originally issued 17.7mil warrants (which would eventually dilute into the stock), however last week [they dropped the news](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and) that they would be calling for a “cashless redemption” of the warrants at a ratio of .26 shares per warrant, and changing the dilution from the long established 17.7mil to 4.6mil.\n\nThis is bullish because\n\n1. PAYA is saying they don’t need the cash (the 17.7mil warrants exercised would have brought them $204mil)\n2. Instead of the float being diluted by 17.7mil shares, there will now be only 4.6mil shares issued. **This is a positive change of +11% which the market has not priced in.**\n3. The warrants don’t have an upward cap, and can be bought as high as wanted in relation to the stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ez4n81ng3rh71.jpg?width=1239&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2e1b47203fa5f6462741885fba686c2c8e1c7ed\n\n# Part 4: The Short and Long Play\n\n**Fair value is** **at least $16.65** based on analyst coverage, warrant cashless redemption, and fundamental growth profit margins [growing at 42% YoY](https://investors.paya.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-q/0001819881-21-000035). They provide services that are growing exponentially and will remain in high demand for decades + their stock has received a ridiculous number of valuations all 46% higher than current valuation **before the warrant redemption news hit**.\n\nThere is still an immediate need for the market to react to the warrant redemption. Upside is at least 11% - from current $10.21 to $11.33 just on the news Friday alone (PSA - the options market has not priced this in at all yet) not even factoring in their massive revenue guidance, short coverings, or other catalysts they have lined up.\n\n**9/20 10c @ .60 = 733% returns at $11.33 by Sep 10**\n\n**9/20 12.5c @ .10 = 2400% returns at $15 by Sep 10**\n\n**11/15 15c @ .15 = 1800% returns at $17.5 in October**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7fas1jv4qh71.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=570595e622f388a6851b911bf930d69be92dfbed\n\n# Part 5: TA\n\n[The arrows are a RSI oversold indicator, and it looks like earnings FUD is over -- repeating the pattern of a rebound it showed in the last earnings. Actually, if you expand to the March 8th earnings you will see the same pattern.](https://preview.redd.it/793hwgqicqh71.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=0674980f349a2bd3dffc4629ee0719efd372e43f)\n\n# Part 6: Option Flow\n\nBelow is a graphic from an external site that summarizes option flow. It's filtered on the last 50k orders with premium greater than or equal to 1k.  Just based on the flow and ignoring everything else we have extremely bullish premiums,  the ask side is outperforming the bid side,  with the stock showing an overall bullish sentiment going forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Flow as of Aug 13, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/frzqxpjr9sh71.png?width=1954&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bc57a91a0b710840b488bf9637cca24cc86d105)\n\nI also looked back in time at historical option flow to see when  10k OI for the Aug 10p was opened, since someone pointed out to me that this OI looked suspect af. So, i found that the Aug 10p  were opened  on March 8th and 9th, and they were met with 10k calls for the Aug 15c at the same time. It seems this action corresponds to a  spread trade that was opened after PAYA's March 8th earnings.\n\nThere were also 1k Nov 12.5c  calls bought on Friday at the ask (not by me) at a price of 0.45. This explains my position, I just followed the dude/dude'et into the November's after seeing the price was in a tight consolidation intra-day.\n\nLooking back in history:\n\n* 850 Nov 12.5c calls bought on Aug 9th price between {0.37, 0.5}\n* 1.3k Nov 12.5c calls bought Aug 3rd price between {0.45, 0.9}\n* 5.4k  Nov 12.5c calls bought Aug 2nd price between {0.75, .8}\n\nThese large purchases typically account for most of the option volume for the entire day across all strikes and maturities, and you can see that a good chunk of OI was opened up in the most recent weeks. So, unless it one of you fucks, I'm thinking someone is playing on some inside information or is simply a degenerate (like me). Hence, big dick energy.\n\nEdit: Here is a summary of the flow today\n\n[Flow eod today: Aug 16, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/vyx473hx9sh71.png?width=2362&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6c831d617985415e087478ed86f2646b9e506bc)\n\n# Part 7: Position\n\n[I also have some 15c Aug shit calls in addition to the November's](https://preview.redd.it/tujjzzlp4qh71.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfe6640ff2e1211acfb8e1d5b9203cecfe43fe8d)\n\n# Part 8: End\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/k667kdv49sh71.gif\n\n***Now will you please bow your heads and join me and my coked out brethen above in a prayer for $PAYA.*** *Dear tendie gods, if you're listening, we ask that you protect and show favor to the brave  WSB warriors who are battling on the front-lines.

{"title": "My Lucky CLOV - A case study in the meme market’s Epileptic Squeezures and why the market is ready for another.", "selftext": "# A case study in the meme market’s Epileptic Squeezures and why the market is ready for another.\n\n**Alright folks! So you've heard CLOV looks good for an epic run... and oh boy does it!**\n\n**I have a full write up broken into multiple parts and I’m spending quite a bit of time on this, I hope you find it useful! If there is any organizational changes I can make to allow reading it easier, please let me know. If you find any piece of information wrong, please point it out but also explain. I’ve spent a lot of time learning about the market since the meme stocks started what they’ve been doing. It’s fascinating, and I’ve learned so much. Lost money, made money, but am overall better for the education! I don’t know everything and I am open to counter arguments and more details where I may have missed some. Thanks!**\n\n***The brief summary of data:*** *CLOV option open interest on 8/20 (the number of contracts open for calls/puts) is absolutely enormous. For perspective, this Friday has a typical number of contracts for the stock. We see 77,006 calls and 31,986 puts (0.42 ratio) expiring, 8/13.*\n\n*FRIDAY 08/20 HOWEVER, we have jaw dropping 306,424 calls, and 72,752 puts (0.24 ratio). This puts us right on track for a GAMMA SQUEEZE (details further down).*\n\n*Earnings report showed a surprise beat on revenue (+100%), critical for growth stocks. We are at a local minimum value on the stock, so with a great earnings report, investors are eager to buy the stock. We saw this on 08/12 after earnings with the insane amount of volume (147.4million, vs the avg. of 29.22 million) fighting for the price around $9 a share.*\n\n*These factors, plus 25% short interest (who doesn't love hearing that), mean that CLOV is ripe for a major mind melting squeeze beginning the week of the Futures contract rollover dates beginning on the Futures First Notice Day, August 26. The futures contracts are a key piece of this meme stock puzzle that many have been trying to solve.*\n\n*This will likely peak before Sept. 9 due to futures rollover dates. Unless we see insane price action reaching margin call levels, which considering the DTCC's updated Uncleared Margin Rules (phase 5) going into effect on Sept 1st. is expected to cause a spike in margin calls.*\n\n***TLDR: CLOV go moon before Sept 9, buy shares. Buy calls 09/03 @ $10 and 9/10 @ whatever strike suits you.***\n\nFor the long version, read on!\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\n1. What the hell is a gamma squeeze?\n2. How will we recognize a gamma squeeze? How long can it take to play out?\n3. FTDS\n4. **Futures Contracts Rollover Dates –  Triple Witching Rollover Edition and we're in a Ford Bronco**\n\n***What the hell is a gamma squeeze and how do you predict one is going to happen?***\n\nA gamma squeeze is a product of the derivatives (calls/puts) market. Usually this is a rare event, but with growing accessibility to the markets by retail investors, it is becoming more common. (*Tin foil hat*: this will not last forever, they will nerf this feature at some point).\n\n***What causes the gamma squeeze?*** Unusually high call option open interest + Rise in share price + Market Maker Delta hedging.\n\nDelta hedging is when market makers buy and sell shares in a stock to remain delta neutral. See, a Hedge fund (market maker) is intended to provide liquidity, and help you buy and sell shares. But they don't want to be on the bad side of a trade, so they remain delta neutral.\n\nDelta is a value that affects the option price on calls and puts. It is directly related to the rate of change in stock price. So if you have a call option with a delta of 0.1, a market maker needs to buy 10 shares to hedge. A delta of 0.5 would be 50 shares, and the max delta is 1.0 or 100 shares (this would be deep in the money) The more call options open (open interest), the more market makers have to do this.\n\nAs you might be figuring out, if the market makers have to buy shares to delta hedge, and there are an immense amount of call options open, then the buying action from market makers to delta hedge can and WILL drive up the price. As retail investors continue to buy shares and the price climbs, market makers must also buy shares to delta hedge. This causes a snowballing effect called the gamma squeeze. We saw this happen with so many stocks now (AMC in June, CLOV in June).\n\nGamma is the value that measures the rate of change in delta. So the faster the price changes, the higher the delta, and gamma runs higher as delta changes faster. Hence why it is termed a gamma squeeze.\n\n***How will we recognize a gamma squeeze happening? How long can it take to play out?***\n\nThe timeline for a gamma squeeze can be longer than you think. It is driven by multiple factors, and the intensity of each of these factors adds pressure to the overall squeeze. It can be broken into a few parts:\n\n***Share buying***\n\nAs shares are bought causing a rise in the stock price, market makers must hedge by buying shares as delta rises. The faster the rise in stock price due to buying pressure, the faster delta increases and the more shares need to be purchased by market makers. This is due to the need to deliver these shares the following week as more calls become in the money. More on this below.\n\n***Call Buying***\n\nThe more calls bought, the more shares must be purchased to delta hedge. If I purchase the $8 strike for 08/20 expiration, that call has a delta right now of 0.6. This means the market maker will purchase 60 shares to hedge against this.\n\nIn one respect, I think you can view buying calls as a way to effectively move the market as though you purchased that many shares, for a fraction of the price – hence the fact it is a leveraged bet. The current value of the call option is $59, however it would cost you $492.6 to buy $60 shares to have the same effect. (That said, please do not just YOLO call options, I’m doing a mix of calls and shares).\n\n***Call Options Expiring ITM and their delivery***\n\nThe more calls that expire ITM on Friday, the more this impacts the price of the stock the following week. If you weren’t aware, options expiring ITM must have their shares delivered to the exerciser of the contract by T+2. If the call writer is short the stock, they must buy the stock on the market. As a result, we usually see a surge in stock price following options expiration if a large number of calls expire ITM. This surge in stock price causes a surge in delta, which further compounds the rise in price as market makers buy shares to hedge delta. It’s this T+2 option delivery, combined with futures rollover dates, that I believe is going to help catalyze the next run.\n\nIn the case of CLOV, there are absolutely staggering numbers of calls at various strikes on 08/20. See the following table from Barchart to see the numbers yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Open Interest on 08\\/20 for CLOV strikes $1-$17.50](https://preview.redd.it/2z331r8mjqh71.jpg?width=1160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=124414fbc8a6314411691481a022d9df3185cfac)\n\n***Closing Short Sales***\n\nAs share price increases and borrowable shares dwindle, the borrow fee for short positions rises. Eventually this becomes untenable for short sellers and they must purchase shares to close their positions. We’ve beaten the short squeeze scenario to death in this subreddit, so I won’t go into more details. Just for data, the most recently reported (08/10) short interest on fintel shows 22.48% of the float is short, though Ortex estimates this has increased as of Friday 08/13 to 25.58% (go figure after that price action we saw on Friday). Short sales have likely been used to suppress price prior to the massive buy up necessary due to futures contracts (see below).\n\n***FTDS – Failures-to-deliver***\n\nCLOV shares that failed to deliver in the first two weeks of July is a staggering number. There were 46 million shares that failed to deliver. Compare to the 22million in June, vs the 6 million in May. These shares must be delivered. FTD data for the second half of July should be available on 08/16.\n\n46 million shares out of the public float of 133.76 million = 34.3% of the entire stocks’ float failed to deliver in the first two weeks of July.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FTDs for CLOV. Massive Spike in early July during the consistent drop in stock value](https://preview.redd.it/jo34i1g2kqh71.jpg?width=1830&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4433d9ee3994dcbd16e6ac84951894a8fa099204)\n\nHigh number of shares that fail to deliver usually indicates high amounts of short selling. Additionally, after the 30th of June, it appears that skyrocketing FTDs is correlated to a consistently falling share price that sees no Tuesday recovery due to options delivery. You can see a spike each Tuesday in June due to this, followed by a drop in share value.\n\n***READ! Futures Contracts Rollover – THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL!***\n\nFor me, this was the last piece of the puzzle on figuring out what is going on with the meme stocks. The Triple Witching day is well known, and happens when futures expiration meets quarterly option expirations, but the timeframe for equity rollover was completely unknown to me.\n\nOn 9/9 the next futures contract rollover date happens. There is evidence that much of the meme stock activity is due to someone on the bad end of a futures basket that included many of the \"meme\" stocks we love so much today.\n\nEach major run up has been just before the futures rollover date on many more stocks than CLOV. Some of those companies show movies, other sell stuff to gamers. I don’t want to name them and get flagged for removal.\n\nThe last futures rollover date was 6/10, the week that was the peak of our last meme circus. CLOV’s peak was seen on 6/9, and the futures rollover happened the following day. CLOV stock never recovered.\n\nFurthermore, if you look at the following table I stole from /u/criand without permission (the futures info is his DD, thanks dude, you’re a fucking hero)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qtzon9pjqh71.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=c066103e8c7bf7ea71274f397bb33a7d57923dfc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Critical dates in the June 2nd - June 9th Squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/mllu0qaqjqh71.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=6da4572dbed718075d9ad28ebce7b9b195f6bb90)\n\nWe can see that the beginning of rollovers started on May 25th, the same day we started to see CLOV climb up from $7.01/share. The following week it closed on Friday, 6/4 at $9.12/share\n\nThe next Monday 06/7, it rips up to $11.92 by close, followed by a run to a close of $22.15 on Tuesday the 06/08. Wednesday 06/09 saw a high of $28.85 and a close of $16.92, ending the squeeze. You may ask yourself why it took so long for it to run up like this? The objective is to cover at the very last minute and avoid retail traders piling on to make the problem worse. If retail traders were to push the value of the stock higher each week allowing more calls to end ITM, through the buying of shares and ITM and ATM call options, then this run will end up moving sooner and moving higher. This is the exact scenario they want to avoid, and why you have never heard this information until now.\n\n**What to look for in confirmation?**\n\nMarket maker algorithms generally move prices to max-pain. This is where option writers are hurt the most and the least impact is placed on the market maker. When we end above the max pain level (which for 08/20 is $9.00) it puts more calls ITM, which usually leads to increased price action the following week as shares are bought to deliver for options contracts.\n\nIf it closes over $9 a share this Friday, that puts an additional 20,952 call options ITM. If we go over $10, this adds another 32,382 calls ITM. The more shares purchased this week by retail, plus the more AT THE MONEY AND IN THE MONEY CALLS will put pressure on this gamma squeeze to get started. The higher the price ends this Friday, the higher this event goes.\n\n**How to cause the most impact on the stock price:**\n\nIf you plan to participate, I suggest buying shares and ITM or ATM call options. One method of acquiring shares is buying a call option. If you by a call option for 8/20, the $8 strike is $59. The current share price is $8.21. If you purchase the option and choose to exercise it, you can have the effect of the call’s delta forcing market makers to buy shares to hedge, plus when you exercise you can acquire 100 shares and force a higher price on Tuesday during options delivery.\n\nMy strategy involves deep ITM calls this week which I will exercise on Friday. I have the $6 strike call which will allow me to call away 100 shares for $6 each.

The big three derivatives that measure change in delta are:\n\n1. Change in delta vs change in price (gamma)\n2. Change in delta vs change in time (charm)\n3. Change in delta vs change in IV (vanna)\n\nThe table lists them all, in various forms. Gamma is shown as 1% price change, Charm is shown as 24hr change in time, and Vanna is 1.5x IV increase.\n\n> Either way, this thing is going to blow up due to the futures rollover and FTDs\n\nMaybe, maybe not. From the looks of it, even though gamma is relatively high (as a percent of float), there is plenty of volume for MMs to work with.\n\nAlso, the IVs are quite high, which means MMs have a lot more margin of error when delta hedging. They can delta hedge less frequently, or less intensely -- both of which ensure they don't gamma squeeze themselves.\n\nMy point is, I wouldn't rely on a gamma squeeze. That only happens when options are sold with low IVs, which means the MMs (typically) won't deltahedge as frequently/aggressively -- and also requires the price to get moved up from actual order flow -- and it helps if there is low liquidity.  When all three of those factors combine, MMs have to buy shares to deltahedge faster than anticipated and it leads to them screwing themselves over.\n\nThis ticker has had jacked up IVs for quite some time... so the MMs will not be in any panic to deltahedge even if the calls go ITM. They have the cash to risk weathering the (temporary) storm, or they deltahedged more aggressively to begin with with that fat premium they got up front.\n\n> If you can trigger a gamma squeeze in combination with that you can effect an event like we saw in some popular video game stock between December and January last year.\n\nIf there is actual stock buying happening that pushes the price up, yeah, anything is possible. Just don't count on the MMs multiplying this effect like they did in that January stock... they've priced in crazy volatility via the high IV and they've learned their lesson exactly from that Jan stock.\n\nLike I noted above, it's a lot harder to cause a gamma squeeze now.  Needs to happen on a stock with low IV, low liquidity, and with sudden substantial and sustained buying pressure.\n\nBest of luck, and props for responding to criticism gracefully (and at all)", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the great details in your responses, and I look forward to looking deeper into the Delta Flux tables.

Upward pressure needs to counteract downward pressure of unhedging OTM call delta for a true gamma squeeze to occur. There's a lot of calls OTM meaning possible downward pressure as the get closer to expiration. Considering what you said, would they even have the OTM calls delta hedged, especially if they expected the price to finish at say $9 that week? So if they were never hedged (which I was under the impression happened automatically), then there wouldn't be downward pressure selling as their delta shrinks. \n\nThat said I think the relation to the futures contract rollover combined with 49 million FTDS is the most important part at play for a jump like what we saw in June, with gamma being a possibility with enough upward pressure.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "The assumption that the entire OI is deltahedged according to IV is just that -- an assumption.
