Plus the **\"HOT\"** indicator changes every time Jim Cramer has an idea. What works for me is reviewing **$SPY's** reaction to different indicator. What does the price do when approaching one of the EMAs? Which is more consistent? Watch the 9EMA, 10EMA, 13EMA, 20EMA, and the 34EMA   \n and see the pattern develop.    \n\n\nVolume and price movement:\n\n**Real world example**: M*cDonald's* ***KNOWS*** *that when they discount Big Macs people buy* ***MORE*** *Big Macs. The price makes them attractive. If you're watching TV and see the ad - you go - oh wow! Big Macs are on sale. Your friends see you eating a Big Mac and you tell them they're on sale, and then they're buying Big Macs too.*  \n\n\nWell its the same for the stock market.\n\n**$SPY** is falling to the **VWAP** (example) and if enough people see it and think that's a good discount area, they buy and the price goes up. If those same people are busy watching their kids or looking at **$TSLA** instead of **$SPY**, then maybe the price keeps going down.  \n\n\n*That's why you look for volume to confirm price movement.*   \n\n\nGoing back to the price going up example. Today their kid is at day care, and they got burned by **$TSLA**, so they are watching **$SPY** and they buy at the **VWAP.** Now the price bounces with volume. Price moving on raising volume attracts **MORE** attention and the demand goes up and so does the price. Now you have a bigger move.   \n\n\nPrice moves have so much less to do with company fundamentals or technicals (well not 100%), and more to do with **PEOPLE** (traders).

I could see it 5x’ing in 10 years if they nail execution AND the general market sees a continued 10 year bull run, but they are just not near the infrastructure required to pass an inflection point on their share price in the near term.\n\nMe personally, I do have a relatively large risk tolerance.  My view on GS is not a speculative = bad opinion.  I made a huge bet on MVIS last June that has paid off handsomely.  The company was on the verge on bankruptcy and their only product was under NDA from Microsoft.  I believe that AR is the future (they have the light engine in the most compelling AR device currently available in the world) and I realized their laser based scanning technology would translate perfectly to the emerging LiDAR space, which they had been developing for a few years.  There is a post in my post history from a year ago where I explain why I think it was a good bet.  Luckily the market has since agreed with me.\n\nAround that same time I invested a lot in Clean.Spark, which is a microgrid company.  I saw that energy management is a big issue and thought that grid infrastructure would be a growing industry.  This was also a bet on a democrat administration being friendly to clean energy initiatives before the election.  So certainly some luck involved, and then I got really lucky when they announced a Bitcoin mining initiative last December which ballooned their valuation, using their energy software as a proof of concept and to also achieve one of the lowest cost mining operations in the US with 95% clean energy.  Also a believer in clean energy in general and have long term positions in RUN and some uranium companies (more mid-term here).\n\nI have some money in GENI but think it may be a little overvalued, but I like the sports betting industry and expect that to grow a lot in the next 10 years.\n\nHalf of my portfolio is now in SPY (30%) and big tech (20%) though, not including my 401k which is all broad market.  I converted about half of my MVIS and CL.SK profits there earlier this year.  There is really not much that needs to be said about big tech in my opinion.  They are behemoths in profit, intangibles, and also have a lock on a lot of next generation technology.  I sold into strength in MVIS and CL.SK and even recouped my entire investment just selling covered calls around peaks with what I didn’t sell.\n\nBut all this said, I don’t *expect* massive gains in any these companies and they all have a bear thesis that I acknowledge and pay attention to.  MVIS could struggle to scale production of LiDAR or a generational leap in the way computers “think” could make camera-only systems good enough for L4 autonomous driving sooner than I suspect.  CL.SK’s management has some questions and could line their pockets at the expense of shareholders.  Big Tech and crypto could see regulation stall growth for years.  The cumulative sum of my speculative bets I think will outperform the market in the long term, and that’s about it.

With measles, it seems there are an estimated 1-2 deaths per 1000 infected, that's a 0.002% fatality rate at the high end. Most of the data I've found put covid death rates close to 1% (and well above that for developing countries). I do believe that was based on reported cases though, so it would be considerably lower considering the likelihood of a high number of unreported cases. Even so, it would require 100% of the US population to have been infected to get the death rate down below 0.002% based on how many deaths have been reported thus far, so its pretty reasonable to suspect it is not that low.  \n   \nAlso, polio did not have a high death rate. It was actually less than measles. Right at the top of the Wikipedia page (which cites a CDC doc) it says polio caused central nervous system issues in 0.5 precent of cases. In that small subset only 2-5% of children and 15-30% of adults die. So that would mean on the high end (0.005\\*0.05) 0.00025% of children died and (0.005\\*0.3) 0.0015% of adults died... which is still less than the 0.002% death rate of measles.\n\nThe reason MMR vaccines are mandatory is they are all easily preventable diseases and have been nearly eradicated as a result.

This simply isn't the case with leaps, as a prolonged bear cycle could drain their value to 0 depending on how aggressive your original strike is. Now if you must go through with it, I would go for .80 delta with the market at all time highs. I typically allocate 50% of my capital for my main 3 etfs SPY, QQQ, and IWM, with that 50% split equally between 2-3 year leaps and shares. Typically I'll have ~3-4 leaps at .75+ per 100 shares. The leaps allow me to sell my weeklies/monthlies and reinvest into shares, and then I'll use the windfall from my credit spreads to buy more leaps. So I really like using PMCCs, but you have to be less aggressive or roll out a lot if you get caught short with an illiquid 3 year leap as collateral for your short call since it can cost more to close the spread than you anticipated. The goal should be to augment a buy and hold strategy in my opinion. All 3yr leaps in 2000 or 2002 would have left you out of the subsequent bull market for example.

All of my analysis is based on TA but I've learned you can slide some TA forecasts in a bit better if you first throw out some fundamental guesses to support the analysis. So here goes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Billionaires leaving the planet... WTF? \n* Goldman giving buy signals... WTF? \n* If the billionaires piss off the aliens, we're all fucked! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not the focus of this post, but it's worth pointing out a volatile asset automod does not like is starting to smell suspiciously like a bull trap around 45,000. I can't say what it is, but this is the weekend and it's trading. If you can't work it out, it was never meant to be. I mention this because if there's going to be SPX crash it's likely to see more speculative things warning us the market is heading risk off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter there's been a big pullback in a trend drawing fib extensions from high to low gives very useful levels to watch if price goes back up. When we do this from the March drop it's clear to see these levels were pretty relevant to the market. With most other parts of the chart being free-flowing but these being choppy decision points. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4ds28rgh2g71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=888abde10e1d91133674c14b6a3306884d179124\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I know most of you don't give a fuck about 161s, but that's probably because you don't know about the fucking weird sketchy shit that happens around 161s. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is it in the Nasdaq of 2000 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wb8ta9ewi2g71.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=f10405ebe3cde5cd81d345a16ad5b8b9a627e00a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a 161 of the 2007 high. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9na8us97i2g71.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=7487a185e9e5519266900dad0329d57940072afe\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere it is in 2020 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7omcvshi2g71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=39448d528d00c095f5e897a5439820364903e369\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis does not happen in every crash, but if you look at every crash (In all different types of assets) and analyse the percentage of times this happens it comes out to be \"More than you'd fucking expect%\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight back to the Depression. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfgsbeumj2g71.png?width=1447&format=png&auto=webp&s=45cf8bb3fe0d38c39439ca06c5528f3ce00bf0cc\n\nYeah! I'm that fucking guy.  But that shit is true. In market tops over 100 years of charting history when prices have gotten to 161 levels of previous large pullbacks this has become a critical inflection point for the direction of the future trend. If the market is unable to hold above these levels the next bearish breakouts turn into much stronger drops. \n\nThe 161 level is an inflection point, not a certain death zone.  So if the SPX can hold above here I do think it then will probably continue to have nice upward trending properties. And I suppose that could happen. But it's not like they're leaving the fucking planet for nothing. They know something we don't. \n\nWhen a market makes a big break of these 161 levels it is usually with news.  Big news. Unexpected news. Maybe the aliens shutting off the internet or something. IDK. But watch out for news and a sharp break of the 161 (4,140 price level).

{"title": "Do Hedge Funds beat the market? - I analyzed the performance of 5000+ Hedge Funds over the past 24 years and benchmarked it against SP500. Here are the results!", "selftext": "Hey Everyone, it's u/nobjos back with this week's analysis!  \n\n**Preamble**\n\nHedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry’s Scion Capital returning 489%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry) shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Losses_by_short_sellers) of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -> What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \\[1\\].\n\nEven with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271771/assets-of-the-hedge-funds-worldwide/#:~:text=Assets%20under%20management%20of%20hedge%20funds%20worldwide%201997%2D2020&text=In%202020%2C%20the%20value%20reached,managers%20in%20the%20United%20States.). Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \\[2\\], it begs the question\n\n**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**\n\n**Data**\n\nThe individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \\[3\\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \\[4\\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.\n\nThis dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/), so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Result**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rrgu9o8705g71.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=781036d4ac5a896c8ed5bf391b623255f1f5898a)\n\nS&P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \\[5\\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.\n\nThis awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/32eyi1hb05g71.gif)\n\nIf you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp). FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.\n\nThe catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!\n\n**Warren Buffet’s take of Hedge Funds**\n\nIn 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter\n\n>A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.\n\nPerformance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter\n\nWhile I don’t completely agree with this view that it’s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/) \\[6\\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&P 500‘s \\~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!\n\n**An alternative view**\n\nIt would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/hoiy89zc05g71.gif)\n\nGiven that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?\n\nThe answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/121003.asp).\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/gre25fff05g71.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=66cda7571f6f8a3ffe63e9f6ea12d2700523fc83)\n\nThe above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.\n\nIn the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.\n\nThis chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \\[7\\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry’s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \\[8\\].\n\nWhile you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100’s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don’t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI’s.\n\nEven if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.\n\nWhat this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI’s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.\n\nGoogle sheet containing all the data used in this analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nOQPyHdRNaRSv-c04iBRndvsgMDP78uSLKbxMwGWkeo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] To signify the impact of this fee, let’s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!\n\n\\[2\\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you’ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.\n\n\\[3\\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!\n\n\\[4\\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it’s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.\n\n\\[5\\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.\n\n\\[6\\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.\n\n\\[7\\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive.

{"title": "Jerome Powell Will Not Be Renominated As Fed Chairman", "selftext": "\nJPow’s time at the Fed is coming to an end with his term expiring in February 2022. Biden will not renominate him as Chair and instead will nominate Lael Brainard. Lael Brainard is a current Fed Governor and was nominated as a Governor in 2012 along with JPow. Since many of you enjoyed my post on China, I thought I may share my thoughts on the Fed. \n\n1. Spending is politically popular. Politicians are only focused on the next election, whether it be a House or Senate seat, or even the Presidency. The level of deficit spending the US currently engages in would not be possible unless the Fed agrees to purchase the issuance by Treasury. While the Fed may call this QE, it is not. This is monetizing deficits (or money printing) because the Fed is buying new Treasury issuance from a broker dealer immediately after it buy them from Treasury auctions (for those who don’t know broker deals are required to bid on Treasury auctions). Janet Yellen wants JPow to buy as much Treasury bonds as possible as the market does not want this negative yielding asset (it is negative yielding because of high inflation currently). This is seen through the 120Bn in monthly purchases (80Bn treasury bonds, 40Bn MBS). \n\n2. Biden has said publicly he wishes to elevate women or people of color. JPow is neither of those. He is a 68 year old white dude with years of Wall Street experience as MP at the Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group is a private equity firm founded by David Rubenstein in the mid 1980s. \n\n3. JPow is trying to simp for the job. I have watched JPow for many years and have noticed recently he has changed his tune. He now seems to care about regulating Wall Street, climate change, and income inequality. These views were absent during the Trump administration. JPow has also expressed an interest in running the economy hot (with high inflation) to ensure a full job recovery. This directly contradicts his actions in 2018 where he was only interested in raising interest rates at the first sign of inflation. \n\n4. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, shares many of the same views as Progressives. She is a woman and a Democrat, where JPow is a Republican. Most importantly, she is publicly calling for the Fed to adopt a digital Dollar, which is in direct conflict with her colleagues. Brainard joined the Fed in 2012 (the same time as JPow) and has a good relationship with Janet Yellen. Under Brainard’s leadership the Fed would be less likely to taper, if at all. This would allow the Fed to continue to monetize deficits which would allow for more politically popular spending.\n\nI have no positions in the market other than a SPAC I am going to redeem. The rest of my assets are in cash. JPow will be told whether he has the job in September, although I am still staying on the sidelines after being burned in Chinese stocks.", "id": "p0fsmf", "created_utc": 1628433474.0, "score": 603, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 340, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|400|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't disagree with the analysis.

You might also want to take oh. Maybe, 30s? And just peruse their financials before you keep yoloing.  That revenue being flat / declining isn’t great. But turn around stories almost always work (sarcasm - they almost always fail).\n\n\n Box office is still shuttered basically. Cable is being cut. Their new platform is solid but they have licensed out most of their content so don’t need to pay them to watch their stuff until those contracts expire. They also wasted a bunch of money rebranding cbs all access. \n\n\nIt’s not hugely material but their Star Trek discovery / Netflix deal is pretty big embarrassment. If they operate that way, they probably fucked it up on similar other deals. \n\n\nPluto seems good. I don’t know a ton about it but they also don’t release any actual income / profit metrics I can find so for all we know it could be unprofitable. \n\n\nThey don’t have a big subscriber base to push their new movies into for big premiums like Disney does. Super smart move for Disney. People are laying $40 or whatever to watch Mulan. It’s crazy. But if paramount tries to do the same they have so few subs they can’t get the same impact. For now. \n\n\nThey are basically going all in on streaming from what I can see. Which is the right move but it also puts them in a risky position. \n\n\nIt depends what market wants to see. If market is solely focusing on sub growth, they should do okay. If market actually cares about financial health, I would guess they won’t do okay. \n\n\nHaven’t decided if I will be backing any of them yet personally by the way. Disney is expensive but probably will have the highest odds of long term success. Sold Netflix a while ago after multi bagger on it over a few years. \n\n\nThe business is now who makes the best content. Doesn’t matter who streams it. That’s why Netflix does so much Original series work. \n\n\nThe winner of them all will probably be Disney due to size, and catalo; amazon because it offers it for free with prime shipping and there is valuable data there alone, plus it can be the one that buys all the ground level garbage for cheap, or buys the not renewed cult series, etc., and Roku. They make money off of all of them and will be the aggregator. Apple could’ve been but they’ve dropped the ball. Roku is embedded in a lot of tv’s os so will have better chance of being the platform.
