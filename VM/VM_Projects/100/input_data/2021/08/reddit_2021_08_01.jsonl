I've never done much with ITM options outside of buying them for leverage using LEAPS.\n\nHere's my thesis:\n\nI want to make an outsized bet that there will be some black swan event soon that could send the market toppling, or that inflation will start to get out of control fast and JPOW will do a 180 and go Paul Vlocker on this party and brutally murder the bull.\n\nIn the event of raising interest rates or a sudden and severe downturn, I suspect zombie companies will start to blow up left and right. The HYG ETF is comprised of junk bonds, many of which are companies I would consider teetering, especially if we have a rapid onset recession or rapid interest rate increases.\n\nI was looking into selling ITM call credit spreads as a way to short the fund, with limited loss potential and without having to payout the dividend, pay borrow fees, or margin interest like I would if I was directly short.\n\nLooking at specifically selling the $70c and buying the $88c for as close to $18 a spread as I can get. Experation can be variable but I'm looking for in the next 6 months.\n\nLet's say I'm able to sell this spread for $17.95 and I sell 1000 of them. That's $1,795,000 in premium collected. If HYG collapses below $70c before expiration most of the intrinsic value will evaporate and I can close anywhere between break even and a $ million + payday. If I'm wrong I lose $0.05 ($5 per contract) per spread plus commission costs. ($5000 + $1300). So for a max loss of $6300 I could potentially make up to $1.7 million by shorting junk bonds when everyone is uncertain of the future.\n\nThe only risk I see is if I get assigned early, I'll have to exercise my long leg early to cover the short created on my assigned short call.

However there's no full name and no links to anything that supports those self-made claims. For me that's always a red flag until people I trust vouch for the account, or more proof of authenticity is given. The post history of the account also seems hella sus to me. Created in 2009 and spend years and years being dedicated to pretty much nothing but religious and a few sports related tweets. Then from jan 2017 to jan 2019 there's not a single tweet, but then from jan 2019 and onwards it's pretty much just non stop anti tesla and pro everyone else tweets\n\nSecondly I generally don't trust someone that goes out of their way to be critical of pretty much anything Tesla does, while simultaneously is never critical of other companies in the same industries. Because even if they're actually someone that knows their stuff, this to me is strongly indicative of a strong emotional bias against Tesla and a strong bias to anything else just for being \"not Tesla\". \n\nThirdly, Tesla have consistently been fairly open and technical about a fair bit of the stuff they're doing in self driving, and the whole point of that has been to convince people that actually know their shit to decide to go work at Tesla. If  their tech was actually as bad as this guy would have you believe, I doubt Tesla would want to show it off so prominently. Meanwhile I don't see companies like intel's mobile eye or waymo holding big hour long recruitment drive presentations where they try and get smart people to come work for them by getting technical about their self driving tech.

This is much harder to do than just use the lidar on the same car with almost lock step timing information and almost the same view points. And Tesla's approach is much more scalable. The only limitation is computing power.\n\nThe Waymo presentation claims they have large scale real world training data collected by their fleet. Give me a fucking break now we are comparing fleet size and miles driven?\n\nIn my opinion the successful recipe of Google AI on language understanding is from 1 their access to large scale language data that nobody has and 2 the ability of the system itself to find consistencies from the language data itself, no crutches! \n\nNow in my opinion Tesla has that exact recipe in vision model. The Waymo presentation shows even widely considered industry leader is still relying on lidar as crutches. This put a huge limitation on the amount of data they can collect and the amount of training they can do.\n\nThis is almost like Gordon who sees simulation and claims that Tesla just use simulation and nothing else.

{"title": "Stop Trying To Predict The Next Market Crash", "selftext": "Always seeing people using fake technical analysis/news articles on Twitter, WSB, and everywhere else trying to be the next Michael Burry. Obviously, every single one of them has been wrong so far.\n\nHere's the reality of it. If you are trying to predict the next market crash - you are either dumb, overconfident or both. I've been TAing all of the indexes on a daily basis for a long time - and the charts have been **objectively bullish** ever since last April. In fact, they have been like that for a while. SPY just bull flags perpetually aside from a few **outliers** like last March, December 2018, etc. Obviously we don't always go up this fast - but there is a good reason I don't swing puts much.\n\nPretty much every time SPY (or any other index) get's close to breaking an important trendline or level - it bounces. There is some stick save at the end of the day or the end of the week - every time.  The only reason people think their charts are saying death is because they are deluded by their own biases - or don't understand how to use technical analysis.\n\nNow - there are ways to tell when you can gain an edge in predicting a SPY correction. For one, wait until we form a **bearish continuation pattern.** This means we've dropped a few percent - and then we've formed a bear flag, bear pennant, etc. This does not happen often. We usually get violent bounces, rather than sideways chop upwards. Bears fall for it every single time. Either way - these patterns do not indicate a major market crash, they simply mean we will make a routine move downwards - there is **no pattern that indicates a major market crash.** These are **outliers** and the whole point of technical analysis is gaining an edge in market movements by looking at patterns that have repeated **hundreds of thousands of times since the market was a thing.**\n\nIf anyone wants me to go into more details of why the charts have been bullish - let me know - but I know that will make the post too long for you retards to read.\n\nLastly - if you can read it on the news online - it's priced in. You aren't going to predict the next Black Swan with a Yahoo Finance Article. Honestly - just stop trying to predict anything. Way too many people here think they can predict a move in a stock or the market with 100% accuracy. You can't, no matter who you are. You can only gain an edge. What Burry did was not only a gamble, but an extremely rare scenario.\n\nNo one knows when the next major crash will be or when the party will stop. Just go with the flow and don't be the last one holding the bag. When the trend flips, we will know - but for the last 10 years we have pretty much gone straight up. No one cares about your bear fan fiction.\n\nEdit: For the record, I'm not saying the market is going to go up forever. I'm just saying don't let your ego make you think you can predict when it will stop.", "id": "ovitlk", "created_utc": 1627779861.0, "score": 932, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 383, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|32|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|374|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My Dude, I totally understand your gripe...

I've never done much with ITM options outside of buying them for leverage using LEAPS.\n\nHere's my thesis:\n\nI want to make an outsized bet that there will be some black swan event soon that could send the market toppling, or that inflation will start to get out of control fast and JPOW will do a 180 and go Paul Vlocker on this party and brutally murder the bull.\n\nIn the event of raising interest rates or a sudden and severe downturn, I suspect zombie companies will start to blow up left and right. The HYG ETF is comprised of junk bonds, many of which are companies I would consider teetering, especially if we have a rapid onset recession or rapid interest rate increases.\n\nI was looking into selling ITM call credit spreads as a way to short the fund, with limited loss potential and without having to payout the dividend, pay borrow fees, or margin interest like I would if I was directly short.\n\nLooking at specifically selling the $70c and buying the $88c for as close to $18 a spread as I can get. Experation can be variable but I'm looking for in the next 6 months.\n\nLet's say I'm able to sell this spread for $17.95 and I sell 1000 of them. That's $1,795,000 in premium collected. If HYG collapses below $70c before expiration most of the intrinsic value will evaporate and I can close anywhere between break even and a $ million + payday. If I'm wrong I lose $0.05 ($5 per contract) per spread plus commission costs. ($5000 + $1300). So for a max loss of $6300 I could potentially make up to $1.7 million by shorting junk bonds when everyone is uncertain of the future.\n\nThe only risk I see is if I get assigned early, I'll have to exercise my long leg early to cover the short created on my assigned short call. Even in this case I only lose $5 per contract that gets assigned early on me.\n\nThe other \"risk\" I see is there's no way I can get filled that close to the risk free rate. ($18 a spread between $70c and $88c) maybe I'll have to adjust to $17.90 in which case max loss is $11,300. Or $17.85 where max loss is $16300.\n\nSo long as I can get reasonably close it seems like an absolute insane payout for just taking on early assignment risk.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nAm I really that likely to get assigned early on my short $70c leg?\n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated.", "id": "ovmgi3", "created_utc": 1627795797.0, "score": 102, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|14|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|119|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If you short a deep ITM call with no option value then you will 100% be assigned right before the next ex-div date.

{"title": "China is playing the long-game; US is running on band-aids", "selftext": "China is not trying to kill their big tech, they are trying to make their business models more long-lived and sustainable both financially and socially.\n\nIt is definitely trying hard to create a more conservative financial system while contributing to a more equal distribution of wealth. Say what you want, but that ain't bad news at all if you're a long term investor.\n\nChina wants to rely less on foreign fund flows because they see high speculation and bubble activity in Western countries and they don't want their domestic companies to be exposed to that euphoria and collapse risk. It's easy for a company to act recklessly in such an environment, and these reckless acts might ruin the Government's efforts towards a stable and healthy growing market.\n\nRemember, China is a country lead by a collectivist mindset where the good of the mass is more important than the good of a single company or individual (which will frequently lead to abuse of the few for the many, in direct opposition to the policy of the US government which easily sacrifices the many for the few on top (not so much Western Europe). In the end the collective good turns out to be the company's best interest too.\n\nThey are not oblivious to the effects these measures have on the markets, even going as far as to post ads on the front page of every newspaper claiming that they are not in any way trying to harm tech companies, but actually helping them become more sustainable and resilient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWas the crackdown on education stocks really a surprise?\n\nIn April the government released a document analyzing the education system of the country and already pointing out the problems they saw and possible corrective measures.\n\nIf somebody read those (and they should have if they owned the companies) they could have anticipated the sector to be caught in the regulation crossfire. But people don't do their due diligence and always act surprised when things go south. China is always clear about its intentions, we're just unable to understand them because we keep thinking in Western terms and taking our society and the companies we know as the \"default\" condition, which is fundamentally wrong.\n\nWas the crackdown on Didi a surprise too?\n\nAbsolutely not. The government had explicitly recommended Didi delayed their IPO until certain data issues had been dealt with. Their main concern was making sure data breaches were avoided since, well, the US is literally their main competitor.\n\nDidi ignored all this and went ahead. What followed was more than expected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not pretending their totalitarian government that seeks to have absolute control over everything and every piece of information and conducts ethnic cleansing is in any way the most advanced form of human governance.\n\nI'm simply pointing out that it is doing what it is doing because it wants to secure a strong and steady growth for its companies, and it knows that can only be achieved if it does not come at the expense of impoverishing its population and compromising healthy competition and fair-play in all sectors.\n\nOnly the western investor deeply embroiled in never-ending ATH's and euphoria can view the sustainable long-term measures as unsustainable and the unsustainable short-term bandaids as sustainable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Now this is what I call a controversial fucking post. I guess time will tell.\n\nThe casino doesn't care about your stupid borders and your Murica koolaid, and neither do I.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "ovrkt5", "created_utc": 1627822376.0, "score": 175, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 491, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|817|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwhwbs/this_dd_converted_me_to_disca/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oizpee/doyu_is_deep_value/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/os5qc9/liquidated_my_entire_value_portfolio_to_allin_on/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "op comes off like a pro-chinese shill that bought a 1 year old account, \"fuck the CCP but like.. they're gonna win y'know?\"", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "turns out that not condoning a totalitarian government and observing the successful measures it is taking to secure sustainable business growth aren't mutually exclusive.  \n\n\nwhat a world we're living in, am I right", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "$DIDI 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌\nPosition\n\nx100 $13C 08/06", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "One thing they definitely aren’t looking out for is the good of the US investor", "score": 97, "replies": [{"body": "Yep.

{"title": "What's really going on with inflation?", "selftext": "In June 2021 inflation increased **5.4%** compared to June 2020 ([official release](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we look at who were the main contributors of inflation, we see that *Used Cars & Trucks* increased **10%** from March to April, **7.3%** from April to May and **10.5%** from May to June. The weight of *Used Cars & Trucks* in the CPI is 3.166% (see Relative Importance column [here](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t02.htm)), which means that in the last three months, **0.96%** of the CPI increase was due to an increase in prices of *Used Cars & Trucks*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe issue seems to be the global semiconductor shortage, that is slowing the production of Cars in the US and worldwide (for example: [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-16/record-used-car-prices-can-t-keep-buyers-away)). I'm however wondering if this is true (or fully true). If we look at the price increase for new cars, we can see that the price increase is \"just\" 5.3% compared to last year. Why would used cars prices increase 45% in one year while the new cars prices increased just by 5.3%? If there is a global shortage, shouldn't the prices of new cars also skyrocket?\n\n[\\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/hvkpfvznvqe71.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=080f3e70cbe2109e47b0eb14fd703204be09cd8f)\n\nI also checked the how prices of electronic devices (such as smartphones, PCs, etc.) changed in the last year. In the image below you can see their prices deceased by 17.8%. So if there is a global shortage of chips that slowed down the production of cars and therefore increased the price of used cars, why price of electronic devices didn't increase accordingly?\n\n[\\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/h5gkptzrvqe71.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ce4268562d01db3fe0d270a7a62c29ef5e58fcc)\n\nFinally, if we look at how the cost of renting cars and trucks increased over the last year, we see it increased by a whopping 87.7%, of which 45% just in the last 3 months.\n\n[\\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dy59zcnuvqe71.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad878d60d821705920a83cf078bd476084d2fc41)\n\nSo my theory is that partially the increase is due to the semiconductor shortage, but most of the recent increase in used and cars prices, is the fact that due to re-opening economy people are traveling more and therefore renting more cars. As [this article](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/europe-car-rental-carmageddon-cmd/index.html) mentions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"Essentially, car hire companies tend to order their fleets about two or three months in advance, at the start of the year -- and, having been stung with the low demand last year, they hedged their bets this year.*\n\n*In fact, Sixt confirmed to CNN that its latest figures show that for Q1 of 2021, it had 93,200 cars across its global network. That compares to 130,900 in Q1 of 2020, and 129,200 for the same period in 2019. That's a 29% decrease in vehicles, year on year.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look at how the increases in car prices happened, the increase is mostly happened in the last 3 months, with the coming of summer, while before the increases were minimal, while the global semiconductor shortage was well known already in Q4-2020. So should we expect this increase in Used Cars & Trucks to vanish by the end of the summer?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd be happy to hear your thoughts.", "id": "ovruu7", "created_utc": 1627823482.0, "score": 127, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|10|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "And people keep ignoring the shipping crisis happening world wide right now……🐻", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "Is that why my fentanyl... wait, no, I mean teddy bear... is still stuck in customs?", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": ">Our border patrol agents are being overwhelmed by the 4th straight month of more than 170,000 apprehensions, have seized enough fentanyl this year to kill the entire U.S. population three times over.\n\nSource: My representative's weekly newsletter.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Didnt have this problem with Trump.

Media loves to call it a shortage but it’s only partly true. In regular times, all companies that require semi conductors (car manufacturers, phone manufacturers, laptop manufacturers, etc) place an order with the semi conductors manufacturers and their order gets added to the queue. They usually wait for a few months/a year to get their order as the manufacturer moves up the queue and completes orders. During normal times, the wait time is predictable and is accounted for when companies place in their orders. They will usually place orders to receive semi conductors in 6 months time, but will place orders every month so they will always receive a batch every month\n\nWhen Covid hit, the car manufacturers all thought that demand for new cars would crater for the next few years. So what did they do? They canceled all their pending orders in the queue. When demand fell for a few months and then sharply rebounded, they scrambled to place new orders but now all of them were at the back of the queue, behind all the other industries that didn’t cancel their orders like the laptop and phone manufacturers. So now they have all these semi conductors orders but they’re at the back of the line, behind everyone else. \n\nSo yes, there have been some production delays in semiconductors in general and yes, there have been some shipping delays but the major problem for car manufacturers is that they fucked themselves royally in March/April 2020 and canceled all their pending orders for chips that were supposed to be shipped to them from Oct 2020 until now. The back log of semi conductors for the car industry is so large now that it will be some time before we see prices going down (read at least 2022).\n\nLook at the other industries. The phone manufacturers are having to deal with the decreased supply and the shipping delays but they are not jacking up prices like crazy, used iPhones aren’t shooting up in price.

Whilst the used car market skyrocketed (at least by our standards). The ADAC (one of the biggest institutions that track lots of stuff from the automotive branch) just released a paper that issued used cars have increased by around 2.700€ compared to last year, the average price for a used car was \\~22.700€, so its a 10%+ increase.\n\nI work in a wholesale dealershop with huge discounts anyways, so our prices didnt got effected at all.

In Fact, a MSRP is only interesting for people who want to buy the car for a company, because its the base value to calculate the taxes for using the car in your company. \n\nThe prices in europe only change due to the discount of the MSRP, depending on the manufacturer a usual discount is between 5-15% off MSRP.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Chip shortages far more pronounced for new vehicles.

{"title": "China Doesn’t Care About US Investor’s Money", "selftext": "I see quite a few posts on China this morning and want to clarify a few points. In full disclosure I lost over 300k on Chinese stocks in a combination of shares, warrants, and options. Yes, I am glad I sold because my losses would be even greater. \n\n1. Chinese entrepreneurs like to IPO in America because the entrepreneurs and VCs are given US dollars for their shares. For those that didn’t know it is almost impossible to move money out of China. This is true for American companies such as Apple and Starbucks, the money stays there. It is a closed capital account. IPOs in American markets means foreign investors (American investors) can get liquidity when investing in a Chinese company. \n\n2. The CCP was more than happy to allow American IPOs because they need US dollars. The world does not trust the Renminbi and it is only used in 1 percent of transactions compared to 60 percent for the US dollar. China must use US dollars to trade with the world. (If anyone is familiar with the Belt and Road you will know China uses dollars to fund such project). When Chinese investors and entrepreneurs are allowed to sell their shares in American markets they bring in US dollars. \n\n3. China has global ambitions of being a super power. After watching a certain guy (not trying to get political) get banned from social media and made irrelevant, Xi and the CCP woke up to the reality it could be next. The party then decided to crack down even further on its entrepreneurs, who the CCP believes may one day oppose it. The crack down on the Ant IPO was just the start. (For those who don’t know, China does not take criticism well. If Apple/Tesla was to criticize the CCP both businesses would fail to operate in China (this happened to Hilton for naming Taiwan as a country, but only for a week).This is why you see NO American CEOs or entrepreneurs criticize China. \n\n4. The SEC is finally acting. News has broke the SEC will not allow anymore Chinese IPOs without disclosure of the CCP’s control. Every company in China is subject to control by the CCP. You either comply or you are sent to a camp. You also have the threat of delisting because of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. \n\nAt this point China has pissed off pretty much the entire US. From crashing internet money, to stocks, and don’t forget about their lies about COVID. I can’t imagine investors will bid up the price of these stocks again.

IPOs in American markets means foreign investors (American investors) can get liquidity when investing in a Chinese company.\n\nThey like to IPO in the US because it is harder to do it in China.

While BABA, JD and other mega caps are less likely to suffer from this problem, generally the risks are much higher with Chinese companies than with their American or European equivalents.\n\nSecond, US political risk. The US government is finally waking up to the fact that China has been competing with us in order to supplant us for the last 20-25 years, and is beginning to take action. China's multinational corporations, especially those listed on US exchanges, are the some of the easiest places to apply pressure.\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, is political risk from the CCP. The Chinese government can be arbitrary, and political concerns supercede economic ones. They can and will crush certain businesses just to make a point. This is real.\n\nAll that being said, I think sentiment for Chinese stocks is about as low as it can be right now.

I was literally feeding you guys free plays every day, so y’all have no excuses for finishing out the week red. **$SBUX netted us maximum gain on our spreads (125%), $FB netted maximum gain on our spreads (100%), and $PINS netted us 65% on our strangles and 355% on our binary options!** Three for three again this week, with no plans of slowing down! We’ve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, so there’s no shortage of opportunities to make some money. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let’s get into it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFvWUJb_E02c7xBqPN92uxmvUjvKC4noNDRJLXGNfUo/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFvWUJb_E02c7xBqPN92uxmvUjvKC4noNDRJLXGNfUo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Wednesday AH has a load favorable trades.** $ROKU, $FSLY, $ETSY, $LMND, $BNGO all have an average move of over 10%, and are all set to report on Wednesday. If you’re looking to gamble, I would personally roll the dice on one of these companies since they have the highest likelihood of providing us with a profitable moonshot which will greatly offset the IV crush we’ll experience. Since they’re reporting Wednesday after hours, the options for them will be *incredibly cheap* because they will only have one day left before they expire, and theta will have made them close to worthless. **Cheap options, huge potential moves.** What’s there not to love? The best part is, many of these options are priced inefficiently. At the time of writing, $ROKU has a projected move of 8% but often moves double that. The same goes for $FSLY. These ratios will only get better for us throughout the week as theta does its thing. I’ll likely throw on a couple of straddles right before close on Wednesday.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.**  Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you’re bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we’ll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, IV will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [**here.**](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Avoid $BABA and $NKLA like the plague.** Both companies are getting hammered due to outside circumstances, meaning that earnings will have very little to no impact on their overall stock prices. $BABA is getting smacked around by the Chinese government, and $NKLA is facing round 8 or 9 of fraud charges. I have no stake in either company, nor do I ever plan to, but I know some idiots will inevitably try buying the dip thinking they’re Warren Buffet. Do not play $NKLA or $BABA this week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, I haven’t had much time to review any extra trades given that I’ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe’ve got a wild week ahead! Lots of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies across many different sectors are set to report, meaning we’ve got some huge opportunities to generate some serious alpha. If you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know!
