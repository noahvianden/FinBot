Intel has been losing their customers as they lost competition. \n\nOn the other hand, AMD gradually over the quarters, showing innovation with a cutting-edge chip and in other sectors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Buy Intel’s dip instead of AMD or NVDA?\n\nIt’s a big no for me. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, Intel is far from dead or less competitive. Balance sheet is great and the new CEO looks pretty promising. \n\nHowever, the big question - Will INTC go back to their glory days?  \n\nNot gonna happen if they don’t show any innovation. I’m laying my hands off for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Don’t panic if you have INTC, here’s why.\n\nIf you already got some INTC on your hand, don’t sell just yet. INTC is kind of overlooked due to how great NVDA and AMD did recently. However, if you do hold INTC, best case scenario INTC gets back on their feet and stomps AMD and NVDA. \n\nWorst case? \n\nThey stay like this for a couple more years.

{"title": "Winter is Coming! Brace Yourself! Why Covid-19 is about to get much worse and why I think $AVIR is Poised to Save the World!", "selftext": "$AVIR $SPY $VXX\n\nI predict we are seeing the begining of a Covid-19 infection wave in the USA that will be even bigger than last fall/winter. 3 months ago Delta variant was not even 10% of the cases in America, but now it accounts for 83.4% of all cases. \n\n\nAll the signs I am seeing tell me we are poised to overwhelm our hospitals even sooner than we almost did in many parts of the country last fall/winter.\n\nThis will all create massive pressure for the USA government to expedite funding and remove roadblocks to the EUA of 2nd generation vaccine technology, new Covid-19 antivirals, Covid-19 treatments, and repurposed medications that also assist in reducing the severity of Covid-19, but especially hospitalization and death. \n\nLet me break down what I am seeing: \n\nPandemic fatigue is everywhere. People, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, want to return and maintain a sense of normalcy. Most people are not taking any precautions. They think they are vaccinated so the pandemic is over for them.\n\nThis pandemic fatigue is perfectly expressed by governors in right leaning states that have taken swift action against schools imposing mask mandates, and have even gone so far as to threaten to cut funding if they do impose masks upon students. These governors never want to repeat 2020 again and they feel the people that would re-elect them feel the same. Specifically Arkansas, Arizona, Iowa, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah have banned mask mandates. Unfortunately, many of these states have the highest number of unvaccinated teenagers so they are at greater risk for catching and spreading Covid-19 amongst themselves and even among the vaccinated.\n\nUnfortunately, physicians are seeing more and more young people filling up their hospital beds. For example, Arkansas reported today that they only have 8 ICU beds left in the entire state. Yes, just 8.\n\nA Children's Hospital in Florida recently reported they were at 116% capacity. \n\nWe are heading into schools re-opening and starting in late September the cooling of the weather will see more people spending increasingly more time inside, which will greatly increases the risk for transmission. Plainly states without masks in many schools we can expect the infection rate to exponentially accelerate across many parts of the United States.\n\nWhile children have no pratical protection against COVID-19, except for masks and social distancing, vaccinated adults are not entirely out of the woods either.\n\nPfizer's CEO recently reported that vaccine effectiveness drops to around 84% after 4-6 months. Research suggests that effectiveness will drop up to 6% every 2 months. Israel, which is exclusively using Pfizer's vaccine, reports it is only 39% effective at preventing infection, however, it is 88% effective at preventing hospitalization. This may not remain true as immunity continues to drop as Israel races to implement a third booster shot. \n\nBut more concerning Israel has reported that Lambda variant is showing that three mutations on its spike make it 150% more resistant to antibodies produced by the vaccine. In plain English this means, it is 1.5X more effective at infecting a fully vaccinated person. The more people that get infected the more people will end up in hospitals.\n\nLambda variant is present in 44 states now. Japanese researchers believe under certain conditions that Lambda may spread faster than Delta variant. It is the main variant in South America and some researchers think it may become the dominant variant in America in a matter of months, based on how quickly it spread in South America.\n\nMoreover, the first among that were vaccinated are now experiencing facing reduced vaccine effectiveness as Delta is surging and poised to continue to surge. In December 2020 Phase 1A prioritized the vaccination of healthcare personnel and long-term care facilities (aka generally very old people). Due to low vaccine supply and early snags in vaccine logistics many of the people on phase 1A received their 1st vaccine sometime between December and January with most having finished their 2nd dose in January or February. As I see it phase 1A all have hit their 6 month mark in August....as in right now. The other phases of those who reciever vaccine priority will start to lose even vaccine efficacy in September-December, the veey months that are looking like they are going to be worse than their 2021 counterparts.\n\nCompounding the strong likelihood for even more cases of Covid-19 and increased hospitalization are those who decline to be vaccinated with the J&J, Moderna, or Pfizer vaccines. Many employers are mandating by September-October timeframe or sooner that all of their employees get vaccinated. \n\nPrediction: People that refuse to work for a company that requires vaccination will find work in companies that do not require vaccination. \n\nLiterally, in the next few months we will see a shifting of the workforce as the unvaccinated begin to congregate in workplaces that are conducive with their decision to not become vaccinated. Already my work has lost 1% of it workforce since announcing just 7 days ago that there will be mandatory vaccination completed by mid September. Based on conversations with key in-the-know people at work we will see many more people leave in the next few weeks. I expect upwards of 10% will leave. Your company could be seeing the same effect if vaccines are mandated. Most people that are unvaccinated in America are so not from a lack of opportunity, but by choice. I agree many will comply and become vaccinated as they are told by their employers, \"Resistance is futile, you will be vaccinated\" to avoid losing their jobs. However, a late 2020 study out of Germany indicated as many as 30% of people would refuse mandatory vaccination.  A December 2020 US study suggested that in many parts of the US a majority of people did not support employee-enforced vaccine mandates.\n\nNow what will these unvaccinated people do? Will they seek work or live off government assistance? There is a strong link between people that are unwilling to become vaccinated and the likelihood they belong to a political affiliation that greatly reduces their willingness to receive government assistance. Accordingly, they will seek non-mandatory vaccine workplaces to continue to provide for their necessities of life.\n\nIt is also fair to assume that many of these anti mandatory vaccine businesses will not enforce mask rules or social distancing. It is doubtful they have invested in improved ventilation or air filtration which are two approaches validated by MIT researchers as essential to reducing the spread of COVID-19. An extreme example of this anti-vaccine mentality can be found in a Missouri taxi service that banned vaccinated or masked riders.\n\nNow, non-vaccinated clientele and employees will begin to increasing gravitate  to these types of businesses (out of necessity) they are going to create the perfect opportunity for repeated outbreak opportunities (and greater possibilities for the introduction of new and possibly more infectious variants) that will lead to even more cases and even greater hospitalizations. \nAnd all of this is lining up for the fall when we increasingly are inclined to spend more time inside.\n\nAs you can see I am clearly predicting a dire fall and winter ahead. I don't think the stock market is realizing how bad this actually is going to be in America and other parts of the world. When the hospitals get close to getting overwhelmed, governments will be forced to institute another round of lockdowns. Again, because of pandemic fatigue they will resist until the absolute last moment to institute lockdowns, but they are coming. I predict by Thanksgiving. \n\nThe market is in for a shock this fall/winter as politicians will likely surprise investors by resisting shutdowns until the very last minute. Accordingly, I have purchase VXX calls and Spy puts. \n\nBut let's you think, this guy is all doom and gloom I have tremendous hope for the future that in a mere 6-12 months we will develop the rights vaccines, the right antiviral drugs, the right treatments and discover the right existing drugs to absolutely crush Covid-19. We will conquer it and there are several publicly traded companies that I have identified that I think may paly a huge role in saving lives and ending this pandemic.\n\nHere is my write-up on $AVIR: \n\nDr. Fauci has mentioned the company and drug by name several times, which means it is definitely on his radar. AVIR has already received government funding, which means it is on the US government's nice list. Roche has established a partnership with them based on phase 2 data and provided AVIR with around 322M in cash because their phase 2 data was so positive. By day 2 of treatment 80% of baseline viral load was reduced! They had a positive EPS of 34 cents last quarter. AVIR is a clear winner that is poised to become a leader in antivirals and may be an excellent acquisition target. Phase 3 results for their oral antiviral pill should be ready by end of year. \n\nThere is a low share count of 92M authorized shares and they currently have a tremendous 833M cash on hand to fund their pipeline.\n\n\nDisclosures: I am not a financial advisor, tax advisor, or a medical advisor/expert. I have provided this for entertainment purposes only. I own shares and calls options for AVIR. I own VXX calls and SPY puts as well. I am extremely bullish on AVIR.", "id": "p2a6rc", "created_utc": 1628676901.0, "score": 107, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 222, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|125|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p2a49o/brace_yourself_winter_is_coming_covid19_is_about/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/Commodore64__, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "A bet against viral genetics mutation probability, I like it.

Let me get the ugly and bad out of the way so the rest can focus on the good. The company's financials are a mess with high debt, low cash on hand, and over 2B shares issued. However, the monthly burn rate appears to be low. \n\nThe company has authority to print up to 3.5B shares so further and significant dilution may come. If the company does not recieve government funding or a partnership or some other interested parties involved in funding in some sort of non-dilutive manner, dilution may come.\n\nNow that the bad and ugly are out of the way let's focus on the good. The CEO is highly engaged with shareholders and quite communicative. He recently bought shares at 5.9 cents indicating he believes the share price is undervalued. \n\nJadicell is the primary reason why this company is a compelling investment. In phase 2 trial of Jadicell, 24 patients in the ICU on ventilators participated. 12 patients received the Jadicell treatment and 12 received the placebo treatment. 8 out of 12 of the patients, receiving the placebo treatment, died. Meaning only 33% of those patients survived. In the treatment group 100% of patients under the age of 85 lived. 91% of patients over the age of 85 lived. This is truly an impressive outcome. Jadicell Is a stem cell treatment that reduces inflammation and heal scarring of lung tissue which is huge since a primary cause of death and covid-19 patients is acute respiratory distress syndrome. ARDS occurs when fluid builds up in your lungs due to covid-19 and do scar damage impacting the function of the lung. As fluid builds up and scar tissue also restricts oxygen capacity patients do not receive a sufficient amount of oxygen requiring increasing amounts to be delivered to them. Eventually the untreated scar damage and continual buildup of the fluid results in such a reduced lung capacity that no amount of oxygen being delivered will result in a sufficient amount being delivered to the body to avoid organ failure. Again I point to the very tiny survival rate and the placebo group of only 33%. \n\nJadicell will likely get a buyout offer since it may also restore lung function for covid-19 survivors with lung damage and it can possibly be used to heal long function from other diseases and lifestyle choices. Jadicell Is a moonshot worth the taking based on its extremely positive face to results the company is seeking EUA based on its face to results and maybe granted it outside of the US due to the impressiveness of its phase to results and the tremendous surge of covid-19 patients that threaten to overwhelm hospital capacity in many nations. Only 12 drugs out of 100 make it to phase 3 and of those that make it only 6 successfully pass phase 3 so Jadicell has a tremendously high probability of doing just that. \n\nAnyone who is currently shorting the stock will get the rug pulled out from them very soon. Government funding or other funding will very likely be secured and a stellar phase three will make the stock rocket. Moreover it has come to my attention that T S O I has connections to Gilead through a company that Gilead acquired in 2017 called kite pharma. Kite's head of Cell Therapy was hired in 2021 and his name is Dr. Francesco Marincola. He is also on T S O I's Scientific Advisory Board. Connections matter and he may information to Gilead to sour an acquisition or partnership with T S O I. \n\nI am extremely bullish on T S O I  even though I acknowledge it has some technical issues. It has huge potential to be a Covid play, but also a play to heal ling damage from all manner of lung diseases and life style choices; such as smoking or vaping. Vaping lung damage in particular represents a future potential for T S O I as it is increasingly being used by non-smokers who do not realize that even non-tobacco vapes can and will cause severe damage to lungs over time. \n\nT S O I represents an ignored gold mine that just hit a mother lode and truly has the potential to create generational wealth with shares costing mere pennies.\n\nIt is my opinion that Jadicell is the company's main opportunity to not only survive, but thrive into a very high multi billion market cap.

Members growth 110% YOY (now at 2.3M). SOFI rolled out a ton of credit card promotions and new account bonuses. If just 10% of wsb users sign up for the free money alone, that’s a 43% increase in their membership base, which would blow their quarterly metrics and analyst expectations out of the water.\n2. App store Top #4 app: SoFi app was #122 May, #102 in June, #5 yesterday, and now #4.\n3. Their Galileo platform services 70 million accounts (130% YOY growth) and is used by many major Fintech companies (Samsung, MoneyLion, Monzo, SoFi, Vala, Wise etc). Galileo is used by RobinHood and nearly all their transactions are processed through it.\n4. So, if RobinHood does well, then SOFI should do equally well. HOOD is valued at 45 Billion, while SOFI is way undervalued at 13 Billion. With higher annual revenue and growth, SOFI should be near 25 Billion in my opinion; once people learn more about the company.\n5. A friend of a friend who knows a friend that works at the company who’s also my friend, says they are actively working on options trading platform.\n6. Bank charter status:  this is jet fuel to SOFI’s business allowing them to out compete and out tech anyone.  Expected by end of year or early next. Just a matter of time.\n7. Cathie Wood will likely add SOFI to ARKK or ARKF in the near future. We know how much she loves SQ. SOFI should fit her funds perfectly; both high tech and high growth.  SoftBank is already a major investor in SOFI.\n8. Stock took a beating past couple months due to lock up expiration. By now, those who wanted to sell already sold.

If the money created was done via issuing debt, then you'd still get some short term inflation as its still a shock to the system, but since those newly created dollars are required to pay a bond the long term demand / supply equation for the currency remains 'balanced'.\n\nThis is why understanding the debt cycle is so important to understanding boom/bust cycles.\n\nWhen an economy becomes overburdened with debt, entities will start paying down debt to reduce its affects on their balance sheet.  When this happens all at once, the amount of dollars in circulation is shrinking, so the stock market falls, prices fall, economic activity slows.\n\nIf all lending in an economy stopped but debt payments were still made on existing loans - this would induce massive deflation as the money in circulation shrinks every time someone pays a debt.\n\nLet's look at a mortgage.  When a bank provides the loan, they aren't actually giving you someone else's money.  They create a double entry in their books.  The loan note becomes a bank asset and the dollars get placed in your deposit account as a bank liability.  This is an expansion of the money supply, but its not inflationary because we matched it with the economic activity of building a house.\n\nYou take that 100k and give it to the builder.  So your bank now has an asset worth 100k (forget interest for now).  When you make a mortgage payment of $1k, the bank now has $1k in its reserves and the loan note asset is now worth $99k - but that $1k you paid to the bank is no longer in circulation.  So all other things being equal, the effective currency in circulation in this economy is $1k less than before you made that payment.\n\nThe bank now has $1k more in its reserves, but it needs to create new loans in order to push money back into circulation in the economy.\n\nEveryone knows interest rates are used to manipulate lending (and therefore monetary expansion and potential inflation) throughout the economy, but another avenue is to reduce or increase Reserve requirements.\n\nThe entire world is still fighting the repercussions of the Financial Crisis in 08.  One of the biggest issues with that crisis was that banks stopped lending.  And what did we just learn about lending vs paying debt?  The former is expansionary while the latter is contractionary.\n\nThis is why we are in this zero interest rate environment and all the other seemingly crazy things central banks are doing...\n\nThere's a lot more to the story....but this is already significantly longer than I anticipated and I'd be surprised if many of you even make it this far...cheers", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">this is already significantly longer than I anticipated and I'd be surprised if many of you even make it this far...cheers\n\nHold my beer...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The point is \\*hyper-\\*inflation is basically impossible in our system unless we break some rules (like massive debt forgiveness or something).\n\nI would say, at this point, it's inevitable. Reserve currency status is the only reason we've been able to keep the party going for so long, could just export our inflation all these years. That advantage is coming to an end the more prices go up and foreigners look for alternatives, namely commodities and the consumer goods they produce themselves and usually export to us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Hyper-inflation occurs when the supply of currency is \\*significantly\\* higher than the demand for currency\n\nIt has far more to do with the demand for the currency than the supply. In fact, the supply need not change at all. It is demand that is the essential component. If the U.S. government were in a war with China and it started to look like they were going to defeat the last of our forces soon, regardless of credit expansion or monetary expansion levels, hyperinflation (of prices) would occur. That is because there would be no *demand* for the dollar in a world without Uncle Sam. Likewise, in all historical examples of hyperinflation, the rate of price increases initially does not keep up with the rate of supply increase. Then, in a spectacular and sudden crash (around 6 months for Germany), the rate of price increase skyrockets to infinity. It should go without saying, they did not need to create infinite amounts of new currency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If the money created was done via issuing debt, then you'd still get some short term inflation as its still a shock to the system, but since those newly created dollars are required to pay a bond the long term demand / supply equation for the currency remains 'balanced'.\n\nOk sure, and what happens when one bank (hint: it's the Fed) ramps up the dollar amount of its outstanding loans by nearly say 200% in the span of one year with no sign of slowing down and an unlimited supply of dollars at their disposal? Furthermore, let's say this 200% increase in their outstanding loans has constituted a 30% increase in the entire money supply... shall we define \"You'd get some short term inflation as its still a shock to the system\"? Seems to me you're just saying hyperinflation is a phenomenon that occurs quickly, when banks (particularly central banks that aren't limited by the risk of defaults) expand their loan book at a very fast rate without an end in sight. I took the above numbers from the past year Fed balance sheet and M2 growth, I would say those are very fast rates. They certainly are by historical standards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If all lending in an economy stopped but debt payments were still made on existing loans - this would induce massive deflation as the money in circulation shrinks every time someone pays a debt.\n\nThis is true, but as is the case in all hyperinflations, the central bank *never* stops lending. In fact, it always *increases* its *rate* of lending, forever, until the currency is worthless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Let's look at a mortgage.  When a bank provides the loan, they aren't actually giving you someone else's money.  They create a double entry in their books.  The loan note becomes a bank asset and the dollars get placed in your deposit account as a bank liability.  This is an expansion of the money supply, but its not inflationary *because we matched it with the economic activity of building a house.*\n\nJust because the bank can create the cash to *finance* building a house out of thin air, it cannot create the house itself out of thin air or the means to produce it.\n\nYou have to go into the market place and hire labor, purchase lumber, paint, etc. You have to lease equipment. All these things are scarce. The mortgage amounts to an increase in demand for these resources. That pushes their prices higher, which pushes home prices higher, which pushes other prices higher. It is inflationary both in the sense that there are literally a greater number of currency units in existence while the loan is outstanding, and because it leads to an increase in prices for those things the loan cash is spent on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You take that 100k and give it to the builder. So your bank now has an asset worth 100k (forget interest for now). When you make a mortgage payment of $1k, the bank now has $1k in its reserves and the loan note asset is now worth $99k - but that $1k you paid to the bank is no longer in circulation. So all other things being equal, the effective currency in circulation in this economy is $1k less than before you made that payment.\n\nThis is entirely true, but hyperinflations are caused by central banks, not the private fractional reserve system which is constrained by risk of loan defaults. Private banks will always hit a limit, whereby there is noone left in the market to which they believe they can provide a loan and expect to recieve the P&I back. They perform cost benefit analysis. However the central bank hasn't a care in the world what its lendees do with their cash, it isn't worried about defaults in the slightest, it has unlimited dollars. It will continue to increase the money supply at faster and faster rates to finance the ever growing federal gov. deficit and to prop up the debt dependent sector of the economy, those same people private lenders refuse to lend to out of fear of default. This is the path towards hyperinflation, not credit expansion by private/commercial banks, but monetary expansion by central banks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The entire world is still fighting the repercussions of the Financial Crisis in 08. One of the biggest issues with that crisis was that banks stopped lending. And what did we just learn about lending vs paying debt? The former is expansionary while the latter is contractionary.\n\nThe reason that it was such a big issue for banks to stop lending is that the economy had grown so accustomed to debt. Why? Because the central bank held interest rates artificially low for the preceding decade.

They sure as hell aren’t gonna be able to rely on rate cuts since they are not only at zero *at least* into 2023, but they’re also unlikely to raise them to a significant enough degree such that cutting them back down in the event of a downturn would be very beneficial. Let’s not also forget the massive debt burden the economy has, they can’t raise rates much at all without risk of crashing the very bond market they are propping u, not to mention without alsocrippling the US Federal Government under an increased debt load. Their only policy option (at least in their short-term view) will be to monetize the debt via more inflation.\n\nI find it funny that you seem to speak of the Fed as some sort of all-knowing and benevolent organization that is by default doing the right thing, but that’s simply not reality.

The solution will create a \"digital fingerprint\" for the vehicle, allowing it to securely connect to a bank's payment network, validate, and autonomously pay for a wide range of frequently used services, including fuel, tolls, parking, insurance, maintenance, and other \"wallet\" capabilities. Historically, vehicle-based payment processes have been complex and leverage legacy banking primitives such as physical credit cards or multiple smartphone apps to communicate with each individual merchant and service provider.\n\nThis is a massive step and hopefully the first of a number of key pieces of news that could be used as potential catalysts for BB over the coming days. CEO John Chen is addressing investors as apart of JP Morgan Investor conference today. Typically Chen does not stand in for these meetings so the fact that hes coming out now to lead the show is a very bullish sign.

{"title": "A Beaten Down Dog that Will Make You Smile - $SDC DD", "selftext": "It's me again, bringing you your next ticket to the moon next to Jeff Bezos.\n\nToday's pick is a beaten-down stock, and looks like it's poised for a massive recovery. In this market, where everything seems to go up, there still remain opportunities and this stock is a prime example of that, I'm talking about $SDC, Smile Direct Club.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSDC essentially competes with Invisalign in braces. They make aligners to straighten your teeth, nothing too fancy. You can't use their products for the most complicated cases, but works great for milder cases. However, their pricing clearly undercuts traditional braces and reduce the cost of wearing traditional braces ($5'800 on average for braces to $1950)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSDC **dropped 25%** just yesterday after earnings. They reported\n\n* $174m or **62.7% growth** year over year\n* Net loss of $(55)m or an **improvement of 41.6%** year over year\n* Adjusted EBITDA of $(22)m, a **decrease of $2m** year over year\n* Diluted EPS of $(0.14), a **44% improvement** year over year\n\nThese numbers are great especially considering the extremely cheap valuation and all the headwinds the company faced last year. Most of the issues they faced are one-off expenses and the company is slowly going to get to profitability. Keep in mind that this isn't your typical Pump and Dump ultra high growth stock, this is a **value play.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn their earnings call they said that they were negatively impacted by a cyber attack in April, the lasting economic effects of COVID-19, and the slower scaling of international markets due to COVID. However, they are planning to relaunch in Germany and Spain this year and will resume focus on acquiring new customers. This is essentially a new chapter for their business, as they are going to be more aggressive on their customer acquisition and expansion into new markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's important to note that the long-term story for SDC is intact and looks very promising, as they turn their business around to avoid these short-term one-off issues. SDC has a vertically-integrated platform and a very unique way of operating that prevents any other competitors from stealing their business. This is crucial to their business and is what will eventually allow them to grow profitably.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShort-sellers seem to have forgotten the long-term growth story of SDC and have just thrown away the stock, and this down move is unjustified, as the future is very bright for SDC. Analysts have all come out and downgraded the stock which pushed prices down even more. The company is expected to grow about 20% this year and 24% in 2022. For a value play, have you ever seen numbers like that, this is not your average boomer stock. I can clearly see a path where this company becomes profitable this year, as they really seem to have shifted focus on **growing profitability.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey could clearly receive a buy-out from Align technologies or another healthcare company. At this valuation, I think major health care companies, manufacturing companies are seriously doing due diligence on SDC. I would clearly see P&G or another conglomerate getting interested in SDC at these prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\n60x 5$ Calls\n\n10000 Shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: $SDC just got slammed on earnings yesterday and dropped 25% to $5. $SDC is a great value play at this cheap valuation. As they shift their focus towards profitability, the recovery to $10. Hop aboard with dirt-cheap calls.**\n\nEDIT: There seems to be some controversy among dentists about SDC products, please be careful and read u/TheFatOneKnows comment to learn more.

{"title": "Why Ford is Ready to Head towards 50$ starting next Q...", "selftext": "^(I'm  not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** “Ford knows what pickup owners want,” IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features.\n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now 😂(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\nPrior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.\n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.\n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n“Ford clearly has business and government fleets in mind,” Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it’s equipped with a standard battery that’s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a “no-brainer” component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford’s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company’s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\nAt that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[My Ford Forecast illustrated with Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/4cwxwa68rrg71.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d66883a4eddd06a88a5799b3a19095280b050f4)",
