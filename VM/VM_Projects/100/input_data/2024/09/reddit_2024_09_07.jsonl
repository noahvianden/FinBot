It's also not like Nvidia just released CUDA and graphic cards capable of doing AI work. Its also not like Machine Learning is new.\n\n* Machine Learning has been used in scientific research for a long time now (atleast in Physics/Astronomy).\n* Look at Cyberpunk video game. It released in 2020 and started development in 2016. It used AI to lip-sync character conversations into 10 languages. This was back in 2016-2020.\n* GPT-1,2,3 was released in 2018/19/20. Here's a part from wiki about LLM - \"Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use.\".\n\nLooking at that Sam Altman/Microsoft etc didn't think they should pour trillions into it or just buy all Nvidia chips? Nvidia earnings actually went down in 2019 lol.\n\nAll these companies knew about it years before. So what changed? Is it just that ChatGPT became public and people realised what it could do? or is there a more technical reason that justifies this?\n\nI looked at dot-com bubble. That was spurred by creation of public Web which became accessible in 1993 - so naturally only after 1993 could people even imagine websites etc and then there were new startups blah blah. Something, that couldn't have been anticipated, actually changed to cause the hype and new funding.\n\nBut this time around it seems to me like nothing fundamentally changed. Did companies/investors just overlook use of AI until 2022? Then looking at ChatGPT suddenly realised they were missing out on a trillion dollar industry that will revolutionize human lives?

Here are some key reasons:\n\n1. **Automation of Tasks**: AI can handle repetitive, complex, or dangerous tasks more efficiently than humans, leading to increased productivity in industries like manufacturing, logistics, and customer service.\n\n2. **Data Processing**: The sheer volume of data generated today requires advanced tools to process, analyze, and extract insights. AI, particularly machine learning, excels at identifying patterns in massive datasets, which is useful in fields like finance, healthcare, and marketing.\n\n3. **Breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: AI models like ChatGPT, Google‚Äôs BERT, and others have revolutionized how computers understand and generate human language, making conversational AI, content generation, and machine translation more accessible and useful.\n\n4. **Personalization**: AI allows companies to offer highly personalized experiences, from product recommendations on e-commerce sites to tailored content on streaming services. This increases engagement and satisfaction for users.\n\n5. **Healthcare Advances**: AI is being used to diagnose diseases, analyze medical images, predict patient outcomes, and even assist in drug discovery. This can lead to faster and more accurate healthcare solutions.\n\n6. **Self-driving Cars**: Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on AI to navigate, recognize objects, and make real-time decisions. This has sparked excitement about the future of transportation and its potential to reduce accidents and improve efficiency.\n\n7. **Creative AI**: AI is now being used in creative fields like art, music, and writing, generating new works or assisting humans in the creative process. This has sparked debates on the nature of creativity and originality.\n\n8. **Economic Impact**: The potential for AI to transform business models and create new economic opportunities is driving investment and research. Companies that leverage AI can gain a competitive edge in innovation, cost reduction, and scalability.\n\n9. **Ethical and Societal Implications**: With AI‚Äôs rise comes significant concerns about job displacement, bias, privacy, surveillance, and decision-making. These issues are drawing attention from policymakers, ethicists, and the general public, further amplifying AI‚Äôs presence in discussions.\n\nBecause AI affects so many facets of life‚Äîeconomically, socially, and technologically‚Äîit continues to be a focal point of research, investment, and debate.", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "This was definitely AI generated", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "It was intentional", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}

They refuse to put popular first-party titles on sale even years after their initial release date. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was released in April 2017 and it's still going for $60 on their online store. Smash Ultimate released in October 2018 and it's also still $60. TOTK released in May of last year and is still going for $70. Imagine how much money they miss out on when they refuse to lower the prices. Several people, myself included, purchase used games as a result--that's money that could've gone to Nintendo had they simply reduced their prices over time.\n\nThere's also the problem with Nintendo's refusal to create ways to play their older titles. They refuse to port popular games to their newer consoles, but throw lawsuits at anyone who dares to make it possible to relive their childhood. So players are left with the decision to either pay an arm and a leg to play things the \"right\" way or resort to emulating.
