The Model Y and 3 seem to sell well but I rarely see a new model X or Y. So the high end has stopped moving. Plus they have lowered the prices so much they have destroyed the high margins they were making. Plaid has gone from almost $140k to less than $100k. That’s a lot of profit gone. Tesla dealerships have them stored to the Moon. Same thing cars stacked 4 and 5 high and parked all over the place. At other Dealerships I am being told by friends who live in other parts of the Country that it’s worse. \n\nThe entire car industry is having massive issues but Ford and GM are not valued at 60xs forward earnings. \n\nI think Elon is going to try to preempt the Earnings disaster with his “RoboTaxi” announcement on the 10th. 1 week before earnings on the 16th.

Now, why is that not a good sign of Tesla?\n\nWell, that's because they've been doing poor to an extent that has the entirety of Europe rethink the previously agreed on goal of banning new ICE vehicles by 2035. If they void that agreed goal, it means prolonged and stronger competition from ICE vehicles on the market, the transition to EVs is gonna commence slower which in turn gives other car manufacturers more time to catch up in terms of their product and in terms of their infrastructure.\n\nAs for everything about Tesla that's not directly related to their EV business - well, how have those things been going so far?

Tech companies trade at a high multiple because, they can scale simply by adding compute. You can write software once, and sell it millions of times. It's more complicated than that, but you get the idea.\n\nTesla's valuation is based on the hope that everyone will be licensing Tesla's FSD, battery designs, and other technologies at some point.

Tesla might be better served by updating its aging cash cows, the Model Y and Model 3.

So far, it looks like Elon's gamble on using vision-only for FSD (against the advice of his engineers), has backfired. Waymo and Cruise have arguably pulled ahead of Tesla in real-world autonomy. Elon had better pull a pretty big rabbit out of his hat with the robotaxi announcement.\n\nA Google engineer was once quoted as saying \"We're 90% of the way there with autonomous driving.
