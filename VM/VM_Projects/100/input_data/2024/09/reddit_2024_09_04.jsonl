{"title": "[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint", "selftext": "Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.\n\nThe tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.\n\nReuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.\n\n\"Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,\" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. \"There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.\"\n\nA Broadcom spokesperson said the company is \"evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.\"\n\nIntel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.\n\nBroadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.\n\nSome of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.\n\n**CRUCIAL SETBACK**\n\nAs part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.\n\nIntel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.\n\nIntel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.\n\nTypically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.\n\nBroadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.\n\nFor an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.\n\nTSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.\n\nMoving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.\n\nBetting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.\n\nIntel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.\n\nThe company plans to be \"manufacturing-ready\" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers \"actively engaged\" with the tool kit.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-manufacturing-business-suffers-setback-broadcom-tests-disappoint-sources-2024-09-04/", "id": "1f8spne", "created_utc": 1725454841.0, "score": 189, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "This stock is a trader's wet dream and an investor's nightmare.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "Considering this company is facing down the end of their existence within a few years if they don't pull a rabbit out of a hat soon, I'm quite amazed that the SP is as stable as it has been.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "They'd be bankrupt without the US taxpayer giving money so that Intel can pay severance to 15k fired Americans.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I believe it‚Äôs time to sell my $30.88 bags after this news.

Samsung is another high end  fab, and China has started doing high end fabs as well.\n\nThe  CEO has been to split fab and design business but there is no mention yet of spinning out one of them, so both are tied to the fate of the new fabs. And without Intel design being 100% on TSMC it would be hard to spin out, and by being 100% on TSMC they would also loose the vertical integration advantage. \\*\\*So, unlike AMD success in the past, Intel chip design fate is still tied to the fabs, while AMD was able to spin them out\\*\\*  \n\nOne thing to note about fabs is that they do not have the high margins of designers like AMD, NVIDIA, QUALCOMM, instead they have \"stickiness\"/ vendor lock-in, NVIDIA and AMD cannot move out of TSMC easily, because all of their designs are for TSMC machines.  \n\nIn terms of risk, fabs needs ridiculous amount of investment needed to keep up (i'm talking about high end only, dunno about other makers), just check on how many billions TSMC spends on new machines, and how much intel is spending on new factories. It's a big risk and new nodes might not work as expected.\n\nHigh margins and less need of CapEx makes design usually more profitable (until TSMC blows up, then designers rush to be able to design for something else).\n\nSo, why couldn't intel do an AMD and split fab and design and go back to the top?\n\n1. AMD cpu division did not had its CPU rival also making chips in the same fab. Intel would have to beat AMD at what AMD is already great.\n\n2. Intel has trash  middle management and trash board, and is now paying for good engineers as well as other companies. Also, the legendary Jim Keller did join Intel and did not last long there, seems like as usual Intel management was not very welcoming.\n\n3. ARM is getting more mindshare, and intel team needs experience in both TSMC fabs, and understanding a new instruction set should intel produce products for it or another instruction set. Or simply innovate enough to keep x86 relevante in the age of single board computers.\n\n4. Competitors might be able to pay TSMC more, and therefore getting access to new nodes earlier. Also something that keeps AMD \"behind\" NVIDA on GPUs and Apple on CPUs.\n\nso, for chip design, intel will have plenty of challenges, but it does have positives:\n\n1. existing contracts, as long as intel doesn't piss people even more.\n\n2. Compiler tech and specific extentions on x86. Intel did invest a lot on software unlike the cash stranded AMD, and like for GPUs AMD fights the CUDA battle, for CPUs there are lot of extenstions on intel CPUs  in use  popular libraries for scientific computing (and other high performance computing) , that make intel chips still performe better than AMD's, but AMD beats them in every other workload.  \n  \nIMO, Intel design might survive with change of management/board etc, (not  good odds though) and a high margin business doesn't need much to survive\n\nWhat about the fab business?\n\nIt's a fucking gamble.\n\nIntel is full of debt to make these new fabs.  Remember me mentioning how much freaking expensive it is to build and upgrade these?\n\n1. If Intel design ends up using more of TSMC instead of their fabs, then lots of money lost.\n\n2. If no other designers use them, more money lost.  \nThere is much less experience in building EUV, high risk of failure and therefore loosing fab contracts.\n\n3. CHIPS act is by  parcels and milestones, shall intel fail to deliver it will have to pay all the fabs without big daddy government money.\n\n4. People quote intel Book value, but they are evaluating new fabs as pure assets, while they are a fucking huge liability, a wrong there can mean the fab will be worthless.\n\n5. Intel is all in investing into the new fabs, if these are failures, Intel goes bankrupt, it will have no way to pay the debt incurred into building the fabs.\n\nINTC = new CEO (due to crisis) decided to take BIG GAMBLE building lots of new fabs with new tech, and by buying INTC you are alongside him in his huge bet.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.
