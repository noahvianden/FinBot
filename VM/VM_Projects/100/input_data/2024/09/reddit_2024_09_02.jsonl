It helps small caps/growth companies. One way it could help is access for small caps to try and scale into AI investment through debt.\n\n2025 I'm shooting to the low end, depending on the election outcomes we will either be experiencing a battle on tech, or a battle in tariffs. The later we all know how that works with one of the candidates. \n\n2030 I'm sticking with a $10T market cap, so roughly $400 a share. I expect more, but this has been my base case since 2018.

Who would have believed NVDA would have hit the equivalent of 1400 a share in 2024 when it was 50 a share in 2019?\n\nThe right way to ask this question is: what are NVDA's markets between now and 2030?\n\n1. Data center -- I see this growth slowing down after Blackwell. My main reason being the process improvement for Rubin seems marginal, and Blackwell is already reticle limited. I would be proved wrong should Nvidia's AI-driven chip design result in significant performance improvements per watt and area. I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia starts driving costs down here also.\n2. Games -- not gonna grow much. Once everyone upgrades to the 5xxx series, it'll slow down a lot IMO.\n3. Networking -- this is really data center and this part should grow. But likely less than $20B by 2030.\n4. Automotive -- reliable AI driving will come, and basically needs the autonomous agent level of AI (see [https://www.perplexity.ai/page/openai-s-5-steps-to-agi-STzklF5SSQ6JOiBTaV.cfA](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/openai-s-5-steps-to-agi-STzklF5SSQ6JOiBTaV.cfA) ) to handle all of the little details that are not trainable.  The global 4 wheel market is estimated to be about $4T in 2030, so if AI is 10% of the cost, that's a $400B market.\n\nNew markets:\n\n5. Robotics -- this can start with just the problem solving level of AI, but eventually you want autonomous level as well. The market here is essentially unlimited. $10T I do not think is unreasonable. So, that's $1T of revenue just for the AI components (again assuming a 10% breakdown.) Maybe it takes longer to get there. So $2T in 2030? 200B for Nvidia then.\n\n6. AI in the cloud -- I think Nvidia won't get into this as it's far more profitable to sell a $X cost part for $4X than to use that to build their own data centers. They'll still build one datacenter for their own use, of course, and that's deductible as a business expense as well. (So your autonomous agents run on someone else's hardware in the cloud, and that's what continues to drive data center purchases -- as more people want to use agents, hardware to support them increases.)\n\n7. New unknown market -- I have no idea. I'll assume none.\n\nSo we're looking at roughly $700B in sales in 2030, which is a roughly 6x increase. So, my 2030 prediction for NVDA is 6\\*125 = 750 a share, and a $20T market cap.\n\n2024, 2025? Who the fuck knows. I sure don't.

{"title": "Intel CEO will reportedly present plans to cut assets at an emergency board meeting", "selftext": "According to Reuters reports, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger and other key executives are to present their plan to trim Intel's fat and course-correct the company. The meeting will focus on removing assets and reducing costs, with items of discussion apparently including Intel's upcoming Magdeburg, Germany fab and its ownership of Altera.\n\nIntel announced a $1.6 billion loss in its now-infamous August 1 earnings call, which also carried the news that Intel had laid off 15% of its workforce and aims to reduce spending by $10 billion by 2025. The loss came thanks to Intel's falling behind in the AI arms race and its 13th/14th-generation widespread CPU failures. Intel stock had its worst day in 50 years immediately following the call, and the company has continued to suffer in the month since. Chip industry legend Lip-Bu Tan resigned from the board of executives, resulting in a 6% drop in Intel stock and a significant lack of industry experience.\n\nSignificant changes to Intel were always likely to reverse this major downturn, but recent reports reveal that Gelsinger's plans may include seriously drastic measures. Construction on Intel's upcoming Magdeburg chip fab is expected to be paused or canceled, leaving the $32 billion project unfinished. Magdeburg's local government has already begun drafting plans in case Intel withdraws its commitment to the project.\n\nIntel is also likely to sell off its ownership of Altera, its programmable chip business, which is currently a fully spun-off company owned solely by Intel. Altera has been an industry fixture for decades, with Intel investing heavily in reviving Altera after acquiring the company in 2015. Altera has been a part of Intel's broad market strategy for ten years but is likely to be entirely sold off to another interested chip manufacturer in the coming months.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Intel is not expected to entertain discussion about spinning off or selling its Intel Foundry wing. Intel's contract foundry business, one of Intel's most significant expenses, has been kept distinct from the rest of Intel's business since Q1 2024 and is considered a tentpole part of Intel's future. Two separate sources have confirmed that Intel will not propose any plans to sell its foundry wing to TSMC or another similar buyer, keeping it around for the day it is hopefully as profitable as Gelsinger believes it can be.\n\nIntel's sharp decline can be attributed to several factors. Lip-Bu Tan reportedly blamed his exit from Intel on a bloated workforce, and Gelsinger blamed expenditures across the board as a major problem. Intel is still mired in issues related to the instability and failure rate of 13th and 14th Generation CPUs, which could lead to permanent chip damage. Tech media heavily reported Intel's lethargic response to a disastrous product failure, leading to increased public distrust of Intel's brand. While selling off companies will help quell Intel's bleeding out; the company has a long road ahead to stability.\n\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-ceo-will-reportedly-present-plans-to-cut-assets-at-an-emergency-board-meeting-chipmaker-may-put-dollar32b-magdeburg-plant-on-hold-and-sell-off-altera", "id": "1f7hjwm", "created_utc": 1725310173.0, "score": 993, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 282, "comments": [{"body": "$1.6b loss, dude still gonna get like $30m in bonus comp this year", "score": 665, "replies": [{"body": "Stock based compensation went from 1.6 billion in the quarter last year to nearly 2 billion last quarter.

At least though the company was profitable and had decent cash flow. Now it doesn‚Äôt even have that. \n\nWhen Gelsinger took over in the beginning of 2021 he basically said he wanted Intel to be a company that both designs chips and manufacturers them.  He was extremely optimistic to investors about that plan and started making announcements of building big factories in Arizona, Ohio, Oregon, Germany, and other places. In their original forecast in 2021 Intel said that the factories would start being constructed in 2021 and be built in late 2025 and start producing. \n\nThe main problem came that not even Intel foresaw was a complete earnings collapse. All of the money was basically going to capex to develop these factories and nothing was really going towards their existing products. Intel fell even further behind and their products became more undesirable and competitor‚Äôs moved even further ahead. It came to a point where margins collapsed and they are basically giving away their products for a small to no profit. They also took a massive loss on their chip fab machines cause they were crap so now they have to write them off and buy new ones from ASML. \n\nNow cause of the earnings collapse they have even less money to put towards these factories and have to use every financial trick in the book to get money to fund these. One they have been using is debt. Debt has ballooned but you can only take on so much debt. Another is issuing shares. Intel has been issuing shares quite substantially but that will only get you so far especially when your stock is selling off and not desirable as is. Another is selling their ownership stakes in their factories and spinning off other assets. They basically dumped Mobileye and now they want to dump Altera. \n\nConstruction was also delayed and now Intel is saying that the factories now won‚Äôt be ready until 2028 at the earliest. That also assumes no more delays. So their financial situation is only getting worse and worse and the fabs are not expected to have results until 2028-2030.

{"title": "4 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist After Its Latest Pullback", "selftext": "For those that have not bought the dip... the time is now... Load up because Winter is coming!\n\n# [4 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist After Its Latest Pullback](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-buy-nvidia-stock-075200614.html)\n\n# 1. Blackwell is coming soon\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said in the company's Q2 earnings call that the Blackwell platform will ramp up production beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. She added that Nvidia expects Blackwell will generate \"several billion dollars\" of revenue in Q4. Kress mentioned that demand exceeds supply, a trend that should extend into next year.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang clarified that Nvidia will begin shipping Blackwell in Q4. He touted Blackwell's capabilities and maintained that it's \"going to be a complete game-changer for the industry.\" Huang emphasized that Blackwell isn't just a graphics processing unit ([GPU);](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/gpu/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=0f94b09d-ad43-40f5-80ac-1a14707443cc)¬†it's \"an AI infrastructure platform\" that offers between 3 times and 5 times more AI throughput than Nvidia's Hopper platform.\n\nSome investors might have been disappointed that Nvidia missed its \"whisper\" earnings number in Q2 despite beating the official Wall Street estimates. However, I suspect the release of Blackwell will soon wipe away those misgivings.\n\n# 2. The $1 trillion data-center migration\n\nIt's important to keep in mind why Blackwell and forthcoming innovations are so critical to Nvidia's success. A massive migration of data centers from CPUs to GPUs is underway. As Huang said in the Q2 call, \"$1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs.\"\n\nDon't look at this as an opportunity for Nvidia that's well into the future, though. Huang noted that the company expects its data-center business will grow \"quite significantly next year.\"\n\n# 3. The next generation of generative AI is at hand\n\nOne reason why data centers need powerful GPUs is that the next generation of generative AI is at hand. According to Huang, \"The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software.\" He noted that Nvidia is already using generative AI coding \"quite extensively.\"\n\nBut while the use of generative AI in coding, chatbots, and image generation is accelerating, Huang argues that's \"just the tip of the iceberg.\" He mentioned several other areas that generative AI is transforming, including ad targeting, large-scale recommender systems, robotics, and search systems.\n\nImportantly, training next-generation AI models will require 10 times to 20 times more computing power. This creates a huge growth market for Nvidia, one the company is capitalizing on.\n\n# 4. Nvidia plans to buy its shares hand over fist\n\nThere's at least one other reason to buy Nvidia stock after the recent pullback: The company plans to buy its shares hand over fist. Nvidia's board of directors approved a $50 billion stock-buyback authorization. This comes on top of the $7.5 billion remaining on the existing share-repurchase authorization.\n\nSure, the total amount of authorized-stock buybacks represents less than 2% of Nvidia's market cap. However, the increased authorization underscores that the board believes in the company's future growth prospects. With Nvidia prepared to bet another $50 billion on itself, it could give investors putting up much less money to buy the stock with more confidence in their decision.", "id": "1f762ii", "created_utc": 1725281881.0, "score": 658, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 455, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 382 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Nvidia is the BUBBLE", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Your $130 shares are in the red aren't they", "score": 2131, "replies": [{"body": "HAND OVER FIST", "score": 134, "replies": [{"body": "op going HAND OVER FIST GAWK GAWK", "score": 33, "replies": []}, {"body": "HE WANTS YOU TO FIST HIM", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "They must be a big sailor", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Shoulder deep", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "I always found fisting kind of a turn off", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "This got even funnier today", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)", "score": 261, "replies": []}, {"body": "Excuse me $138", "score": 60, "replies": []}, {"body": "Mine is ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "lol exactly", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "Lmfaoooooooo!!

{"title": "17% cut in expected production 2025 in Kazakhstan (~45% of world production) announced & there already was a global uranium supply problem ", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nNow that the NVDA earnings are out, and investors can again look beyond that...\n\nMy previous post on this sub that had a lot of success, explaining the nuclear construction pace in China: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eyj9vf/china\\_just\\_approved\\_the\\_construction\\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eyj9vf/china_just_approved_the_construction_of/)\n\nBefore looking for stocks, you need to understand the drivers of the sector of that stock (imo)\n\nThe uranium sector is in a global structural supply deficit, and now Kazakhstan, responsible for \\~45% of world production, announced a big cut in the hoped uranium production for 2025 and hinted for additional cuts for 2026 and beyond.\n\n**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.\n\nLet me explain\n\na) The gas price represents \\~70% of total production cost of electricity coming from a gas-fired power plant. So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!\n\nThe uranium price only represents \\~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105\n\nb) the uranium spotprice is only for supply adjustments, while the main part of the uranium supply goes through LT contracts. So when an uranium consumer needs 50k lb uranium through a spot purchase in addition to the 450k lbs they got through an existing LT contract to be able to start the nuclear fuel rods fabrication, than they will just buy those 50k lb at any price, because blocking the start of the nuclear fuel rods fabrication is not an option.\n\nc) buying uranium (example: 50k lb) at 150 USD/lb through the spotmarket, doesn't mean they need to buy 100% of their uranium needs at 150 USD/lb (example: 100% is 500k lb)\n\nThose are the 3 main reasons why **uranium demand is price INelastic**\n\nUtilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME\n\n**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future\n\nFrom 2011 till end 2017 the global uranium market was in oversupply which created an uranium inventory X (explained in a detailed 30 pages long report of mine in August 2023 where I calculated the creation of inventory X and the consumption of it starting early 2018)\n\nSince early 2018 the global uranium market is in big structural deficit and this structural deficit will continue for the coming years for different reasons which have been consuming that inventory X\n\nBut now that inventory X is mathematically depleted. In previous high season (September 2023 - March 2024) we saw the first impact of that nearing depletion with the uranium spotprice going from 56 USD/lb in August 2023 to 106 USD/lb early February 2024\n\nA good week ago a non-US utility went semi-public by sending an email to different uranium stakeholders in the world because they couldn't find 300,000 lb of uranium for delivery in October 2024. Not a surprise because inventory X is depleted now, and there aren't enough idle uranium productions left in the world to close the supply gap. And those few idle production capacities will take years to get back online.\n\n300,000lb is not even enough to run one 1000 Mwe reactor for 1 year! The total global operational nuclear fleet capacity today is 395,388 Mwe\n\nSo now that that inventory X is depleted, the structural global uranium deficit has to solved with a lot of new production that is't available.\n\nHow come?\n\nDuring 2011-2020 not enough was invested in exploration and development of new uranium deposits, while existing uranium mines are nearing depletion.\n\nAn example: The biggest uranium project in the world is Arrow in Canada, but that projects needs at least 4 years of construction before it can produce the first pound of uranium, and the greenlight for the construction start hasn't been given yet.\n\nThe production start of other smaller uranium projects have been postponed:\n\n* Dasa: postponed by 1 year from early 2025 to early 2026\n* Phoenix: postponed by at least 2 years from 2025 to 2027 at the earliest\n\nWhile producers are producing less than hopped: the majors Cameco, Kazaktomprom, Orano, CGN, Uranium One, ... but also Paladin Energy (2.5Mlb instead of 3.2Mlb planned for 2024)\n\nAnd at the demand side, the last 3+ years a lot of uranium reactors licences have been extended by an additional 20 years and even some by an additional 40 years. But that's a lot of unexpected additional uranium demand that the uranium sector haven't prepared for.\n\n**C.** On Friday Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond\n\nArticle: [https://www.ft.com/content/240af090-8684-49dc-a85e-20b535d62dda](https://www.ft.com/content/240af090-8684-49dc-a85e-20b535d62dda)\n\n\n\nAbout the subsoil Use agreements that are about to be adapte to a lower production level:\n\n[Source: Kazatomprom \\(Kazakhstan\\)](https://preview.redd.it/w6vugzwdiemd1.jpg?width=881&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=255ca458c714a229442d0926c26ae3ff5e23717c)\n\n**Problem is that:**\n\na) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.\n\nHere are the production figures of 2022 (not updated yet, numbers of 2023 not yet added here): [https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production)\n\nb) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?\n\nAll the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, contractually forcing producers to supply more uranium, than they actually produce. And in the future those uranium producers aren't able to increase their production that way.\n\nc) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of the uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!\n\nConclusion:\n\n**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce**. Meaning that they will soon all together try to buy uranium through the illiquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket (Uranium One) has less uranium to sell now.\n\nAnd the less uranium producers deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket themself.\n\nThere is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy a significant volume of uranium in the illiquide spotmarket during the new high season in the uranium sector.\n\nAnd before that production cut announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:\n\npage 10 of this presentation: [https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf)\n\nNote: For that slide on page 10 Cameco used data from UxC, 1 of the 2 sector consultants of all uranium producers and uranium consumers in the world\n\nWith all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\nWe are at the end of the annual low season in the uranium sector. This week we will gradually enter the high season again\n\nIn the low season in the uranium sector the activity in the uranium spotmarket is reduced to a minimum which reduces the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket and the uranium spotprice goes back to the LT uranium price.\n\nIn the high season with an uranium sector being a sellers market (a market where the sellers have the negotiation power) the activity in the uranium spotmarket increases significantly which significantly increases the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket.\n\nNote 1: the uranium spotmarkte is an iliquid market. Sometimes you don't have a transaction for a couple days, so an uranium spotprice not moving each day in the low season is normal. In the high season the number of transactions increase in the uranium spotmarket.\n\nHere a link to the uranium spotprice: [https://numerco.com/NSet/aCNSet.html](https://numerco.com/NSet/aCNSet.html)\n\nHere a link to the Uranium LT price: [https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price)\n\nNote 2: I post this now (at the very end of low season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector. This week we will gradually enter the high season again\n\nFor those interested. No rush.

So insufficient to solve the supply problem.\n\nb) From the known uranium spotsellers Uranium One, Olympic Dam, Sopamin, Navoi through 2 trading firms in Japan and Namibia JV partner.

You can't solve a supply gap due to lower current global uranium production than the anual consumption with uranium from that same current uranium production! The only uranium that could close that gap was uranium of the past, meaning that inventory X that is depleted now.\n\nThe more Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano buy from Uranium One, Olympic Dam, Sopamin, Navoi and Namibia JV Partner, the less utilities will be able to buy from them. This will add 0 lbs of uranium to the supply problem!\n\nc) Imo, the last option is that utilities start to buy as much shares of the 2 physical uranium funds as possible to be able to, but this would push those 2 uranium funds significantly higher. But the uranium sectors take already a big part of the freefloat of those 2 physical uranium funds.

If Lunar Lake is as good as the rumors, it should also work towards encouraging investors that INTC can make a competitive product when the process node is normalized. The downside? Your margins are impacted because TSMC is a monopoly for anything 3nm and below (Samsung fabs are slowly turning into a joke).\n\n5N4Y (5 Nodes in 4 Years) is also critical because after being stuck on 14nm so long, it should at least encourage investors that INTC is serious at making a comeback.
