{"title": "Apple loses EU court battle over 13 billion euro tax bill in Ireland ", "selftext": "Europe‚Äôs top court on Tuesday ruled against Apple in the tech giant‚Äôs 10-year court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland.\n\nThe pronouncement from the European Court of Justice comes hours after Apple unveiled a swathe of new product offerings, looking to revitalize its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod line-ups.\n\nCNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. The company‚Äôs shares were down 1% in premarket trading at 09:07 a.m. London time.\n\nIn 2014, the European Commission, the European Union‚Äôs executive arm, opened an investigation into Apple‚Äôs tax payments in Ireland, the tech giant‚Äôs headquarters in the EU.\n\nThe Commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received ‚Äúillegal‚Äù tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades.\n\nApple and Ireland appealed the Commission‚Äôs decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EU‚Äôs second-highest court anulled the Commission‚Äôs 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage.\n\nThe Commission in turn appealed the General Court‚Äôs decision, sending the litigation up to the ECJ.\n\nThe case, which first began under outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, highlights the continued conflict between U.S. tech giants and the EU, which has sought to tackle issues from data protection to taxation and antitrust.\n\nThis was not the last time that Apple found itself in the EU‚Äôs crosshairs. Most recently, the Commission hit the iPhone maker hit Apple with an antitrust fine of 1.8 billion euro ($1.99 billion) in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\n\nSeparately, the EU‚Äôs sweeping Digital Markets Act has forced companies to change some of their practices in Europe. The Commission has opened various investigations under the DMA into tech giants, including Apple, Alphabet and Meta.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/apple-loses-eu-court-battle-over-13-billion-euro-tax-bill-in-ireland.html", "id": "1fdcraa", "created_utc": 1725956059.0, "score": 859, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 258, "comments": [{"body": "AAPL down more than 1% in pre-market this morning \\~", "score": 198, "replies": [{"body": "That was just after recovering from the 2% it dipped during the presentation.

Europe is facing an \"existential challenge\" due to slowing growth and productivity compared to the US, coupled with new geopolitical and technological pressures.\n\n2. Without major reforms, Europe risks being unable to finance its social model and achieve its ambitions in areas like climate, defense, and technology leadership.\n\n3. Three main areas for action are identified:\n\n   a) Closing the innovation gap, especially in advanced technologies\n   b) Developing a joint plan for decarbonization and competitiveness \n   c) Increasing security and reducing dependencies on other nations\n\n4. Key barriers holding Europe back include:\n   \n   a) Lack of focus and clear priorities\n   b) Inefficient use of common resources\n   c) Poor coordination between national and EU-level policies\n\n5. The report calls for a new industrial strategy to overcome these barriers, including:\n\n   a) Streamlining regulations and the Single Market\n   b) Better coordinating defense and innovation spending\n   c) Reforming decision-making processes to enable faster, more coordinated action\n\n6. Significant public investment will be needed alongside private sector funding. Increasing productivity is seen as key to creating fiscal space for this.\n\n7. Draghi argues Europe must act decisively now, as procrastination has only led to slower growth without preserving consensus. He calls for democratic debate on priorities and trade-offs.\n\n8. The report expresses confidence that the scale of shared challenges will compel European nations to unify and enact bold reforms.\n\nThe overall message is that Europe faces major structural challenges but has the potential to overcome them through coordinated action and reform at the EU level. Draghi portrays this as an urgent necessity to preserve Europe's economic strength and values.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I've been trying to convince my wife to move to Florida for a while.

Therefore, the process can now proceed without re-taping out, as production delays being minimized._\n\n_The report noted that NVIDIA‚Äôs updated version of B200 is expected to be completed by late October, allowing the GB200 to enter mass production in December, with large-scale deliveries to ODMs expected in the first quarter of next year._\n\n_Previously, as per a report from The Information, NVIDIA‚Äôs GB200 was said to be experiencing a one-quarter delay in mass shipments. Another report from the Economic Daily News further suggested that the problem likely lies in the yield rates of advanced packaging, which mainly affected the non-reference-designed GB200 chips._\n\n_Industry sources cited by Commercial Times addressed that NVIDIA‚Äôs Blackwell chip used to be facing instability in metal layers during the HV process, which was then resolved by July._\n\n_In addition, since the issue reportedly occurred in the back-end-of-line process, a new tape-out was deemed unnecessary. Still, as CoWoS-L capacity remains a bottleneck, the advanced packaging for GB200 this year is expected to adopt  CoWoS-S._\n\n~~\n\nWait until Jerome turns on the money printer over the next quarter btw and that $2T sitting on the sidelines enters into the stonk market.
