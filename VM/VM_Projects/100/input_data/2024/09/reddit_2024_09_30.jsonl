If there was competition, then Nvidia would lose share and trust me, companies like Google, Amazon and others would \"happily announce\" all the billions they make with renting their AI HW to customers because that would immediately be seen as positive for the stock value.\n\nThe only competitors we can measure are AMD and Intel. Nvidia is growing faster than both of them combined. It doesnt' matter that AMD has 100% YoY growth on AI GPUs if Nvidia makes more in 1/8 of a quarter there then AMD hopes to do this year and that's with good old Hopper. Blackwell next year will be even more dire for competition. That means, Nvidia grows at their supply capacity increase rate while AMD and Intel don't. TSMC would happily take away some supply from Nvidia and move it to competitors to not become as much dependent on 1 AI HW customer.\n\nA very good indication is that AMD has spoken highly of guidance in AI beginning of the year when Nvidia has had higher lead times. But Nvidia worked of the lead times and H200 beats MI300 on price/performance easily. So what happens is that for 2 quarters (just as H200 ramped in Q2) Lisa Su now is looking for crumbles to increase 2024 guidance by $500m while Nvidia looks to make more than $100b this year. If that trend continues then AMD's DC revenue in 2-3 years will be a rounding error of Nvidia's and we're talking here of EPYC and MI combined!\n\nAMD fans cried that Blackwell delay is AMD's opportunity and meanwhile benchmarks show that the strongest competition for Blackwell is H200/GH200, not MI series by AMD. The memory upgrade of MI325X will not offset the compute + SW combination issue. Nvidia will cannabalize their own products to leapfrog all competition.

Back in 2022, 6 months before ChatGPT, Nvidia showed the $1t TAM with all product lines combined as outlook for the next \"years\" since no timelines was shown. But nowadays, the CEO talks about trillions for DC HW only. That TAM back then in 2022 was only 1/3 of AI DC HW, there were other interesting data points and it was pre-ChatGPT.  As an investor, I remember such things and I re-evaluate that in context of what has developed since then. Back then the TAM seemed a bit crazy but 2.5 years later I can see it shaping more and more.\n\nBack then CEO expected an impact by LLM and he even hinted at ChatGPT in the earnings call prior to the release of ChatGPT. I read that earnings call very carefully because it was fall 2022 and Nvidia dropped to the bottom at -70% from ATH 2021.

{"title": "8 reason to YOLO $NIO today", "selftext": "Alright, guys. Consider this a follow-up to my last NIO post. I bought some Nio call earlier and its printing, I‚Äôm selling off some of my other holdings to ride this trend when the market opens.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxiodau6fvrd1.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=3159fc1099c782241a38b2018765a9c94eab7255\n\nIt might sound crazy, but hear me out‚Äîhere are 8 reasons why I‚Äôm YOLO-ing into NIO right now:\n\n**Fed cutting rates** ‚Äì The Fed‚Äôs already cutting, and they‚Äôre likely to drop another 0.50 at the next meeting with inflation coming down (real or fake numbers, who cares). The golden rule: *Don‚Äôt fight the Fed*‚Äîwhen they cut, the market goes up.\n\n**China stimulus** ‚Äì The Chinese government is throwing out stimulus like crazy. Look at their index‚Äîstocks are limit-up every day. This bull run won‚Äôt be short because China‚Äôs economy is so messed up, they *need* this boost like nana blessing. And the 3 trillion yuan aid package hasn‚Äôt even fully kicked in yet, use your imagination bro.\n\n**Chinese economy recovery** ‚Äì Like I said, this isn‚Äôt a short-term bull. It‚Äôll probably last a year or two. China‚Äôs economy will improve, their purchasing power will go up. I‚Äôve seen posts from Chinese forums‚Äîsome people are making crazy money, like 600k RMB in a day, others upgrading their cars. This will keep happening before the next crash.\n\n**Chinese stocks are dirt cheap** ‚Äì Everything is on the floor. Check your charts and you‚Äôll see how ridiculous the prices are right now.\n\n**NIO is even cheaper** ‚Äì NIO is way down compared to other big Chinese stocks. It‚Äôs been shorted and tanked for so long that even a 50% jump from last month‚Äôs price is still a bargain. And let me remind you, despite being a loss-making company, NIO‚Äôs sales are beating BMW, Benz, and Audi combined in China.\n\n**NIO just got new funding from Anhui state** ‚Äì The last time Anhui invested in NIO (April 2020), the stock shot up from $2 to $60 in a year. This time, even if it just doubles from $6 to $12, it‚Äôs a piece of cake.

The CEO promised all orders placed this year will be delivered by Chinese New Year, which means the next two earnings reports should look pretty sweet.\n\n**A turning point is coming** ‚Äì If 0nvo‚Äôs sales continue to pop off, and NIO maintains their current numbers, they‚Äôll scale production and cut costs. They‚Äôre also planning to launch a mini car brand next year. If all three brands take off, NIO could finally turn a profit. Remember how Tesla skyrocketed once it became profitable? That‚Äôs the kind of potential we‚Äôre talking about here.\n\n------- Adding another reason here -------\n\n**Strong reversal pattern** - Read the self-explanatory screen shot below, $10 is doable\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5w47bzucawrd1.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc3b04db0ce14f133b98013a70a30e6c5e2b0265", "id": "1fsn403", "created_utc": 1727669539.0, "score": 304, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 year ago\n**Total Comments** | 32 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/njg9rpd6r0sd1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ab033c6bf8fd43d660ed225c4e274dbb21931e7\n\nHey guys did I do this rightüò≠üò≠üò≠", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/19o8hfes6wrd1.jpeg?width=2556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4849345b2dee318943f95a873120e58345da5f31\n\nAll in and agree with all your reasons.

I'm a proponent of \"the people,\" being able to take advantage of all that the stock market has to offer.  Particularly the younger generations.  I want most everyone to understand the matter and allow everyone to gamble whatever they can afford to lose on investments that have a real potential to change their lives. \n\nThat said, when someone like you (OP) l takes losses like this, I'm curious if you understand why you lost what you did and how you could have prevented realizing that loss.\n\nIf you brought home as valuable lesson and speak about it , that would be MY loss porn.  I want to know the good honest why and how you realized this loss, and what you learned in the process that could potentially prevent other investors from experiencing this kind of loss. \n\nIt appears to me, your loss was a result of buying high and selling low.  (The opposite of what you want to do obviously). \n\nThe question is, if you buy high again in the future, what will you do to prevent losing your investment. (, Obviously, this doesn't necessarily apply to the higher risk \"options\" trading that many do when they have information that could help guide them towards a winning bet (like sports betting, you find out that, for example, your team has four critical members of the team officially out on medical, it's fairly safe to assume that their secondary players may not have the skillet to replace the other crystal players for the next game against a strong rival team). That's an decent educated gas based on data and basic common sense or logic as your predictor) but I digress.\n\nWhat do you think you could have done to avoid losing the money you lost in this particular \"investment\"\n\nWhat does the word \"investment\"mean to you?  Hopefully it includes the words \"Due diligence\" and \"risk of loss\" as well as hedging your bets with conservative investments that are time proven to grow slowly but surely.  It's possible to make a ton of money quickly, but as you can see, the most risky moves (like options) can often backfire without reliable data and perfect timing.\n\nHow you could have converted this loss into a potential gain or at the very least an eventual \"break even\" situation?  \n\nIf you owned fractional shares, you could have avoided an immediate loss by simply holding your stocks and not selling them at such a deep loss. \n\nBy not selling your shares but rather holding (unless, of course, the stock you purchased was that of a company in dire financial ruin or bankruptcy when you sold your shares) the potential of a return eventually would still exist.\n\nSometimes we all take temporary or even permanent losses (like we do at a casino or any gambling circumstance) depending on our decisions. \n\n Ultimately, you should never gamble money you can't afford to lose.  I'm a bit conservative in that way, but if you're young, you will have the chance to recoup those losses and find better ways of growing your investment portfolio.\n\nBest of luck.  I suggest doing a full post mortem and figure out what you did or didn't do that could have prevented this loss.  Just my $0.02!\n\nüòéüòâ ~Dave", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
