Famously, nuclear power plants don't use much fuel. The cost to build *one* nuclear power plant is about the same as the entire year's volume of uranium sales. The money isn't in the uranium, it's in literally everything else.\n\nBut let's say you expect a spike in uranium prices because of increased demand. Where does that demand come from? New and reactivated power plants, right? Well we don't have very many to reactivate, and it takes a while to do it. And building new ones takes even longer. So you're buying now and *might* see movement in like 5-10 years?\n\nWouldn't it make more sense to invest in the companies that need to build infrastructure to make this shit happen, instead of the thing that only becomes relevant at the very end?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That‚Äôs just extra sentiment.
