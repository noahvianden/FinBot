Then they proceed to destroy them by either: \n\n1. Incorrectly thinking \"this thing has made a lot of money so it will always make a lot of money\" and producing low-quality content that angers loyal fans\n\n2. Setting unrealistic deadlines and pumping out a new movie/season every year that ultimately leads to a repetitiveness that bores people\n\nThey then see that it is not going well and decide to take a classic out of the vault and try to revamp it to dig themselves out of the hole they created from the failed acquisition completely forgetting the old rule \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"  People look forward to the classic remake only to be disappointed because it doesn't live up to the expectations based on a childhood experience remembered through rose-colored glasses.\n\nThe answer? Make NEW content and quit ruining old content.  We didn't need a Lion King remake.  We didn't need a Little Mermaid remake.  The originals were incredible, and people watch them over and over again.  I watched the new Little Mermaid once and haven't felt compelled to rewatch it.  However, I find myself rewatching the old one with my kids, and my kids ask to watch the original more often as well.  Who are better critics than the children who are supposed to be the intended audience?  If a kid asks to watch a cartoon version of something over a live-action remake, that should tell you something about which direction you should push the studios.\n\nBarring a complete financial crisis, the parks will continue to make money.  The peripherals like cruises and excursions will probably have to tighten their belts as they are more affected by macroeconomics.\n\nThe streaming on Disney+ is a disaster.  It isn't intuitive enough, and new parents are trending toward less screentime with their kids as we've all seen how detrimental an iPhone or tablet can be on the development of children.  \n\nIn summary, just quit ruining things that people like and make new things that might become the next classic, but these failed remakes just aren't it.  If you don't believe me, ask any child under the age of 10 if they liked the live-action version of the little mermaid or the classic better and most, maybe not all, but most will say the cartoon.  \n\nThere's a reason why everyone over the age of 30 remembers that Robin Williams was the Genie in Aladdin but only a handful of people remember that Will Smith played the Genie in the new one.  Not even kidding I asked people at work the other day who was the Genie in the new one and everyone sat there thinking until someone had to look it up on their phone.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Forever.

Imagine for a minute you will never get to their theme parks. What if you could get a vr ride on a rollercoaster? What if you never see disney on ice, but can watch it in VR? Star Wars skits in VR? Build a library of that content. Make some of if bundled into Disney streaming. Toss some of it into discreet packages for a low cost. Toss some it out there for free with advertising. Every holiday offer a bit of new content in all three of those categories. You could easily be seeing the equivalent of a mid budget movie every 90 days without having to reinvent the wheel. Most of the content would be VR experiences of existing product. \n\nAs for why I think they should talk to Meta about it... the headsets. Meta has the best entry level set right now and Disney should get with them and drag others along to make those headsets more affordable without sacrificing quality. Get headsets to be the new smart phone that every wants to have. Have the content providers understand they can all make money off of this by providing access to things that are currently out of reach for so many people. Think about all the sporting events you could have front seats at. Think about sitting there watching top bands do a session with a small audience. Imagine getting to sit in the audience for tv game shows. \n\nThen when all that is rolling along every few months Disney rolls out their next holiday special. Perhaps they have some virtual theme park rides for people. Perhaps they have skits with characters kids will love to see. Perhaps they offer princesses to have tea time with little kids and perhaps they offer a peter pan outing with the lost boys. Mix it up with some paid content, some freebies, and some with advertising. Again Disney excels at rolling out experiences. They have that expertise and there is a medium waiting for content that could put more stuff out there close at hand for consumers. \n\nOr they just tinker with the parks and hope to make more money off the next few movies.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Go Woke, Go Broke", "score": -16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Acolyte Season 2", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "üòÇüòÇüòÇ", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Diversity, every show they make has the same 5 characters. \n\nIf the characters dont really care‚Ä¶ how am i supposed to?

McNerney decided not to spend billions of dollars building a new plane to replace the 737. Instead, Boeing tweaked and updated the existing model and called it the 737 Max, outfitting it with larger, more efficient engines for increased economy. Compensating for the resulting instability was a secretive automated system called MCAS that would adjust the plane‚Äôs pitch without input from the pilot.\n\n> McNerney also fought to deeply cut costs. On his watch, the company opened its first non-unionized aircraft production line and initiated a program called ‚ÄúPartnering for Success‚Äù that pushed suppliers to cut their prices by 15 percent or more.

Guys on Harleys, women driving sport/utilities, family types, Gen-Xers and Gen-Yers-the PT always rates a smile, a \"thumbs up,\" or some other positive reaction. We had the Patriot Blue Limited Edition shown in these photographs parked at a restaurant one evening, and an attractive woman in her early 30s walked outside-and hugged it.\"*\n\n[Here's Auto123's review at the time](https://www.auto123.com/en/car-reviews/2000-chrysler-pt-cruiser/46529/):\n\n*\"The four pre-production models of the car that will go on sale in March are swarmed by everyone who sees them, either at that stop or at any other opportunity. Even the couple in the¬†Porsche Boxster¬†pull over to look and touch and finally pronounce it \"cool.\" Well, not everyone is swarming the Cruiser. The couple who are driving the VW New Beetle are not charged up about it, since they are very clearly unhappy about their car being upstaged. But upstaged the Beetle certainly is, and soon enough it slinks away to the notice of absolutely no one except your faithful correspondent, whose job it is to watch things like the torch of automotive fashion being passed around.\"*\n\nThe PT Cruiser was very well loved when it launched.

Boeing union workers just went on strike.\n\nThe Inflation Increasing Act was originally designed to help auto union workers, and now mostly helps hybrid vehicle manufacturing.\n\nDo you think the NACS would not be Tesla if it weren't for the government!?\n\nElon's companies have benefited from government contracts because of the quality and sole existence of their products, not because they are propped up by the US government.\n\nYou and I pay for this stuff through our taxes.

And I agree his companies do all these things very well. \n\nElon is suggesting that the government is conspiring against his companies to exclude them from government contracts by \"tipping the scales\" in favour of the competition. This simply isn't true.\n\nIt's in the government's interest to multi-source contracts for EXACTLY the reason Boeing demonstrated. In this case SpaceX saved the day and will continue to thrive. Had things gone the other way, would you be pissed that SpaceX shit the bed and could possibly lose their contract?\n\nOpen competition is in everyone's best interest. Single-sourcing anything before either company has proven its capabilities to meet contractual benchmarks is foolish. In the case of the ISS de-orbit, SpaceX is the only company with the capability, so the government went with that. \n\nIRA does include hybrids but due to the battery size requirements, there are literally only a couple that are able to take advantage of half the tax credit amount compared to the huge number of pure EVs that are able to realize the full benefit. This directly incentivizes the purchase of a pure EV. It also benefitted Tesla in that it is pretty much the only manufacturer that uses USA-made batteries for their powertrains. This is why so many of their vehicles qualify for the tax credit. The trope about being designed to help union auto workers is lazy and just untrue. Tesla is the most American auto maker in the world and it realizes the most benefit from the IRA out of all the American automakers while being a non-union shop.\n\nRegarding NACS, if it weren't for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill that sought to create a North American Charging Standard, Tesla would have had no reason to make the Tesla connector backwards compatible with the protocols used by CCS (not the connector itself, but the ISO 15188 communication standard). So yes, without this legislation, the old Tesla connector and standard would not have been adopted as NACS.\n\n>Elon's companies have benefited from government contracts because of the quality and sole existence of their products, not because they are propped up by the US government.\n\nIsn't this the way it should be? The product should shine through on its own merits.  If it doesn't, Tesla would be in Boeing's shoes right now.

Not sure why you're asking that question, tbh.\n\n>Until another company can demonstrate rockets that can land, SpaceX deserves 100% of government money and any \"backup\" option should just be another SpaceX option\n\nThat's easy to say now that we are in 2024 and SpaceX won the race. When the contracts were awarded, there was incentive to dual-source in case one didn't work out. Again, if SpaceX had failed with Dragon and Boeing succeeded, Boeing could have gobbled up the resultant business of that contract.  Remember, this was a fixed price contract (although Boeing received more). Boeing didn't deliver and was way over budget. They fucked themselves while SpaceX differentiated themselves with success and cost effectiveness. Had SpaceX failed and Boeing succeeded, would people be saying Boeing failed because they cost more? Of course not, the end result would have been a crew resupply vehicle that worked regardless. Going forward, I totally agree that SpaceX should get the contracts, but back when the competition for new a new crew vehicle was started, no one knew the outcome. \n\nSpaceX emerged from a level field of competition...as it should be. Reusability of their technology and lower per launch costs demonstrated by Falcon9 meant they were given less than Boeing which used an expendable launch vehicle. Elon signed the contract willfully and ended up proving his solution works and works safely. Boeing failed.

It's government, not everything is going to make sense, but for the most part, the money has gone towards the right companies - namely Elon's when he's proven to do things better.\n\nMy overall point was that on the whole, Elon and his companies have been extremely beneficial of government contracts in general. His assertion that the government is constantly pressing on the scales to favour the competition just isn't true and it just screams of sour grapes when something doesn't go his way.

Obviously the Russians are prioritising their current advances over Kursk, but that goes to show their lack of reserves. \n\nNo one can win this war with a total victory imo so both sides will have to compromise (which is perhaps why Ukraine has gone for Kursk, to force Russian concessions at the negotiating table)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I dont know why you're still holding this belief that Russia's goal is to take all of Ukraine.  There is abundant evidence going back to the start of it that Russia's goals are to boot them from Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia.  Lavrov and Putin have said as much dozens of times now.  Yet some people still think the goal is all of Ukraine.  They're well on their way to achieving those aims, BTW.  \n\nPerhaps you're referring to the other stated goal of removing the Zelensky government \"Denazification\".  I think removal of Zelensky's government, is well under way and I will reiterate as I've said in the past that he either flees, is killed, or is killed by his own people and I think that's inevitable.  \"Denazification\" is a little more nebulous and is probably something negotiation terms will be flexible with.  \n\nPlease don't be one of the suckers that thinks the Ukrainian invasion into Kursk is any kind of game changer.

There may yet be something in store, but the chances of that are fading fast and maybe 10% or so.  \n\nI again remind the entire audience that wars are hard.  Especially when escalation management and reigning forces in from their fullest capability is a big part of the equation.

It‚Äôs too late to gateshift now, it‚Äôs clear from the outset Russia was pursuing maximalist aims - of course now those have failed its fallen back to just wanting the land it has mostly taken already.\n\nAnd of course it‚Äôs not practical for Ukraine to keep Kursk long-term.

If Tesla released it in its current form to the rest of the fleet, there would be a collective WTF from users after seeing how poorly it performs and how little it has progressed in half a year.

Tesla won't release it to the fleet until there's a version that is tangibly better in feel and capabilities than all previous versions so it can \"wow\" users once again and lead to further subs/sales. Therein seems to lie the problem as their Hail Mary for HW3 vehicles is to emulate HW4 optimizations in software. Will it work? Tesla seems to think so, but it hasn't worked yet.

Yes, people stop using it - like I have with 12.4.3 - but also the people who claim intervention-free drives refuse to disengage and send data points for scenarios that are obviously failures. For example, turning right from a left lane like in one of Omar's videos. Or missing navigation turns altogether. Or consistently driving under the speed limit to the chagrin of drivers behind you. All of these things should be reported but aren't in the interest of achieving that \"perfect\" drive.

Like, day-to-day variances in traffic, weather, lighting, camera cleanliness and driver's mood can all lead to different perceptions on different days.

{"title": "OpenAI Released a New Model GPT-o1 That Only Allows 35 Messages Per Week Because It Thinks - It Also Hasn't Been Trained With All Data", "selftext": "Ladies and Gentleman there cannot be a larger buy signal than this. The fact that this model requires so much power it has to be limited to 35 messages per week is incredible. I am driving this one point because it is a clear throughput situation. \n\nAlso, the information cutoff is October 2023 which tells me this isn't the new massive model they are releasing. So, what does this all mean? \n\nIt means they released a new capability which uses much more compute but isn't technically perhaps their new monster model that is trained on trillions of parameters. If this was a new model I would expect the cutoff date to be much more recent. At least 3-6 months would have made more sense. Now, there is time between training and cutoff time but I don't think they've been sitting with a model that has been trained for over a year ago. A newer, more recent model must be sitting there for use but can't. \n\nWhat this all suggest to me is that they are currently massively GPU constrained at the moment and waiting desperately for Blackwell. What you would expect is massively more throughput for GPT-o1 and you eventually have to expect a newer more massive model that is fundamentally better at the core. \n\nJoanne Jang from OpenAI tweeted this. \n\n>\"There's a lot of o1 hype on my feed, so I'm worried that it might be setting the wrong expectations. what o1 is: the first reasoning model that shines in really hard tasks, and it'll only get better.
