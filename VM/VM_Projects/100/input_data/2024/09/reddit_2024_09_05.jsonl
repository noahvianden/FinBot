This moment is not now obviously. Because having products is the focus. But it will come.\n* Nvidia has to insanely beat expectations to match its market value earning after earning. In fact, for Nvidia to have 2.5T of market cap, you are betting that it will have 250B of free cash flow in 10 years (rough number pulled out of my ass where you sum the FCF of a decade, but don't discount it nor expect it instantly because you assume they will keep growing even after a decade).
