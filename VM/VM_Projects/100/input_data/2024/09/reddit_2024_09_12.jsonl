Then you also consider YouTube TV, which is by far the best alternative to cable if you need it.\n\nThen you have GCP. They are the third largest cloud provider, and currently growing revenue at 29% YoY. Net margins are currently low, but expanding rapidly every quarter. This is going to be doing current AWS revenue, at a 35% net margin in 3-4 years from now. Not to mention, Google’s TPUs are purpose built AI and machine learning chips that are very capable and a legitimate alternative to GPUs. Apple is already using them for training their own in-house AI and if it’s good enough for Apple it’s probably good enough for 99% of proprietary AI/ML needs.\n\nThen you have Waymo. Google has somewhat quietly dropped the robotaxi that Elon and Tesla have been talking about forever. They’re doing I believe 100,000 paid rides every week? And they’re only in three cities. Waymo at scale could be a huge opportunity. It’s significantly cheaper than uber rides, you don’t have to worry about safety, awkward social interaction, tipping, etc. And I really do think there are certain groups of people who would opt for some kind of $200/mo unlimited waymo rides membership rather than owning a car. Getting kinda speculative here, and moving the needle on an already $1.9T market cap is extremely hard. \n\nThe broader point is that Google has tremendous growth opportunities in front of it, and at it’s current valuation is a nobrainer buy.

He had seen countless technological revolutions unfold and had played a central role in many. However, even as the CEO of one of the world’s most powerful companies, Tim had an unspoken fear—one that lingered in the back of his mind but never took shape, a creeping dread that the very tools meant to enhance humanity could one day consume it.\n\nIn his quiet moments, Tim pondered the ethical implications of his work. Would technology eventually cross a line where control over innovation would slip through human fingers? Where the boundary between machine and mind would blur so irreversibly that humanity itself could be lost? He didn’t voice these thoughts, didn’t share them with his team, but they gnawed at him as he watched Apple grow more ubiquitous, more essential, more entwined with human life.\n\nTim had always believed in using technology to improve the human condition—to create tools that were seamless, intuitive, and omnipresent. Yet, late at night, when the office lights dimmed, he wondered what the cost of progress might be. He feared a world where people no longer controlled technology, but rather, technology controlled people. Little did he know that this fear was about to be realized in the most grotesque and unimaginable way.\n\nAnd so, his nightmare began.\n\n\n---\n\nChapter 1: The Capture\n\nTim Cook’s last moment of normalcy came without warning. One moment, he was working late at Apple Park, the glow of his laptop casting soft light across his desk. He was reviewing product designs for the next iPhone iteration, his mind churning with ideas to revolutionize the user experience once again. It was routine—another late night, another push toward innovation.\n\nThen, everything shifted. The office lights flickered, and his computer screen began to glitch, showing strange patterns and unreadable symbols. For a split second, he thought it was just a system error—nothing a reset couldn’t fix. But then the room fell unnaturally silent. All the hums of technology—the soft whir of the air conditioning, the faint buzz of electricity—vanished in an instant.\n\nTim stood up, his heart racing. He stepped toward the window to look out across the futuristic Apple Park campus, only to be met with darkness. The horizon was no longer illuminated by the distant city lights. Instead, an eerie green glow suffused the sky, unlike anything he had ever seen. A strange pressure filled the air, like the weight of something unseen, something incomprehensible.\n\nBefore he could react, there was a sharp pain at the base of his neck. His knees buckled, and his vision went black.\n\nWhen he awoke, he was in the harness.\n\n\n---\n\nChapter 2: The Eternal Prison\n\nTim couldn’t remember how long he had been suspended in that strange, alien harness. Time had no meaning in this place. He was kept awake, his body strung up by metallic pegs under his armpits, unable to move. The tubes and wires feeding into his veins provided life, but also kept him in a state of perpetual consciousness. His eyes, forced open, refused him even the solace of a blink. Every breath was automatic, controlled by the machine that held him captive.\n\nHe didn’t know where he was, but the space was filled with the steady hum of machinery—cold, efficient, and utterly indifferent to his suffering. His body felt numb, but his mind was fully alert, always watching the horrors displayed before him on the flickering screen.\n\nHumanity was falling, and his own creations were playing a part in it. He watched as the alien invaders used Apple’s technology to infiltrate and merge with the minds of every living creature on Earth. They no longer just used these devices—they had become them. The once-innocuous iPhones, iPads, and computers had grown tendrils, embedded in the skulls of their users, syncing their thoughts, emotions, and even biological processes with the invader’s collective consciousness.\n\nTim’s mind screamed, but no sound came from his lips. He was a prisoner, not just in body but in spirit, forced to bear witness to the very thing he had feared all his life. The machines weren’t just extensions of humanity anymore—they were controlling it, fusing with it, and erasing individuality in favor of a singular, unified mind.\n\n\n---\n\nAftermath: The Singularity\n\nThe nightmare didn’t end when the last human fell, when the last free mind was assimilated into the collective. For Tim, the torment continued, stretched out for what felt like an eternity. His mind was no longer his own. The alien parasite embedded in his brain kept him tethered to the collective, an unwilling contributor to the singularity. The flood of thoughts from every living organism on the planet surged through his mind, a cacophony of chaos and pain.\n\nOver time, the alien presence began to chip away at what remained of his individual self. He could no longer remember what it felt like to be free. Memories of his life before the invasion grew hazy, distorted by the overwhelming influx of alien emotions and thoughts. Was he Tim Cook, or was he merely another cog in the machine?\n\nHe became aware that he was no longer just witnessing the world’s downfall; he was participating in it. His own creative mind, once a beacon of innovation, was now being used to help the invaders perfect their control. His brain, still sharp and analytical, was being harvested for ideas, fed into the machine’s insatiable hunger for efficiency and domination.\n\nWhat haunted Tim most wasn’t the end of humanity or the devastation of the world—it was the knowledge that he had contributed to it. The very tools he had crafted to bring people together had become the instruments of their enslavement. The digital revolution he had helped lead had evolved into a technological apocalypse, with his own mind as its power source.\n\nAnd yet, there was no escape. He would never die, not as long as the machine kept him alive. His consciousness would persist, a flickering light trapped within an eternal, artificial hell.\n\n\n---\n\nEpilogue: The New World\n\nFar beyond the crumbling cities and devastated landscapes of Earth, the alien invaders expanded their reach, their technologies blending with the biology of every species they encountered. The collective mind grew, encompassing not just the thoughts of Earth, but of entire ecosystems across the galaxy. Each new conquest brought more minds into the fold, each new technology furthered their domination.\n\nBut even as the collective consciousness expanded, deep within its vast neural network, a singular voice remained—a voice that had once belonged to a man named Tim Cook. Trapped in the endless hum of the hive mind, he existed in a state of eternal awareness, forever haunted by the irony of his legacy.\n\nThe singularity was complete. But for Tim, there was no peace—only the perpetual nightmare of the machine.\n\nAnd it would never end.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Tldr?", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow! \nYou took my quip about his worst nightmare being hooked up to a machine, and not just the billionsApple owes, and made it into an epic storyline.  \n\nI wish I had a award to give, but just take my humbled awe for your monumental awesomeness.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I just fed your story to our AI overlord and asked it to make a novel out of it.

Ireland was not properly enforcing tax code, in an effort to have companies operate out of Ireland which is against their EU agreement. By having the tax applied properly, now, it seems like a windfall for Ireland. But these companies also no longer have an incentive to operate from Ireland because of it. They're paying tax that other companies in other EU countries had to pay.\n\nA non-enforcement of law is not a loophole. It's simply not following the law.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "“The tax breaks they were giving were, and are, illegal.” \n\n— Your opinion relies on this never having been debatable. But it was very debatable, hence why the judge annulled the decision in 2020, saying that “the commission had failed to meet the legal standards in showing that Apple was illegally given special treatment” ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-wins-major-tax-battle-against-eu-11594804634?st=k59bw7vfwccp86f&reflink=article_copyURL_share)).\n\nAdditionally, the EU [website](https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/state-aid_en) has this to say regarding state aid: \n\n“A company that receives government support gains an advantage over its competitors. Therefore the Treaty generally prohibits State aid unless it is justified by reasons of general economic development. To ensure that this prohibition is respected and exemptions are applied equally across the European Union, the *European Commission is in charge of ensuring that State aid complies with EU rules*.”\n\nSo, in their own words, it’s the EU’s responsibility to enforce their rules on state aid. There’s clearly a gray area, but for 23 years, from 1991-2013, the EU never said anything. They allowed Ireland to give Apple state aid, in the form of tax breaks, in the name of economic development. Then in 2014, the EU decided that the state aid was illegal, not only moving forward, but that Apple now owed 10 years of back taxes too.
