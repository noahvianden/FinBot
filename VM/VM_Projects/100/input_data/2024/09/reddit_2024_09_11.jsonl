It's inevitable and will lead to a new breakout bull run of new highs and no one wants to miss that.\n\nThe only question is when that future will be close enough and the timing clarified enough on ramp timing for it to begin pricing it in before it happens.\n\nlt's entirely possible that NVDA is range bound until Q4 (or even Q1) earnings are approaching - that would require markets as a whole to be range bound, which would require economic data to keep deteriorating. \n\nI have no crystal ball and this is a throwaway Reddit comment, but my hypothesis is that economic data will stabilize in the slow consistent growth mode it did during the 2010s where growth, jobs and inflation were stable and just below desired, which allowed for a dovish Fed and a decade long bull market.\n\nMarkets are uneasy right now because they're forward looking and worried that the data trend will continue deteriorating. However, there's a lot of tailwind that will keep data better than a default scenario - the CHIPS Act, infrastructure and climate spending, and lower oil prices put money in the pockets of people and most companies across the globe. \n\nEvery recession in the last 60 years (except the Dot Com bubble) was preceeded by a sustained spike in oil prices and we have not had that. It's a really good gauge of whether industrial civilization has enough calories to grow. If it doesn't, prices rise until the weakest link in the economic chain buckles. It's something different that breaks each time, but the spike in global energy costs that preceed the crisis is consistent.\n\nI am not a perpetual optimist by any measure, but the guaranteed back stops of infrastructure spending, lower/stable oil prices and a dovish Fed (which drives interest rate policies globally) make it less likely that a recession is at hand and more likely that post-COVID growth is settling down back into the consistently slow and positive growth environment of the 2010s.\n\nMy prognosis is that we've experienced a healthy bull market correction and consolidation before the next leg.

Here are some key distinctions:\n\nInformed Decision Making:\n\nOptions Trading: Successful options traders often rely on extensive research, analysis, and strategies to make informed decisions. They use financial models, market data, and technical analysis to predict price movements and manage risk.\nGambling: While some gambling activities can involve skill (e.g., poker), many rely heavily on chance, with outcomes that are largely unpredictable and not based on analysis or research.\nPurpose and Approach:\n\nOptions Trading: Typically involves a strategic approach to either generate returns, manage investment risk, or hedge against price movements in other investments. Traders often have a clear investment thesis and risk management strategies.\nGambling: Primarily done for entertainment or the thrill of winning, without necessarily involving a long-term financial strategy or risk management plan.\nRisk Management:\n\nOptions Trading: Involves implementing strategies to manage risk, such as setting stop-loss orders, using spreads, or diversifying a portfolio. Traders aim to control their exposure to potential losses.\nGambling: Often lacks structured risk management, with participants potentially wagering amounts they cannot afford to lose.\nRegulation and Transparency:\n\nOptions Trading: Conducted on regulated exchanges with transparent pricing, standardized contracts, and oversight to ensure fair practices.\nGambling: While regulated in many jurisdictions, it often lacks the same level of transparency and standardization found in financial markets.\nOutcome Analysis:\n\nOptions Trading: Involves analyzing past trades and adjusting strategies based on market conditions and performance metrics.\nGambling: Typically doesn’t involve such analysis, as outcomes are less predictable and more influenced by randomness.\nWhile both activities involve risk, options trading is generally seen as a more calculated and strategic approach to investing, whereas gambling is more associated with risk-taking for entertainment without a long-term financial strategy.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I only need to see where it shows me the outcome is certain and there is no risk and uncertainty, but it clearly starts off by saying both involve risk. \n\nRisk and uncertainty means there is a gamble.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "There is no strategy on the planet that is without risk.
