{"title": "The Chinese stock market is notching its strongest weekly gain since 2014.", "selftext": "The CSI300 is up by 12.4% this week so far, which is its strongest weekly gain since December 2014 (+13.4%). By the end of the day, it could be strongest weekly gain since 2008. I know we hate investing in China in this sub, but there might be a point for adding a bit of China back into your portfolio today. There are two main investment theses:\n\n1. The Chinese consumer is not financially weak, they are simply sentiment driven.\n2. Chinese government support for the market is sending the signal for retail investors to invest.\n\n**Point 1:** Context for today's environment. Chinese stock market pessimism reached peak in February 2024 as it appeared the government was not keen to provide policy support. This was a mistake in messaging by the CCP. Chinese investing culture is extremely different from the US. While US markets are more sophisticated and fundamental driven - Chinese investors are HIGHLY sentimental. Western media blames the collapse of real estate for the past 2-years of market underperformance, this is true, but not because its hurting Chinese people's financial health. It's the severing of trust in the government (that they would bail out the real estate firms and save the people's money and investment properties) that is the problem. The Chinese gross savings ratio sits at \\~44%  - unlike US consumers and investors (US personal savings rate is 3%) who CAN'T spend if the market collpases, the Chinese are simply choosing not to consume or invest. \n\nSo what does all this mean? It means the CCP needs to send the strongest possible message to the Chinese people that it will support the market and help the property industry. It doesn't actually have to do anything like a massive bailout, but it needs to be performative and convincing - like the Fed is in the US. Once sentiment swings positive, all that unallocated capital floods right back into the market - especially if it becomes a 'government-approved' medium. \n\n**Point 2:** And that's exactly what the CCP has done in the past week. It TELEVISED a PBOC announcement on a range of (tbh low-impact) fiscal policies. Then XJP called for an \"emergency\" politburo meeting to implement \"forceful\" rate cuts and support for real estate. They even allowed state-owned-entities (basically government fund managers) to borrow from the PBOC just to buy and prop up broad market indices. This is hugely sentiment swinging. The CCP is essentially saying to its people that \"you can invest safely, we are going to prioritise the market\", and retail is responding. \n\nThe fact that the Chinese market might be having its strongest weekly gain since 2014 is pretty convenient because this coincides with the 2014 bubble when the Chinese government incentivised its citizens to invest in the market - a similar environment to today. What happened then:\n\n1. The CSI almost DOUBLED between late 2014 to mid-2015. \n2. It caused one of the biggest bubbles and crashes in Chinese market history.\n\nIMO if the market is headed for a V-shape recovery, China does not appear to be a long-term play. But there is a lot to be gained from the compressed spring that is Chinese equities rn. China Tech is arguably their strongest suite of stocks (fundamentally) and they have been going absolutely gangbusters over this week. I see strong upside over a 1-year time horizon, with downside risk being political tensions w/ US and CCP failure to follow through with policy support. I would reduce portfolio exposure approaching 2021 stock market peaks in the case of market exuberance. The ideal scenario is a slow-down or even correction to allow for more sustainable recovery. In which case, corrections represent compelling entry-points.\n\n(Disclosure: 55% of my portfolio is in HK and I am up 15% over 1 week.)", "id": "1fqe95d", "created_utc": 1727406390.0, "score": 238, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "When’s the dump?", "score": 141, "replies": [{"body": "soon as you buy", "score": 127, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds accurate.

Lower job openings and Higher unemployment will lead to even less demand and lower inflation moving forward.\n\nIf the Fed cut by 200 bps and announced stimulus checks, then yes it would say probably not a good idea at this point. But a 50 bps is gonna do nothing to reignite inflation at this point.\n\nEdit: I’ll add, inflation is either going to come from a decrease in supply or increase in demand when you boil it down. We had massive supply chain issues during Covid, which have since been resolved, hence one of the reasons why inflation came crashing down so fast. Inflation doesn’t ONLY come from companies raising prices, it also takes a consumer to be willing to buy those goods at higher prices. The consumer is showing they are no longer willing to pay higher prices and are being much more choosy on the products they are buying relative to the price. Countless companies are loosing pricing power and saying in their earnings reports they can’t pass the cost along to consumers anymore. So supply has been fixed, demand has been fixed, this is why inflation is trending so fast back to the Fed’s preferred 2% goal. The Fed and Jerome Powell have also said numerous times if you wait till inflation is actually at 2% before cutting you’ve waited too long, which I 100% agree with since the rate cuts and hikes work with long and variable lags and take time to have an effect on the economy.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "He's a doomer.

{"title": "'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition'", "selftext": "* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.\n* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.\n\n  \nWith just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.\n\n\n\n**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.\n\n\n\nWith Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.\n\n\n\nJohnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.\n\n\n\nWhile the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.\n\n\n\nJohnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**\n\n  \nData reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:\n\n* Waymo: 17,311 miles\n* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles\n* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles\n* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles\n\nThe **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  \n\n\n**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”\n\n  \nAccording to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.\n\nFuture Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.\n\n\n\nIn premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30\n\n  \nSource: [benzinga.com](https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/41047267/safety-disaster-tesla-fsd-galaxies-away-from-being-anywhere-close-to-competition-says-bearish-analys)", "id": "1fqk8k6", "created_utc": 1727431479.0, "score": 264, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "*Fully supervised driving*", "score": 179, "replies": [{"body": "My gf in the passenger seat already does this.

Have not taken it on large Hwy/Interstate yet, only country roads, county highways, and rural city streets.\n\nFirst run was a 30min drive through 3 towns and 4 roundabouts. Then travel back on same route.\nRoundabouts were handled very well, car only fully stopped when was needed. Otherwise maintained a moving roll/creep to keep traffic flowing, signal intent, just like a human would. Two times though it came up to the roundabout at too high of a speed. It actually had to use it brakes in addition to regenerative braking. Was just like a human who was not paying attention and \"whoops\" gotta jam on the brakes. I let it do that, no one behind us, and it otherwise did just fine. One time while in a roundabout with two traffic lanes, it was in the center circle when a car entered into the outer circle. It did not read the other vehicles intent soon enough and gave a sharp jab on the brakes, not fully stopping, but just playing it super safe. I tapped the accelerator and all was fine from there.\n\nIt still has trouble getting up to full speed all the time. Many times after intersections or roundabout it will hit 40-41mph and just hold there when it has seen the 45mph sign and the screen shows the 45mph image. Same for 55. Also same for adjusted cruise speeds, does not get up to the final speed without driver giving the accelerator a press.\n\n\nStandout items: on a two lane county hwy there was was wrecker on the right side of the road straddling the white line, half way into the traffic lane. Behind it was a car with a flat on the road side of the vehicle and 3 people were standing there. Oncoming traffic was solid cars one after another. But those cars were being polite and were straddling the white line on their side so there was room for our lane to pass in the center.  The Tesla slowed from 35 to 30 and then crossed over the center double yellow line and went around without a hitch. Just as smooth as I would have done.\n\n\nAnother time, in town, there was a car in front of us turning left across traffic in the middle of a block. To the right of the car there was space adjacent for street parking before the curb. It was not marked for being a traffic lane. on a whim I hit the turn signal as we approached the stopped car that was turning. The Tesla moved over and shot the gap between the car and curb, about a foot of clearance on each side, and returned to center afterwards without any input.\n\n\nNo disengagements at all, only driver input on accelerator and turn signal. This run previously would incur at least 4-5 disengagements previously.\n\nStrong solid improvements in this iteration. Very exciting!\n\n\nASS: I only tried this once so far and gave it quite the challenge.  It was a grass field temporary parking lot. Almost all the other cars were gone.  You could see the blue nav path on the screen and it was crazy jaggy as the car was trying to read a path from the vehicle tracks in the grass. It began moving but stopped after about 30ft. It was not happy trying to navigate in location without any markings whatsoever. I was impressed with its valiant effort to read the vehicle wheel marks in the grass.\n\nLooking forward to trying in regular parking lots.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I have the same speed control issues on my HW3 vehicle.

{"title": "Tesla more like Deadsla", "selftext": "Hello fellow regards and thank you for coming to my Tesla talk. Today I am going to explain the bear case for TSLA in the short term\n\n1. I’m not a super technical trader/indicator freak, but TSLA is currently near or above overbought territory on every RSI timeframe, including 1mo, 3mo, 1y, and 5y. This can be explained by the hype surrounding delivery numbers, upcoming robotaxi event, and earnings. RSI is not the end all be all for a stock’s price but it’s good to note\n\n2. TSLA has been on a tear recently as investors are pricing in good delivery numbers, a successful robotaxi announcement, and good earnings. All it takes is ONE of these events to go poorly and investors will panic\n\n3. ROBOTAXI EVENT - this will probably be the biggest influence in the stock price for the short term, and I don’t think it will go well. Apart from Tesla’s history of screwing up announcements (see 6% drop after cybertruck fail), I simply don’t think Tesla has the technology to compete with Waymo, the main competitor for this type of product. Waymo is backed by google, a HUGE cloud storage provider. This means they’re able to train their models with more data, more TPU infrastructure, and a better AI team. Tesla, on the other hand, uses a vision-only model that requires a MASSIVE amount of data to be stored in places they don’t have. This is shown in their latest FSD versions, which experience about 180 miles per critical error. For reference, human drivers experience about 100,000 miles per critical error and Waymo is at 17,000. Unless Tesla is prepared to unleash some magical new tech stack that they’ve been hiding for some reason, I don’t think they have the tech to release a safe robotaxi to compete with Google. Safety is huge in the driverless car space, because most consumers are already on the fence about being a passenger in one. One misstep in the rollout and TSLA bears would have a field day. I also think that Elon is too full of himself to admit some of these things, so he would happily march out a product that isn’t ready for the public to use rather than acknowledge Tesla’s FSD shortcomings\n\n4. Future events - the nice thing about delivery numbers, robotaxi event, and earnings being in a span of a few weeks is that IV shouldn’t be a huge factor until after everything is all said and done, and you could probably make money buying puts OR calls before the robotaxi event and simply selling the volatility. \n\nObviously nobody can predict how earnings will go, but I think one of the main reasons investors give for Tesla’s ridiculous PE is its market share, advanced technology, and production ability in the EV space. While I still think it has some upside for those reasons, I think other EV companies are chipping away at all 3. You can go on google right now and find open source code that performs nearly as well as Tesla’s FSD and vision models.\n\nTL;DR - I think there is more downside opportunity than upside with Tesla, and I think bad performance in upcoming numbers and events will tank the stock that has risen 25% in the last month\n\nPositions: \n10x $230p 10/11\n5x $240p 10/11\n5x $240p 10/18\n2x $250p 10/18", "id": "1fqy99e", "created_utc": 1727471483.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 week ago\n**Total Comments** | 8 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 8 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "260 and breaking 🤣", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "You were saying?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I'm thinking it will move back up near 225-230 then I'm going to grab puts for earnings.
