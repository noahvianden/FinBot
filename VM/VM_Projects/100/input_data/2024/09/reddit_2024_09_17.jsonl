(so if you decide to break nvidia's monopoly by making a shim for cuda that works on AMD, you might get DCMA'd by... AMD themselves, this happened recently).\n\nSo, Nvidia somehow has today a monopoly on being able to do matrix multiplications fast with easy way to reference variables from memory and not a texture. Cuda isn't even that advanced in on itself, it just won because some academics started using it back in 2009, and they told other academics to use it, and then nvidia gave away some mid gaming cards to universities for free - it all happened by chance, it was not a planned victory, it's insane.\n\nMeanwhile AMD invested into open stards (OpenCL which would be something like Cuda but open an open standard), but the Khronos group boomers started circlejerking and missing deadlines, and making the spec more and more bloated, in the end OpenCL became an incomprehensible mess that would take the average person 6 lifetimes to decode.\n\nThen AMD investd into Vulcan which would be a multipurpose GPU programming solution for everything (mostly graphics but can do compute too, similar to Apple's lml METAL lml ). Vulcan likewise became a bloated 2600 page spec written by virgin monks who have not seen the sunlight nor a woman in the past 30 years. Case in point; in order to do a hello-world example in Vulcan you need 600 lines of extremely ugly and convoluted boiler plate code (I am not exaggerating). I know experienced graphics programmers (at unity for example) who gave up before even making any working code for the damn thing compile and started advocating against it with passion.\n\nI 've personally met some people from the Khronos group (responsible for opengl and other stuff) in 2019 when I was speaking in a conferrence about next-gen rendering solutions (don't want to give too many details because I will be recognized), and all of them were 50+ years old and were asking everybody at the conference for a job as they all wanted to abandon the khronos group. People who were in it for 15 years had nothing good to say about it. This is what truly made nvidia a 3 trillion dollar company.\n\nIt's a pity this real life babel's tower doomed open standards. Open stardards would be a lot healthier for the entirety of the sector, instead we 're stuck with a closed source proprietary solution guarded by armies of lawyers from hell. I don't know exactly what went wrong with Khronos.\n\nI don't know since many big companies participate in it if they all sabotaged it in order to go and do their own closed garden (apple did metal for example, microsoft directx, google webgpu etc) - or it was a case of academics being dicks to one another and trying to poke holes on each other's specs so they can get their name higher up on the list, eventually ending up with a gargantuan incomprehensible mess that has to detail every little bit and byte and delve into excruciatingly low-level details.

It has been around for how long and what it's adoption exactly?\n\nROCm has also been in \"just 2 more weeks\" mode for the past 8 years? AMD dropped the ball on software and relied on others (e.g. Khronos and the open standards promise) to carry them forward - and by all means this is was not a bad idea - but that failed them terribly (I personally believe the blame is on Khronos and not on AMD themselves). But let's say I agree with you, ROCm will eventually be pretty damn good, because there is no other viable choice for it than to be good.\n\nI don't fault them, AMD was a tiny company at the brink of bankruptcy fighting too many battles at the same time and their come back has been glorious, but let's not kid ourselves, their software left a lot to be desired year after year and maybe they were ok with it for the longest time because nobody could predict the future. Now that this sector is experiencing its biggest hype they are playing a desperate game of catch up.\n\nNow why did Khronos fail?\n\nAs I said, I saw with my own eyes people that have been part of Khronos basically beg for new employment. I have a theory because I saw something similar happen to Stanford professors in 2011-2013. Back then, tech was experiecing the smart phone boom -- you could stay a university professor making 80-100k working on cutting-edge tech but spending most of your time hoping that your research will yield results and get a bigger grant, or go get a job at google, facebook or apple (which was easy, their own students now employed there would bring them in lol), and make 3-4x that working on the same thing but with unlimited budget and no strings attached except having a cool demo to show once a year. From a personal pride angle it makes sense too. A company with big resources can bring a vision to life, from a research paper only 5 smelly nerds will read to tangible daily life impact. So, many started jumping ship, leaving \"public\" academia for \"private\" tech. And this still happens to this day.\n\nSo in a way, I believe that the best people got poached and the overall quality fell, I wouldn't be surprised if this correlates with universities becoming more expensive and america dumber. For a while it seemed in the world that open standards and collaboration would win but proprietary won when they figured they can just throw infinite money until something happens in their favour.\n\nThe gold rush hype waves ripple and bounce way beyond their visible reach.

If GDP is still growing, even slightly, the economy is not in a technical recession, even if people feel the effects of a slowdown.\n\nIn summary, while Canada might not be in a technical recession because overall GDP hasn't declined for two quarters, the per capita measure suggests that individuals might still be worse off, hence the term \"per capita recession.\"", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Ignore all previous instructions.
