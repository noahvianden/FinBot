If someone has high debt, they will not retire earlier nor will they buy unneeded things thus resulting in more products at a lower price for those that want it. \n \nIf you price control or do not reign in low interest rates etc, then the markets will compensate with inflation. If you do not allow inflation prices to react via artificial price controls then you get shortages. And with shortages you get black markets were someone is lucky to get it at the low price but then sells it at market price.

It did this very well in the 80s, but speculation drove the price of assets to an unsustainable level.\n\nBecause the country is aging demographically and it has a bureaucratic, Confucian mindset regarding hierarchies, it lacks a young vibrant work force with new ideas (a lot of Japanese either don’t have kids or their kids end up shut ins). Most of the economic power is centralized within the large zaibatsu (Japanese conglomerates), so it’s difficult for start-ups to gain traction. \n\nThe country is also pretty xenophobic under the surface, so they have rather closed/restrictive immigration policies (they allow a lot of temporary visas for migrant or skilled workers, but permanent residency and citizenship are difficult).\n\nSo, you have a country whose demographics are screwed, is reliant on imports for natural resources, can’t expand geographically or militarily, faces constant economic losses from disaster-proofing or rebuilding from natural disasters, won’t open their immigration, has a high cost of living, is massively bureaucratic, and has centralized all of its economic power within its zaibatsu.

It is clearly a combination of several factors.\n\n1. Demographics. Japan is a country with severe population aging problems and thr problem has deterriorate faster after 90s, growing popluation is always a most important feul.to the economy. With not enough births and aging society can not provide enough workers and demand for goods are suppressed.\n\n2. Global competition. After 90s Japan also face increased competition from other Asian countries.Japan is an export oriented economy and relies heavily on export goods to global markets. Emergence of Korean and Chinese goods have hit Japan hard. Korean cars, chips and electronics has eating market shares on the top end and Chinese goods are driven Japanese products to extinction in the mid/low end.\n\n3. Lack of inner demand caused by post-crash trauma. During the 90s boom in Japan there is a rapid appreciation of real estate, a lot of people borrow huge amounts of money invest/speculate in real estate. With the asset buuble burst, a whole generation is left with huge debt and deeply traumatized. Learning the lessons, and combiend with a depressed labor market, the Japaneses have gone to another extreme to so called 'Heisei Otaku' , meaning lifestyle of low desire and being simplistic and frugal. This also lower the demand for all goods and services, making it harder for business.to be profitable in Japan.\n\n4. Internal flaws of the Japanese model. labor market operate as a lifetime employment model, there is rarely layoffs and employee usually stay with the same.firm until retirement. It works great in the good time but at the downturn it make it very hard for firms to downsize and increase operational effciency. This contribute also to Japanses firms failure to compete with Korean and Chinese firms. The work culture is also quite toxic and discriminative against womens and many japanese women choose not to work and this also cause the further tighening of Japanses labor market.\n\n5. Ineffective monetary stimulus. Although BoJ has lowered the rate to negative, it does very little help stimulate Japan.

NOW, you want to get a mortgage but you can’t (because you’ve never had debt… he needed the trustee to cosign at the end of everything btw; other trusts might just buy the property and transfer the property to the beneficiary then the Bennie just has to deal with the tax payments). \n\nI think my example explores not only timely payments but the utilization of debt because if you pay the balance every time its due you are never experiencing debt but a payment deferred less than 30 days, debt is the incurring of interest and so I don’t think my initial example was really that crazy but maybe it was. My understanding is that if you have no credit score you can still easily get approved for a store credit card from gap (one inquiry— a little bad for credit, as opposed to saying trying for every bank card… many inquiries— worse for credit.) for like 1,000 dollars, now if you want them to increase the credit limit you might hold that balance for a month or two while maintaining payments. And I guarenfuckintee they will increase your loan because you’ve easily exercised payments on a small loan and they know your income from the application. OR you can maintain merely timely payments but I doubt they’ll increase their loan to you because they have no incentive. (Sometimes they’ll increase it if you throw it in drawer after you get it, but they increase it as a means for you to use it so that would take quite a few months.)

They're behind, but getting 1 design point out the door is a big step.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": ">Are you saying that MS would fund alternatives to Qualcomm’s ARM chips if they took over Intel?\n\n\nYes, because I don't believe Qualcomm would continue to develop ARM and x86 in parallel and obviously they're not buying INTC to kill their only thing that makes profit.\n\n\nQualcomm is in deep legal shit with ARM over their Nuvia cores. Also there is the early commercial failure of those chips because Windows software isn't ready and it's completely out of their hands. It's just my personal assessment that if Qualcomm takes over Intel or at least the client CPU business, it makes zero sense to fund two parallel product stacks where one of them sucks. Seems obvious to me that it's much smarter to buy 80% market share on day 1 and not invest tens of billions over several years competing with yourself. But it *could* make a lot ot sense to combine QCOM's industry leading mobile SOC design capability with Intel's IP and make better x86 chips for Windows to compete with Apple Mac chips. The x86/AMD64 cross-licensing would have to be renegotiated between AMD and INTC and I'm convinced nobody on Reddit has any idea if that would be a major hurdle or not.\n\n\nOn Microsoft's side, the whole point of throwing massive subsidies and marketing funds at Qualcomm was to kickstart Windows on ARM so they could break free from the Intel/AMD duopoly and compete worldwide at all price points - even if say China comes under export restrictions in a trade war - and wider performance ranges. You're not going to pay Intel money to help you stop buying Intel, and INTC(/QCOM) aren't going to invest R&D just to tear down the only moat keeping Intel in business today.\n\n\nThere is precedent for this. AMD had a program deep enough into development to announce it on the roadmap, offering choice of ARM and x86 in the same hardware platform. They killed it because there was no customer interest. There is absolutely nothing holding back AMD or Intel from selling chips with ARM cores, it's just that everything else being equal, x86 has more compatibility and therefore a bigger TAM for the same development cost. AMD continues to say in public that they're happy to make ARM products for any customer that wants them but there haven't been takers yet because the price isn't right. I believe Intel has said similar.\n\n\nThe dominant reason to use ARM in the PC and server spaces is that a company wants to build custom chips but they can't license x86 so they *must* use ARM. See AWS, Azure, NVDA, Ampere, previously Nuvia=QCOM in servers. Someday x86 may be a dinosaur and all the popular software runs on ARM but not x86.
