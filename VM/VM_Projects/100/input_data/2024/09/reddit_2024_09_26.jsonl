{"title": "Investing in Costco today is actually betting against it", "selftext": "Costco has been the best single holding in my portfolio and after 10 years and \\~1000% gains, I liquidated my holdings of Costco when it crossed $900 last week. To be clear, Costco is going to have a fantastic report today - we know this because they already release monthly sales and Costco has continued its industry leading performance, and the limited revenue growth projections of 1% are largely due to the fact that the comparable YoY quarter is a week shorter. Moreover, on an annual basis, Costco is probably one of the only companies out there that hasn't had a single losing year over the last decade. I'm also a huge Costco shopper that continues to be an addict in throwing more spend in, despite my perception that many of Costco's core staples aren't as good of a deal as they used to be. \n\nRevenue has improved 5%+ every year. More impressively, so has net margin, improving 50% from \\~2% to 3% over the same time period. I believe the bull case that both of these trends will continue at very little risk. Costco has an amazing team to select locations and proof of international scale. It also has room to continue to steadily improve margins through its supply chain, pricing, product mix, membership price increases, and eCommerce penetration. \n\nBut what used to be a bull case for this stock has now become bull fantasy. The arguments for Costco popping to $1000 boil down to:\n\n1) Costco stock has always been expensive and PE doesn't matter\n\n2) Stock split = $$$  \n\n3) My local Costco has long lines \n\nYes, Costco stock has always commanded a premium above industry. And every single quarter, every Costco bear that has said \"Costco stock is too expensive\" has been slapped in the face and proven wrong. Personally, I think Costco deserves tech-stock like valuations and a multiple of the rest of the industry. This year has been different. Costco PE ratio has eclipsed Nvidia, and is now above 55; Costco is now more expensive than it's ever been relative to its earnings by an enormous margin. For reference, if Costco instantly doubled in size right now and paid out 100% of its profits in dividends in perpetuity, it's yield would still be a little smaller than the 10Y treasury. \n\nA PE ratio above 50 means quite simply that you are investing in the company because you are confident earnings will explosively grow in the next few years. I am betting Costco is going to continue to be Costco - an amazingly well run company that takes almost no risk in continuing to improve over time, resulting in fantastic high single digit eps growth. The bull case now is essentially betting that Costco isn't going to be Costco, but rather something entirely different in 5 years. Those betting on Costco eclipsing $1000 after earnings today are betting that Costco will have an unprecedented pop on the quarterly report (there has never been a +10% before) and a 60+ TTM PE ratio. At some point, optimistic becomes insanity and we're there already. \n\nAnd there are downside factors to consider too. If revenue has already been largely reported, the report really centers around margin and comments on future growth. \n\n- 5-10% of Costco's growth has been from gold bars, which will likely be dilutive to margin (2% margin on these vs a typical 10-15%) \n\n- Gas prices going down isn't good for Costco\n\n- As Costco expands it membership base, share of wallet, and portfolio of products, it becomes increasingly tied to US macroeconomic conditions simply as a function of being a more meaningful representation of total consumer spend \n\n- Membership price increases were smaller than some desired and haven't fully taken effect \n\n- Costco door scanners were likely implemented after tests proved they were accretive in the short run for margin due to improved shrinkage and folks buying more memberships; but this isn't like Netflix where each membership increase is just pure margin - the story on basket sizes, renewal impacts, and potential competitive dynamics is likely a little more murky, and will take longer to play out given annual vs. monthly renewals\n\n- Costco lines consistently being long everywhere quarter after quarter might be a hindrance and capacity constraint vs not \n\n- eCommerce margins are still unclear along with the impact of Instacart on memberships", "id": "1fpzm9a", "created_utc": 1727366185.0, "score": 891, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 306, "comments": [{"body": "I think Costco is an example of a more irrational stock if you look at things like the PE and such instead of the environment that Costco is in now.

Walmart went for cheap real estate, while Costco specialized and saw the value in convenience in paying more for RE but catering to a more affluent customer base. \n\nSpecialization is the hedge against competition. Much like developing a niche in an ecosystem. \n\nCostco has a lot of solid qualities:\n- their payable days exceed inventory, so they have no working capital need when it comes to inventory. It’s covered. That provides positive cash flow. \n- their own brand Kirkland accounts for 20%-30% of sales, because of the contrast principle. Kirkland is often placed against 1 national brand, and often appears to be a significant bargain, whereas by itself it wouldn’t appear so. So in contrast to the 1 or otherwise very few competing brands it appears to be the better choice, and so Kirkland makes up a high % of sales.\n- their membership fees make up half their pretax operating margin. Membership fees grow by 8% a year in volume, and they just raised prices by 8%, and this is where much compounding of the business comes from, not the retail side which is low margins but high turnover. \n- their average store sales which can be seen in the annual report grow significantly over time, doubling every 7 years or so. They also only add a constant 20 stores per year, or close to that. Very stable consistent growth. \n- much of this works together to give them high returns on invested capital, and high returns on equity. They buyback shares and pay dividends. The phenomenal declining and now 2-day cash conversion cycle. They are a compounding machine.\n- self reinforcing durable competitive advantages. Costco has high demand, which along with its footprint gives it the economies of scale for favorable supplier terms and prices that allows it to buy large quantities of inventory it sells out of its warehouses at wholesale prices, 20%-30% from its own label keeping costs lower and passing it down.

That region is really the main thing impacting the share price, and it was as Charlie would call a lalapalooza effect, or combination of various short term factors that drove just how bad the 23-24 main crop was. These factors have already begun to unwind, and I’m assuming by next years main crop the speculation still present in cocoa commodities may be pushed out. \n\nHaven’t seen cocoa prices eclipse their stock and suppress it since the last go from roughly 2007-2013.

It’ll probably take 2 normal or mediocre back to back harvests to offset the awful 23-24 harvest.

Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help.
