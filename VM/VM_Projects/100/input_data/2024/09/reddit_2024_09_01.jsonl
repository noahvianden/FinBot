That said, I found IBM to be a kind of cult to many customers in the 80s and 90s, and a few even now. \n\nAt first, enterprises looked at IBM as the Cadillac of computing. They locked in many places with their mainframe computing; the IBM 360 was a staple of business. The biggest places had sales staff with personal relations to the C level of enterprises and sole sourced the equipment. UNIVAC, DEC, Tandem and others to a lesser extent. \n\nAs the 80s and 90s rolled around, Big Blue kept high prices on their Cadillac and although they rolled out their UNIX (AIX) and virtually invented the PC, the pricing was high,  proprietary in an open source minded world and they lost market share. \n\nFor one retail company, the Bd of Directors required competitive bidding, and even though any competitor could provide less price and equal or superior function, IBM would be awarded the work \"because we are used to them\". Finally others stopped bidding the pointless exercise; it was just to press IBM to keep their pricing down. When the old guard retired, and the enterprise realized the premium they paid for obsolete proprietary systems it was too late. They still used the IBM OS/2 PC into the 2000s. They went from sales of billions to bankruptcy. I am convinced their cult belief in IBM and failure to modernize contributed. \n\nI did a study for multiple companies that illustrated if they moved off the bloated AIX systems to competitive systems, they would save millions. The paradigm shift always seemed risky, but those that moved were well rewarded. \n\nIn the last 15 years, where IBM competed against Dell,  HP/HPE, Fujitsu, Amazon, Microsoft and others for data center refresh, cloud and other updates, they  rarely stood the test, unless it was from one of those cultist enterprises who had decided before the bid. \n\nThey still have a mainframe market; it is expensive to migrate but not impossible. Their database product , PC, AIX and others are considered by most to be \"old iron\". Even their cloud is a bit proprietary and pricey; iron cloud. Watson has been discussed\n\nTheir quantum computing research is admirable but given their history of trying to make things proprietary so they can keep price and margin high, I won't expect it to play well with others.

People who make more money tend to proportionally spend more as well. Beyond discretionary purchases (status becomes more important as necessities are covered) they also live in more expensive neighborhoods, pay more for exclusive schools for their kids, etc.\n\nFurthermore, this hypothesis doesn't match the recorded history of valuations. According to that logic, we should see a straightforward increase in average P/E ratios from 1880 to the present. This is not reflected in P/E or any other proxy like Tobin's Q. [Until the 2000s it resembled a sine wave](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio).\n\nThis also ignores the impact of inflation upon the perceived value of money.

It becomes popular when people assume passive investing is guaranteed profit (i.e. the 1920s, the 1990s, post-2015) and unpopular when the market is volatile or bad (i.e, the 1930s, 1970s-1980s). The public becomes enthusiastically interested in investment when they can envision the market as a bank on steroids.\n\n> People are investing much more than they used to\n\nYes, and it has nothing to do with wealth. It's about risk-free returns in other assets being poor for decades, which has shifted liquidity into risk assets for better yield.

You are conflating nominal increases in the money supply (i.e. inflation) with real added value. [The personal savings rate has tanked over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT), therefore currently people have *less* money to invest in the market than ever before.

The 1950s are regarded as the halcyon days of American economic prosperity, yet the S&P's aggregate valuation didn't break the mean until 1959. In fact, the market exhibited consistently higher P/E multiples *during the Great Depression*. Again, this is all displayed in the chart.\n\nWhy did this happen? Because during times of economic prosperity, earnings growth outstrips price growth. People spend when they're optimistic about the future and believe standards of living will continue to improve. I often see people on this subreddit fail to grasp this basic point, so they cite P/E ratios in the past as evidence that past business environments were inefficient. \n\n> Since there were two world wars, people in 1880-1980 were mostly getting out of poverty.

The time value of the option - the longer an option has until expiration, the more valuable it is. Time value is represented by the greek letter theta, which is why you hear options sellers referred to as \"theta gang\" sometimes.\n\n3. The implied volatility of the underlying - the range of possible price movements that the market considers possible for the stock. This can shift dramatically over the life of an option, and when IV is high, option prices are high because the uncertainty means the market can't rule out larger moves to the upside or the downside. Around major events like earnings announcements, IV rises as people try to predict what a company will say during its report. After the report, the company's expectations and results quickly become widely known, and \"IV  crush\" occurs, causing option prices to drop.\n\n4. Last but certainly not least, the current price of the underlying stock.\n\nOP lost money because they lost ground on all four of these variables - when NVDA went down in price, the intrinsic value of the option fell with it, each day that passes eats up more theta, the earnings report caused IV to drop, and of course, the drop in stock price itself made the option less valuable.\n\nOneS8lf, you should really do some deeper reading on option pricing than this Reddit comment before attempting to trade them.

The contracts themselves are up over the last month and took a good hit this week.\n\nYou may want to freshen up on a poor man‚Äôs covered call. It isn‚Äôt a guaranteed way to limit exposure and ultimately you want the stock to gain traction, but depending on the premiums it would be a way to collect some $ provided you don‚Äôt get assigned. \n\nFor example: $130c exp 9/20 are $1.73 (subject to change). If you sold 150 PMCC‚Äôs at this strike you would get over $25k in premiums. That‚Äôs 1/5 of what you have lost recovered just in premiums in less than 3 weeks.\n\nWorst case scenario is the stock dips and you lose more on your contracts you purchased than the money you made on the ones you sold. You may want to run some calculations on that.\n\nBest case is the stock closes 9/20 at $129 and you don‚Äôt get an early assignment. Your options you purchased will be a lot more as well and you can consider closing or selling more contracts for another time in the future.\n\nI‚Äôm bullish on NVDA long term especially the last few months of the year, but I‚Äôm bearish on it in the short term. It is difficult to give advice because I think the stock will suffer in the coming 2-3 weeks. And I could be totally wrong. September has also been one of the worst performing months in the market historically. And elections years are usually good for the market towards the end of the year and into the next one.\n\nIf you do not plan on taking the full blown L (selling everything), I would suggest running some calculations and price targets, as well as some risk assessment (stop loss for you). \n\nThe added bonus of collecting those contract premiums is you could DCA with your current contracts with the extra money.\n\nGood news: all strikes are still long dated and ITM. NVDA is a golden fucken bull.

IFS is burning cash but the other half of Intel actually pulls revenue, so the value is primarily concentrated on the revenue one, since anyone wanting to invest in growth is being directed towards AMD, Nvidia, TSMC etc. I don't see going lower than this point unless their core revenue is threatened, but for that, PC's would no longer have to be a good market, And then and only then would Intel start having to sell off its core business for scraps.\n\nBasically the price of Intel right now is their core revenue, cpu's etc. Foundry being sold off was seen as a positive so the market is not invested in that, and it was also a decent dividend stock but the removal of that took off a lot of share value.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Here's the problem with Intel's book value.\n\nIntel can't liquidate its fabs (most of its book value) for that book value.
