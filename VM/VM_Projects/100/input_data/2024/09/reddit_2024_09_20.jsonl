The vast majority of Qualcomm‚Äôs business comes from selling smartphone processors, 5G wireless chips, and licensing mobile technology. There isn‚Äôt much synergy with Intel‚Äôs core x86 PC and server processor business, which has been losing significant market share to¬†Advanced Micro Devices¬†in recent years.\n\n>Intel‚Äôs PC chips have already been eclipsed by in-house offerings from¬†Apple¬†and others, which draw on designs from¬†Arm Holdings. On the data center side, New Street Research estimates that AMD‚Äôs x86 server processor business will reach 40% market share by year-end, up from less than 5% four years ago. Those gains have come at the expense of Intel, making it that much less attractive to Qualcomm, or any other suitor.\n\n>A merger won‚Äôt fix Intel‚Äôs biggest problem, its foundry, or chip manufacturing business. For Intel Foundry to succeed, the company needs a flagship U.S. customer like Apple, AMD, or¬†Nvidia. While Intel has¬†announced¬†smaller deals, including one with Amazon Web Services last week, they‚Äôre not large enough to matter.

Your phone and for that matter PC experience is unidirectional. You tell the point and click interface to do things. You navigate menus, submenus, websites etc.  Its nice but not an \"agent\". It is not learning your processes or tasks and \"moves\".  AI will allow the phone to understand your usage and support automating repetitive tasks.  It will extend the phones programming as you demonstrate your needs.  That's phase 1.  As you know you have Siri (or equivalent) as an assistant already.  Its probable that with a merge of AI, Siri and some CGI that your phone will have an avatar that you interact with.  The bits are all there. So lets say you are driving hime from work the same way you always drive and do not have a MAP app open. The AI can pop up an alert and say - \"Alert the usual route home has an accident around Elm Street - suggest you re-route to Redwood.\"  (It can interface with the car as well to assist.)  Oh then you realize - you will not have time to cook. So hands free you say to you phone - \"Please order a Cobb salad from Gino's for me to pickup en route\".  The AI will open Grubhub, place your re-order and notify you when it will be available.   Or the phone tells you one morning, \"Mom's birthday is tomorrow. Did you need me to order flowers or anything else?\" This sort of interaction is not fantasy and has been a goal for decades. The scaffolding needed building first.  The scaffolding is done.  AI is the glue that makes it work. Note Steve Jobs even commented on AI in the late 1990's - paraphrasing - \"It still far off but when it happens it will change everything\".   He then compared it to how long \"multimedia\" took. But you can now watch Youtube on every device that has a screen.  These are evolutionary steps that have taken a long time to converge. \n\nAnd note - tangent - if you think VR/AR/MR are just about gaming - oh no - that too is a monumental shift.

This prevents any risk of the automatic exercise from happening, and allows ample time to deliver notices, process DNEs, etc.. \n\nYou can‚Äôt really assume that you will be able to offload a contract close to expiration, especially in illiquid markets (most options lol) - liquidity dries up with IV - and it can be tough to close a position reliably at the last minute or even hours ahead of close  (hence most options expire unexercised).
