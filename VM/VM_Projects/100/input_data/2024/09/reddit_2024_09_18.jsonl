If the Fed delivers a 50 basis point cut, it could trigger a surge of optimism and a major rally in the stock market.  \n  \nHere's why I believe we could see a 300-point jump today:  \n  \nBoosting Investor Confidence: A deeper rate cut would signal that the Fed is committed to propping up the economy amid ongoing uncertainties. This would inject a lot of confidence into both institutional and retail investors, who are eager for signs that the Fed is taking bold action.\n\n  \nCheaper Borrowing Costs: Lower rates make borrowing cheaper for companies, encouraging business investments and spending. Investors often see this as a precursor to growth, further pushing stocks higher.  \nEasing Recession Fears: There’s been growing concern about a potential economic slowdown, and a significant cut would help ease those fears, signaling that the Fed is proactive. This could drive capital back into the market, particularly in sectors that have been lagging due to recession worries.\n\n  \nMarket Sentiment: Historically, aggressive rate cuts have resulted in strong short-term market reactions. With a 50 basis point cut, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all post substantial gains by the end of the day.\n\n  \nIt’s important to remember that nothing is guaranteed, but if the Fed comes through with this aggressive move, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the market finish 300 points higher, if not more.

The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*\r  \n\r  \n*Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H.

Here are a few key reasons why the Fed is often considered to have a better understanding of the economy:\n\n1. **Access to Data**: The Fed has direct access to vast amounts of economic data collected from various government agencies, financial institutions, and research. This includes real-time data on employment, inflation, consumer spending, and lending activities, allowing them to make more informed decisions about the economy.\n2. **Research Capabilities**: The Fed employs teams of economists and researchers who study economic trends, run models, and analyze how different policies impact the economy. These experts constantly monitor global economic conditions and use sophisticated tools to assess risks and opportunities.\n3. **Regulatory Insight**: The Fed has regulatory oversight of many financial institutions, including banks. This gives them insights into the financial health of these institutions and the broader financial system, which can affect the economy.\n4. **Monetary Policy Tools**: The Fed controls monetary policy, including interest rates and money supply, which directly affects economic conditions. The ability to implement policies gives the Fed more control over economic outcomes, which provides insights that investors don’t typically have.\n5. **Confidential Information**: The Fed has access to confidential data, like discussions with major financial institutions, global central banks, and government agencies. This privileged information gives the Fed a clearer picture of both domestic and global economic health.\n6. **Neutral Perspective**: The Fed’s goal is to maintain economic stability (full employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates), while individual investors are often more focused on short-term gains. This long-term view allows the Fed to assess the economy from a more holistic and less biased perspective.\n\nWhile investors may focus on market trends and specific industries, the Fed’s broader mandate and access to deeper data sets give it an edge in understanding the overall economy.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "These must be the factors that told them inflation was transient in 2021.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You asked what data they have that we don't have.

{"title": "Why cut 50? What is JPOW hiding?", "selftext": "One argument for cutting rates by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, instead of 50 basis points goes like this: The Federal Reserve only makes larger cuts when something is going wrong in the economy or financial system.\n\nAnd that’s partly true, but it also misses an important point.\n\nSince the Fed began to publicize interest-rate changes in 1994, the central bank has moved from a neutral stance to a cutting stance six times.\n\nThe Fed initiated shallow cutting cycles in 1995, 1998, and 2019, each time leading off with a cut of 25 basis points.\n\nThe Fed began what would be deeper cutting cycles three times, in early 2001, 2007, and when the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread in March 2020, each time leading with a cut of 50 basis points.\n\nThis has led many analysts to conclude that larger cuts of 50 basis points are “reserved” for more severe situations, and there is some truth to this pattern.\n\nStock markets were sliding as the tech bubble began to deflate with the Fed cut rates in January 2001 by 50 basis points. The bursting of a subprime mortgage-credit bubble in August 2007 preceded the Fed’s cut of the same magnitude in September 2007.\n\nAt the same time, Fed officials at both of those meetings still thought their more aggressive action might preempt a downturn, according to the transcripts of those meetings. In other words, just because 50-basis-point cuts look, in retrospect, like actions reserved for the start of a recession, officials didn’t think that way in real time.\n\nSource: WSJ and Federal Reserve ", "id": "1fjzgie", "created_utc": 1726682925.0, "score": 1207, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 721, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 5 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 month ago\n**Total Comments** | 65 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "He's hiding the sausage inside your mom", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "We’ve predicted 20 of the last 0 recessions correctly.", "score": 2586, "replies": [{"body": "there is missed opportunities from rallies when we wait too long for a correction. even if it is inevitable and happens you are still better off staying in the market for a longer period and absorbing the correction. expected return is still positive.", "score": 264, "replies": [{"body": "Timing only works if you are perfect.

But let’s take a step back and think about what that really signals.\n\nThe Fed going for a 50-basis-point cut isn’t just a move to preempt a downturn—it’s an acknowledgment that we’re already facing significant economic headwinds. We’re past the peak of growth, inflation’s starting to cool, and the credit cycle is tightening. A cut like this is the Fed’s way of saying, “We’re in a tough spot, and we need to act decisively.”\n\nBut here’s the tricky part: while the cut might seem like an aggressive move to stave off a recession, it also risks sending a message that things are worse than they appear. Markets are already on edge with liquidity concerns in the banking sector and a deeply inverted yield curve, and a cut this size can amplify those fears.\n\nThe Fed had to balance a lot of factors here. On the one hand, a 25-basis-point cut might’ve been seen as too timid, given the risks we’re facing. On the other, a 50-basis-point cut could make people wonder, “What do they know that we don’t?” It’s a delicate balance, and they chose to act boldly, but that doesn’t mean we’re out of the woods.\n\nThe reality is, recession risks are elevated, and this cut reflects that. The Fed’s trying to get ahead of the curve, but they’re walking a tightrope. And while they’ve made their move, it’s going to be crucial to watch how the markets and the broader economy react in the coming weeks.\n\n*Edit:* It’s worth noting that Wall Street ended lower yesterday, likely a “sell the fact” reaction since the market had already priced in the Fed’s rate cut. But we might be seeing some risk-on sentiment returning. Equities in Asia-Pacific rallied today, and futures are pointing to a higher open in both the US and European markets. The euro and the pound initially weakened against the dollar but rebounded as the ECB and BOE were less dovish than the Fed. So, there’s a lot in flux right now—definitely something to keep an eye on.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
