In some of their plants, less than half of the vehicles that could theoretically be produced are actually being made. \n\n## Examples of hard-hit companies\n\nVW is planning to layoff 15K, possibly closing 2-3 plants in Germany (for the first time).

[This graph of exports by country is from early 2024](https://i.imgur.com/nPAd2wh.jpeg)--China is the Japan of the 1980s. The threat of Chinese competition is so high that EU is considering 50% tariffs (currently 15% on Chinese EVs), while the US is at 100%. In past years, I've always heard that Chinese cars are junk. Junk cars wouldn't need to need to have their price doubled to keep consumers from buying them. In other countries, Chinese brands are taking over the nascent EV market: \"Chinese automakers accounted for 88% of the EV market in Brazil and 70% in Thailand in the first quarter of this year.\"\n\nIn Europe, despite tariffs: \"Chinese carmakers' share of passenger car sales in Europe rose to 17% in the first seven months of 2024 from 12% a year earlier, according to data from automotive consultancy Inovev, and Chinese car exports have reached record highs this year.\" [(Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-auto-suppliers-ev-makers-flood-major-trade-fair-germany-2024-09-10/).\n\n## Shifts in China's Domestic Markets \n\nThe Chinese automobile renaissance is killing foreign producers in China, yet another sign that these cars in China are actually comparable quality. \n\n> Foreign brands’ market share of Chinese auto sales is tracking at a record low of 37 per cent in the first seven months of 2024, down from 64 per cent in 2020, according to data from Automobility, a Shanghai consultancy. So far this year, US brands are down more than 23 per cent while Japanese, Korean and German carmakers have also suffered double-digit declines, the data showed. By contrast, sales of Chinese brands are up nearly 22 per cent with Chinese companies overwhelmingly dominating sales of the EV market.\n\n[Here's Ford CEO/CFO](https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-ceo-cfo-left-shocked-after-chinese-ev-test-drive-2024-9) being shocked by the quality of Chinese EVs in a test drive. [Longer article here](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ford-china-ev-competition-farley-ceo-50ded461?st=86lo43cq3ccgaz6&reflink=article_copyURL_share).\n\n## Technological Edge in EVs for China?\n\n[Nearly 40% of Chinese auto sales are of EVs](https://i.imgur.com/cqX6jts.png) versus 10% for the US and 21% for Europe. Aren't the US/EU supposed to be championing the green revolution in autos? BYD had a 5% share of Chinese cars in 2022--today it's 20%.  That's a big threat to Tesla for instance, who gets 20% of its revenue from China.\n\n## Possible Bull Case\n\nSo  is there a bull case for VW? Here is a [Sum of the Parts](https://x.com/StanphylCap/status/1832096596319727717) bull case for Volkswagen. VW owns stakes in Porche, Traton in addition to owning Audi, VW cars, Skoda, Seat, Cupra Lamborghini, Bentley and Ducati. I don't fully understand how the debt impacts the analysis here, though. OP claims the debt is held by a captive finance arm and fully secured by leased cars + non-recourse (only collateral can be pursued, nothing more).\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nHow are European automakers going to handle the competitive threat of a new Chinese auto juggernaut along with massive fiscal support in the US (from the IRA)? Their energy prices face much higher spikes [than in the US and China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliasferrerbreda/2023/09/21/energy-europes-big-disadvantage/). Labor unions are much more powerful in Europe, making cost cuts difficult. Autos are already a very difficult sector to invest in, but I suspect European cars brands may be uninvestible and they are rightfully cheap on a P/E basis (if earnings are even positive).\n\n---\n\nArticles used in this post:\n\n- [Bloomberg: Europe’s EV Sales Plunge Has Carmakers Seeking EU Relief](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-19/germany-s-slump-in-ev-sales-drags-on-europe-s-auto-market).\n- [DW: Volkswagen's crisis: How can Europe's car industry survive?](https://www.dw.com/en/volkswagens-crisis-how-can-europes-car-industry-survive/a-70231806)\n- [Automotive News Europe: Threatened Audi plant closure sparks broad Brussels protest](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/audi-brussels-plant-closure-threat-sparks-belgium-national-strike)\n- [Reuters: China auto suppliers, EV makers flood major trade fair in Germany](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-auto-suppliers-ev-makers-flood-major-trade-fair-germany-2024-09-10/)\n- [Business Insider: Ford's CEO and CFO took a drive in a Chinese EV.

Interestingly, EVs Polestar 3 SUV and the 3 row Volvo EX90 are both made in Volvo’s South Carolina plant which is in a free trade zone, giving additional duty free benefits on certain imported parts and components for exported vehicles, and in turn exports will earn tariff credits in the US to offset imports of the new EVs Polestar 4 from South Korea, and the compact Volvo EX30 from Ghent, Belgium coming early 2025.  Just a brilliant strategic play by Geely for their Polestar and Volvo brands in the US that makes them the only Chinese-owned EVs manufactured in the US and possibly North America, likely for years to come.\n\nhttps://www.autoweek.com/news/a46989952/polestar-volvo-ownership-changes/", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I don't see Volvo Cars as a Chinese brand, it's listed on Nasdaq Stockholm and has it's HQ in Sweden, so it's technically a european brand, it's however majority owned by Geely, but you can buy shares in it right now.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes you are correct…Geely has about 78% ownership.

The enhanced feature is a flash point in the escalating tensions between merchants and the card networks setting the fees for payment processing.\n\nThe world’s largest retailer has offered pay-by-bank through Walmart Pay since earlier this year. Until now, the transactions were akin to digital checks and took roughly three days to finalize when being processed through The Automated Clearing House, the same network often used for bill payments or paycheck deposits. Soon, customers opting for pay-by-bank transactions will see the purchase reflected in their bank account balance instantly – and Walmart will receive the funds immediately.\n\nThe consumer advantage of instant pay-by-bank over debit cards is avoiding stacked pending transactions. For customers carrying low balances, pending transactions can open them up to the risk of overdraft or non-sufficient funds fees from their bank, according to Jamie Henry, vice president of emerging payments at Walmart.\n\nIn the US, most consumers carry credit or debit cards which offer convenience, fraud protections and, in the case of credit products, rewards programs. However, frustration has mounted among merchants over fees they pay for card processing to banks and networks like Visa and Mastercard.\n\n  \nTLDR/ \n\n* Retailer partners with Fiserv for upgraded pay-by-bank option\n* Aims at reducing consumer risk of NSF or overdraft fees", "id": "1fko4kd", "created_utc": 1726760985.0, "score": 359, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "Credit cards provide benefits a bank account does not.  I would never give them my banking information either.", "score": 207, "replies": [{"body": "A few years ago when checks were still used commonly, your bank info was written in plain sight at the bottom of nearly every transaction you made..
