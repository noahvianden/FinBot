This enabled consumer companies like Apple to roll this out.\n\nSo, is the apple one any good? Not really. It’s a gimmick. Why? Apple AirPods only last 6-7 hours with a single charge and continuous playback (hearing aid feature is effectively continuous playback mode). This is not usable for most people. Medical grade hearing aids last 3-4 days with one battery. You don’t want grandma worrying about charging her AirPods every 6 hours and sit down for an hour for it to charge without hearing.

{"title": "Listen regards, my next speculation is $COST will split and rip.", "selftext": "I'm the degenerate that bought way OTM calls on $DG and $DLTR because $1 stores are trash and the options were cheap lotto tickets. How you find these plays; get a thesis going, then check for lottery tickets, then manage your risk. \n\nThe play? The deepest OTM calls on $COST, at various strikes and dates as follows:  \n\n\n10/4 1040c for $1.67/each  \n10/18 1200c for $0.40/each  \n12/20 1300c for $0.69/each.  \n  \nI started earlier this week with the 980 and 990 calls, but they were up 80% and 33% respectively, so I sold those and loaded up on the above. \n\nI know what you're thinking, \"Dude, you're fucking stupid\". A little, but besides the point. Here's the thesis. \n\n1) Its fucking Costco. Just look at that chart. Speaking of chart?  \n2) $COST is the $NVDA of grocery stores, essentially. Better and better every year, since they both opened. Well run companies, good products and financials, blah blah blah. Why compare to NVDA? The split.   \n3) The strikes on the options chains. DG was a play because the 100p were cheap and was a critical level on the chart. DLTR on the other hand? **Yes, the 65p was also at a key level on the chart. But 65 was the lowest strike on the chain.** \n\nThink about it. If the stock prices goes higher (or lower) than the highest (or lowest) strike on the chain, the people writing those options have **NO** hedge. \n\nHow? Well, not everyone is a degenerate monkey like we all are. They hedge, instead of zero to hero shit. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with options, here's the ELI5 of it. I write (sell to open) an option, I collect the premium (price paid per contract). I get the money; you get the contract. Contract expires, dope, I get 'free' money. Contract goes ITM, I'm boned, now I have to buy or sell 100 shares to fulfill the contract. At a loss. An example. \n\nSay I think WMT will go down by next Friday, to $75. WMT is now $80.60/share. \n\nSo, I write a 75c for WMT (sell to open) that expires 9/20 and collect \\~$6.10 in premium. 1 of 3 things will happen. \n\n1) WMT hits $75, or below by 9/20. Instead of $5 ITM, it is barely ITM and only worth $1.06/contract. So, I buy one of the contracts for $1.06 to \"buy to close\". Sold it for $6.10, bought it back for $1.06, I keep the $5.04 in extra premium in my pocket.\n\n2) Stock price does nothing, pretty much all week. The option is still $5 ITM by Friday, but worth less than the $6.10 I wrote it for on Monday. Price is still the same, but now there is less than 24 hours to expiration instead of 5 days. You buy to close the same option back for $3-4, still collect $1-2 in premium. \n\n3) WMT rips to $85, now the option you wrote is $10 ITM and is worth $10. Either it gets exercised and you lose money, or you buy to open another contract for $10 and still lose money.  \n\nSo, how do you hedge for the possibility of scenario 3? You buy the 80c for $1.06 roughly. If WMT does rip to $85 that week, yes the 75c you wrote is worth $10 instead of $5. But the 80c you bought as a hedge for $1.06 is now $5 ITM and is worth the same $5 you lost on the contract you wrote. That is the hedge\n\n  \nWhy bring all of this up like I have any idea of what I'm talking about? \n\n**Well, what happens when the $75 is the highest strike on the options chain? You can't buy the 80c for a hedge, because it does not exist.** \n\nThat is where the play comes in. If COST posts good ER (usually do because they're COST, and increased membership so money money) **AND** they announce a split on their 9/26 ER? This thing absolutely rips. \n\n**IF** this happens, $1100 is my price target by 10/4. \n\n**This is a BIG IF so position yourself with money you are comfortable seeing go to ZERO.**\n\nBut if this does work? We can all buy our own Wendy's. \n\nLet us assume that this play works as I'm imagining it and COST hits $1050-$1100/share by 10/4.   \n  \n- The 10/4 1040c will be $10-60 ITM, \\~$17.50-$52.50/each up from $1.67/each  \n- The 10/18 1200c will be $100-150 OTM instead of $280 OTM. Hard to estimate from options chain, but definitely worth more than the 0.40/each we buy them for. And, by 10/18, those could possibly even be ITM also.   \n- The 12/20 1300c will also be worth more than we paid for them. \n\nI'll post my positions below in a photo, with some charts. \n\nThis is my next play, and I'm putting up 10% of my capital at risk on it. \n\nIf you only want one option to keep track of, go with the 10/4 1040c for sure. \n\nCurrently, they are $1.67/each. **START a position, don't fucking load up on them all at once! Risk only what you're willing to see go to ZERO.**\n\nSo, whatever 1% of your capital is. Risk that and start the position on Monday. Whether that is 1, 10, or 100 contracts. Fuck it. Only 1-2% of your capital. \n\nAfter that, watch and observe. Options go down and value and are less than $1.67/each? Then add more. This is what I will be doing, until the total of the bet accounts for 10% of my bankroll. 5% if you want to be conservative, but I'm risking 10% on this one. \n\n***tl;dr: I'm regarded and think COST will do a stock split, and will rip past 1060 (to put options writers in an awkward and unhedged position). $COST will rip to $1100 by 10/4, and the 1040c will be $1-$60 ITM. They're only $1.67/each right now, cheap lotto tickets with decent enough odds.***", "id": "1fh2imi", "created_utc": 1726367919.0, "score": 632, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 433, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 7 | **First Seen In WSB** | 6 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 63 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Meth.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thank you for explaining autism.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just seems the common theme is that when a stock hits 1k it splits.\n\nSaw that with a few now.\n\nNot only is COST a contender... so is LLY.", "score": 245, "replies": [{"body": "My pops was telling me the other day he got in some company around $200/share and it’s at like 900+ now.

I sell however many to be happy with the gains, what i would be sad about losing in profit pretty much. Let's say you're up $10k the following Monday. Ask yourself, how much of that $10k is life changing for you? What would you be sad to see go to zero on Tuesday? Is it $1000 out of 10k? Is it $5000? Only you can decide. Maybe it is $1000 in gains instead of $10k, or even $100k instead. That isn't the point. **The point is, lock in the gains you would be sad to lose.** \n\nI will be selling half of my position sometime on Monday. Will vary. Up to markets and price action when I do it. Say I have 10 out of 15 contracts on Monday, after Friday (step 1). I will sell 3 of them at open, lock in the gains. Then, I will watch the chart the rest of the day. I will look to sell 2-3 more by EOD.\n\n5) From Tuesday until Friday, I do nothing. I let the remaining 4-5 contracts ride. Zero or super hero. Maybe they go up another 1000% in gain, maybe they don't. I won't care, because I've already made money. \n\n  \n**A big take away is this when trading options (if your capital can afford it):** This is why grabbing more than one contract is optimal, it removes the emotions of wins and losses. Like my trade above, by scaling out in the manner described above, you remove all the emotions related to gains and losses. Friday, you set yourself up by not only getting a free trade. But also 35% profit. No negative thoughts now, you're already happy. Haven't lost gains, or even money. You're not only ahead on the trade, but now you're on a free trade with contracts left with 1 weeks' time after a major catalyst. \n\nMonday, you lock in some more gains. Now, not only are you on a free trade, but now you're up 200% instead of 35%. You're even more thrilled than Friday! Free trade and up 200%? Sweet! \n\nNow here is the best part. You don't give a **FUCK** what happens to those other contracts. Now? You can take them to zero (expiration date, aka 10/4) and not give a flying fuck what happens. The rest of the contracts go to zero? WHO CARES? You made 200% on the trade. Congrats! But what if they continue to rip? Now, you're up possibly 1000% or more on the trade. Don't make that extra 800% by 10/4? Who cares, you made 200%. And you didn't risk that 200% to try to get 1000%. \n\nThe idea is to trade in a manner that completely eliminates any emotions, positive or negative (greed or fear). \n\n1st order of business is paying for the trade and locking in a little gains.  \n2nd order of business is to lock in even more of the gains when it goes up (or down for puts) in your favor. Now, free trade, and big gains you're already happy with.  \n3rd order of business, let the others ride. Now you can handle all of the risk of them going to zero, because the trade was free, and you made profit. \n\nRegards", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.

It is an incredible and well run company of course and is considered a compounding machine, so it's basically a golden investment vehicle for a long term portfolio to build wealth.\n\nA stock split would be great to see and could drive more investment, but I don't think it would happen as quickly as you are thinking. Lots of these successful compounding machine style companies don't move quickly, generally a 1% - 2% rise or fall is all you see from them most days. Nothing at Costco or other great companies like Mastercard or Moody's or even Texas Roadhouse happen quickly.

I risked 3% of my capital on DLTR, and 10% on DG.\n\nI was extremely confident in the $1 store plays. I have the same gut feeling about this COST play that I did with the $1 store plays.\n\nBut the $1 store plays had much more reasons for me to be confident. The speculation on the $1 was for a few reasons.\n\n1) WMT is now better than $1 stores, and has online ordering and home delivery. I expected $1 stores to get crushed, not only because their business model isn't as good as it was years ago, their financial statements were declining every year since 2022, but WMT is absolutely crushing many businesses. Especially $1 stores. \n\n2) $1 stores were trading above very critical levels that had no been seen since 2016-2018, and tested them last year and bounced. The thesis was, if these major levels were cracked ($100 for DG and $70 for DLTR) then it would be a massive bloodbath to the downside. Especially since both were below the 55MA (55 day moving average = institutions are in, below 55MA they are out). \n\n3) The options were very cheap and the odds of them cracking those levels was pretty probable. Enough for me to grab 100 of the DG and DLTR puts. $3000 risk on both turned into $72k and $18k respectively. \n\nThis COST play is much different because it is already trading near ATHs. COST can easily continue to go down, short term. Next levels for COST to test would be 872, 862, and 850. A bounce off of either levels, and a close above $900 before ER next week would be massively bullish IMO. \n\nFurthermore, they created a shit ton of strikes this morning. All the way up to 1260 for some reason. Interesting that they not only created new strikes already, but so many of them. Makes me wonder if MMs are preparing for a split. But ultimately, no one knows until ER next week.\n\nI'm feeling good about it, enough to increase my position to 15 1040c instead of the 7 I started with.

If it were to end up in the unlikely scenario of a prolonged war, they do have the upper hand of being able to rapidly replenish stockpiles and endure much longer than we could... at a safe distance.

Hence I have short term calls on SPY that expire September and ling term puts that expire December. \n\nNow you might ask why would fed hold it steady in November - my calc says we have not stabilized inflation and job market will remain strong due to holiday season with seasonal labor increase and extensive spending during the holiday season.
