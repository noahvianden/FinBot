{"title": "Boeing losing '$100 million to $150 million a day' as union strike rolls on", "selftext": "Boeing (BA) finds itself stuck between a rock and a hard place as the labor strike between it and the International Association of Machinists (IAM) union nears a second week.\n\nOn Monday, Boeing upped its offer to the union, which represents 33,000 workers, but did not proceed through union leadership and instead sent a \"best and final\" offer directly to workers, which didn‚Äôt sit well with the IAM. Boeing‚Äôs latest offer upped pay hikes to 30% from 25% in the prior offer, doubled a signing bonus to $6,000, and increased 401(k) contributions, among other things.\n\n\"The survey results from yesterday were overwhelmingly clear, almost as loud as the first offer: members are not interested in the company's latest offer that was sent through the media,\" IAM said in a statement late Tuesday night. \"Many comments expressed that the offer was inadequate and the company's decision to bypass the Union was viewed as disrespectful.\"\n\nEarlier, IAM said it contacted Boeing to engage in ‚Äúdirect talks‚Äù after the offer, which the company refused. Therefore, the union said it would not be holding a vote on the proposal.\n\nNevertheless, Boeing‚Äôs insistence on going directly to union members speaks to the difficulty the company is in, said Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and tourism expert at consulting firm AM&A.\n\nIAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a ‚Äúvery strong position,‚Äù Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a ‚Äúreputational level‚Äù too.\n\nWith the strike hitting Boeing‚Äôs bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon. Boeing shares are already down an astounding 40% year to date.\n\nShareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October.\n\n‚ÄúBoeing is already having to do some significant re-examination of the financials of the organization. To put this in context, every single day that Boeing is on strike, they‚Äôre losing between $100 million and $150 million,‚Äù Mendiratta said to Yahoo Finance.\n\nWithout union workers based in Boeing‚Äôs Renton, Wash., assembly facility, Boeing cannot deliver its 737 Max jets, which are the company‚Äôs cash cow. Boeing is still able to deliver its 787 Dreamliner out of its non-union South Carolina facility; however, those jets are limited in number. In the second quarter, Boeing delivered 70 737 Max jets, but only nine of the larger Dreamliners.\n\nMendiratta, who is also special adviser to the UN Tourism Secretary-General, said disruptions in Boeing not only hurt the American plane maker but also the aviation industry as a whole.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just Boeing that‚Äôs in trouble ‚Äî the entire global aviation system is in trouble because it relies on Boeing for 4 in 10 commercial aircraft as well as what it delivers in its other divisions,‚Äù Mendiratta said. ‚ÄúWhen there is a delay in the delivery of aircraft, and there are many airlines that are having delays, it means that the entire global aviation ecosystem is going to suffer, as is the global traveling public.‚Äù\n\nMendiratta doesn‚Äôt see the union bending here, at least not in the short term. Boeing put workers in a difficult position that led them to strike in the first place, she said, and emotions are running high following Boeing‚Äôs latest move to circumvent IAM leadership.\n\nIAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a ‚Äúvery strong position,‚Äù Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a ‚Äúreputational level‚Äù too.\n\nWith the strike hitting Boeing‚Äôs bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon. Boeing shares are already down an astounding 40% year to date.\n\nShareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-losing-100-million-to-150-million-a-day-as-union-strike-rolls-on-130406155.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANAWQmHD0UzqhKnTVDPsFleXumbn6G1xmOLNZ1qIpyvkppimRiyy_gjOLPw696DvbAlA3BFaU-DOlU9IwEQJpP0atQzCVt4lS1sxV8XLSzzpstngGWXUTGlg_Bo8vCePljmQbLBpTO6RRHhZIbX_vL4VeUmcoErS1aaCJzzp8ds6", "id": "1fp6x3r", "created_utc": 1727277293.0, "score": 1441, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 283, "comments": [{"body": "Pretty shocked they are ONLY down 40% YTD with everyone that‚Äôs happened", "score": 628, "replies": [{"body": "being backed by a superpower that won't let you fail is enticing to buyers", "score": 372, "replies": [{"body": "The issue is even if the US bails out Boeing, there is no guarantee that they will do so in a way that protects shareholders.

{"title": "Meta unveils $299 Quest 3S VR headset, Orion AR glasses prototype ", "selftext": "Meta announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company‚Äôs Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor.\n\nThe device will go on sale on Oct. 15, and it‚Äôll retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023‚Ä≤s Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple‚Äôs $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February.\n\nIn addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot.\n\nMeta‚Äôs previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company‚Äôs spending as a strategic initiative to prevent Apple from controlling future hardware platforms.\n\nAlthough there was hope among VR developers that Apple‚Äôs entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn‚Äôt revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price.\n\nWhat it does\n\nA Meta representative said the ‚ÄúS‚Äù in Quest 3S stands for ‚Äústart‚Äù ‚Äî as in getting started with VR.\n\nMany of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset.\n\nMeta highlighted improved ‚Äúpassthrough,‚Äù the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough.\n\nThe company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console.\n\n‚ÄúAll the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.\n\nIn demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta‚Äôs app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta‚Äôs controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn‚Äôt pressing buttons.\n\nBesides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last‚Äôs year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $649 to $499. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S.\n\nAdditionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum, and the older Quest 2 headset.\n\nEventually, glasses\n\nZuckerberg‚Äôs justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world.\n\nInvesting in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg previously said.\n\nZuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won‚Äôt be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell.\n\n‚ÄúThis is where we are going,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.\n\nMeta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company‚Äôs first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be.\n\nOrion is Meta‚Äôs first ‚Äúfully-functioning‚Äù prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small ‚Äúpuck.‚Äù The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company‚Äôs 2019 acquisition of CTRL-Labs.\n\nOrion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said.\n\nMeta‚Äôs Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook.\n\nMeta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don‚Äôt have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company‚Äôs voice assistant.\n\nAs part of Wednesday‚Äôs event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses.\n\nFor example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user‚Äôs ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes.\n\nAnother new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. \n\nLi-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number. \n\nThose features will become available ‚Äúlater this year,‚Äù the company said.\n\nThe Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were ‚Äúa bigger hit sooner than expected.‚Äù\n\nLast week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses.\n\nAI that speaks\n\nZuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts.\n\nWith voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta‚Äôs apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone.\n\nFor Meta AI‚Äôs new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell.\n\nThe new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.\n\nThe Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service.\n\nMeta‚Äôs new chatbot features are based on the company‚Äôs AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people‚Äôs written prompts.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/meta-unveils-cheaper-299-quest-3s-vr-headset-.html", "id": "1fpdcpn", "created_utc": 1727293342.0, "score": 251, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "$299?

{"title": "Consumers are broke, and maybe your SPY/QQQ Calls wont print", "selftext": "Sup my favorite casino goers,\n\nThrowaway account because reasons.  \nMy positions are currently as follows:  \n5x SPY Put @ 540 January 17, 2025  \n10x QQQ Put @ 450 January 17, 2025  \n10x SPY Put @ 500 June 20, 2025  \n10x Spy Put @ 450 December 19, 2025\n\nI believe that the US Labor market and US consumer are currently much weaker than what is being indicated by the media/FEDs at this time. Interest rates are going to fall very rapidly over the next year in attempt to prop up the labor market, and influence greater consumer credit spending. I do not believe this will work because of the present state of the average US consumer. Lowering interest rates can't help consumers who already don't have any sheckles.\n\nThe American consumer is completely broke and over levered, and additionally we are trending towards a tightening labor market, as corporations have been laying off more frequently due to over hiring during the pandemic, job openings are trending down, and unemployment is on the rise. I believe in the next 12-24 months we are going to bear witness to a Consumer Led Recession. For those of you that have made it this far, allow me to explain with some graphs.\n\n**Saving Rates**  \n\"Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences\"\n\nUS savings rates are at the same levels we experienced in the 2008 financial crisis, currently last reported at 2.9%. This means the American consumer has only been able to save 2.9% of their earnings towards their retirement, or to buy houses. In the second graph we can see this is trending downwards even still since COVID, as wages have not kept up with the high levels of inflation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a14fx3gimuqd1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=abeccecd40cb3e22225872ce00ddaa27b4eeaf4a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rudy6x5jmuqd1.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=520e70de2eca321717f91c6d6fc6032c009b2f10\n\n**YoY Household Expenditure**\n\nYear-over-year household expenditures have up-ticked dramatically since the COVID bucks were printed. The average increase YoY change in Household Expenditures has historically been 3.074% since 1984 (close the average inflation rate in the US of 3.25% since 1973). The problem here arises in the second picture below. Household expenditures rose by 8.361% in 2021 and 8.276% in 2022, which is back-to-back years outside of 1 standard deviation away from the mean, highlighted as 5.693%. Tomorrow at 10:00 AM the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release their 2023 Household Expenditures data, it would not be shocking that 2023 was another above-average year, as the average inflation rate for that year was 4.1%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwv8ivyjmuqd1.png?width=1203&format=png&auto=webp&s=f219b6f3e3a0683f2bcc58ea2437d6d77b18687b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6dd6fsmlmuqd1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddbca207332bece98da87bc0e86894e23d8071de\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wctffclnmuqd1.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=95ee317450b60e4d0038b146a56768c511fdd4d1\n\n**Unemployment**\n\nNot much to say here, except the graph has begun moving upwards in the last 12-months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ji3liokomuqd1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=c959158a5c0075d044dcbbf93575eb0fe4707a71\n\n**Job Openings**\n\nNot much to say here, other than again Job Openings are trending downwards, albeit still above the average Job Openings rate (orange).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3veewgepmuqd1.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=76a6ae9f6ca0c9a4fb81ecb9ecc26f72d378936a\n\n**Delinquency Rates Consumer Loans**\n\nHere's where we get interesting again, Consumer Loan Delinquency rates are now currently above levels in 2011 and have continued to trend upwards in our heightened interest rate environment. This may infer two things: consumers have not changed their spending habits, or have become over levered. Orange line indicates the average since 1987.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwew7olqmuqd1.png?width=971&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ca9405a025a9c60be436ec070a3815641b70e0e\n\n**Delinquency Rates Credit Cards**\n\nDelinquency rates on Credit cards are saying the exact same thing as consumer loans. Trending upwards, and above levels since 2011 in the era of low interest rates and lessened inflation.  \nWhat I WILL say is that delinquencies on mortgages have not risen much, but that is an indicator than I am aggressively watching QoQ.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fl4asp6rmuqd1.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=f921c6badf44b855bc087b875795c97ec5f2e7cd\n\n**US Deposits**\n\nDeposits on checking, time and savings accounts for households are all going down and are currently all¬†**BELOW**¬†levels in 2019. This is indicating that consumers are currently being forced to draw on their savings previously established from the pandemic to survive, or keep up with their perceived levels of consumer spending. This is also inline with what you can hear from retailers, like Amazon, Walmart or fast-food businesses. Customers are becoming more \"value-orientated\", as they look for ways for their dollars to go further.¬†[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/economy/recession-consumer-spending.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/economy/recession-consumer-spending.html)¬†is a great read from multiple earnings calls that highlight this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ie9bbg6smuqd1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=f17952747abb993748550ff348458ef6755f9044\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pecy9ssmuqd1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cbc828d8f9e3ec9d6d7444e4179f686508427d0\n\n\n\nAll data I've presented is publicly available from the US FED or BLS.

Send me a PM of your thoughts.\n\nWhere I think the SPY \"should\" be priced at is a bit nuanced, but my overall answer is \"roughly 15%-30% lower than it is now.\"  If your case of a deteriorating US labor market and US consumer plays out, then maybe closer to the 30% perhaps.  I think it would likely affect the SPY mega-caps, but perhaps with a delayed effect.  The end consumer struggles first, which then causes the business-to-consumer companies that sell to them to struggle, which then in turn causes them to cut spending or close up shop, which then in turn causes the bigger B2B businesses (like Microsoft, Google, Amazon AWS, and Meta) that sell to those B2C businesses (or to some other middle-man B2B intermediaries down the chain) to take a hit in their earnings (but not a catastrophic one or anything like that).  I think some companies are more over-valued than others and may/should take a bigger hit, but I'm feeling too lazy to go through  each one right now.  But I will say this for what I think of overall SPY valuation:\n\nI use sites like [currentmarketvaluation.com](http://currentmarketvaluation.com) and [multipl.com](http://multipl.com) to see what the S&P 500 is valued at overall vs. historical averages.  Currentmarketvaluation shows the S&P 500 Buffet Indicator, CAPE ratio, and Mean Reversion all being above or near 2 standard deviations above historical averages (i.e. - \"Strongly Overvalued\", i.e. - near the red dotted line).  The last 2 times that happened were in 2021 and 1999/2000.  So, that makes me bearish overall. Seeing the sentiment survey on [aaii.com](http://aaii.com) (often a contrarian indicator) leaning so heavily bullish in a historically very over-valued market makes me feel even more bearish.  I feel like best case, the market is fairly valued right now if earnings growth is superb.  If earnings growth is tepid, market is over-valued.  If no earnings growth, even more over-valued.  If earnings decline or recession, extremely over-valued.  But in the meantime, clown market gonna clown market and algos will bubble it higher if they're so determined to do so.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Bagholder spotted.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I just think its wrong to say that INTC has been disliked by gamers for a decade now when a decade ago AMD was definitely below intel in the rankings. I'd say it's only been in the last 5-7 years that AMD has continuously truly upped and upped their components. I remember back then every single time you'd watch any channel that did PC building making some overpowered rig they always utilized intel and nvidia and they were the top performing components, it's in recent years that those same channels have actually started to shed light on AMD and use them in their high-end rigs. AMD is definitely grabbing market share, but saying intel has been hated by gamers for a decade now just isn't accurate. \n\nI think intel gets hate lately because they were complacent the last several years, are much more expensive and pretty much equal performance if not better can be achieved by AMD for a lower price.

Being the former King and struggling in this massively profitable AI era is laughable and they need to do have a lot of catchup.\n\n  \nAnd I'd agree with your final point that AMD did come out of nowhere (in what I'd say has only been in the last like 5-7 years) and blew intel out of the water which definitely does put them a peg above intel in some spheres. AMD used to be so far below intel and today their share price is like 8x that of intels -  and double intel's historical high FROM 20 FUCKING YEARS AGO. The threadripper is definitely a beast but doesn't blow i9 out of the water, they each have their pros and cons and the better one depends on what your use is. I've seen articles say the i9 is better for gaming but also article say threadripper is better. Some will say i9 is better for this and threadripper is better for that they seem to be in relatively equal standing- so it really comes down to your needs and I guess what else you have in your rig as I'd assume comboing a threadripper with an AMD gpu is likely beneficial in some ways compared to mix and matching with nvidia parts but I do know that unlike INTC, nvda's 4090 performance blows the best amd gpus performance out of the water by farrrr so at that point budget comes into play and what nvda vs amd offers in that price range.\n\n  \n(edited to split into two paragraphs)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Incredibly thoughtful insight, much appreciated thanks.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Good discussion brother, now Imma go back to praying my i9 isn‚Äôt one of the ones with those insane defects that are going on üò≠üò≠", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "gamers loved intel until the 7800X3D from AMD", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "yeah, Intel was the only go forever, but for quite a while AMD has been blowing them out of the water.

Here's a breakdown of the main points:\n\n1. Processor comparison: The person is saying that comparing a new chip to an EPYC processor (made by AMD) for AI tasks isn't meaningful. It's like comparing a sports car to a truck for a race - they're not typically used for the same purpose.\n2. What's actually used for AI: Instead of regular processors, AI tasks usually use specialized hardware called GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). These are much better suited for AI work because they can handle many calculations at once.\n3. Adoption challenges: For a new AI chip to be successful, it needs to be significantly more efficient (faster and use less power) than existing options. Also, companies need to trust that the technology will stick around for a while. The person suggests that Intel, who's trying to enter this market, doesn't currently inspire this confidence.\n4. Big tech companies' strategies: Major tech companies like Google, Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft are developing their own specialized AI chips. This means they're less likely to switch to a new option from another company.\n5. AMD's advantage: The person believes AMD (another chip company) has a better chance of competing with NVIDIA (the current leader in AI chips) because their technology is similar and can run the same software with minimal changes.\n6. Intel's approach: Intel's new AI technology (called Gaudi) requires users to modify their existing code to work with it. The person suggests this extra step might not fit well with how companies currently develop AI systems.\n\nIn essence, the main point is that entering the AI chip market is challenging.
