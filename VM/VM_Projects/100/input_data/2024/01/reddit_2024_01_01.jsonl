Your best strategy is to just keep a decent risk allocation and not let any single position become outsized in your portfolio. Basically trim shares to keep the percentage similar in relation to your other assets and roll the money into an index.

So you would sell that down to two shares and then take the $1,500 that you get and throw it into VOO or VTWO which is like the piggy bank position. You always want to keep shoveling money into index funds. Never sell them always accumulate on deals or when you make good profit on individual stocks. This lowers the overall volatility of your portfolio and reduces risk. Save up some more money put on different positions. You're going to have wins and losses but the important part is the index fund always keeps growing. This is how you make money over time in a simplistic trading way. No matter what you don't take money out of the index to buy individual stocks you only keep adding to it. If you mess up and you lose a few thousand dollars on individual stocks, you keep working, you make more money and you try again always building the index fund. Makes sense?

The first of these reasons should be obvious to anyone. This is when a mistake has been made in the original purchase and it becomes increasingly clear that the factual background of the particular company is, by a significant margin, less favorable than originally believed. The proper handling of this type of situation is largely a matter of emotional self-control. To some degree it also depends upon the investor‚Äôs ability to be honest with himself.\"\n\nHe has a great section on the psychology of selling a stock:\n\n\"However, there is a complicating factor that makes the handling of investment mistakes more difficult. This is the ego in each of us. None of us likes to admit to himself that he has been wrong. If we have made a mistake in buying a stock but can sell the stock at a small profit, we have somehow lost any sense of having been foolish. On the other hand, if we sell at a small loss we are quite unhappy about the whole matter. This reaction, while completely natural and normal, is probably one of the most dangerous in which we can indulge ourselves in the entire investment process.\"\n\nI know you were just asking about AMD in particular, but these principles have been really helpful for me.
