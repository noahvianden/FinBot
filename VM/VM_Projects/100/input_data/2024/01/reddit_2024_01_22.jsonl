That was actually an outstanding investment, so congrats on your success. So, does your broker allow you to buy options in your Roth account?

Here is a simple strategy:\r  \n**Options Straddle**\r  \nAn options straddle can be used to hedge a stock position. A straddle is a neutral options strategy that involves simultaneously buying both a put option and a call option for the underlying security with the same strike price and the same expiration date.\r  \nA trader will profit from a long straddle when the price of the security rises, or falls from the strike price by an amount more than the total cost of the premium paid. The profit potential is virtually unlimited, so long as the price of the underlying security moves very sharply.\r  \nHere’s an example: If a trader believes that a stock may rise or fall from its current price of $55 following the release of its latest earnings report, they could create a straddle. The trader would look to purchase one put and one call at the $55 strike with an expiration date of March 15. To determine the cost of creating the straddle, the trader would add the price of one March 15 $55 call and one March 15 $55 put. If both the calls and the puts trade for $2.50 each, the total outlay or premium paid would be $5.00 for the two contracts.\r  \nThis strategy is most effective when considering heavily volatile investments; without strong price movement, the premiums paid on multiple options may easily outweigh any potential profit.\r  \nRemember, options trading involves risks and costs, so it’s important to understand them fully before implementing. It’s also crucial to consider factors like liquidity, transaction costs, and tax implications.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You can sell half of it and invest in other stocks, check my profile where i posted list of stocks.

Basically, Sanda met Kinoko Nasu and was interested in writing a detective series set in the world of magecraft, and the LN was the result of this unusual collaboration. The core of the Lord El-Melloi II Case Files LN is rooted in classic detective fiction and is influenced heavily by the writings of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle, among others.\n\nThe anime heavily modifies the source material to bring it closer in line with previous animated Fate installments, so over half of the show is anime-original. The only LN-sourced arc for this show is the Rail Zeppelin arc, for which it is named and which occupies fully half of the show's 13 episodes run. The remainder is anime-original, but carefully integrated with the Rail Zeppelin arc in order to seamlessly merge original and LN-sourced content.\n\nBecause of the show's alterations, it focuses more heavily on Waver's motives. It has been 10 years since the events of Fate/Zero. He is better known now as Lord El-Melloi II after having taken up the name and the Lordship in an agreement with the official heir, Reines El-Melloi Archisorte. She is the niece of Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald, who was last seen exploding all his innards onto the floor during the 4th Fuyuki HGW. Reines is too young to take up the mantle of Lord, and Waver found himself with little to do and a lot to think about after the events of Fate/Zero. Now he is a Temporary Lord, acting in Reines's stead until she is old enough to officially accept her role as the head of the Archibald family and become one of the Twelve Lords of the Clock Tower. He spends his days as a professor at the Clock Tower navigating the cutthroat politics of the mages while solving various mysteries, mostly murders, that confront him in the world of magic.\n\nIf what I have written so far is complete gibberish to you, then you are definitely not the intended audience for this show. It is deeply immersed in the lore and world created by Nasu for the Fate franchise. The show draws heavily from knowledge of the world you are implied to have if you are a fan of Fate, plus you won't be able to enjoy the numerous characters who cross over from other Fate entries. This was true for the LN/manga and goes doubly for the anime.\n\nNewly added to this adaptation, distinguishing it from the source material, are anime-original characters who cross over from all corners of the Fate multiverse. Another version of Caules Forvedge actually appears in the LN but he is joined in the anime by Kairi Sisigou, both from Fate/Apocrypha. Luvia Edelfelt, who has also appeared in multiple other Fate works, joins the cast as well. Flat Escardos originally came from this LN and has since gone on to become a main character in Fate/Strange Fake. Most surprising though is the addition of Olga-Marie Animusphere, the daughter of Marisbury Animusphere and one of FGO's critical supporting characters. This version of Olga-Marie is both very cute and an entertaining addition to the Rail Zeppelin story.\n\nThis show ended up being one of the most pleasant surprises I've experienced in some years. The history of Fate-derived shows has generally been a mixed bag. I'm going to be completely honest here, this show took my completely nonexistent expectations, charged them up like a giant glowing magical lance and fired them straight into the Sun.  This show was a giant bag of fun, and it channels the spirit of classic detective fiction while mixing it with the strange magecraft of the Nasuverse. The Rail Zeppelin arc itself, which is considered the most popular arc for LN readers, is a straight up homage to Christie's beloved Murder on the Orient Express but infuses the mystery with magic. \n\nUnexpectedly, it's one of the best Fate-derived works I've watched in years, and I'm saying this as someone who has watched the Fate/Stay Night Heaven's Feel movies. It's that good, assuming you're already a fan of this franchise. It's one of the few shows I've ever watched where I legit want to find the fan translations of the LN and read them. I know there's many more cases like Rail Zeppelin in the first LN, and now there is a sequel LN also being translated. Sometimes, all you really need to do is add a bit of mystery novel to an unrelated franchise and magic unironically happens.", "score": -8, "replies": []}, {"body": "So they always send new fsd version late evening or very late.

{"title": "Tesla is 1T+ valuation easily", "selftext": "Now I won’t go full regard on you guys and say you should 0DTE calls or 7DTE calls. But I do think in the coming few months, Tesla will rally big and can end this year with a 1T+ valuation. \nWhy?\nFSD (Full Self Driving) \nWe all know other car manufacturers are catching up to Tesla’s electric cars. Their range is similar, they drive well and the only reason now to buy a Tesla, is because of the supercharger network that is unmatched in US (which is also slowly being opened to other cars). So yes, it’s true tech specification wise, other car manufacturers are catching up and at this rate they might catch up in a few years in sales too. But Daddy Elon has an ace up his sleeve. \nThat ace is Tesla Self Driving. Full disclosure, I own a Tesla with FSD, and I own other cars and I can confidently say no other car manufacture is even attempting to do what Tesla is doing. The closest I’ve seen is some videos of Chinese car manufacturers attempting something like Tesla, but the bottom line is Tesla is way ahead of the competition, rest of the competition is not even trying. \n\nThe only issue is that even though Tesla is way ahead, their product is kind of garbage. You can’t use it with any consistency so it makes no difference to the user experience with or without FSD. It certainly does not affect sales of Tesla cars in any significant way. But I have strong reason to believe this product will follow a trend like ChatGPT. \n\nFor all you regards who entered AI in the last year, you probably have no idea of the real history of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It was not a linear continuous improvement. It was not we kept slowly getting better with our chatbot and finally it became good enough to become ChatGPT. No you see, it was a sudden step size improvement that shocked most researchers in the field. You see OpenAI released GPT1 which could barely spell correctly and seemed useful for pure research. Then OpenAI released GPT2 which had a lot of hype because researchers were “afraid” of releasing it to the world and when we finally saw it, it tended to create grammatically ok sentences but most of the time it was incoherent and didn’t even make as much sense as a toddler. Then came GPT-3, at which point OpenAI was spending millions upon millions training this model. GPT3 and 3.5 seemed kinda useful if you prompted it really well. In fact many companies popped up that just prompted GPT3 really well and created text for copywriting etc, but a good 50%+ of the time you used to get nonsensical responses. It didn’t feel like you were talking to a human. There was a general feeling among researchers I spoke to, that this scaling experiment from OpenAI failed, there is a missing piece to human intelligence etc etc. Then suddenly came ChatGPT, it always held a conversation with you. Yes it could give you wrong answers, but it always gave answers that made sense, you understood what it was trying to convey to you. This proved OpenAI’s thesis that just scaling worked .\n\n\nAll this to say that it looks like the technology does not work until it just suddenly starts working. Tesla is now doing the same thing for FSD that OpenAI did, they are using pure scale, the human hand engineering has been pushed to a minimum. This in my view is the correct approach to self driving, and so in the coming year with the release of Version 12, the first end to end neural network trained Self driving model, I think they will have made the breakthrough needed to solve driving and the market has not priced this in. Version 12.1 has reportedly started going out to select customers, which is why I’m so confident that EoY is a good timeline for Tesla. It will be the second big revolution that occurs due to AI. 1T+ to me seems easy, much more likely to reach 2T+ eventually.

There was hope that China can improve in the future. The hope is now too unlikely to happen.

The most obvious thing is that Xi will be the first president since Mao to keep his power till his death. His third term (since 2023) effectively killed any hope that China can become democratic. A more democratic China was more or less priced in like 5-10 years ago. \n\nThe population growth is doomed.
