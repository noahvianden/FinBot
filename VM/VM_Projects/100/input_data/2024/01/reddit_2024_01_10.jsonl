Apple is the most valuable company by selling phones and having an app store.

FSD won't take 5-7 years but is more likely 18-36 months away. My rationale is the compute. Recall this [tweet](https://twitter.com/Tesla_AI/status/1671589874686730270/photo/1), when posted it looks like Tesla had possibly between 10,000 and 20,000 A100 equivalent GPU's worth of compute. That was 6 months ago, assuming this projection was correct, they now have over 100,000, and they'll have 300,000 by year end.  \nThere isn't any limitation from an architecture perspective as to why FSD can't be superhuman, we know that neural networks can approximate any function to an arbitrary level of accuracy given enough training examples and training time, and driving itself is simply a complex function.  \nUnlike LLMs whose training set is limited, Tesla will continue to grow their training set exponentially as they sell more cars. They can query the fleet for specific cases to improve accuracy. If they need more rainy conditions they can do that easily, if they need more roundabouts, they can do that too, there's nothing from a data perspective holding them back.  \nIt's literally just compute now. Elon has specifically said that V12 got scary good once it was trained with a certain amount of samples, this is how neural networks work. There is a phenomenon where if you just train for a very long time, you can have a sudden drop in model loss even after it appeared the model had converged on a minimum loss, last time I check it's not exactly known why this happens, but functionally speaking the model is getting stuck in a local minimum and very long training times can help the model find a new, lower local minimum. My point is that compute in itself can actually have an effect on model performance, not to mention larger compute clusters with more distributed video memory will allow for significally more data to be used in training which will also significantly improve training.  \nI know it seems like FSD progress is slow, and it seems linear from an outsider's perspective, but we're talking about a 20x in compute from Jun 2023 to Dec 2024, that is an absolutely insane increase and I honestly think the progress we will see this year will be stunning, I think this will be the FSD breakout year and I say this purely because of the end-2-end architecture paired with the massive increase in compute. People are sleeping on this.\n2. I think Cybertruck will have positive margins before 2025, I think the ramp will actually go better than expected. I have 90,000 sold for the year, let's see what happens.\n3. I think next-gen production will begin in december this year, and it will be announced weeks prior to first deliveries.\n\nUnrelated to your post, but I think after Mexico, only 2 additional factories will be announced for car production. There will be Fremont, Shanghai, Berlin, Austin, Mexico, Unannounced 1, and Unannounced 2 making 7 car producing factories in total. The existing factories (minus Fremont) will simply expand, and we'll hit 20m in 2031 and just under 17m for 2030 with 11.5m of that 17m coming from 25k car and vaiants.\n\nI think energy could have as many as 15 factories, but I expect they will have joint facilities like Berlin, or they could simply just scale out existing factories like Austin, don't know enough about Tesla's energy plans, we'll see.\n\nShare price?

I literally gave you an example of this in my comment - Martha Stewart, who traded on MNPI, had her trades ultimately found to be legal as she was not an insider.\n\nI don't know who put together that summary but it's not very good.\n\nIt cites Dirks v. SEC and claims Dirks says \"the Court held that a prosecutor could charge tip recipients with insider trading liability if the recipient had reason to believe that the information‚Äôs disclosure violated another‚Äôs fiduciary duty and if the recipient personally gained from acting upon the information\". But that's not really what Dirks says.\n\nLets look at the case itself:\n\n>The SEC's position that a tippee who knowingly receives nonpublic material information from an insider invariably has a fiduciary duty to disclose before trading rests on the erroneous theory that the antifraud provisions require equal information among all traders. A duty to disclose arises from the relationship between parties, and not merely from one's ability to acquire information because of his position in the market\n\nNow in detail\n\n>>We were explicit in Chiarella in saying that **there can be no duty to disclose where the person who has traded on inside information was not [the corporation's] agent, . . . was not a fiduciary, [or] was not a person in whom the sellers [of the securities] had placed their trust and confidence.\"**\n\n...\n\n> Here, the SEC maintains that anyone who knowingly receives nonpublic material information from an insider has a fiduciary duty to disclose before trading....**This conflicts with the principle set forth in Chiarella that only some persons, under some circumstances, will be barred from trading while in possession of material nonpublic information.**\n\n>Judge Wright correctly read our opinion in Chiarella as repudiating any notion that all traders must enjoy equal information before trading: \"[T]he 'information' theory is rejected. Because the disclose-or-refrain duty is extraordinary, **it attaches only when a party has legal obligations other than a mere duty to comply with the general antifraud proscriptions in the federal securities laws.\"**\n\n...\n\n>Imposing a duty to disclose or abstain solely because a person knowingly receives material nonpublic information from an insider and trades on it could have an inhibiting influence on the role of market analysts, which the SEC itself recognizes is necessary to the preservation of a healthy market. [Footnote 17] It is commonplace for analysts to \"ferret out and analyze information,\" 21 S.E.C. Docket at 1406, [Footnote 18] and this often is done by meeting with and questioning corporate officers and others who are insiders. And information that the analysts\n\nLet's get to tippees\n\n>Thus, a tippee assumes a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of a corporation not to trade on material nonpublic information **only when the insider has breached his fiduciary duty to the shareholders by disclosing the information to the tippee and the tippee knows or should know that there has been a breach**\n\n>[T]ippee responsibility must be related back to insider responsibility by a necessary finding that the tippee knew the information was given to him in breach of a duty by a person having a special relationship to the issuer not to disclose the information\n\nSo a duty exists only when 1) insider has breached, and 2) tippee knows or should know that there was a breach. \"Knows or should know\" is a very different standard from \"reason to believe\" like the summary claims. But wait, there's more:\n\n> **Thus, the test is whether the insider personally will benefit, directly or indirectly, from his disclosure. Absent some personal gain, there has been no breach of duty to stockholders. And absent a breach by the insider, there is no derivative breach.**\n\nSo the insider has to personally benefit somehow from this disclosure in order for it to be a breach. You are almost always only going to see those in quid pro quo or family relationships. A stranger, complete outsider, is pretty much never going to be found to be an insider. And as the Court rules:\n\n>Under the inside trading and tipping rules set forth above, we find that there was no actionable violation by Dirks. \n\n>**It is undisputed that Dirks himself was a stranger to Equity Funding, with no preexisting fiduciary duty to its shareholders**\n\n>He took no action, directly or indirectly, that induced the shareholders or officers of Equity Funding to repose trust or confidence in him. There was no expectation by Dirks' sources that he would keep their information in confidence. Nor did Dirks misappropriate or illegally obtain the information about Equity Funding\n\n>Unless the insiders breached their Cady, Roberts duty to shareholders in disclosing the nonpublic information to Dirks, he breached no duty when he passed it on to investors as well as to the Wall Street Journal. **It is clear that neither Secrist nor the other Equity Funding employees violated their Cady, Roberts duty to the corporation's shareholders by providing information to Dirks. The tippers received no monetary or personal benefit for revealing Equity Funding's secrets, nor was their purpose to make a gift of valuable information to Dirks**\n\nNone of this is in the Cornell summary which just broadly claims 'reason to believe' + RECIPIENT personally gained = derivative insider trading. Which is incorrect. It's 1) breach, also which requires the INSIDER to personally gain from the disclosure, and 2) know or should know that the insider breached.\n\nIf there's no quid pro quo, existing relationship, or family/friend kickbacks you are almost never going to prove the insider personally gained from the disclosure. If the outsider is your normal person who is not some stock or corporate expert, good luck proving know or should know unless there's proof the insider said 'this is MNPI and I am breaching by telling you this.'", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The general public is most definitely outside the plane though where the door landed.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Sure, but my point is it doesn't matter if the general public knew or not.

The government is clearly benefiting from something unique. \n\nThe answer: Inflation. Not consumer prices, but \\*real\\* inflation. \n\nHere is real inflation:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sfcu8dgmlmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc2eace6e4ffd2c1d68d0c9647f2ea75b01d50ba\n\nHere is government-reported inflation (consumer prices):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b8hvvejnlmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a77e0882cc521daaa014e422c7d7020a5970205\n\nAnd here is real inflation compared to government-reported inflation:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ff20tfolmbc1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=369e27f7d5f1a771202344f1223b198a34f10bd8\n\nMost of the difference between these two values is the productivity gains that the government has stolen from you. \n\nThey do this by conflating CPI with real inflation. \n\n\\----\n\nInflation is not prices, inflation is the expansion of the money supply. \n\nImagine that the aggregate productivity increases of globalization (to use just one example) should have translated into a 10% decrease in consumer prices across the board.\n\nEnter, Keynesian Economics. A decrease in consumer prices is bad! Without much evidence to support it, the assumption is that a reduction in consumer prices will create a negative feedback loop that will cause Recession. \n\nEnter, The Federal Reserve. Their Keynesian mandate: a 2% year-over-year increase in consumer prices, and they‚Äôll inflate the money supply at what ever level is necessary to achieve this.\n\nThe result is that the entire benefit of any productivity increases that should have been realized by the consumer through reduced prices is stolen by The Federal Reserve through monetary inflation.\n\nThe primary benefactor of this becomes the government, who will realize a relative reduction in the real value of their massive debt and deficit burdens, allowing them to rapidly expand both - in real terms, not just nominally - as shown in the charts above.\n\nThis works, effectively, as an average 100% tax on all productivity gains that society has generated (and will generate) since our abandonment of sound money in the early 1970s. \n\n\\---\n\nYou are a squirrel gathering nuts. You are allowed to keep only what you gather, less capital gains tax, of course. The only entity allowed to grow in real terms and in league with the technological advancements of humanity is the government ‚Äì and this will continue until we return to sound money that is backed by something finite. \n\nThis is a lesson that has already been taught by history before. It‚Äôs the entire reason the country was founded on sound money to begin with, and, sadly, it‚Äôs a lesson that‚Äôs going to have to be eventually retaught again.

However, ETF issuers are required to adhere to strict rules about transparency and fair dealing. This includes disclosing the ETF's holdings, which helps prevent the issuer from engaging in unfair practices like loading up on an asset before it becomes part of the ETF's portfolio.\n\nWhile the specifics can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the exact nature of the ETF, in major financial markets like the United States, the regulatory environment overseen by bodies such as the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is designed to prevent such practices and ensure that the market operates fairly and efficiently.\n\nGiven this context, it's unlikely and generally not permissible for ETF issuers to load up on underlying assets beforehand in a way that would give them an unfair advantage or manipulate the market.
