Set up an emergency fund. If retirement is the goal get started as soon as you can try give yourself the longest time possible invested. Stick to your plan (have a decent plan). If you will only be invested for a short time don't go all risky trying to make up the money, if you have less time less risk. This is a simple, will help a lot of people kind of advice.\n\nFor myself\n\nI started investing roughly 2-3 months before a crash guess that would have been around 2000 was a one time thing at that time so wasn't really able to buy the dip. \n\nFinished schooling / other smaller jobs and had started training to be a financial advisor around 2007. This was my second time I was able to add money to investments. Guess I had good timing, that being said I was lucky to not have to sell.\n\nIt was amazing how many calls the office we has with clients wanting to sell. Overall the advice was to stick to the plan and if possible invest a bit more if they could.\n\nI was in a way unlucky, as some issues didn't allow me to continue putting the same amount of money in each month. A bit unlocked I guess but was still able to keep my funds invested.\n\nThe bigger problem happened to the ones that needed to pull their money out. Let's say job loss at the same time as the market dropped. This is why having a emergency fund is important.\n\nThe thing is we don't know what will happen in the future and honestly you will learn in time that people telling you this will happen or that will happen will end up being wrong a lot of the time.\n\nSo again, set up a good plan. Honestly for a lot of people this can be as simple as a few etf's. Be consistent with the plan and you will \"probably\" be fine.\n\nI won't say that timing is useless, but I like to think of it as I get my core plan in place regardless of what is happening. I will time things by buying a bit more when the markets drop.\n\nFor the people that need to try and time or attempt to beat the market, I would suggest you pick a % of your investment to do that with. Perhaps you like investing with etf's or perhaps you are a stock picker, or a dividend investor. We can argue about what could work out best here but a reminder it doesn't have to be black or white. You don't need to only do one thing.\n\nA simple example, I can invest 50% ETF 25% single stocks and 25% dividends if I want to. That being said have the core of the investment following the plan. \n\nI could probably be fine trying to speculate with 10% of my investments not so much 50%. Again suggest you have a core plan in place.\n\nAnyway hopefully this is helpful for you. Oh and some times it helps to not follow it every day.

Off the bat try to save something like 5% of your paycheck as soon as you get it. Try to think of it like any other bill you have to pay.\n\nThe reason I think this is so helpful is often times if you try to save with what is left over at the end of the month you find out there is nothing really there to save. Had you put the 5% away right at the beginning you wouldn't really miss it as it's already gone. That had worked for me at least. I know it has helped others as well.\n\nI would hear all the time well next month I will put more away because (add something that happened) so next month I will make it up.

I will plan for things to happen every few months I have a (oh sh*t) set up into the budget. If something happens I can usually have enough saved to deal with it. If nothing happens for a while and there starts to be a lot in there I take half and invest it. \n\nI also know things will break so let's say you own a car, you know at some point you will need new tires.

Instead of buying $200 options, well....now i had the \"bankroll\" and \"skills\" to finance $400-600+ options that would build my bankrolll even higher.\n\nThe combination of A) GREED from seeing your money and numbers going up so damn quickly and B) FOMO and JEALOUSY from seeing how every bozo on the internet is making a fuck ton of easy money triggers something so incredibly PRIMAL and uncontrollable. The vast majority of people just lose control and double down. You don't hear about it because people almost never go around talking about how much they lost.\n\nAnd in my \"long term\" account i thought my risk was managed expertly when i took out about $8k in margin against the like $24K in assets in the acount because they were lending it out at like 1.5% or 2% interest. I figured worst case i'd be stuck paying a couple hundred bucks a year in interest or whateever and wait until the market goes up, or i have the assets to cover the margin. (little did i know that later on interest rates would just keep raising HIGHER AND HIGHER and that 1.5% interest rate turned into an 8% rate as the value of my portfolio kept dropping because i started to mix riskier plays into this account too.. I really couldn't believe that, the interest thing - never saw it coming)\n\nThen the market turned. I was also buying what i thought to be growth stocks with a promising future. Really these were just extremely high risk, smaller cap companies riding the wave. My options started dropping in value....aggressively. Things just kept going down. Lose $900 on an option that is now worth $60. Watch my $800 cost in a company lose like $60% value in a few weeks. I couldn't bear to sell some option i had paid $600 for for like $220 so i just kinda stupidly waited.\n\nIt was just a steady trend down...and down...and down, and the more things sank the more depressed i got about it and disgusted that i lost all of that money and just ignored even looking at it. A good portion of those companies went under or filed bankruptcy. Down until my $25k portfolio eventually ended up being worth about $2500 in fall of 2023.\n\nThe biotech stuff was basically ALL down around -85% to -95% across the board. The \"growth\" companies are like anywhere from -55% to -85% for most of them save for 1 or 2 that ran up like 100%. And of course thousands and thousands of call options expired worthless or i sold them for tens of dollars.\n\nI couldn't even bare to really look at the account until just this month. Luckily the robinhood account is up to like $4200, i started paying more attention to it, took profit on the stuff that went up, solid the trash for tax losses to claim and i do feel like a lot of stuff left in there is higher conviction for me and will go up enough eventually to make my original $7k back with patience.\n\nAll in all - i lost more money than i had ever seen, and it was extraordinarily painful, but truthfully, i think it was worth it and i would do it again. The only way people learn is by getting their face ripped off. I probably learned more about investing through losing all that than i did from the countless hours i spend reseaching. I have a completely different view on investing and risk now. And honestly in my mind i had \"written off\" that original $7k as high risk fun money. I consider myself lucky that this lesson was more or less break even for me instead of being like 38 and risking some $70K in savings or something. And it was honestly a crazy, insanely fun ride (at least the first year or so lol)\n\nA piece of advice. You will NEVER time the market in any truly meaningful way. If you could every hedge fund in the world would want to hire you. It's easy to sit there and say you'll \"wait\" for a crash, but that's bullocks. In a turbulent or bear market you don't know WHERE the fuck things are going to go, where the bottom is, when you should start buying, when you should stop buying. You have NO idea when a crash is coming, and most people don't keep nearly enough cash ready and waiting in their brokerage when it happens. So they spend weeks waiting for paychecks, and trying to transfer money around and try to read up on stocks at the last minute, waste a lot of time.\n\nOr the market drops 20% and then you get your dollar bills all ready to fire off for the big crash when it drops another 20% but it shoots back up. \"Oh shit i missed the bottom, maybe that was it guess i have to buy now before it keeps going higher!\" NOPE. Market decides to drop another 20%, then another 40%, but you've already put your money in at what you thought was a good time and now you're down like 60% or whatever it is. And it just KEEPS going down. \n\nDo you have the stomach to invest a couple grand into a market going down quickly, thinking it's the bottom and promptly watch like 50-60% of the value of your money just disappear calmly? And then keep buying at even lower prices because you did your research and have high conviction in the companies? Starting out you WILL buy stocks and you WILL watch with a knot in your stomach as those stocks just start dropping despite your careful plans. And then you WILL watch with regret as it rebounds and keeps going up...and up...and up, until you kick yourself because the kid down the street made like $10k \"Easily\" and you didn't put nearly enough in at the bottom because you we're fucking terrified that it would just evaporate because everyone is moaning about how much further it could drop and now the stock is \"overvalued\" to you and you're scared to pay too much for it in case it drops again.\n\nGood luck! Buy safe shit, only buy companies you actually really like and understand at prices youre happy with owning them at, and buy frequently, in smaller amounts and buy a lot of different sectors, and different specializations within those sectors.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Well the market is kind of crashing now, if not crashing then it’s been really bad last two trading days.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Absolutely.

With that many 250C open, MM is delta hedging lots of shares for all those. Right now it's kinda acting like a magnet since there's so many there. As the expiration comes up, if TSLA doesn't push past that to put those ITM and start a gamma squeeze, then they start to decay away quickly. This leads MM to not have to hedge for those calls anymore. Max pain is 220 and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets to 220-230 for the Jan opex unless sentiment and volume changes in preparation for earnings the following week.\n\nAs for earnings, it's going to be tough. Unless Tesla pulls something out of their hat, TTM EPS is going to drop like 15%. That means to keep their high PE ratio, the share price will drop 15%.

But at the same time they did lower prices on base price and also offer higher inventory discounts in the US (last quarter cheapest M3 was 36220, this quarter 35090).\n\nSo if the market does react poorly to sub par earnings (not saying it will or it won't since no one can predict the market) and the share price goes back to 200 or lower, will that cause financial stress? If it does, that's when you should hedge your position in one way or another. Sell calls at strikes where you're happy selling at. Buy puts at strikes where you definitely don't want the share price falling below. If TSLA falls, now you're protected to the downside. If TSLA does outperform and moons again, you've now capped gains at a strike you're happy selling at anyways (and can always join rolling gang to get even higher).\n\nIf a dropping share price doesn't cause financial stress and you're in it/believe for the long term, just keep accumulating shares until you're at a share count you're happy with. Short and even longer term call options are a pure gamble until macro settles out, threat of Elon selling shares goes away, Tesla starts making more money one way or another.\n\nOnce again, this is from my low risk point of view where the risk of losing money outweighs the benefit of making a lot more.
