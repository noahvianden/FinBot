{"title": "I found the catalyst for the 2024 crash", "selftext": "As stated in my prior post, 2024 is the year of both our new all time highs and the start of our heading back to COVID lows. Be it 2024 achieves those lows or 2025, they will certainly be revisited. But we can't just magically get there because things \\*look\\* bad. Something has to actually go wrong before we see any real fireworks.\n\nJuly 26th 2023, the fed achieved its final rate hike. There will not be anymore rate hikes. Rate cuts are the real threat to the markets. There is a current narrative out there along the lines of the market expecting rate cuts this year.\n\n**The Narrative**: Unemployment is low (3.7%). Core PCE went up only 2% Q/Q. Y/Y Core PCE sported a nice 2.9% today. Earnings have not been terrible. People are making money and still buying luxury goods. Money is still flowing, its safe. The fed can simply begin \"normalizing\" rate policy with small cuts as inflation begins to cool off.\n\nThis narrative overlooks the current risks which I will outline below. Rate cuts are NOT a sign of strength, they are a sign of weakness. They are a sign something has gone wrong and stimulation is now needed.\n\n**Bank Term Funding Program**\n\nTheres a free money train the banks have been riding from the fed called the Bank Term Funding Program. This program began in March of 2023 and it ends March 11th. See below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/g6bbixob68fc1.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff99ac06a45f242abf7e94ce310c6f3eb4ac30ed)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-allow-emergency-bank-lending-program-expire-march-11-2024-01-25/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-allow-emergency-bank-lending-program-expire-march-11-2024-01-25/)\n\nIn the article, they explain that not only is the fed stopping the funding March 11th, but they just raised the rates on the loans 50 BSP as of yesterday.\n\nHeres a cool chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ve54w7qg68fc1.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b83f2882880f1567dde3b56e5a4ca4aa9e65c0b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow just what has that pesky market done during all this borrwing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[+28&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/wkdupaok68fc1.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=75ce9c067de1f915170652fd82b63466d73dad11)\n\nSPY went up 28% so far since the weekend that program began.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fcxucmq68fc1.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf61cd8de90ef7e41ce2db016f424b8a7323142\n\nAbove I measured the program from its first \"peak\". That hilariously enough was 20%. Generally you'll notice index's do these macro moves to around 20% up and stop. So now we have to face the hard reality that banks wont have access to more free money March 11th. Notice how this ends in March by the way. March is when they all started talking about the rate cuts starting.\n\nSo if I had to guess, the odds went up for trouble to occur when this program ends. As the fed could have theoretically kept the door open, March remained unlikely. But when it ends, trouble is expected.\n\n**CRE debt looms**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/9ipw8aby68fc1.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf2e497648628a64abd45912e778122c6001f435)\n\n[https://www.chicagobusiness.com/commercial-real-estate/chicago-area-commercial-prope](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/commercial-real-estate/chicago-area-commercial-prope)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/lmgyex1378fc1.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf469b87ec16e843374cc5d193748aa470de628b)\n\n[https://sfstandard.com/2024/01/13/billion-commercial-mortgages-san-francisco-union-square/](https://sfstandard.com/2024/01/13/billion-commercial-mortgages-san-francisco-union-square/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0z0y8wl678fc1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a666e21f4142f12c3676a56ffc60fa5596f6f19)\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/4ed9e5b0-f3de-422a-9a07-a328ebf2340c](https://www.ft.com/content/4ed9e5b0-f3de-422a-9a07-a328ebf2340c)\n\nThis quote explains the dilemma at hand for CRE:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vbutanud78fc1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=f72479e9af51819f455154ccfff596cfa501eefa\n\nTo be honest, the fact that all these commercial real estate loans face baloon payments that are due at the  end of the loan term THE DAY ITS DUE, which happens to be by the end of this year, it's kinda scary.\n\nThe last real estate crisis we had involved loans just like this. The mortgage industry as a whole generally phased out the concept of any baloon payments. Loans like this were common leading into the 08 crash and played a major role in forcing forclosure activity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/df1giy3i78fc1.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&s=bea1abb5eeb47e43ee635f22ddd0ef1ec3f9f3a1\n\nConsider the highlights above. this is about the 2008 crisis. The seeds were already there and the setup was basically a forced move into forclosures then. It will be no different this time around, just for the commercial sector.\n\nIt also does not help the lack of natural demand for office space.\n\nSince the pandemic, work from home has invaded the workforce. It simply is not going away. With this being a major factor, demand is not the same anymore. With demand not being there, prices for the underlying buildings will go down. Since refinance time is coming, defaults are looking more likely.\n\nThis is just another reason why the fed is expected to cut rates, because it's expected to save the economy from \"something\".\n\nTo add to this, the banks have been preparing in advance for something they already know is going to happen since the summer of 2023:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/2haivhfn78fc1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=d246f16b4356e6f1968522f3b898220bf5959491)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-banks-increase-reserves-commercial-real-estate-exposure-2023-07-21/](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-banks-increase-reserves-commercial-real-estate-exposure-2023-07-21/)\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n\nWe have a timetable, shoot we even have some hard dates. The banks for the last 10 months had access to cheap money to cover whatever they need. To date they have apparently needed $160B. Looming CRE debt stands at $117B this year. To put this amount of money in context, the amount borrowed is about the market cap of Wells Fargo right now (who has a sizeable CRE portfolio). Once the lending program is over, the banks will not have access to easy liqidity forcing them to simply absorb whatever happens. The fed may step in \\*when\\* that happens, but if history is any gauge it will be too little too late.\n\n**The historical time table:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bsupdq4s78fc1.png?width=1655&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cf70b01df759d8e7ba6ef448b86143b93e0cad9\n\nFed policy typical goes in 3 phases. Hiking phase, pause phase and cutting phase. Currently since the fed completed its last rate hike, SPY is up 7.6% after having dropped 9.95%. As the fed last hiked in July, we are in the \"pause\" phase with a +7.6% gain so far. This is higher than the tech bubble, which saw a 4.77% gain during the pause phase. But we are much lower than the housing crisis which saw a wild 22.5% before it peaked. Every scenario is different and these are just interesting estimates I simply find interesting and nothing more. One thing I do count on however is that psycology and \"those who remember\" will potentially act out a similar time table or price action again that is common through all of the events.\n\nWhat is really more important than anything else is the \\*cutting\\* phase. As all things in common are that the cuts are a symptom of a one way trip down. The housing crisis saw a pop of 3.49% and a decline of 51.15%. Nice lil half off sale. Then even the tech buble saw a lil 2.5% gain followed up by a 42.87% decline from its first rate cut.\n\nSo if one thing is obvious, its that the rates themselves dont \"matter\" (they do obviously) if your trying to determine what is too high or low for the markets to handle. Its the policy shifts that act as the canary in the coal mine. They are a sypmtom, not the disease itself.\n\n**How long can the fed go?**\n\nThe tech bubble pause phase lasted 7 months and 3 days. The housing crisis pause phase lasted 14 months, 2 weeks and 6 days. If we translated that to our time table from our last rate hike to the first rate cut we get the following:\n\nTech bubble cycle: Feb 29th 2024\n\nHousing crisis: Oct 16 2024\n\nI highly doubt either of these dates are important. If history is any guide, its that the cut won't be on either of these dates or those respective months. BUT you will keep hearing about rate cuts around these dates ONLY BECAUSE of the psycological scarring on the old heads and naturally because of the underlying risks ahead.\n\n**TLDR;** A free money train is ending for the banks who have been socking away billions of dollars in anticipation of CRE loan defaults by the end of 2024. This rally has been natural and if anything historically anticipated. The decline and the phases will also be natural and historically anticipated.\n\nCheers'", "id": "1ad9qme", "created_utc": 1706467578.0, "score": 370, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 305, "comments": [{"body": "So you build your bear thesis on the possible default of $117Bn of CRE debt and drawing lines to the 2008 financial crisis?

Key points include:  \n1. \\*\\*Final Federal Reserve Rate Hike\\*\\*: July 26, 2023, marked the last rate hike by the Federal Reserve, with future rate cuts considered a potential threat to markets.  \n2. \\*\\*Current Market Narrative\\*\\*: Low unemployment (3.7%), moderate Core PCE growth (2% quarterly, 2.9% yearly), stable earnings, and continued luxury spending suggest a positive outlook. This could lead to small rate cuts as inflation cools.  \n3. \\*\\*Rate Cuts as a Weakness Indicator\\*\\*: The author argues that rate cuts are not a sign of economic strength but rather indicate a need for stimulation due to underlying issues.  \n4. \\*\\*Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP)\\*\\*: The BTFP, providing banks with low-cost funds from the Federal Reserve since March 2023, is set to end on March 11, 2024. This coincides with talks of rate cuts and a significant market rise (SPY up 28%) since the program's start.  \n5. \\*\\*Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Debt\\*\\*: CRE loans face balloon payments by the end of 2024, reminiscent of practices leading to the 2008 financial crisis. This, coupled with reduced demand for office space due to remote work, raises concerns about defaults.  \n6. \\*\\*Banks Preparing for Trouble\\*\\*: Banks have been bolstering their reserves in anticipation of CRE loan defaults, with borrowing totaling around $160 billion.  \n7. \\*\\*Federal Reserve's Policy Phases\\*\\*: The post-hike \"pause\" phase sees SPY up 7.6%, indicating a unique situation compared to past crises like the tech bubble and housing crisis. Rate cuts usually signal a significant market downturn.  \n8. \\*\\*Prediction of Future Federal Reserve Actions\\*\\*: The post speculates on the timing of the first rate cut, drawing parallels to past crises but noting that the exact date is uncertain.  \nIn summary, the post warns of an impending financial crisis due to the end of the BTFP, looming CRE debt, and potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, drawing comparisons to past market downturns.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Couldn’t have summarized it better myself", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It’s important to note that on the CRE deals with balloon payments, many of those borrowers are often expecting to refinance the loan at maturity.

The Federal Reserve's rate cuts are often preemptive, aimed at staving off potential economic downturns rather than being reactive to existing problems.\n3.

It's essential to differentiate between the short-term liquidity crunch and long-term solvency issues; the former can be addressed with policy tools.\n5. The assumption that work-from-home trends will permanently decrease office space demand doesn't account for the potential rebound as the pandemic recedes.\n6.

They only make X amount, they only sold X amount, and Elon said/did this today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it were as easy as looking at what a company currently is, or what they have done, everyone would be rich.  That is not how investing works.  There needs to be an understanding of what the future will look like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe future I see is one of abundance of labor, energy, time, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla is set up to capitalize like no other company in history and become larger than anything anyone has ever built before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets focus on the now for a moment though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings to understand, the company has the #1 selling vehicle in the world.  Not just #1 EV, it's the #1 car.\n\nThe TAM for there current lineup of vehicles is approaching it's cap with current interest rates and pricing.  The growth will be moderate compared to what people are use too from Tesla.\n\nThe current lineup of vehicles is printing money for them though, which is padding there balance sheet now with $29 billion in cash, about 5% of the market cap and the rest covering all of their current investments in the future and operations.\n\nSo for 2024 we can expect moderate volume growth and everyone already knows.\n\nWhat will margins look like in 2024, nobody really knows, some people think it will continue to trend down, some people think it bottomed in Q3, when it bounced up slightly in Q4. Regardless I know that they will be printing more money and strengthening their balance sheet further while growing current projects.\n\nThey will also be ramping the Cybertruck as well this year, new product for which I expect in the 75k-100k range produced/delivered.\n\nSo that is vehicle outlook for 2024.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat about energy which just seems like a completely overlooked aspect of the business.\n\nThey delivered over 14 gwh of energy storage in 2023, up from 6 gwh in 2022.\n\nThe Lathrop factory is scaling to produce 40 gwh annually and they have a new factory in shanghai on the books to come on later this year for an additional 40 gwh of production.\n\nTesla did about $3.9 billion in revenue in 2022 from energy,  around $6.4 billion 2023.\n\nThey only deployed 14 gwh of what will soon be 80 gwh of capacity and it already is starting to impact their profits positively and becoming a meaningful source of profits and revenue.\n\nSo while the vehicle business will have lower growth in 2024, the energy business will have accelerated growth.\n\nWhat about batteries? Tesla is ramping their own 4680's and expects to install additional lines later this year and produce all they need for the Cybertruck ramp as well as Semi and future projects that require it.\n\nThe IRA bill that passed is going to pay Tesla for the production of these batteries.  They literally are looking to be at a production rate of 100 gwhr of 4680's annually later this year and will get paid per kwhr produced.  This amount of money that will come in is not understood yet.\n\nSo for 2024, energy is entering into a very interesting and lucrative phase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not really going to touch on charging much but their network of chargers continues to grow, other vehicle manufactures will gain access this year as well as all the new Tesla's produced, this is something to consider.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay so that covers 2024, I expect earnings to be far better than people expect, especially in the latter half of the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat about the future?\n\nThe TAM for vehicles will be expanding massively.  They already said they plan to produce their next generation vehicle in 2025 in Austin and then expand to their new factory in Mexico, and another undecided location for a factory overseas.  The #1 selling car is the Model Y at over 1.2 million sold annually.  What happens when there is a new vehicle for a fraction of the cost made by Tesla.  I don't even know if it will qualify for the POS tax credit from the IRA but if it does, the price for this car could be insane. It's already expected to be sub 25k. This thing will sell many millions and usher in that next wave of vehicle growth. The car goes into production next year, did I say that already, NEXT YEAR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets talk about what is probably the greatest opportunity of our lifetime, I am not even talking about FSD for autonomous vehicles which would revolutionize travel and the economics of it for people and the company, I am talking about Humanoid Bots.  I don't think people understand that they are coming, not just from Tesla but multiple companies and they are around the corner.  This is real, everyone is asleep right now and don't realize but this is happening.  They are going to be filling labor gaps initially, and eventually will be everywhere will Millions shipping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe economics for this type of product is hard to fathom, people do not understand and Tesla is the best positioned out of any company with their manufacturing capabilities, engineering, ai background and access to capital.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo while I believe 2024 will be better than people realize thanks to stable margins from vehicles, acceleration of growth in energy, and a tam expansion coming in 2025 to lead the next wave of volume and eps growth, these things will pale in comparison to what this Bot represents and it is not priced in, nor is the next gen vehicle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo your own DD, make your own decision, but I am ready for what is to come and will capitalize on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "1adgztd", "created_utc": 1706485835.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "Hopium much", "score": 115, "replies": [{"body": "I took a dose of Fokitol and feeling pretty good about my bag holding right now", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Pretty much just gave vague statements and expect us to believe that Tesla is worth its valuation based on those?

That's what doesn't work any longer.\n\nNow?  That intervention point would hopefully send a signal up to Tesla, they'd look at clips of the intervention, figure out what it was doing ... and then they simply have to ask the fleet to collect clips of non-FSD navigation through the same spot by humans, review them for the best \"5-Star Uber driver\" ones, and stuff them into the training library for the next release.

He sounded like a 21-year-old Apple Genius Bar employee, and treated the entire process like if my sis was trying to fix an IPhone to get on tiktok and not her $40,000 vehicle.\n\nThree hours later, at the Tesla Service Center, they offered her a $25 Uber ride and a $10 coupon to Chick-fil-A.

When she asked for a loaner, she was told they usually don't give out loaners and that it would only take a day to get the Tesla back. When she explained that she was upset with how she's been treated, a manager came out and treated her like complete shit, listened to her, and told her she was free to take her Tesla to another bodyshop (seriously).

I fully believe the human brain is so complex, hormones, and other things we know nothing about can explain people being one sex, but mentally feeling another. Do some people take advantage of that? Just want attention and use the trans banner to do it? Or course. Just like there religious leaders diddling little kids, and GOP people accused of sex trafficking and drugs. Human being are foulable, to a fault. \n\nTo me, one sides whole ethos is we want as many people to vote as possible, full stop. The other side wants to limit voting in whatever legal or illegal way they can. They've suggested taking away women's rights to vote, single people, 18-21 year olds, and constantly do things to make it harder to vote in poorer areas. The biggest earners from social programs?

I remember when tattoos like 15 years ago were litterally being taught in school on how bad they are for future employment to then see it take off in the celeb space and now every kid I see looks like Justin Bieber did when he first just started getting them… \n\nAs far as voting goes the only reason the democrats are fighting for it is because it helps them.

I do think if some people have to work 60-80 hours a week to put a roof over their heads, we ought to give a week or so. Not everyone is super fortunate like me, and knows they're busy 9-5 mon through Friday. I also have an amazing employeer who allows us sufficient time off to vote, without threatening our jobs and income. We've had mail in voting since the early military days. It shouldn't be a practice reserved for the wealthy and affluent. There are literal recordings of the GOP discussing how they can prevent voters in certain areas. \n\n<<To me the whole trans thing is the fakest thing on earth>>\n\nSpoken like somebody with no first hand experience, and it's uncomfortable and not what you grew up with, so it's bad. We have people born with multiple limbs, conjoined twins, down syndrome, heart defections, and myriad of brain and nervous system disorders, people born with both genitalia etc..I was born medically disabled. I have spent over 5+ years of my life in hospitals, with people like I've described above. Im 100% certain that in the next few generations, it will be proven that people can be born as one sex but have the mentality of the other. If someone can loose a limb, and experience ghost limb syndrome, amongst many others. There has to be people whos brains are wired wonky, and hormones are wonky. Who am I to tell someone they aren't what they feel? And what does it hurt? There has literally been documented homsexuality, crossfresser, and trans gendered people going as far back as human written history.\n\nSo saying it's the fakest thing on earth? To me that can only be said by someone who either doesn't unders5and science, or willfully choose not to understand it. Wether it's because it makes you uncomfortable, or like tattoos you were taught it was wrong doesn't really matter in the big picture. In the big picture human society has evolved and changed every single generation. There are always those who push back and say \"it was better in my time! Perfect! Let's keep it that way!\"..I'm sorry but change is like a universal constant. History has proven those who try to stop it, or even slow it down? Life pushes back, it may take a few generations for the uncomfortable to get weeded out. We saw it with racial stuff, we saw it wi women, and now it's being applied to other groups. Might not be my lifetime, or yours, or the next, but man it will be a wonderful sight when we're not arguing about stupid shit like this instead of bigger picture stuff.

My thoughts:\n\nJPOW & Committee has no reason at all to do six rate cuts this year so far.  Too bad - the economy would boom otherwise.  He won’t declare victory and most likely will remain cautious.  I think the market needs to get over the Fed and move on.    \n\nTuesday the fun begins:\n\nMSFT -  red hot!   The tunes are full blast - can they dance?   They have three businesses to report on plus AI.  Microsoft 365, Asure cloud, & personal computing- XBOX, Bing, Surface, and Activision.  Their yoy earnings is expected to increase 19%.  They been pushing AI close to two years now - show me the money!  Would like to see  yoy revenue growth of at least 25% based on their price. I think they are over bought.  \n\nGOOGL -  is expected to grow earnings by 53% to roughly $ 1.61.  Let’s see how search and YouTube does.  Maybe they have a new AI story to tell.  Over bought I think.   \n\nAMD -  is expected to grow earnings by 12% to roughly $0.77.   It’ll be about forward guidance I believe.   I like what I hear about the 8000G processors with lower power graphics and innovative content creation capabilities.   They have a strong story as well with their neural processing unit(NPU) Ryzen A for PC’s. Over bought but will continue to kick ass I think.\n\nThursday:\n\nAAPL - is expected to grow earnings 12% with flat yoy revenue.  Really don’t see any surprise to the upside.  Heard the Apple Pro Vision isn’t gaining any app’s on Netflix’s.    Really no growth story so far.  Sell. \n\nAMZN -big Q upcoming.   They need to demonstrate they can make big money.  They are expected to grow earnings from $0.03 to 0.79/share.  Use them a lot - we’ll see.\n\nMeta - expected to grow earnings by 66% to $5 roughly.  Meta plans to have 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips to drive its data centers & AI by end of 2024. Year of efficiency is over I think.  \n \nI’m hoping for a flat week, but do have puts on MSFT & APPL.

Like a company's board of executives, these users typically have control over the space's future direction. \n> \n> Sadly, on all social-media websites, one user has to create said space, and they can remove all moderators below them. That *head* moderator, who never was active in building or running the sub, removed all the other moderators + brought in ones that would do things at his absolute direction. \n>\n> This is equivalent to a company's board being bought out resulting in a change of ownership that was not planned: i.e, a typical hostile takeover.\n>\n\n**The Motivation —**\n\n>\n> So... Why did that *(inactive, and not involved in building or running the subreddit)* head-moderator come back all the sudden? Why did they remove the permissions of all the moderators who actually built and ran this space for years, and bring in new users who had zero experience in moderating but would do anything said head-moderator requested of them? \n> \n> Well... If you think critically you'd find that the only groups who would ever need to *\"buy out\"* a social media space (in our case, a subreddit), and/or to attempt a hostile takeover on an active space, with the intention of controlling the flow of information — i.e, the *\"narrative\"*, are **Political Organizations**, **Governments**, and **Apes**...\n>\n> For a **political organization** OR a **government**, the objective is to control what is discussed regarding said org/govt and to gain influence and power, all while encouraging positive discussion and discouraging discussion against said org/govt.\n>\n> For **Apes**, all-focus MUST be on the meme-stock and it becomes imperative that all control over the flow of information, posts, and comments is required to encourage users to purchase the meme-stock and discourage selling the meme-stock. \n>\n> Most importantly, **controlling the flow of information is necessary for Apes as the discussion of other securities is widly considered *\"FUD\"***, and must be censored/removed — as hyper-fixation on one meme-stock is required for Apes to function.\n>\n> It is also widly important (*and prevalent in all Ape spaces*) to delete past *\"DD\"* and other posts that end-up being incorrect, or posts that go against the current narrative, as that could cause new potential-Apes to realize that something is off/wrong. The goal is to paint a picture of a group of *\"investors\"* who *always* knew what was happening before it actually happened, and therefore can guarantee that buying-in now or continuing to *\"HODL\"* will certainly result in generational wealth.\n>\n\n**Our Unexpected New Ownership —**\n\n> Our Unexpected New Owner happened to be...an Ape *(lovely — ...right)*\n>\n> His specific intentions were to profit off of WSB and turn it into what r/SuperStupid (Stonk) is now, while selling us products related to the subreddit, marketing it like a company, and making a whole bunch of money in meme-stock pump-and-dump schemes.\n>\n> Soooo... we would have been turned another reddit ape-filled meme-stock echo-chamber.

What 1-30-2024 to watch for...", "selftext": "## AMD Heats Up: Can Earnings Ignite a $200 Stock Price Bonfire?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) is about to step into the earnings inferno, and investors are sweating anticipation. Scheduled for **January 30th, after market close**, this call could be the catalyst for AMD's stock to finally **reach the coveted $200 mark**. But is it just wishful thinking, or is there real fire behind the hype?\n\n**Why the Optimism?**\n\nAMD's recent performance has been nothing short of scorching. **Fiscal Q3 2023 saw 4% revenue growth** despite a jittery market, driven by the company's **dominance in high-performance CPUs and GPUs**. The **data center segment, in particular, roared with a 45% year-over-year surge**, fueled by cloud computing giants gobbling up AMD's EPYC processors. And let's not forget the AI revolution – **AMD's MI300 series AI chips are expected to become revenue monsters in 2024**, potentially exceeding $2 billion.\n\n**Analyst Whispers:**\n\nWall Street isn't playing coy either. The **consensus EPS forecast for Q4 is $0.77**, a healthy jump from $0.69 the year before. Some analysts are even whispering about a potential beat, propelled by strong data center and AI sales. This could send the stock soaring past its current perch near $180\n\n**The $200 Question:**\n\nSo, can AMD crack the $200 barrier? It's definitely not a gimme. **A strong earnings report and bullish guidance would be the rocket fuel**, but there are still headwinds like potential supply chain disruptions and macro-economic uncertainties. However, **AMD's momentum and strategic positioning in booming markets** make it a **compelling buy for long-term investors**.\n\n**What to Watch:**\n\nDuring the earnings call, keep your ears peeled for:\n\n* **Data center and AI revenue figures:** A healthy bump would be a green light for growth.\n* **2024 guidance:** Does AMD see continued momentum, or are there cautious whispers?\n* **Competition:** Any insights into market share battles with Intel and Nvidia will be crucial.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\n\nAMD's earnings call is a high-stakes poker game. But with its strong cards and an ace up its sleeve in the form of AI, the odds of reaching $200 are looking hotter than ever. Whether it's a slow simmer or a full-blown eruption, AMD's stock is definitely worth watching. So, grab your metaphorical marshmallows and cozy up to the earnings fire – it's gonna be a scorcher.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.
