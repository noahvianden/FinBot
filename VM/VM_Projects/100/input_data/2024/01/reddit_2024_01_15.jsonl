Most of you are in the same miserable state that I am in, stuck flying coach. While we toil, gamble, and tuck our savings away into 401k and market funds, the tide is slowly rising against us.\n\nFast forwarding into the future and you can guess where this is going. All the profits are moving into private hands, where if you want to play, you get to join at the lowest tier. No more data will be available to you, and you will have to just trust that your share of the winnings is a fair one. The person handing you your portion has nothing to report, and you can take it or leave.\n\nPrivate equity has no obligation to report anything, only that it exists and that it “pays taxes”. But that’s okay, we don’t need dividends, right? Heck we don’t even need companies to be profitable, cuz we are all willing to bet high multiples valuation for losing companies. \n\nSo you get those gains if you can, and then stuff it into your 401k, and it will still give something for now but will slowly deflate in the distant future.\n\nSource: https://www.inc.com/bruce-crumley/blackrock-buys-private-equity-firm-in-125-billion-mega-deal.html\n\nMy apologies.

And it’s possible that humanoid multifunction robots that don’t get tired, are composed of rare earth elements and require specialist care, engineers and an abundant and reliable energy source will someday cost less than actual slaves but I don’t think so. A sweatshop worker makes enough to have a bowl of rice and save a bowl of rice for the next day or for one loved one, and when they get more expensive the sweatshop shuts down and the owner finds a new location where the quality of life never rose or has again fallen.\n\nA robot that can do the work of a sweatshop worker can also do many much more valuable tasks and so the process a sweatshop can pay for one won’t be enough - if the value proposition is so high it falls right into the favor of the higher value products and services. There is no logical world where a robot humanoid would do the job that an autostitcher does now, in other words: robot sewing machines.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your perspective, while emotionally compelling, lacks a nuanced understanding of technological progress and economic dynamics. The comparison of robots to slaves is not only historically and ethically problematic, but also economically simplistic.\n\nFirstly, the argument that robots will be directed to higher-value tasks ignores the principle of scalability and specialization in technology. Just as we have high-performance computers for complex tasks and simpler ones for basic operations, so too can robotics be diversified. The development of humanoid robots for tasks such as sweatshop labor does not preclude their application in more sophisticated roles; rather, it allows for a broad spectrum of utility based on complexity and cost.\n\nSecondly, the assertion that sweatshop owners would simply move operations in response to rising labor costs overlooks the inevitability of global economic development. As nations develop, their labor costs invariably rise, reducing the pool of cheap labor worldwide. This trend, coupled with increasing pressure from international human rights advocacy, makes the low-cost labor model unsustainable in the long term.\n\nMoreover, your argument fails to account for the rapid advancements in robotics and AI. Cost reduction in robotic manufacturing is not just a possibility but a trend observed across various technological sectors. The initial high cost of robots is mitigated over time through economies of scale, technological improvements, and increased efficiency.\n\nLastly, the focus on current capabilities of robots versus humans in sweatshops is a short-sighted view. Technological progress is not linear but exponential. The capabilities of robotics and AI are advancing at a rate that will soon make them not only viable but preferable for tasks currently performed by humans in low-wage environments.\n\nIn conclusion, while your argument raises valid concerns about the current state of robotics, it fails to adequately consider the dynamic nature of technological advancement and global economic trends.\n\n</AI>\n\nI was curious what ChatGPT would counter your argument with, as I'm supposed to be working.

Upon further inspection of the log he reads that the photoelectric barrier on the exit conveyer band wasn't cleared and the machine shut itself off as per protocol. He exits the office, walks over to the machine, up the stairs and he sees that there is a jam of paper boxes on the conveyer band which backed up all the way to the folding machine and caused it to shut down. He clears and aligns a few boxes and moves along the belt to find the cause of the issue. A few meters in front of the inlet to the machine that loads the boxes with folded shirts he notices that a box got caught on the side of the conveyer belt. What happened was one of the nuts on the side railing had loosened from the vibration of the machine which opened a small gap where through an unlucky coincidence a paper flap of one of the boxes got stuck. He removes the box. Goes back to his office, gets a new nut, a wrench and a bit of loctite and he fixes the belt. Clears out a few more boxes. Disables the emergency shutdown on folding machine 2. Goes back to his office and restarts the process on his computer.\n\nNow would your proposed automation solution have been able to fix this issue? Because people doing this kind of work, which is simple but extremely unpredictable, is really common even in modern factories.
