It felt like we were all in on a little secret and part of a clique. (Apple held this feeling for a long time, even after they were gigantic and kind of still does somehow). Whether for performance, the environment, fuel savings, being more fun to drive, American made, having an iPhone on wheels/future tech. etc we'd chat at the superchargers, wave to each other on the road, and maybe most importantly evangelize to friends and family. Every car felt like a moving showroom. Now, sadly, the car is a political symbol or negatively associated with Elon for some. Even though all those other positive things are still true it's taken the wind out of sails for most. So now, there are 44K model Ys WITH 7500 off at point of sale, sitting on Tesla lots. This all seems so unavoidable and self inflicted. I love Elon, he's changed my life, but he's squandered so much.

{"title": "Everything you need to know about AMD in 8 bullet points.", "selftext": "Everything you need to know about $AMD, in 8 bullet points.\n\n1. $AMD's rise over the last decade has been the result of the company betting on chiplets. Chiplets consist in making a chip out of many small chips, instead of making a big one (monolithic) directly like $NVDA does. This is how it has disrupted $INTC and how it is now poised to disrupt $NVDA.\n\n2. We are nearing the \"end\" of Moore's Law. Making monolithic chips is getting exponentially harder and therefore, chiplets are the way around the end of Moore's Law. They enable much  higher yields at similar if not higher levels of performance. $AMD has been working on chiplets for about a decade now, while the rest of the industry is only just catching up.\n\n3. $AMD is just a bunch of people working together to design chips. The company's success is a result of having bet on the right roadmap (chiplets), but also of its excellent organizational properties. Lisa Su is a world class leader and ensures; everyone feels connected to the mission; employees are empowered and accountable; communication is extremely transparent. \n\n4. The market still doesn't quite understand why $AMD bought Xilinx. Essentially, Xilinx is the #1 FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) company in the world. FPGAs enable chips to change shape autonomously and adapt to whatever computational task. They have the potential, over the long term, to deliver much more efficient computing. FPGAs will allow $AMD to deliver AI acceleration in any of their products. \n\n5. $AMD also bought Pensando, which excels at making datacenters stateful. Stateful data centers hold information about their current state of operations. This data can then be used to train AI models, that enable organizations to run data centers at increasingly higher levels of automation. Pensando came with a lot of software engineers too and is essentially going to enable $AMD to provide the environment for their computing engines to do their best work.\n\n6. The combination of the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions give $AMD a highly differentiated roadmap. For $AMD to bring chiplets to the world, it's had to fine tune its $AMD Infinity Fabric tech, which excels at connecting chiplets. $AMD is now positioned to use this tech to connect any kind of computing engine. This gives $AMD a structural competitive advantage, whereby going forward it will be able to fill specific gaps in the market that no one else will be able to.\n\n7. $AMD is now transferring its chiplet expertise to the GPU market. $NVDA is busy making bigger and powerful chips, defying Moore's Law. $AMD is meanwhile coming from below, with the same strategy that it used to distrupt $INTC. So long as $AMD's organizational properties persist, it's a matter of time before its GPUs are atleast as competitive as $NVDA's. The latter has a strong software moat, but even a moderate gain in GPU marketshare could lead to considerable returns for $AMD shareholders.\n\n8. In the Q3 conference call, Lisa Su said $AMD has made “significant progress” in the Datacenter GPU business, with “significant customer traction” for the next generation MI300 chip.

The insurance maintained by Coinbase Global is shared among all of Coinbase’s customers,\n\nAnd on page 33, it seems that even if an internal Blackrock employee went rogue and stole all the Bitcoins, Blackrock won't insure against that either:\n\n>Although the Trust’s transfers of bitcoin will regularly be made to or from the Trust’s account at the Bitcoin Custodian, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, the Trust’s bitcoin could be transferred from the Trust’s account at the Bitcoin Custodian in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts ... ... To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third-party or is incapable of identifying the third-party which has received the Trust’s bitcoins through error or theft, the Trust will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred bitcoins. The Trust will also be unable to convert or recover its bitcoins transferred to uncontrolled accounts. To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek redress for such error or theft, such loss could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\n\nThe general idea I get about the Blackrock BTC ETF prospectus is that there really isn't any insurance, and if there is any hacking/theft of Bitcoin and the ETF collapses, there is no protection against you losing everything. If this is the case, this is a shame, since I was hoping there was more protection mechanisms to hold a BTC ETF over holding BTC yourself (if I pass away and I hold a BTC ETF, at least my BTC ETF can be left for my family members through inheritance, but if I hold BTC and my family members don't know my private key, my BTC is lost forever).", "id": "199pjym", "created_utc": 1705582604.0, "score": 364, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 77, "replies": [{"body": "\"ohh no, blackrocks CEO died and he was the only one with a password to the laptop!!\"", "score": 59, "replies": []}, {"body": "These are things are giving spacs a run for the money in terms of worst performing asset..", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You don’t need to be a genius to see that BlackRock is simply going to work and manipulate BTC prices just like the CCP has done in the past. \n\nBlackRock: Sell a bunch of calls, sell a bunch of BTC through foreign subsidiaries to drop the price and collect from those sold calls.\nNothing to protect consumer from an unregulated cryptocurrency", "score": 221, "replies": [{"body": "yeah blackrock is only going to buy the bare minimum and ftd the rest to scalp as much as possible", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": ">**ftd** the rest\n\nWas gonna ask.

With apple and Google pay the cut provided to visa and MC  seemingly is gone, with merchants being able to process using apple and Google pay without fees. I am not sure exactly how or why this is but I know JPM and Citi have been pressing to institute a fee and generate kickback for themselves but I am assuming that the data collected by apple and Google on these transactions makes it worth paying the fees to Visa and MC out of pocket and cutting the banks out completely.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "The acquiring banks that provide the POS terminals are not impacted, the issuing banks (that actually back the card you've loaded into ApplePay) and the networks (that the transactions are routed through) are unaffected except having to deal with the volume - and signing shitty deals for Apple branded cards,of course.\n\nApple have absolutely no desire to be as regulated as the networks and banks are.

You are also right that Merchant account providers like First data and Fiserv whom supply the terminals are not affected as they will still charge nominal fees (although they are substantially lower thus why many small businesses push for apple Pay usage so much) but for online transactions that's where it gets a bit weird. The issuing bank for your card is not responsible for handling processing fees, this burden is passed along to whatever institution the merchant utilizes to process the transaction and the merchant themselves. The way apple Pay works is very similar to stripe except without the fees stripe charges, apple processes the payment utilizing their Super-MID and then deposits the payment into the merchants account.

Apple collects extremely limited anonymous data in this whole process.\n\nThere's no real way to cut the payment network out of the process. Merchants don't accept Apple Pay, per se; they accept contactless Visa (etc.) payments, and the issuing banks provision a contactless Visa onto the person's iPhone.

While your first paragraph is true that the card is processed over visa's network and the issuing bank of the customers credit card is given their portion of the fee it skips entirely over the fees processed on the merchants end. When processing an apple Pay transaction the transaction does not go through the merchants assigned merchant account it goes through apple's Super Mid. Very similar to how stripe works (except stripe still charges the merchant associated fees while apple does not pass along those fees). Therefore the acquiring bank of the merchant is left not getting any of their pieces of the pie due to the payment just not routing through them. This is why JPM and others are pushing for a higher rev split in terms of the split in terms of issuing bank fees. Banks make a majority of their credit card processing revenue through charging the fees to the merchant, this is why companies like Fiserv are so massive and make up a great deal of the money generated in e-commerce.
