I'm personally a pirate for life, with torrents you get access to every show and movie ever made without any ads at all, which streaming service do I sign up for that? None, and one will likely never exist. Also it's literally free, hard to compete with that. And torrents are like herpes, you can't get rid of them. Now let's look at Netflix, they have a meh moat, if any, piss off customers all the time, are close to maturity and are at a 47pe atm. How can they grow enough to justify that price?

The company required fans to subscribe to their payed streaming service to catch the game. That is one subscription that until this year, you did not need to watch an NFL game due to the local networks being free ( I use the term free loosely ) or easily accessible. It seems this may be the beginning of having to subscribe to the big 3‚Äôs streaming networks to watch what was once included with any simple cable or satellite subscription. What is stopping them from charging consumers a premium fee to watch your local news cast in the future such as Paramount +, Peacock etc. The WWE has singed a 10 year deal with Netflix. The fans ( not myself ) of the product are now going to pay a premium fee to catch their favorite show. The more these steaming networks add, the higher the cost of monthly subscriptions will be. It will eventually make entertain my unsustainable for many of Americans. \nWith the cable subscription, satellite subscriptions there was competition between the cable providers, which in turn kept the costs from rising often or very much.

Netflix has been raising prices, every other quarter it seems. Premium ad free is $25 a month. Disney + which can include ESPN + and Hulu costs $25 a month. Add a few more services to get the content we all once had with cable and the cost is substantially more.  ABC, Fox, NBC and CBS were always basically free with a satellite or cable subscription. Heck, you could even watch them with just an antenna and not cable subscription. These networks pay big money for professional ( and college )sports contracts with NFL, MLB, NBA etc. This year, NBC had Sunday night Football. However, they stuck a deal with the NFL to air the playoff game on their paid for streaming app, Peacock. What was once a basic channel to watch sports became a $7.00 a month subscription as well. Same with Amazon Prime in getting the contract the NFL to stream Thursday night football.. Which used to be one one of the big four networks to watch cheap or free. Are we headed into paying separate subscription to watch the Super Bowl every year? Advertising, subsidized the cost of watching cable. Sit through ninety seconds of commercials and the show was back on. Ad free tv does not matter much anymore. Most of us are scrolling through our smart phones, seeing ad‚Äôs while simultaneously watching TV anyway. Not giving full attention to either one.

Cable and Satellite was a competitive market, in which you could get all your entertainment in one package. The competitiveness kept the prices steady.

But when all of Bear Stearns failed two months later, stocks remained steady, buoyed by aggressive government action to contain the damage. By May, the S&P regained a few points.\n\n> That summer, however, mounting financial losses finally started to spook investors. By July 2008, the S&P was down 20% from the prior peak‚Äîa bear market. Stocks zig-zagged for the next two months, but panic selling began after Lehman‚Äôs bankruptcy, leaving the S&P 500 down 40% from the peak nearly a year earlier.
