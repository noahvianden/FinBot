I don't know because I do not pay attention to T-mobile...simply asking. \n\nThese are things we would need to answer before we can give a near accurate estimate to where their subs are coming from.\n\nThis isn't to say you're wrong.

The company required fans to subscribe to their payed streaming service to catch the game. That is one subscription that until this year, you did not need to watch an NFL game due to the local networks being free ( I use the term free loosely ) or easily accessible. It seems this may be the beginning of having to subscribe to the big 3’s streaming networks to watch what was once included with any simple cable or satellite subscription. What is stopping them from charging consumers a premium fee to watch your local news cast in the future such as Paramount +, Peacock etc. The WWE has singed a 10 year deal with Netflix. The fans ( not myself ) of the product are now going to pay a premium fee to catch their favorite show. The more these steaming networks add, the higher the cost of monthly subscriptions will be. It will eventually make entertain my unsustainable for many of Americans. \nWith the cable subscription, satellite subscriptions there was competition between the cable providers, which in turn kept the costs from rising often or very much.

Netflix has been raising prices, every other quarter it seems. Premium ad free is $25 a month. Disney + which can include ESPN + and Hulu costs $25 a month. Add a few more services to get the content we all once had with cable and the cost is substantially more.  ABC, Fox, NBC and CBS were always basically free with a satellite or cable subscription. Heck, you could even watch them with just an antenna and not cable subscription. These networks pay big money for professional ( and college )sports contracts with NFL, MLB, NBA etc. This year, NBC had Sunday night Football. However, they stuck a deal with the NFL to air the playoff game on their paid for streaming app, Peacock. What was once a basic channel to watch sports became a $7.00 a month subscription as well. Same with Amazon Prime in getting the contract the NFL to stream Thursday night football.. Which used to be one one of the big four networks to watch cheap or free. Are we headed into paying separate subscription to watch the Super Bowl every year? Advertising, subsidized the cost of watching cable. Sit through ninety seconds of commercials and the show was back on. Ad free tv does not matter much anymore. Most of us are scrolling through our smart phones, seeing ad’s while simultaneously watching TV anyway. Not giving full attention to either one.

Cable and Satellite was a competitive market, in which you could get all your entertainment in one package. The competitiveness kept the prices steady.

Stocks rose into October, when a 5-year bull market ended as the S&P 500 stock index topped out at 1,562. In January 2008, the S&P 500 entered a correction, down 10% from the peak. But when all of Bear Stearns failed two months later, stocks remained steady, buoyed by aggressive government action to contain the damage. By May, the S&P regained a few points.\n\n> That summer, however, mounting financial losses finally started to spook investors. By July 2008, the S&P was down 20% from the prior peak—a bear market. Stocks zig-zagged for the next two months, but panic selling began after Lehman’s bankruptcy, leaving the S&P 500 down 40% from the peak nearly a year earlier. The index would ultimately lose 57% of its value by the time it bottomed out in March 2009.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-evergrande-lehman-moment-analogy-is-wrong-195010674.html\n\nRIP 3333\n\nEdit: I'm a coward who's long guts with SPY options, I don't care what happens, as long as **something** happens.", "id": "1aduq9d", "created_utc": 1706533162.0, "score": 2447, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 567, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|144|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "We got kids who were 8 in 2008 telling us this is just like 2008.", "score": 2718, "replies": [{"body": "I graduated college in 2008.

Those are the people who are taking whatever crumbs are on your plate to sprinkle on their already inflated slices of the pie. Those are the people making it impossible for you to own that condo today. Those are the people who have multiplied their wealth ungodly times since 2008. And they have done it by keeping people like you pushed down and extracting as much from you as hard as they can without causing a revolution. \n\nI am still middle class and want to see those people and companies have an economic reset. I don’t want to see middle and lower class people suffer more economic hardships through an entire economic reset. \n\nI am now fortunate enough that if the economy collapses, I might be able to outright buy an investment like that but I still do not want that to happen because the uncertainty and far reaching effects are so unpredictable that I know it would impact me negatively because I was paying attention and living it when the crash happened in 2008 and saw how badly it destroyed so so so many lives. \n\nYou are wishing and hoping to cut off your own nose to spite your face.
