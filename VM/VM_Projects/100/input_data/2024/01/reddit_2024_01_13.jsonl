{"title": "Hertz Wants to Sell 20,000 EVs Amid Low Rental Demand, High Repair Prices", "selftext": "Just over two years after announcing plans to purchase 100,000 Teslas and another 65,000 electric cars from Polestar for its rental fleets, Hertz is planning to sell off 20,000 of its EVs, according to a federal regulatory filing posted Thursday. The rental company noted the high cost of collision repairs and lower demand from consumers as the primary drivers for the EV divestment. Hertz, in turn, plans to use some of the income from those sales to purchase more new gas-powered vehicles.\n\nThe electric rental demand issue may have less to do with the cars themselves and more to do with the unique traits of EVs. An average renter is looking for a car that will get them around over the course of a trip rather than a compelling experience in that car. For those customers, the complexities of an EV may prove to be more of a frustration than a charm.\n\nRenting a Tesla Model 3, for instance, comes with all the frustrations of the screen-heavy Tesla user interface without any of the time to get used to those adjustments that a buyer would have. Charging is an even bigger issue: Not only do consumers without EV experience who rent a Polestar 2 or a Tesla Model 3 have to figure out how to charge a car while on the road, they also have to figure out two completely different charging ecosystems depending on which car they get.\n\nEven though Hertz plans to offload much of its electric fleet, the company says it \"will continue to execute its strategy around EV mobility and offer customers a wide selection of vehicles,\" according to the filing. Hertz says it will grow its charging infrastructure, work closer with electric car manufacturers to lower parts and labor costs, and continue to help educate customers about EVs.\n\nHertz currently lists 548 Tesla Model 3s and zero Polestar models on its direct sales website. The most affordable Teslas are currently selling for just over $20,000, but screenshots shared by Electrek on Wednesday suggest that other Model 3s have previously been listed for as low as $17,700 before a potential tax credit for used EVs.\n\nhttps://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a46353518/hertz-wants-to-sell-20000-evs-amid-low-rental-demand-high-repair-prices/", "id": "195j02j", "created_utc": 1705132767.0, "score": 423, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 215, "comments": [{"body": "The conclusions are correct.

Do the math", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "As a novice, I ask:  what does this mean?", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "1. **P/E ratio**\n\nSo you can think of a P/E ratio (i.e. price/earnings) as the market capitalisation of the company divided by one year of net income. Right now for Alibaba, this is approximately $180 billion in market cap divided by $18 billion in net income. This gives a P/E ratio of 10. They call this a 'trailing' P/E ratio because it's actually taking the net income from the trailing twelve months (AKA TTM). Another type of P/E that's often mentioned is the 'forward' P/E. This takes the net income of the future year (which is a forecast/estimate) instead of the trailing year. For Alibaba, this forward P/E is currently about 7. Meaning that next year analysts forecast that Alibaba will make $25 billion. \n\nAnother way to calculate a P/E ratio is by dividing the stock price by the net income *per share* (known as earnings per share). For Alibaba, this is a stock price of 71 divided by earnings per share (eps) of 7.1. Again, we have a P/E ratio of 10. \n\n2. **Dividend yield**\n\nA dividend yield is simply calculated by dividing the yearly dividend per share by the share price. For Alibaba, they paid one dividend in 2023 of $1 per share, divided by the share price of $71, this is a yield of ~1.4%. \n\n3. **Share buybacks**\n\nThis one is pretty straightforward: a company can buy back its own shares and destroy them. This is normally done when the company thinks its own shares are undervalued and it has two main benefits for shareholders: moving the share price up and increasing shareholders' percentage ownership of the company. Another way to phrase the latter is that shareholders' entitlement to the companies earnings, on a per share basis, increases. \n\nFor Alibaba, it looks like they bought back 3.3% of their shares in 2023. So shareholders' entitlement to earnings (i.e. percentage ownership of the company) increased by 3.3%. \n\nSource: spend way too much time on this stuff.

In financial speak, this is a p/e ratio of 10 (cost of the entire business/1 year of earnings). \n\nNow, this lemonade stand does not grow its earnings. Instead it makes the same $10 each year. This means after 10 years, you have made back your initial investment. Now, you could sell this lemonade stand for the price you paid for it and you've effectively doubled your money (not including inflation). Another way to put this is you've made 10% of your original investment every year for 10 years (i.e. a 10% yield). \n\nNow, go back in time and imagine that the lemonade stand is actually selling for $70, rather than $100. But it still earns the same $10 every year. This is a p/e ratio of 7.\n\nThis difference in the two p/e ratios (10 and 7) is what's referred to as a market multiple. AKA the price that the market sets for the business/stock. \n\nRemember how we said you'd earn a 10% yield if you bought it at $100? Well the yield is even better if you buy it at $70. It's actually about 14%.  \n\nNow, imagine a new investor comes along and says \"wow this company is fantastic, it makes $10 consistently every year. I'll buy it for $200!\". \n\nIt now has a p/e ratio of 20 ($200/10). \n\nNow remember you bought it at 70 and sold it at 200. From this alone, you make $130. The earnings stayed the same but the p/e ratio went from 7 to 20. This is referred to market multiple expansion. In other words, the market prices the company higher. \n\nIf you had held that lemonade stand for 10 years, you'd have made $130 for the sale, plus $100 in earnings for a total of $230 for the 10 years or an annual yield of 32%. \n\nThe difference with stocks is that you don't actually get the $10 paid to you like the lemonade stand does.

Then I realized that I actually do not know as much about China's economy as to make me feeling comfortable keeping it, that China was punishing it with unreasonable taxes and the thing that convinced me to sell was when they announced that CCP will put one of their own in Alibaba's board of directors.
