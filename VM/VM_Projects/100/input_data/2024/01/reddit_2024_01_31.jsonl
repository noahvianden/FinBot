He likes acting like he is working long hours at each and every one of these places and taking a hands on approach to managing and innovating at each of them as well. How is he possibly working even 40hr weeks at Tesla while he is spending long hours and days and nights at Twitter/X or at SpaceX as well? In a single week there are 168 hours so even if he only slept 3hours a night that means he has 147hours leftover. If he tried to work 40hours at each of the major companies he supposedly puts long hours into that would mean 40 at Tesla, 40 at SpaceX, 40 at X, which leaves him 27 hours leftover to divide between Neuralink, Boring Company, xAI, and Musk Foundation (I might even be missing some things he says he is working on too). So that’s assuming a ridiculously low amount of sleep as well as absolutely 0 downtime or eating or socializing or tweeting or interviews… you could argue his interviews are beneficial to all the ventures and I would say that’s reasonable for some but not others.

That's about 55 Billion worth of TSLA at today's share prices.\n\nThe Delaware court's ruling yesterday is that the 2018 compensation plan is illegal under Delaware law because Tesla's board violated its fiduciary duties to TSLA shareholders by not disclosing that the board wasn't independent of Musk and by obscuring aspects of how the compensation plan was created.  The Delaware court's ruling means the 2018 compensation plan is cancelled.\n\nMusk doesn't need to pay back anything.  He loses the options on 304 million shares.\n\nA collateral effect is that Tesla's fully diluted share count drops from 3.4 Billion to 3.1 Billion shares.  This will raise the company's EPS.\n\nSomeone in yesterday's thread observed that this is basically equivalent to Tesla doing a share buyback of 55 Billion worth of TSLA stock.\n\n**Edit:** Note that the ruling is not final, because Mr. Musk and Tesla can appeal the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court.", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "you think you can just waltz in here without reading all 200 pages of court documents like the rest of us?!", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Trust me dude I got stuff going on rn", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "fair enough, well the most important part of the documents is on page 46 of the PDF, which is chapter 6 subsection 4. it goes into detail about the 2.6 billion in damages, on page 74, subsection 6 it states that I wasted between 10-15 seconds of your time and have no idea what’s going on this was all a bluff", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|ZIwIc5ZEHtOPesILSr|downsized)", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "At least the ice cream machine would be working", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Lmao the interesting thing here is that the board won’t give him a new compensation package until this is resolved right?

Here is my DD:\n\n1. AAPL has had a great run. It has strong resistance at 200. Currently trading at 186. Though couple of days it was as high as 195. It's been at all time high. Based on my TA, regardless of good or bad earnings (the psychology is that earnings have to be superb for the stock to jump higher). Hence if the stock is at all time high, and earnings are meh, people will take profit. Earnings can be great (unless it's superb) and stock will still drop. Since it's at all time high, I see people taking profit here and it's a good spot to get PUTS. Here's why:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp8t6akhd0gc1.png?width=1473&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29758c6a6858223bdfaea90a0be97a1d6b119a7\n\nOn the chart above, you will see numbers 1-5. The blue vertical lines are where the earnings occurred. Let's start with #1. From previous earnings to the end of 1, arrow points down. What happened to earnings? It popped. Even though earnings were bad (see the E is red), it still popped. Going to #2. Arrow pointing up. Earnings down (even though they were good). #3. Arrow up, earnings down. #4, arrow down, earnings up. See the pattern here? It is the inverse of the arrows. If arrows are pointing down from previous earnings to current earnings, it most likely go up. Vice-versa if they're pointing up. We are currently at #5. What you think comes next, especially since it's almost at all time high? Noted, the average move in earnings is $5-10. If you are buying PUTS, suggestion would be buying at between 180-185 strike.\n\n2. $AMZN. Same analogy. $AMZN didn't really follow the patterns as $AAPL did though. And while it is at it's high, I am cautious about AMZN due to the success they've had from last earnings to this earnings (holidays, people shopping etc..). I'm leaning towards PUTS since from last earnings to today's earnings has seen significant growth, but if earnings are superb, it could go higher. Might not play AMZN.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot add more than one attachment, so I'll reply to this post so you can see the AMZN chart.\n\n3. $XOM. I'd buy calls for $XOM due to the fact that $SHEL did great. One thing in the market is psychology. $AMD did great, but stock fell. They're in chips/semiconductor business. $QCOM did great, but same thing happened. So if $SHEL did great and stock went up, I see $XOM also going up.\n\nWith all that in mind, playing earnings before earnings is truly a gamble. Rather than being a predictive trader, aim to be a reactive trader. It's best to trade after earnings are released. Most of my winnings have come from being reactive to how the earnings were (except the QCOM.. though I did make $15k from FOMC news on SPY. Hence used the winnings to play earnings)\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/mjgaphv1i0gc1.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e7d5f60e1ce8ff2108771e9e3946f39d3b1bc7b\n\nAMZN chart:", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great DD.
