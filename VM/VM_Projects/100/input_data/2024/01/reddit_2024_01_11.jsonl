Cybertruck.  According to the Isaacson biography, Cybertruck and its controversial design began around October 2018.\n2. Full-Self Driving.  That has its roots in the 2014-2016 era.\n3. Tesla Semi.  Tesla revealed the concept in 2017.  I remember JB Straubel said that the company began the project a few years before the reveal, because he and others found it absurd to be building EVs in a supply chain using mostly diesel trucks.\n4. Optimus.  Early 2021, from p. 394 of the Isaacson book.\n\nThe projects and teams are in place.  The managers of those teams are committed to the vision and the risks.  Both Cybertruck and Semi are in initial production.  Both FSD and Optimus are making progress.\n\nSince the roadmap was put in place, I don't see what Elon has contributed.\n\nThe fact that Kimbal asked Elon to consider stepping down as CEO of Tesla is important, especially given that Kimba's reason for asking this was that Elon was no longer focused on Tesla (Isaacson book, p. 586)\n\nElon's own worldview is that (1) organizations need fresh, hungry perspectives, and (2) people who don't have their head in the game need to be shuffled out ASAP.\n\nUnder that standard, if Elon is unfocused with Tesla, he's overstayed.  By his own standards he should be out.  The only reason I suspect he won't leave is that his ego and narcissistic personality get in the way of making the right choices.\n\n**Edit:**  For Elon to convince me that him staying as CEO is the right choice, I want to see evidence that Tesla is still important to him, that he's active contributing rather than just dicking around on Twitter and trashing Tesla's reputation, and most of all, that he's got the same level of fight in him for the company that he showed in 2008 and 2018.\n\nI don't see that fighting spirit in him today where Tesla is concerned.\n\n* In almost every recent conference call, Elon has rambled incoherently, like spewing nonsense rants about work-from-home policies \n* This shit he says about \"PTSD\" from 2009 is nonsense.  Nobody cares about what happened 15 years ago.  Tesla is strong today and should be expanding faster, not slowing down\n\n>I can't remember if it was Franz or Drew that said it or both.\n\nLars Moravy and Franz von Holzhausen.

But here's the gist. People thought we truly invented AI, and we didn't. What we did invent was a universal translator of sorts. Its an impressive tool, but its a TOOL. It very often gets things wrong, and it will always get things wrong because it isn't real AI.\n\nBut it is a great tool for getting value out of big data. We've been talking about \"big data\" for decades now. And as someone who got a CS degree and can build his own [uncensored ChatGPT 3.5 like LLM](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b), I'm going to tell you a secret. It has been really hard and very expensive to get any sort of real value out of big data. Traditionally the data had to be formatted in a specific way, which took lots of time and effort. And then you had to have large databases to store this data. On top of data scientists, quants, and all sorts of staff all working on and supporting your big data project.\n\nAn LLM allows you to take all of that data, feed it into your model, and then use regular language to extract value from it. You don't have to have database skills, or quant skills, or a number of other things needed to understand this data. You can effectively \"chat\" with your big data. This is a dramatic oversimplification because I have no clue what you, the reader, have for technical skills. But to me, that is a big fucking deal. It just isn't as big of a deal as real AI.\n\nSo yes, its overhyped, but also no, its still a really great tool we previously did not have. Which is why it still feels so game changing but also a bit of a let down at the same time. It isn't the computer from Star Trek, but it IS the universal translator from Star Trek.\n\nAlso now that the lawyers are getting their claws into everything, its going to get worse. Which is why you're seeing GPT4 suck more as time goes on and OpenAI seeks to reduce their legal liabilities. This will force LLMs to splinter. If they've not already.

Obviously, the internet was revolutionary and it completely changed (and is still changing) the way business was done.

Also note, that some of the revolutionary companies (Netscape, AOL, Yahoo, Lycos, etc) were replaced by companies that did it better (Google). When the crash happened, the good companies (AMZN, MSFT, etc) were punished with the bad. The good companies are now some of the most valuable companies in the world and the losers went out of business or faded away into obscurity.  \n\nThe same thing will happen with AI. Long term there will be winners and losers. You may think you know which companies will make it and which won’t, but you really don’t know. I think there is a lot more runway for AI companies to run before the AI bear market, but there will be a bear market. The best strategy now IMO is to go with best of breed AI companies (NVDA), but these individual stocks shouldn’t make up more than 10% of your portfolio because they will get punished harder than the broad market when the bear market inevitably comes.
