It has hit sufficient saturation in global consciousness and is on the way to complete adoption.  \n2. It also happens to be fixed in total quantity with the natural mining supply decreasing over time.   \n3. It's security is guaranteed by decentralisation and the proof-of-work algorithm. This makes it durable store of value.  \n4. The combination of the above 3 points then implies that BTC is by design and by chance the best \"pure\" savings instrument to ever exist in a fiat-based economy. It is hard to find a vehicle where you can store fiat value into the future without dilution due to supply or a lack of economic security. Gold for example has a fluctuating supply, and even though the amount of gold if FINITE but nobody knows how much is left to mine, and the lack of a global public ledger means it is prone to fraud, so its derivatives may not represent the actual underlying asset. But otherwise, gold is also pretty good savings instrument too, which is why it currently sits at a 13T market cap.  \n5. As it gradually approaches global adoption over the next decade, as evidenced by the ETF approval, it will eventually match and likely overtake Gold's market cap. 13T will put BTC at around $600,000 USD per BTC. Given the fact that more fiat is printed over time, and especially during periods of economic recession, it is likely that we continue to see more and more inflation of asset values. A doubling of money supply over the next 5-10 years will see BTC market cap probably double that of Gold's at least, if not more.   \n6. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, as a pure savings instrument, it also helps to allow people to save REAL value from economic growth that comes from productivity gains. This means that even after BTC reaches peak valuation and adoption, it will still continue to grow year on year simply due to global economic growth and inflation, so there's no upper limit to its price. \n\nThere are of course a few risks to this above scenario:   \n1. A collapse of BTC security as mining rewards run out. this is looking less and less likely given that price is likely to appreciate faster than the halving rate, and people have found alternative uses of blockspace, for example for art storage that helps to finance the mining. Worse come to worst, the BTC holders naturally have an incentive to pay for economic security and the programmers are likely to figure out something.   \n2. Quantum computing allowing very old wallets to get accessed and around 20% of BTC may be hacked and spent. This is possible, but even then it may just be a temporary dent to the BTC value and could be an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for those who missed the train. Other issues with quantum computing are likely solvable via changing the core software. Also, the world will have bigger problems to worry about if encryption is cracked than BTC's value.   \n3. Global ban on BTC. Looking less and less likely given the gradual capitulation of governments. Look at the US for example.

I do not agree at all with this take, and I think while I‚Äôm willing to let anyone speak to their ideas, and try sometime new, that this operation will be pretty much dead in the water by 2027.\n\nThe point, my point, and many others‚Äôs point, is that instead of cheering on more custody, to more centralized platforms like coinbase holding custody for 85% of the new ETF‚Äôs, and miners who go public having to commit to only use Foundry where their contributing miners must KYC, and who can have their bitcoin 6102ed by the executive branch at any time of ‚Äúnational security‚Äù like they did gold 90 years ago, it only brings in more, and more complexity and falliability to the bitcoin ecosystem, and the only real pay off is number go up \\[and even that is utopian and questionable\\].\n\nI WANT TO SEE BITCOIN SCALE.\n\nWhat that means to mean is no more of this bullshit like: ‚Äúwe‚Äôve already won‚Äù, ‚Äúbitcoin is fated to win‚Äù, ‚ÄúI can just trust someone else to do all the thinking and coding for me.‚Äù\n\nHow much do you want to see what‚Äôs actually possible on a disinflationary money? I do! I‚Äôve watched it for a decade, as groceries, rent, gas, tools, computers, toys, vacations, homes all fall against bitcoin linearly.\n\nBut my western problems in California are the same problems are some of my Russian coding friends, or people in Honduras I speak with, or Africas who can only use their cell a couple times a week.\n\nBuilding an all encompassing global monetary network means doing our best to reach everyone, and even making concessions when fediments, or local bitcoin banks/leaders can serve, or creating better means to do millisat transactions, and on and on.\n\nIt‚Äôs a lot‚Äîbut there are truly brilliant minds working constantly in the areas they know best. I just pray we can get back to having the good faith arguments from a decade ago before spooks came in to surreptitiously create disharmony, paint bitcoiners as out of touch racists, criminals, and whatever other PR tactics they‚Äôve used for centuries.\n\nIt won‚Äôt be easy. But I would much rather be onboard my friends and family to real bitcoin and teaching them how to store than conversing to a closed system where the government tells us how we can mine, transact, and how much of our USD profits belong to them when we must cash out at least a portion to fix our roofs or get another decent used vehicle.\n\nBitcoin to the bottom first before the top. We are trying.\n\nSo no, I don‚Äôt celebrate more ETFs. We went through this last cycle with GBTC and BAKKT, and mostly it just opened more risk.\n\nBitcoin is a P2P Electronic Cash System. It is not a Peer 2 Market-Maker 2 Peer system. The middle men are unnecessary. They are ignorant. It won‚Äôt end well.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kfl3p5dqfgcc1.jpeg?width=856&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b64a4bcfc764780c24d5c52bdf954ef7dccf0d7b", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Yes it is sad in that it goes against the ethos of Bitcoin.

Especially when it came to being a good representative token for high value currency, since it was rare, non degrading and light for its mass. But also it was useful for jewelry for similar reasons.\nThus is why gold was always in high demand, which led to it being seen as inherently valuable in most modern cultures.  \n\nModern economies however don‚Äôt need gold to function as a high value token anymore, since modern paper and electronic currency does the job just as well if not better. That‚Äôs why most countries have decoupled from the gold standard in the last 60 years. It was no longer a practical way of representing value in a meaningful way. The current value of gold is largely just there out of respect to its history and that the concept is so ingrained in media.\n\nBitcoin does NOT have any of the same practical functions.\n\nNow some morons might argue that it functions as a representative token of value. For which it does a horrible job. Ignoring all the issues that come with its slow transfer and too limited supply for common trade (both would be disqualifying by themselves) it‚Äôs main issue is that it lacks the main defining factor that currency has to be, which is being representative for a specific tradable good or service.\n\nThe reason why traditional government backed currency works, is because they are representative of all the functions and services the government provides as a whole and can be effectively traded in for them, no matter by whom as long as they have the correct amount (that‚Äôs how taxes work). Think of it as a glorified Chuck E Cheese token. If you bring enough to the correct place they will give you a specific thing they have promised you in exchange.\nNow you might ask yourself why different currencies have different values at different times. Well this based on the amount of promises a country makes (in other words how much money they print in relation to what services they claim to provide) and the faith of the people of them upholding those promises. This is what‚Äôs known as being backed p\n\nThere I just saved you about 3 hours of lectures that explain in actual detail the many layers of stupidity of the history of gold, history of currency, the impracticality of crypto currency‚Äôs and the inherent uselessness of unbacked currency and a few minutes of macro economics. \nYou are welcome", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "What a clown", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bitcoin and crypto is all cool and all until a sun flare hits or a EMT blasts our cities.
