I am angry. This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people,‚Äù Minicucci said, according to excerpts released ahead of the interview‚Äôs airing.\n\nBoeing‚Äôs 737 factory will have what the company calls a ‚Äúquality stand down‚Äù at its Renton, Washington facility Thursday, the company announced Tuesday.\n\n‚ÄúDuring the session, production, delivery and support teams will pause for a day so employees can take part in working sessions focused on quality. This is part of the immediate quality actions recently shared by Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal,‚Äù the company said in a statement.\n\nThe internal notice Boeing sent to its employees indicates that the 737 stand down is the first of several that it will hold at its facilities.\n\nNBC asked Minicucci if Boeing has a problem with quality control extending beyond a single plane.\n\n‚ÄúI think this is the issue that‚Äôs at question right here, which is what is Boeing going to do differently on their quality program, to make sure that when we get an airplane, it‚Äôs at the highest degree of excellence and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs got to be different going forward,‚Äù he said.\n\nHe added that the company is adding its own extra oversight on the airplane maker‚Äôs production line.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration urged airlines on Sunday to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes. After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have found loose bolts.\n\nFAA opened a formal investigation into Boeing‚Äôs quality control around two weeks ago. The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again.\n\nMinicucci noted in the interview that the inspections take about 10 hours per door.\n\nIn a statement, Stan Deal, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: ‚ÄúWe have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.‚Äù\n\nThe CEO of United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, also expressed frustration with the company.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed that‚Ä¶ this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn‚Äôt new,‚Äù said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. ‚ÄúWe need Boeing to succeed. But they‚Äôve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.‚Äù\n\nUnited has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Boeing‚Äôs future is also uncertain regarding orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA.\n\n‚ÄúI think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back for us,‚Äù said Kirby. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to build a plan that doesn‚Äôt have the Max 10 in it.‚Äù\n\nCNN‚Äôs Chris Isidore, Gregory Wallace and Hanna Ziady contributed to this report.", "id": "19e477f", "created_utc": 1706057440.0, "score": 556, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "\"Some loose bolts on many planes\" = \"a lot of loose bolts\"\n\nIn an industry where near perfection is supposed to be the standard, this is a disaster.

The hair-raising incident drew fresh and sharp criticism of Boeing‚Äôs quality control systems and safety culture, which has been under the microscope since two fatal 737 MAX crashes five years ago.\n\nLast week, an anonymous whistleblower ‚Äî who appears to have access to Boeing‚Äôs manufacturing records of the work done assembling the specific Alaska Airlines jet that suffered the blowout ‚Äî on an aviation website separately provided many additional details about how the door plug came to be removed and then mis-installed.\n\n‚ÄúThe reason the door blew off is stated in black and white in Boeing‚Äôs own records,‚Äù the whistleblower wrote. ‚ÄúIt is also very, very stupid and speaks volumes about the quality culture at certain portions of the business.‚Äù\n\nThe self-described Boeing insider said company records show four bolts that prevent the door plug from sliding up off the door frame stop pads that take the pressurization loads in flight, ‚Äúwere not installed when Boeing delivered the airplane.‚Äù the whistleblower stated. ‚ÄúOur own records reflect this.‚Äù\n\nNTSB investigators already publicly raised the possibility that the bolts had not been installed.\n\nThe account goes on to describe shocking lapses in Boeing‚Äôs quality control process in Renton.\n\nThe work of the mechanics on the door plug should have been formally inspected and signed off by a Boeing quality inspector.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt, the whistleblower wrote, because of a process failure and the use of two separate systems to record what work was accomplished.\n\nBoeing‚Äôs 737 production system is described as ‚Äúa rambling, shambling, disaster waiting to happen.‚Äù\n\nIf that account of what happened is indeed fully documented in Boeing‚Äôs system it should be readily verified by the investigation.\n\nThe Seattle Times offered Boeing the opportunity to dispute the details in this story.

The new building will be constructed on the location of the old Warehouse on Wheels site which has been moved to another location.\n\nThat said, a significant amount of construction the time for Shanghai, Texas, and Berlin was not only due to clearing the land, managing the flood zones, watersheds, strengthening the ground with pilons, etc, but the sheer enormity of each factory.\n\nGiven the lack of rainfall in Sparks, lack of trees to remove, and water to manage -it's highly likely alot less groundwork will be needed to complete the factory.\n\nIt's also likely that the factory will be significantly smaller than each of the others due to the lower production volumes and probably simpler construction methods of the Semi in general.\n\nSo, for those reasons i would assume time to production should be shorter than the 12-18 months the other locations needed.\n\nAnd as further evidence you can actually watch a very early timelapse of the construction from 2014-2015 here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUy2tbWp5oQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUy2tbWp5oQ)\n\nAccording to the Electrek article attached to the video Tesla broke ground in Nevada on July of 2014 and by October of 2025 they were already producing Powerwalls/Powerpacks out of the factory.

This clip will also be partially usable. Perhaps it tried to go due to poor visibility, and the driver does the correct peaking before going, providing a very valuable training clip.\n4. On a daily commute, the car always picks the wrong lane, the driver knows ahead of time and corrects before getting into the wrong lane. This disengagement is also perfectly usable\n\nI expect we'll see pretty dramatic improvements as this goes out to the whole FSD fleet, especially recurring, easily reproducible interventions due to static environmental issues (like lane issues).
