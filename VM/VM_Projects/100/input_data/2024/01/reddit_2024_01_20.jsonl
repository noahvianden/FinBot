However two caveats: unemployment got lower not higher and the negative GDP growth is balanced by recent strong growth (Q3 +4.9% is bananas). \n\nLastly wages.

The hard part of soft landing is judging when you've done enough and cutting rates \"prematurely\" and letting the lag of rate hike do the rest of the work for you. That's what Greenspan did in 1995 and what the Fed is trying to emulate, but haven't actually done yet. It's entirely possible the Fed have already done too much, and we'll only find out 3-6 months later when unemployment starts to spike, and even if the Fed cut rates now the damage has already been done.\n\nSo just because inflation is down to 3-3.5% without unemployment going up doesn't mean the economy is good. It just means the Fed's job isn't as hard as what was thought by economist (consensus for underlying inflation was around 3.5-4.5%, so not as dramatic of a difference as the headline news. No economist believed inflation would stay at 9%).\n\nThe difference between the soft landing camp and hard landing camp is not that much. First of all, many soft landing camps(and even some Fed officials I would say) consider a mild recession a \"soft landing\". I would say any Fed officials forecasting 4.5% unemployment is in that hard landing camp, and anyone forecasting around 4.2% is in that \"mild recession\" camp. Both camps are seeing the economy weakening. The difference is the hard landing camp thinks the weakening will continue, while soft landing camp thinks it'll stay like this.\n\nSome weak data :\n\n\\- we got 100k nonfarm payroll 2 months ago after final revision. That's the amount the Fed believes is equilibrium economy (# of jobs needed to be added to accommodate people entering the labor force, neither strong nor weak)\n\n\\- Of the roughly 150k jobs added, 50k are from government jobs, and roughly 70k are from healthcare jobs. Both of these sectors are not tied to Fed interest rate, and are backfilling due to uncompetitive salary and not able to fill empty slots 2 years ago. Strip these out and you have roughly 20-50k jobs each month, fairly low.\n\n\\- Nov Fed beige book saying 2/3 of Fed districts have deteriorating economy or flat\n\n\\- excess savings that have been fueling consumer spending is very close to depleted (roughly 250b left from 2.4 trillions in 2022), depleting at a rate of roughly 80b/month.\n\n\\- Companies are starting to report consumers cutting down on spending.\n\nI don't think we are currently in recession yet, but if the econ deteriorate any further, we would be slipping into one.

When that yield curve inverts, the business model is no longer profitable, hence banks cut back on lending. In 2022, big banks were still paying checking accounts 0% because no one knew about the Fed fund rates. It wasn't until March 2023 when SVB happened that banks were finally forced to pay up for deposit. That was also when we saw the mass exodus from checking account to money market fund.\n\nSince March 2023, bank credit lending has been tightening gradually. Of course people/businesses don't need to finance all the time so it takes time for the high rates to bite into the economy. In fact, business/people are intentionally delaying financing anything right now in hope of riding out the high interest rate. At some point, they have to. Corporate bond refinance cycle starts this year. People have to move for jobs or buy a larger home for kids. The reason why we haven't seen a recession yet is because corporates and Americans were sheltered from the high interest rate. Furthermore, during high interest rate, the economy is weak and vulnerable to external shocks. When it's weak, any trivial external shock can tip it over, and we have several in the play right now : middle east conflict, China-Taiwan conflict, Russia-Ukraine conflict, extremely high amount of global election including the US, gov spending budget negotiation.
