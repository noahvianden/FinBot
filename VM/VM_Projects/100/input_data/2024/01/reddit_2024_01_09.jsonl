Who knows! lol\nGenerally speaking it is the overall market that goes up and keeps going up, not individual companies. Most individual companies tend to have boom and bust cycles that follow the news cycle. If they are in the news making headlines... That typically isn't the ideal time to buy in.\nBuy the rumor, sell the news. Nvidia has made some great moves the last couple years. The bitcoin halving coming up is likely going to be a tide that raises all crypto and make GPUs hot commodities again for mining. AI and video walls certainly aren't shrinking markets, so there is plenty of chance for growth that Nvidia can capitalize on. Automation and self driving cars are very GPU hungry, and cheap enough that we are starting to see more mass deployment. Lots of up-side potential for nVidia and other chip makers!\n... But nVidia has been on the hype cycle for a bit now, so how much of that growth is already baked into the price? I suspect they are at a point where their business is priced in, and any deviation from expectation has far more down side risk, than good news bringing upside risk right now. They may not fall in price, but the likelihood of their price rising significantly again in a repeat of the last few years seems unlikely.\n\nDont go for companies after they have made headlines. Look for companies that have been out of the hype cycle for a while. Look for companies that are taking a hit in the media right now but are unlikely to go out of business for it. But mostly, don't make big plays on companies that are already big. I mean, you likely have a 401k, or a broad market index fund... Big popular companies are already well represented in those funds, and that is where the bulk of your money should be. If you are buying individual companies, then look for that dark horse, not the market darling! Or buy a bunch of companies in an emerging industry and wait a decade for 1-2 winners to make the 10-20 bankrupt failures worth taking the risk on.\nI may well be wrong thinking that Nvidia is going to stale for a while. But are there are lots of other companies with more growth potential right now. Put another way, we just went through a major downturn in markets, and everyone went to safety in tech stocks. Those big stocks are selling while the overall market is flat or rising... That means money is rotating into smaller and more risky companies again.

Trying to enforce religious views on everybody is a danger to humanity, with actual demonstrable deaths.\n\nWokeness can be annoying, sure, bad in certain aspects, sure. I don't like much of the movies or shows that try to force the opposite of current stereotypes. Men are physically stronger than women, biologically speaking. Men should not compete in women's sports. Certain people and groups are trying to make it seem equality is universal, while it's a concept in our mind, to threat all humans equal. A baby isn't equal to NFL line backer in a lot of ways, the same goes for the average women and the average men, because of biological differences. Trying to pretend this isn't true isn't help full, but it's not a threat to humanity. \n\nThere's a difference between biological sex and gender, this is all semantics to explain certain psychological processes.

If you want less pedophilia, you would want to destroy the (at least in the open) straight people first, since they are the bigger threat. Maybe start with making it illegal for children to see their grandfathers, fathers, uncles, religious leaders and male family friends, since those are, by far, the most frequent roles that turn out to be pedophiles.\n\nA non transgender person abusing laws to support a person at risk is like a rich drug dealer taking advantage of support systems for poor people, THIS IS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE SYSTEM. This does not mean the system is inherently bad, it shows human laws are open for abuse because they can't be made on an individual basis, the same is true for many laws and support systems.\n\nPeople abuse systems set up to help people, if you judge a system SOLELY by it's worst use/outcome and IGNORE all it's positives, then there's no system in the world that could ever be implemented with the goal to help weaker groups/individuals.

So, to start off, since we are buying a call option, we are essentially buying the right to buy shares of Nvidia at $120 anytime before the option expires. Our $120 is what we call a strike price, essentially the price that we strike a deal to buy the stocks for when we choose to exercise our calls. When we look at the stock price, we clearly see that it is over $500, so because the stock price is over our call, we are currently in-the-money as far as gross worth goes. While it seems like free money, we have to take into account the cost of the actual option, because if we exercised now, we would get our stocks for $120, sell them for $500, so a $380 profit, buuuut, when we take into account the option price of like $400, we are actually losing money per stock, plus we're getting hit with fees and the opportunity cost of just investing in something safe, like a bond. When you buy the option, you'll see a breakeven price, which is pretty self explanatory. Since we want to make money, we will want to wait until the stock increases enough to exercise our options, sell the stocks immediately, and get out of the market, or keep em if we think it'll keep rising and sell later.\n\nNow, the guy who sold us the call, the writer, enters this contract  with us to provide those stocks immediately when we choose to exercise our call. He has no say in the matter, so he's kind of left out to dry. Because he's likely using a middleman, like Robinhood, and Robinhood doesn't want to get stuck holding the bill or have its doodoo reputation ruined any further, they also make the seller put up enough capital to cover his position. This is called a margin account.  At this point, it seems a bit dumb to sell calls, BUT this margin account usually earns interest, and the seller gets a hefty chunk of that $400 option premium, which he can then invest or store in the margin account to earn more interest. When we decide to exercise our call, he buys the stock at the current price via his margin account, sells it to us for $120, and his profit ends up being the interest earned from the account and any money made using the premium, minus the fees and the spread between current stock price and the strike.\n\nIf we never exercise our call, he gets a large pile of sheckles.

One reason you mentioned was interest in the margin account for seller. \n1.) Does that mean all of this is to harvest high interest rates from a margin account?\n\n2.) But then what advantage does Pelosi have in forking $40000 (for 1 option of 100 stocks) of cash upfront when they instead could have been earning interest.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "**tl;dr 1, Sellers focus on the time value of money, exchanging risk for premiums they can invest now to earn greater profits as time marches on**\n\n**tl;dr 2, Deep ITM call options are a lot like cash, maintain their value for a long time, and can be sold off to other investors to make money without buying the stock**\n\n1) When an option is created, the buyer, Nancy, is stuck with the risk that the seller will not be able to fulfill the obligation of the contract, which is to deliver the stock/underlying asset at the time Nancy wishes to exercise her option. When a broker, a middle-man like Robinhood, oversees an option trade, they will require the seller to put up collateral money to ensure that the contract can be fulfilled. This money is known as a margin account, and it usually has a few criteria required of it, namely an initial fund, which can be more than the actual value of the option, and a margin call level, which is a threshold that if the account value falls below, the seller MUST deposit more money or run the risk of the broker forcefully closing the option, which often financially ruins the seller and comes with other potential punishments, like being barred from trading via the broker. \n\nNow, because the seller is being forced to keep a ton of cash just sitting around in an account, earning no money, and the broker, much like a bank, can actually use that money to do their own investing, the broker will often offer the seller some interest on the balance in the account in order to incentivize sellers. This margin interest goes into the eventual profit the seller earns, but it's locked up until the option is exercised or expires. \n\nAdditionally, the seller receives the option premium, minus broker fees, for taking on the burden of being at the buyer's mercy. The seller can then invest that money to earn more money, and then just pull the cash to help fulfill the future obligation to the buyer. In theory, there exists an interest rate that can be achieved via buying/investing in stocks and bonds that is known as the 'risk-free rate' where the investments have no risk of loss and will just earn free money over time. This rate is what's used to in most investment theories and formulas. Utilizing this idea, this is where we need to modify your formula to multiply the premium by (1+risk-free rate)^(days passed/360), because that premium is earning some cash now. Once the option settles, they will also earn the margin account interest. OR, the seller could be lazy and just toss the premium into the margin account to earn the margin interest, which is lower than the risk-free rate, but takes less effort to achieve. This will just modify the eventual premium formula to be more simple.\n\n2) Now, for why someone would buy a deep ITM call option, it comes down to a few ideas. \n\nEdit: Removed some of this because I was typing at 3am and my math doesn't feel like it's matching at the moment..\n\nSecondly, and this gets complicated, we need to look at what are called Option Greeks, which you can see on an option if you click into it. You may have heard people mention things like Theta Gang or getting fucked/rewarded by the Delta on an option, and these are what they were referring to. Each option has a pile of Greeks, but the ones we want to look at for Nancy's are delta, theta, and gamma\n\nDelta measures the change in an option's premium/price in regards to the underlying asset. Calls have deltas between 0 and 1.00, or 0-100%, which is the ratio of how much the option's value increases per dollar increase of the underlying asset. An option, similar to Nancy's, has a delta of .9947, which means Nancy's option is almost the same as just investing the cash, and since Nancy bought a call, she's expecting to end up with a ton of profit later.\n\nNext is Gamma. Gamma measures the rate that Delta changes over time, or how stable is the Delta. The higher the Gamma value, the more volatile the Delta, which isn't great if you want a safe and stable investment that isn't going to go from valuable to worthless over a few % change in stock value. Gamma tends to be close to 0 for deep ITM or OTM options, and pretty wild when you're close to break even. The same option mentioned in Delta has a current Gamma of 0.0001, so Delta is going to be quite stable, further reinforcing that Nancy's option is going to make a ton of cash if the stock keeps rising.\n\nLast is Theta gang, and it measures the loss of value of an option as it approaches expiration. Theta is a seller's friend more so than a buyer, because part of the value of an option is the actual right to exercise it, so each day that passes means one less day of having that right. Theta is always negative for purchased options, and the more negative it is, the more loss of value of the option each day. Nancy's option has a theta of -0.0228, so it isn't losing much money each day.\n\nThere's also Vega and Rho, which measure option value changes in regards to volatility or available interest rates, but ehhh.\n\nAnd this all assumes Nancy holds her option and exercises it. She could just sell the options off to someone else later to pocket money like a lot of options traders do.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for taking the time to right this!!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Thank you!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "There were people here on this sub making the case for buying NVDA several times earlier last year.

{"title": "[DD] Here's what you're missing on the Boeing Safety Crisis", "selftext": "A 737 MAX losing a window mid-flight is a terrible PR disaster, but on its own just that. A PR disaster that will blow over. However, unfortunately for Dave Calhoun and all the BA bag holders, the timing could not be worse.\n\nYou see, BA has been trying to sneak through safety exclusions for the upcoming 737 MAX-7 and MAX-10. And they were about to get away with it too. But now this PR disaster has awoken the sleeping giant that is American consumers, just in time for them to realize that they have BA by the balls.\n\n**The Airworthiness Directive**\n\nBack in August, the FAA published a [little-noticed Airworthiness Directive](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/08/10/2023-17197/airworthiness-directives-the-boeing-company-airplanes) where they state that the engine anti-icing (EAI) system on all 737 MAXs can bring down the entire plane if left on for **FIVE MINUTES** too long. Direct quotes:\n\n>the use of EAI in dry air for more than five minutes during certain combinations of altitude, total air temperature, and N1 settings can result in engine inlet cowl temperatures exceeding design limits\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The departure of the inlet may cause fuselage and/or window damage, potentially resulting in decompression and hazard to window-seated passengers aft of the wing and/or impact damage to the wing, flight control surfaces, and/or empennage, which could result in loss of control of the airplane\n\nOkay that's not so bad right? Just add some temperature sensors and/or an alarm for the pilots so they can take corrective action? Surely that would be the FAA's imposed remedy?\n\nNope. FAA said pop a disclaimer in your manual and you're good. Look at this fucking shit right here:\n\n[we fixed it they said](https://preview.redd.it/g0mkh3g3pfbc1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3afe9861704b72194e9941b6e5c567ba754716d)\n\nImagine for a single second that your car had this problem. That if you left your fucking window defogger for 5 minutes too long, your wheels might start popping off. What would happen? Instant recall. Pull the cars into the shop, fix them. And of course, stop making new cars until the problem if fixed.\n\nOk obviously planes are different than cars. And we all wanted to go home for the holidays to see grandma once more time before she kicks the can so nobody wanted to see the MAX fleet grounded and flights cancelled.\n\n**The Request for Safety Exemption**\n\nThat AD was already terrible timing for Boeing, since they're trying hard to get the MAX-7 certified, and it has the exact same engine melting problem.\n\nThe next piece of the puzzle comes in last month, when Boeing [formally petitions for their upcoming MAX-7 to be Exempt from a handful of safety regulations](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-wants-faa-to-exempt-max-7-from-safety-rules-to-get-it-in-the-air/).\n\nThey want to slap the same warning in the manual and sell these puppies to Southwest, so you can start riding them next year.\n\nThey know their existing fleet of 737 MAX has a safety issue. They won't ground them to fix them. They won't stop making new MAX-8 and MAX-9 with the safety issue. And now they want to release a new model that they know is unsafe on day 1.\n\nThe request is egregious. You should [look at it yourself](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FAA-2023-2340/document). But just look at these two parts in particular:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2w3ik0shvfbc1.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=5112e7351158cfa2573372c356b86c1749d443f0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7tgph3qnvfbc1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=0817077491d259ec026ddb251947024ab8da2b1a\n\nThey're saying - we have a failure condition that can lead to catastrophic (i.e. everyone dies) failure and our lawyers agree it's not \"extremely improbable\". But don't worry, we have a fix that relies on pilots never forgetting the 5-minute rule, and also we won't take into account their human needs as part of our safety system.\n\nBut don't worry, they'll have a real fix by ... mid 2026\n\n**Reading between the** **~~lies~~** **lines**\n\nThey want us to believe that the company with a [history of deliberately hiding info from the FAA](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/boeing-charged-737-max-fraud-conspiracy-and-agrees-pay-over-25-billion) noticed a theoretical issue by \"analyzing the data\". The same inlet that doesn't have a basic temperature sensors to alert pilots of overheating has sensors to detect issues like this?\n\nBULLSHIT. After a dry flight over the American southwest, some good mechanic noticed that this part was halfway fucking melted and told his boss. They ran it up the chain, had their \"oh shit\" moment, and then instead of working on a fix, went straight to work covering their asses to limit liability. Tell the FAA so that FAA can issue the AD with the shit remedy, then if a plane crashes they can say FAA gave them permission. Oh and they can just blame the pilots ([like they did last time](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-16/are-boeing-planes-unsafe-pilots-blamed-for-corporate-errors-in-max-737-crash))  for forgetting the 5 minute rule. Stupid pilots. Stop flirting with the stewardess and set your 5 minute timer again\n\nAt the same time, they're using [leaks to the press](https://simpleflying.com/boeing-nearing-certification-737-max-7-10-october-2023/) to put the screws on the FAA. They've hyped the stock, so now if they FAA blocks them all the BA bag holders will be mad at the FAA, and FAA will be forced to make the good 'ole boys at Boeing look bad.\n\n**Boeing didn't learn their lesson**\n\nThese are the same people who killed 346 people due to their negligence and prioritization of profit over quality. THEY HAVEN'T FUCKING CHANGED\n\nPeople have noticed. People are sick of Boeing's bullshit. Absolutely sick. Take a look at any reddit thread on Boeing, twitter, TikTok, hacker news. Everywhere. People are talking about how they will avoid these 737 MAXs like the plague and fly Airbus only.\n\nBut Boeing isn't worried. They know how short the consumer attention span is. We'll all forget in a few weeks, they're hoping and planning\n\n**We Aren't Priced In**\n\nThis subreddit took down a hedge fund in 2021, for the fun of saving a fan-favorite video game store and the joy of stopping egregious greed in its track\n\nIt's time to do it again.\n\nI say fuck you Dave Calhoun. Fuck you Boeing execs. I'm sick of these shitty planes. I'm sick of the lies, sick of the lack of transparency. Sick of the huge Wall Street payouts while corners are cut again and again in production. Its time for a reckoning. It's time for Boeing to once again become a symbol of great American engineering, not a symbol of Wall Street greed.\n\nAnd I believe we can make this happen. Not on our own of course, but we are not alone. The American people are angry from the 2019 crashes. They're angry about the window popping out. They're angry about this safety exclusion.\n\nAll they need is a vanguard to show the way.\n\nOur demand is simple - NO SAFETY EXCLUSION. FAA must not grant it. If they do, Southwest must not buy these airplanes. If they do, I'M NOT FUCKING RIDING IN THEM\n\nUnleash the meme war machine. Buy puts. Sell your BA. Short BA\n\nWe aren't fucking priced in\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4rm7n7r1gbc1.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5a7e606a2ad7f0acfe48f4ffc93ad7c34656185\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "192j6ib", "created_utc": 1704818940.0, "score": 918, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 221, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|17|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxc6jf/missed_wayfair_jump_get_ostk/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/192j6ib/dd_heres_what_youre_missing_on_the_boeing_safety/) \n**Account Age**|13 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "There's no pleasing you people, you wanted more aisle seats and we gave you a deluxe view seat, but nooo.\n\nThis country has gotten soft", "score": 423, "replies": [{"body": "please sir, can we at least swap the life jackets out for parachutes?", "score": 124, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, so I can soft land into shark infested waters or a rocky crag", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "hopefully it's the agro-crag", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "We can give you a comforter and a pair of suspenders", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "This is very thoughtful and appreciated!

What's actually happened is that either Boeing, CFM, or both, reported the issue to the FAA, made a recommendation about how to ameliorate the threat, and the FAA then  officially issued the AD to ensure compliance and awareness.  *That's* exactly how aviation safety culture works- things are constantly evaluated, often new issues are found, the issues are reported, and a solution (temporary or permanent) is mandated.\n\nThe important point, above, is that the FAA didn't uncover a problem- Boeing did.  They then reported it and the FAA issued an operational mandate to ensure that operators were aware of it.\n\nAt any rate, without access to the document, it's impossible to know what the probability was.  Likely it wasn't calculated to the Nth degree. More along the lines of 'hey, FAA, we wanted to let you know this thing exists and we need to make a procedural alteration to ensure that the possible problem doesn't become an actual problem.  We haven't seen it happen at all on any aircraft, but our materials-engineering QC auditor guys say it's theoretically possible under this one very specific set of conditions.'\n\nBut evidence-based analysis based of the fact that the airplanes have been flying since 2016\nand that of the 1160-ish Maxes currently flying, having collectively racked up literally millions of flight hours without this issue popping up even once, before or after the AD was issued, is pretty telling and points to the chances of it happening being minuscule. Not impossible, but damned near. Far more likely to have some other type of 'normal' mechanical failure than this specific issue.  Or to have an engine damaged from ice buildup because the system *wasn't* used.\n\nI mean, I've flown the 737/Max for over 4000 hours and have never had a single issue with the engine anti-ice system.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> or to have an engine damaged from ice build up because the system wasn’t used \n\nYeah I’d be concerned that the fear of having the anti-icing system on during the wrong conditions could increase this likelihood.

How do you think about that, as a pilot?\n\nI don't think it's really an issue.  The rules are very specific: Engine anti-ice on when the TAT is 10°c or less in flight and visible moisture is present (rain, snow, clouds, fog, etc.).  We turn it on just prior to or upon entering the conditions.  The consequences of not doing that are potentially ungood.  None of us would be wary about turning the A/I on if we think it's needed.\n\nThe issue the AD addresses is exiting the conditions and not turing it off. Anyway, there's far more potential danger from forgetting to turn it on than forgetting to turn it off, is my point.\n\n> FWIW, it concerns me when Boeing has noticed issues with their planes and pushes responsibility for remediation on to the pilots, whether than adding a fix to the plane itself\n\n> Then if something goes wrong, they’re all set to blame the pilot\n\nEvery airplane I've ever flown has had changes made to the operating procedures based on the discovery of new information or on modifications that are done to the airframe or engine. Over 23 distinct types and every one  has had modifications to procedures at some point.  It's normal. \n\nBoeing isn't passing the buck or shifting blame with this. They're disclosing new info as it becomes available and adjusting procedure to accommodate it. Later versions will incorporate modifications/changes to eliminate the problem.  \n\nIt takes a while sometimes.  It's expensive. The process of making changes to already-approved aircraft and their systems is tedious. You can't just 'slap a sensor' on it like you've  suggested.  Every single component in an FAA- approved passenger airplane, down to the tiniest screw, has to be documented and approved by the FAA certification process.  \n\nIf I land in Des Moines Iowa and the FO discovers a screw missing off some minor component somewhere, the local mechanic in DSM can't just run over to Home Depot or whatever and buy a replacement.  They have to use an FAA-approved screw that conforms to TSO-xxxxx from an approved supplier.  That screw's history has to be able to be tracked from the moment it came into existence to the moment it is eventually removed from the airplane.  Its installation has to be be documented and signed off by an authorized mechanic.  If said screw isn't available, we can check to see if there is an approved procedure that allows flying without it for a specific period of time or number of flights.  If there is no deferral procedure, the airplane sits until an approved screw can be flown in and installed.  This is the source of many maintenance delays at non-hub airports. \n\nSo, if the process for replacing a screw is that involved, can you imagine how long and difficult a process it is to add an extra warning sensor or system to an airplane?   It can take years.\n\nThat said, there are temperature and pressure monitors on the engine A/I systems already.  It will shut itself off if it exceeds these limits.  My guess is that there's one little spot somewhere in a part of the cowling that can get a little too hot under very rare conditions even if all other parameters are normal.  The most likely and effective change will be to redesign the inlet A/I or change the materials used.  These are not easy things to accomplish.  \n\nIt's just not that hard to remember to turn off the anti-ice.  There are already procedures in place (pre-AD) that require it to be off outside icing conditions. All pilots know that leaving A/I on outside these conditions  on *any* airplane might cause overheating. Boeing is simply being very specific and now including it as an actual documented operational  limit. I'm cool with this.  As a pilot, a huge part of what they pay me to do is operate the airplane within its limits.  That's literally the job.\n\nIt happens will all aircraft types.  This is the way.  I don't feel at all like I'm going to be fingered if something happens to the airplane.  I *want* them to handle this the way they are handling it.  Give me the info and let me know how to minimize the threat, then get to work on solving  the problem on a more-permanent basis.\n\nu/enodios- added some edits for clarity, if you're still interested at all", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}

I recognized pretty quickly my crypto success was less about being smarter than others and more about being in the right place, right time, and right side of a rare/huge momentum trade. Early to mid-2017, my roommates saw how much money I was making with crypto and wanted to try their hand at it. I informed them they'd likely lose everything but there was a small chance they could make 2x-3x their money. They each threw a few grand into crypto and leveraged their positions by 4x-7x like I had been doing. This was right before crypto went parabolic in 2017 - a super lucky entry. Crypto prices started going straight up and I knew that wasn't sustainable for long, so I told them all to enter trailing stop losses. These ended up getting triggered right below the 2017 bull market's ATH - an even luckier exit. These were fairly broke kids just out of college who had suddenly 20x'ed their entire net worth in just a couple of months. They kept asking what's next and I was trying to explain to them how rare making 20x-25x in 2.5 months was and that we'd just gotten crazy lucky. I told them Crypto seemed over-bought and they should put their money into SPY or QQQ until we find another good opportunity. \n\nDespite just copying my trades, they all thought they had become genius investors and crypto white paper gurus. None of them took my advice. They all jumped back into trading Crypto with leverage because it had seemed so easy their first time. Within a few months, they were all back to being broke again.
