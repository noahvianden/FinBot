If you think even 20% consistent returns are skill you are delusional, the best investors in the history of the world barely average that and there is a lot to say about those simply being results of survivorship bias.\n\nYour risk is way out of whack,  know how I know that, you took a HELOC on your house.

Take the wins, scale back the holdings, get some cash ready for whatever is next.\n\nYou are smart, so don't be stupid and realize people as smart or smarter than you  and  who ONLY work in finance get destroyed regularly and this isn't even your day job, so how is it possible you are better, you are not, and realizing that is your only advantage.\n\nThis is a variation on the same question we get of someone saying \"is it realistic to make 10% a month so I can quit my job..\"  Yeah, sure it is, super easy, just drop in 10k in your account and in 10 years you will have $927 million, not sure why everyone doesn't just do that!\n\nedit : sp", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Debating whether i should buy an investment home and take out a HELOC and use the money to sell options on stable stocks like yourself.

So in the aftermath of that.....\n\n1. The yield curve inverted because the Fed inverted it.\n2. M2, which exploded in 2020-21, needed to go negative to bring down inflation risk and offset some of that.\n3. The housing market which went into bubble territory in 2020-2021 also needed a slowdown.\n4. Even corporate profits had surged, and had to go through a bit of slump.\n\nI've thought all along that many of these interest rate, housing related, and money and credit related indicators are related to Fed interest rate and balance sheet policies, and usually work because the Fed usually overshoots and causes a recession once they start to tighten. If the Fed actually gets policy right, they all can fail. \n\nAnd I think the evidence has only gotten stronger now for the soft landing scenario. Most of these things seem to have already gone through their needed adjustments and seem to be stabilizing. Housing has gone through it's slump and already seems strong again. New data the last 2 days beat expectations, and for Q4, Housing Starts were up 3.4%, Completions up 5.6%, and New Homes Sold up 8.9% compared to a year ago. I think Corporate Profits have gone through their slump and will likely have favorable comparisons going forward too. And the fiscal deficit remains excessive (~ 6% of GDP) so the yield curve likely needs to remain mildly inverted, and this doesn't indicate excessive tightening that will cause a recession. \n\nWhich is why I was mainly worried about labor market indicators in the first half of 2024. The unemployment rate is only very slightly higher than a year ago, so no big worries yet. But if quits continue to fall, continued claims increase, and the unemployment rate increases further, it does start to look to me more like the classic start of a recession. \n\nAnd that could still happen, given the lags often seen with monetary policy. I tend to think we are seeing shorter policy lag due to increased transparency in recent decades, but there likely isn't enough data yet to have high confidence in that.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "There's no bear or bull market.\n\nOnly the algo market, controlled by the few wealthy and those in power.\n\nIf you want to make money, three things: See where the trends are, don't get too risky or greedy, be lucky.", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "I own itm calls that expire in June, therefore the market will crash sometime between now and then to fuck me.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "The bear case is that a lot of dumb, fearful money is on the sidelines. $8 trillion.

I think sentiment sucks, I think Elon could potentially find means to crater the stock. I think there is *a lot* to root for in this company, but the sharks of issues surrounding it means I would rather wait to see if there is a large discount after we potentially see a correction in the broader market.\n\nShort term, however, I believe we see a large bounce, as one does in Tesla when it hits these levels of oversold on the hourly timeframe. We are talking <15 RSI on the 4h chart, and oversold on the Daily, more then 25% below the 200MA. There's a lot of calls here for a strong bounce >200 and possibly to 230 before the month is over. It's happened **many** times before with Tesla, and will likely happen again.\n\n**That being said, lets look at then numbers.**\n\nI see plenty of people here talking about how Tesla is doomed now and is \"just another car company now\" because BMW and Cadillac are both making EVs, which are both getting to Level 3 autonomous driving before Tesla. But just googling for five minutes will tell you that both of these companies are nowhere near positioned to overtake Tesla, and if anything they are in a better position for Tesla to just simply buy them out to shut them up.\n\nThese are all TTM for 2023, and I am simply going to just look at the range of prices for each companies **cheapest** EV options.\n\n**Tesla**\n\nOperating Margins - 14.3%\n\nTesla cars sold - 1.8 MILLION\n\nCheapest EV - Model 3 - $38 to $50k\n\nOperating margin per vehicle - $5300 - $7150\n\n**Cadillac**\n\nOperating Margin - 6.98% **<<< Half of Tesla's operating margin**\n\nCars Sold TTM - 147k **<<< Less then 90% of Tesla's volume**\n\nCheapest EV - Lyriq - $57 to $61k **<<< 22% - 47%  More expensive than Tesla**\n\nOperating margin per vehicle - $3970 - $4250 per Lyriq (?)\n\n**BMW**\n\nBMW Margins - 17.58% **<<< Better then Tesla**\n\nCars sold TTM - 360k <<< **Less then 70% of Tesla's volume**\n\nBMW i4 - $52,200 - $61600 <<< **22% - 36%  more expensive then TEsla**\n\nOperating margin per vehicle $9000 - $10829 <<< **Better then Tesla**\n\nSo, yeah, BMW makes more profit per vehicle but their volume is astoundingly less then Tesla, Tesla simply has the factories and the verticals to support their tremendous growth. And on top of that, Teslas are MUCH cheaper then both these two examples which I am seeing brought up multiple times in this chat.\n\nLevel 3 driving is great, but at least for BMW it's going to cost $6000 to install. What if Tesla decides to simply include it in their most expensive model trim at cost? It's going to be like $70k to get Level 3 in a BMW when a Tesla will let you have it for $55k? It's a no brainer. You buy Tesla.\n\nI'm not even going to go into the charger stations. No \"car company\" is going to try and compete in that space. Tesla owns 58% of the charging station market. Any of these companies trying to compete against Tesla are still feeding into Tesla's margins because they will depend on them to charge their vehicles. Just wait until you see a day when traditional gas stations start implementing EV chargers throughout the midwest. Tesla will be the go-to.\n\nListen, i'm not a Tesla shill. But even outside of charging stations and EV vehicles, their other verticals still make billions and you don't even hear about them. So just be thankful when there's a dip because there is good reason to see Tesla being a 1 trillion dollar company this decade.\n\nEdit: I also want to add, with Cadillac and BMW we don't even really know the margins for their EV line up yet. It will take at least a year until we can be confident that they are actually breaking any ground in profitability, or if they are straight up taking a loss at these prices.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "You missed the point entirely.

{"title": "Whirlpool Corporation ($WHR) is a cutting edge boomer firm out of the Midwest and it's going to go up.", "selftext": "**Hello, WSB**. *How are you doing today?* You sent me a postcard a few days back requesting information on boomer stocks that had huge upside potential with very little downside risk. Does that ring a bell?\n\nGreat. The reason for this post today, regards, is something just came across my desk and it is perhaps the best thing I've seen in the last 48 hours. If you have 60 seconds, I'd like to share the idea with you. You got a minute?\n\nThe name of the company is, **[Whirlpool Corporation ($WHR). It is a cutting edge boomer firm out of the Midwest and it's going to go up.](https://i.imgur.com/g5bczz8.jpeg)**\n\n___\n\nNow, lets set some expectation for $WHR this quarter.\n\n> **$WHR Q4 Estimates**\n  \n> **EPS Normalized Estimate** $3.53\n\n> **Revenue Estimate** $4.98B\n\n> **Q4 EBIT Margin** 6.5%\n\n> **Full-year EBIT Margin** 6.25% - 6.5%\n\n___\n\nNow let's look at their EBIT Margin table from last quarter:\n\n|(approximate impact)|Q2'23 vs Q3'23|Q3'22 vs Q3'23|\n:--|:-:|:-:|\n|Ongoing EBIT Margin|7.3%|5.5%|\n|Price/Mix|-1.50|-3.75|\n|Net Cost|+0.25|+3.25|\n|Raw Material Inflation|+0.75|+3.25|\n|Promotional Investments|-0.25|-0.75|\n|Currency|nm|-0.75|\n|2023 Ongoing EBIT Margin|6.5%|6.5%|\n\n___\n\nListed above are the key-drivers to their EBIT Margins:\n\n* **Price/Mix**: you probably don't even understand what this means, so I'll break it down for you. It's a way to analyze how much of the revenue change is due to alterations in the prices of products versus changes in the mix of products sold. So basically, if prices increase, you have a favorable price. If Whirlpool sells higher proportion of high-margin appliances, you have a favorable mix.\n\n* **Net Cost**: Positive values for Net Cost indicate an increase in costs, a-duhhh.\n\n* **Raw Materials**: is a measure of how much more the company is paying for the raw materials it uses in its production processes due to inflationary pressures.\n\n* **Promotional Investments**: is a measure of their promotional investments, a negative number, they are investing less. a positive number, they are investing more.\n\n* **Currency**: is the impact of currency refers to how changes in foreign exchange rates affect a company's financial performance\n\nThe above driver's will now be segments that we will delve into\n___\n\n**Price/Mix**\n\n* According to the Consumer Price Index, prices for major appliances rose by 1.0 percent, with prices for ***laundry equipment*** jumping 4.1 percent after a string of sizable monthly declines. Also jumped in November, likely the same in January.\n\n* \"As we look forward to 2024, we have an even stronger lineup of new product introductions that we expect will positively impact price mix and market share.\" \n\n___\n\n**Net Cost**\n\n* [Substantial cost-savings efforts are underway](https://i.imgur.com/kncXAIU.jpg), they are guiding for a significant increase for this quarter.\n\n* Some cost progress, which we see in Q4, technically will only be fully P&L visible in the first two months of next year, likely improving future cost savings guidance\n\n___\n\n**Raw Material Inflation**\n\n* YoY Material Prices are significantly lower, the raw material prices QoQ are roughly the same and if some lagging can be expected, we're still at significantly lower prices where this becomes a large tailwind.\n\n* [Steel PPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPU101)\n\n* [Resin PPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCU325211325211)\n\n___\n\n**Promotional Investments**\n\n* nothing much of importance here, will be a slight increase in investment this quarter because of seasonality (Christmas ads) in an attempt to gain more market share.\n\n___\n\n**Currency**\n\n* Primary headwinds are EUR, INR partially offset by BRL, MXN\n\n___\n\nThe primary drivers here being **Price/Mix** & **Net Cost** because we already know raw material will be a significant tailwind. In order to delve a little deeper here, we will have to expand and look regionally to see what evidence we might be seeing in terms of cost-savings and demand (potential revenue).\n\n___ \n\n**North America**\n\n* We now expect industry demand up 1% to 2% in North America due to stronger than expected replacement volumes, trade customer inventory replenishment, and resilient builder demand\n\n* Privately‐owned housing completions in December were at a 8.7 percent (±19.9 percent)* above the revised November estimate  and is 13.2 percent (±17.7 percent)* above the December 2022 rate.\n\n* The pending home sales index, a leading, forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, rose 8.3% to 77.3 in December compared with a month earlier.\n\n* **What do home-completions and pending home sales mean for $WHR?** $WHR is already expecting strong replacement demand, but with a significant boost in home-completions they are also receiving increased discretionary spending. This is huge, and I think will demonstrate that a path to 12% margins is within reach over the next 2 years\n\n* They expect North America to deliver EBIT margins of approximately 10%\n\n**Latin America**\n\n* This region has seen significant demand recovery, and we now expect industry to be flat to up to 2%\n\n* Currency tailwinds are applicable to this region\n\n* They expect Latin America to deliver EBIT margins of approximately 6%\n\n**EMEA**\n\n* This region is a problem child and part of a divesture to trim the negative fat coming from this sector, which we will talk about later.\n\n* Industry expectations in EMEA of down 6% to 8% reflect an increasingly challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.\n\n* Asia demand continues to be impacted by softer consumer sentiment, **however what is extremely interesting** is the [reported earnings](https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/chinas-hisense-home-appliances-hisense-visual-link-arms-to-enter-southeast-asian-market) of a small-competing Asia-sector company called ***Hisense Home Appliances Group***. They experienced better demand this past quarter, where their stock rose 25% since the reported earnings on 12/22/2023.\n\n* The expect EMEA to deliver EBIT margins of approximately 1%\n\n___\n\nAlright so regionally, things look promising in North America, Latin America but still a problem-child in the EMEA region. So what can Whirlpool do to improve profitability and improve margins in these regions?\n\n**Arcelik**\n\n* Whirlpool Corporation’s wholly owned subsidiary Whirlpool EMEA Holdings LLC have signed a definitive Contribution Agreement for the creation of a new standalone business in the European home appliances sector.\n\n* This allows us to participate in significant value creation from the repositioning of the business and cost synergies through our minority interest\n\n* This also created benefits in the adjusted effective tax rate. Now between 0% to negative 5% for 2023, reflecting European legal entity restructuring benefits.\n\n* **Catalyst**: In anticipation of the closing of the Europe transaction, we expect to have a new financial reporting segment structure starting January 2024, including segmenting our attractive small domestic appliance business\n\n**Whirlpool India**\n\n* Whirlpool to sell 24% stake in India business to reduce debt. Analysts are keen on getting answers to when Whirlpool will start to settle debt-obligations and this was their answer.\n\n* Reducing debt, trimming fat, and improving profit margins globally seem to be healthy recipe to an improve balance sheet and a return to solid 7.5-8% EBIT margin globally.\n\n___\n\nOkay alright let's go ahead and make some predictions here relative to the above EBIT margin drivers.\n\n* **Price/Mix**: Demand is looking strong with new home completions, and increased pricing. They are mixing up their offerings and hopefully selling more high-margin appliances. If we can believe another Asian-competitor and their earnings, then we can maybe expect a slightly better than expected Asia region.\n\n* **Net Cost**: We can see that they aggressively cutting the fat and attempting to demonstrate the business value of their lucrative European home appliances sector.\n\n* **Raw Material Inflation**: We can easily see that the data is showing another strong tailwind here\n\n* **Promotional Investment**: Well we can't win them all, they will be spending more in this area this quarter.\n\n* **Currency**: Currency seems to be in-line with reported quarters, no major negative surprises here.\n\n___\n\n**Regional EBIT Margin Assessment**\n\n* **North America**: the data is supporting another double-digit margin, potential to show a further increase with the U.S housing data lending credence to home appliance growth normalizing & improving. \n> **Result: better than expected**\n\n* **Latin America**: the data is supporting a flat to small increase in margins. \n> **Result: better than expected**\n\n* **EMEA**: there could be a surprise in the Asian sector, and the new financial reporting segment of their European home appliances business will likely show great margins here. **This is key** because the America's & Europe make up a vast majority of their margins. This glimmering European-specific margin has been hidden underneath an umbrella of the EMEA region as a whole. \n> **Result: European margins look healthy, the rest of the regions flat to underpreforming**\n\n___\n\n**The most important question to be answered**\n\n* What is the path forward to a 12% margin in North America? Subsequently, what is the path forward to normalizing EBIT margin in all other regions to healthier percentages?\n\nI'll let you decide whether or not Whirlpool has taken steps towards these goals.\n___\n\n**In Summary**\n\n* $WHR is poised to deliver better than expected financial results this quarter with promising trends into the FY24/25 cycle.\n\n* They achieved this by aggressively tackling cost-savings, and momentum in the housing sector is contributing to increased sales.\n\n* Business restructuring efforts will be rearing their heads into the next few earnings reports with a nice catalyst of a new financial reporting segment for their lucrative European home appliance business.\n\n* I believe they will be able to guide healthy by demonstrating reduction in debt, cost-savings, demand picking back up and a normalizing and improving direction of growth all the while still providing a dividend.\n\n* $WHR is expected to make a +/- 7% move.\n\n* [$WHR banbet, 9 wins 1 loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1abfs7e/daily_discussion_thread_for_january_26_2024/kjp6e44/)\n\n___\n\n**How do I make money on this?**\n\n* *this is not financial advice but...*\n\n* $WHR 2/2 $130 calls (FDs)\n\n* $WHR 2/16 $125 calls (reasonable)\n\n* $WHR 3/15 $125, $130 calls (reasonable)\n\n**Good luck!**", "id": "1aco76w", "created_utc": 1706398105.0, "score": 206, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|763|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5nhni/dd_aa_alcoa_earnings_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvbj36/dd_len_earnings_runup_play_for_a_nonmeme_wsber/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aco76w/whirlpool_corporation_whr_is_a_cutting_edge/) \n**Account Age**|11 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "See you in a week ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Are washing machine options the best way to launder money?
