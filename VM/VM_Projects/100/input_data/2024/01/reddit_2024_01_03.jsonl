{"title": "Americans Are Canceling More of Their Streaming Services", "selftext": ">Hulu, Netflix and other streamers are turning to bundles, discounts and ad-supported plans as customer defections rise\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/business/media/americans-are-canceling-more-of-their-streaming-services-fb9284c8\n\n* About one-quarter of U.S. subscribers to major streaming services—a group that includes Apple TV+, Discovery+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock and Starz—have canceled at least three of them over the past two years, according to November data from subscription-analytics provider Antenna. Two years ago, that number stood at 15%, a sign that streaming users are becoming increasingly fickle.\n\n* Among the U.S. customers who joined Disney+ for the first time in November or converted from a trial, nearly 60% opted for the ad-supported tier. That figure was bolstered by Black Friday promotion and is up from 25% in December 2022, when the ad tier was launched. \n\n* More than one-third of new U.S. Netflix customers in November opted for the ad tier, compared with 11% a year earlier, when the ad-supported version was introduced. Streamers say ad-supported plans are a win-win for them and price-sensitive customers, bringing in revenue from monthly subscriptions as well as ad sales.\n\n\nIt’s getting a lot harder for streaming services to hold on to their customers.\n\nCrystal Revis, a mother of six in Lynn Haven, Fla., recently canceled her subscriptions to Disney\n+ and Paramount+, among others, because of their swelling price tags and the rising cost of living. She is also considering canceling Netflix, home to shows such as “The Crown” and films including “Leave the World Behind.”\n\nRevis is among the consumers nationwide paring their streaming bills and getting more strategic about when they turn services on and off. Customer defections across premium streaming services rose to 6.3% in November, from 5.1% a year earlier. \n\n\n\n[Switched Off - Customer cancellation chart](https://i.imgur.com/XSIM5tw.png)\n\n“With the streaming services increasing their rates like they are, it’s, like, ‘OK, do I pay for the cable?’” Revis, who is in her 40s, said of deciding what home entertainment to select.\n\nUnder pressure to improve profitability and avoid having to reacquire users, streamers are trying a range of tactics to retain customers, from launching lower-cost ad-supported tiers of service, to teaming up with rivals on bundled deals and providing discounts or free months of service.\n\nRevis planned to cancel Hulu, home to shows such as “Faraway Downs” and “Only Murders in the Building,” but decided to keep it because the service offered her six months of its ad-supported service for $2.99 a month, less than half of its typical $7.99-a-month price.\n\nBeni Goldenberg, 48 years old, has downgraded some services to control costs. In 2023, he switched from a $22.99-a-month premium Netflix plan to its $15.49-a-month standard plan, limiting the number of devices that can watch the service at the same time and lowering the viewing resolution. Netflix has long had the lowest rate of customer defections among major streamers.\n\n[Watch, Cancel, Go - Percentage of streaming services canceled](https://i.imgur.com/hV4Np2q.png)\n\nGoldenberg also cancels sports add-ons to his YouTube TV subscription when events are over. \n\n“I’m focusing on the ones that me and my family watch the most,” said the father of two in North Texas, who typically watches movies and TV shows on Disney+ with his family on Friday nights.\n\nSome customers who turn off a service return to it later, according to Antenna. \n\nOne in four people who cancel a premium streaming service typically resubscribes to that service within four months, and one in three does so within seven months. Half do so within two years.\n\n“Retention doesn’t just mean holding on to a new subscriber the first time they get them. It’s about managing a relationship over a true customer lifetime,” said Jonathan Carson, co-founder and chief executive of Antenna. Antenna compiles data from third-party services that collect information from consumers, with their consent, such as online purchases, bills and banking records.\n\nStreamers will have to become more sophisticated about when they try to win back customers, he said. For example, they might target ads and marketing efforts at people who tend to watch at a certain time of year.\n\nAd-supported plans offer streaming services a way to attract new customers and win back those who have canceled their subscriptions and want to pay less. \n\nAmong the U.S. customers who joined Disney+ for the first time in November or converted from a trial, nearly 60% opted for the ad-supported tier. That figure was bolstered by Black Friday promotion and is up from 25% in December 2022, when the ad tier was launched. \n\n[Returning to the Stream](https://i.imgur.com/Fa2Jwwd.png)\n\n\nMore than one-third of new U.S. Netflix customers in November opted for the ad tier, compared with 11% a year earlier, when the ad-supported version was introduced. Streamers say ad-supported plans are a win-win for them and price-sensitive customers, bringing in revenue from monthly subscriptions as well as ad sales.\n\nSome rivals have begun bundling their ad-supported tiers of service, offering a discounted rate in the hopes that customers see value in the offering and stick around longer. Verizon in early December began offering some of its customers a bundle that includes the ad-supported tiers of Netflix and Max for about $10 a month, instead of about $17.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has said bundling is an important part of the business’s future and can provide a good customer experience. Disney has said customers are less likely to cancel its streaming service when they pay for its bundle of Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. \n\nBrendan Byrne, a 40-year-old father of four in the Boston area, pays for streaming services including Netflix, the Disney bundle, Amazon Prime Video and Paramount+, in addition to cable, but is starting to question the value of some of those subscriptions. \n\nAfter the 2023 Hollywood writers and actors strikes, “the lack of content is evident across all of these streaming things right now,” he said. \n\n“We’ll cut back on a few of them,” Byrne said. “We’re just not using them.”", "id": "18x9f1g", "created_utc": 1704253168.0, "score": 1132, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 344, "comments": [{"body": "I recently cancelled Prime when they told me that not watching ads was going to be extra from now on.", "score": 421, "replies": [{"body": "I have been thinking about whether Prime is really worth it anymore.

{"title": "The Stock Market is a Giant Prisoner's Dilemma", "selftext": "\r  \n\rI am a research analyst working at a Wall Street firm and I have always tried to make a meaning of my work despite the growing evidence that active investing will underperform passive 99% of the time over the long term. I realized that trading in the stock market seems to indicate a classic prisoner’s dilemma. \n\nEveryone in the financial world has heard of the ever growing ‘passive’ investment strategy to just hold the market and you’ll always perform at the average for the long-term. Yet professional analysts that have access to corporate C-suite executives for an information edge + dedicate their whole working lives can’t seem to beat the market over the long term. (KEYWORD LONG-TERM). There are some anomalies to this such as people who turn up their risk incredibly and yolo on a stock and end up getting lucky or business owners that become millionaires on their stock alone. But what I’m talking about is common risk-adjusted returns from a stock portfolio. \r  \n\n\nWhen I first started as a research analyst, I couldn’t understand how working all day on company analysis and having such exclusive access to the investor relations team of stocks could end up yielding mediocre returns over the long term. Sure, we all see the news on this fund outperformed this year, and this one too, but no one looks at the 10, 20-year performance, everyone is focused on the short term and this and that PM having the ‘magic touch’. I then realized that the ‘exclusive’ access to companies isn’t that exclusive and they talk with many institutional investors – and of course, the information isn’t technically insider info. \r  \n\n\nThe formula to this in my opinion is simple. If everyone does passive investing, i.e., just invest in index funds and never do research, then good companies would never see a bump in their price and valuation as a reward from investors. Therefore, break-away active investors looking at these stocks could take advantage and make bigger profits versus the majority of people not doing research.

So IMHO only individual investors maximize their utility by cooperating (in this case indexing over the long term); all other agents maximize utility by defecting (moving money around and taking their cut).", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> Yet professional analysts that have access to corporate C-suite executives for an information edge + dedicate their whole working lives can’t seem to beat the market over the long term. (KEYWORD LONG-TERM). There are some anomalies to this such as people who turn up their risk incredibly and yolo on a stock and end up getting lucky or business owners that become millionaires on their stock alone. But what I’m talking about is common risk-adjusted returns from a stock portfolio.\n\nThat's because it's mostly paradoxical to keep risk the same or lower while obtaining higher returns.  It's in the best interest of portfolio managers to only take on as much risk as needed to make average returns.  Matching to an average index provides a more accurate trend.  Like you said, there are outliers who take on higher risk in exchange for higher returns, though calling them outliers or anomalies is a bit of a mischaracterization.  Different investors have different motivations.  Professional analysts aren't there to take higher than average risks, but rather grow the value of a portfolio in a way that attempts to guarantee as little loss as possible at any given time.  The idea that no one can beat the market in the long term without insider knowledge is pretty silly.  Almost anyone has a good chance of beating the market by using publicly available knowledge, as long as they take on greater than average risk that their portfolio will be worth significantly less at any period of time.  That might be seen as luck to some, but trying to reconcile lower risk with greater than average returns involves a lot more luck than choosing wisely and taking on greater risk.\n\n> The formula to this in my opinion is simple. If everyone does passive investing, i.e., just invest in index funds and never do research, then good companies would never see a bump in their price and valuation as a reward from investors. Therefore, break-away active investors looking at these stocks could take advantage and make bigger profits versus the majority of people not doing research. More and more people realize this and switch over to active research to try and get a piece of the bigger pie. And then so many people start active investing and finding the smallest piece of public information on the company that the advantage and information edge erodes away, leaving everyone worse off exactly like the prisoner’s dilemma. That’s why I think despite professionals underperforming benchmarks over the long-term, there will always be an active investing community for this reason.\n\nIf this was really the case, it would have occurred several times since time immemorial.  But it isn't happening because most investors (which is an extremely wide demographic) aren't actually interested in managing a portfolio and would at the very least prefer someone manage it in a way that results in as little loss while making the most likely gain.  What you're talking about with active investors speculating based on small amounts of public information has always been a thing because some people are more greedy and delusional than others.  If more people become active investors and make spurious investment decisions, that doesn't change the fact that there will be a market average to follow for those who don't want to go past the point where they are taking on higher risk but higher potential for loss.  The overall motivation for passive investing does not change.  It would only be a prisoner's dilemma if the motivations for passive and active investors were the same.\n\n> - if everyone cooperates and passive invests, everyone gets the most profit.\n\nIf all of the gold that exists is divided up so that everyone gets a bar of gold, is that gold still worth as much as it was before?\n\n> - If there are a few breakaways that defect and active invest – they get the most profit instead of the passive investors since they’ll have an information edge.\n\nOr they may lose big time because actually knowing what's going on is tremendously hard and is often beyond the skillset of average people.\n\n> - Many realize this and start active investing – everyone profits less and waste a ton of time and energy as the information edge disappears.\n\nWhich is why not everyone will become active investors.  Most investors have an aversion to losing money.  Niche information also isn't everything.  A business could do a good job at selling the same single product for 100+ years, change nothing about its business model, still return consistent profits and grow in value; the likelihood of any information being useful other than consistency of profit is extremely low, unless the industry is full of nuance.  You don't need to know information about this company that other people don't know in order to sell your shares at a higher value someday.  At the same time, that doesn't mean people should give up being active traders; not everyone has the same idea of what a \"good\" company is or what their ROI should be.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good sir, most people here probably don’t know what the prisoners dilemma is lol", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes I realized that when the most upvoted comment missed the entire point of the post", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You're very wrong on no funds outperforming long term, you'd do well to look into serial acquirers like CSI.
