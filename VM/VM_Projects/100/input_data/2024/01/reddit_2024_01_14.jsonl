{"title": "Housing: Bidding wars erupt as 2024 kicks off, with some listings seeing over 30 offers", "selftext": "Relevance to homebuilder stocks such as $PHM, $LEN, $TOL, $MDC, $BLDR, etc.  Also mortgage stocks and credit reporting agencies.\n\n* Improved mortgage rates means buyers are coming back — and that means competition.\n\n* Would-be homebuyers are once again coming out of hibernation, this time prepared to strike a deal before competition heats up.\n\n* The volume of applications for a mortgage increased 9.9% from one week earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis for the week ending Jan. 10, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). Some of that activity was driven by purchase applications, which increased 6% from the previous week, as buyers capitalized on the year-end decline in rates and a small boost in inventory levels.\n\nFor rate-sensitive buyers who have been waiting on the sidelines, these first few weeks of the year could offer a window to purchase, experts said. Still, any relief in affordability could be short-lived.\n\nBidding wars are already erupting in some areas of the US, which could drive up home prices among the few attractive listings. Additionally, new economic data this week could sway the Federal Reserve to postpone its planned rate cuts — keeping rates higher for longer.\n\n\"Prices here are all over the board. If your house is updated with the most recent home trends, you’re going to get offers,\" St. Louis-based Stayce Mayfield, a Redfin premier agent, told Yahoo Finance. \"We’re still getting bidding wars with anywhere from 20-30 offers — though it still depends on the location and condition.\"\n\nMayfield added, \"Some of our buyers agents are still experiencing multiple offers and struggling to get their clients in a home.\"\n\n**Where bidding wars are erupting**\n\nAs the new year kicked off, more buyers trickled into the housing market.\n\nAccording to Redfin, mortgage-purchase applications were up 3% compared to a month ago during the first week of January. Redfin agents also reported requests for tours were up 5% from this time in December, and there were 9% more new listings on the market in the four weeks ending Jan. 7 compared to a year ago.\n\n\"Right now, I think the majority of our agents all over the country expected to have a busy first few weeks in January given consults,\" Redfin spokesperson Allison Braun told Yahoo Finance. \"However, given the storms that are pushing through the country [that’s] really leaving potential homebuyers at home and on the sidelines.\"\n\nBy contrast, areas with good weather saw an uptick in activity. One Redfin agent in Phoenix noted an unusual uptick in activity this week.\n\n\"Telling my buyers to get in the market now, interest rates are lower and competition is low,\" said Phoenix premier agent Heather Mahmood-Corley. \"I imagine competition will really pick up in March and prices will start to soar. March really is a hot month here, the weather starts to get better.\"\n\nThe uptick in competition, though, could erode that newfound affordability. According to Redfin, at least 24% of homes sold in the four weeks leading up to Jan. 7, sold above list price. On average, the median price of homes sold was $363,125, up 4.1% year over year.\n\nMeanwhile, South Carolina-based president of Home Loans Inc. Jason Sharon, also noted a pickup in bidding wars in Charleston, S.C. — as well as in Atlanta and Huntsville, Ala. Some of those buyers may also have been lured into the market by the influx of new listings.\n\n\"I am already seeing bidding wars in cities with good job markets,\" Sharon told Yahoo Finance. \"Generally, they are houses in good condition, at or below the median price point. If mortgage rates continue their slow decline, I believe we will see more buyers enter the market, causing even more bidding wars.\"\n\nBuyers were also picky about where they put their money.\n\n\"No one wants to do a fixer upper right now, unless it’s in a really desirable neighborhood and the price is right,\" Mayfield said. \"I was working with a first-time homebuyer recently. We put in six offers (in the 200 range) and all the houses we put offers on kept losing. One of the houses we put an offer on had 33 other offers.\"\n\n**'Demand will depend on mortgage rates'**\n\nThough competition has seemingly begun to pick up in some segments of the US, mortgage rates could destabilize that momentum.\n\n\"Demand in the market, especially from first-time buyers, will likely depend a good deal on what happens with mortgage rates,\" Nicole Bachaud, Zillow senior economist, told Yahoo Finance. \"As it looks now, rates are likely to stay down from the 8% peak.\"\n\nWithin the last three months, mortgage rates have plunged more than a full point to a low of 6.62% the week ending Jan. 4.\n\nThe dip in rates saved potential buyers an average of $325 on their monthly mortgage payment from the all-time high set in the four weeks ending Oct. 22, Redfin found. Still, at a rate of 6.62%, buyers would have an average payment of $2,399 — up 7.4% year-over-year.\n\n\"While lower rates might sound like a saving grace to affordability, rates are still fairly high, keeping the cost of a mortgage out of reach for many,\" Bachaud said.\n\nThose hesitant to re-enter the market may face slightly higher mortgage rates in the near term.\n\nBoth inflation and unemployment readings came in higher than expected in December — indicating that the Federal Reserve may hold off on cutting interest rates. According to Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale, that could keep mortgage rates \"higher for longer,\" potentially causing rates to increase over the next few weeks.\n\nThe annual inflation rate increased to 3.4%, its highest reading since the 3.7% observed in September. According to the government report, shelter inflation including housing and rent costs continued to be a large influence.\n\nWhile shelter costs fell from a high of 8.2% in March of last year, they were still up 6.2% year over year in December. According to Realtor.com, shelter costs need to fall to 3.5% in order for inflation to come on target.\n\n“[Elevated rates] will curb total demand, as otherwise would-be buyers look for housing opportunities elsewhere, like single-family rentals,” Bachaud said.\n\n\n**'Buyers aren’t likely to see price cuts'**\n\nAs competition picks up, those waiting around on the sidelines may miss out on opportunities to negotiate a price reduction.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut in December was just under 16% — the lowest since April 2022.\n\n\"Sellers are holding firm on prices, likely thanks to the slower pace of price growth helping sellers (and buyers) know what to expect when it comes to setting a price,\" Bachaud said. \"Price cuts are never popular in the winter.\"\n\nDespite an influx of new listings this past month, the overall shortage of inventory was once again to blame for waning price cuts.\n\nNewly listed homes in December were 9% above 2022 levels as sellers showed up in larger numbers, Realtor.com found, marking a second month of increased listing activity after a 17-month streak of decline.\n\n\"Competition is complicated. As rates go down there will be more buyer activity but because there has been such little inventory and since homeowners have been waiting, how much will this motivate sellers to go to market?\" Scott Driscoll, Boston-based Redfin premier agent, told Yahoo Finance. \"I do think there will be a lot more activity from sellers.\"\n\nStill, active inventory in December remained 36% below typical 2017 to 2019 levels. That’s kept home prices propped up, Realtor.com noted. While the national median list price declined seasonally to $410,000 last month, prices were growing 1.2% compared to a year earlier.\n\n​​\"Competition in the market today is a bit stronger than pre-pandemic norms. Although high costs have pushed a lot of first-time buyers to the sidelines, there are also far fewer choices,\" Bachaud said. \"Buyers aren’t likely to see a lot of price cuts, and should expect some opposing bids for the most attractive listings.\"\n\n**‘New homes provide options for hungry buyers’**\n\nSome of the pressure in buyer demand could be soothed by new construction.\n\nSingle-family home construction surged in November after declining mortgage rates helped relieve some affordability concerns. Overall, housing starts increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Census Bureau.\n\nShould that rate continue to trend lower, that could provide a boost to new construction, noted the National Association of Home Builders.\n\n\"Unless we see new homes starts rise to 2 million homes per year, the seller's market will remain strong,\" Sharon said.\n\nHomebuilders reported more confidence, as lower rates have also attracted more buyers back to the market. With the share of previously owned homes on the market still low — builders can still get away with offering incentives for prospective buyers.\n\nIn December, 36% of builders said they offered a price cut averaging 6%. Meanwhile, 60% of builders offered sales incentives of all types, the same as November, but slightly down from 62% in October.\n\n\"New construction will continue to play an important role in bringing more options to the market,\" Bachaud said. \"As rates cool off from their peak, homebuilders are more optimistic about the future, increasing the number of projects they are starting this winter. Hopefully those starts translate into more new homes hitting the market to cool competition and provide more options for hungry buyers.\"", "id": "196mc18", "created_utc": 1705256480.0, "score": 137, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It isn't something you can just learn through messaging. First, you have to save up initial seed money to open an investment account. I recommend that you open your first account with Schwab. In a few years, open a second investment account so that you don't have all of your money invested in only one location. Schwab is stable, they have training resources, they have great analysis, and they have excellent research resources.\n\nI always advise people to start by investing in the SPY ETF (S&P 500). It is a fund of all the stocks that make up the S&P 500. That is like owning a part of the entire stock market. The first goal is to get 10 shares of SPY, even if it is just one share at a time. Plan to hold those shares for at least 5 years. That forms a great foundation. While accumulating that investment over many months, conduct research and learn about other individual stocks, up to ten, in preparation for your next purchase. \n\nRight now, the best bets are for growth tech stocks like Nvidia, Broadcom, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. They are all strong companies that will likely continue to grow for many years. There are others, but that is a good starting list. Don't gamble at first on volatile stocks being touted by the media. Pick one stock and focus on building up a few shares of that. Then start buying shares in another company.\n\nThe third tier is to also purchase some stable dividend stocks like Altria (MO), One Main Financial (OMF), iShares International Select Dividend (IDV), Enterprise Products (EPD) and DOW. Again, there are others, but that is a good starting list. As you accumulate dividends, use them to buy more stock. Keep injecting new money from your income into your investment account every month or week and accumulating more of the same stock. Slowly expand into other stocks over time until you own a dozen or so different companies. That's diversification, which limits your risk.\n\nWork on accumulating those groups for the next 3-5 years and beyond. In the meantime, keep visiting sites like this to read what others are doing. Read articles from Schwab, in your account, and every week read other materials and articles from investing sites. Just run searches on the companies I have listed and learn about them. In that process you will also learn about other important companies. Schwab will have links to daily news articles. Invest in an account with The Wall Street Journal and read it every few days or every day. Schwab rates various companies. Only invest in highly rated companies, like ratings A, B, or C.\n\nKeep a notebook for ghost investing. That's where you pretend that you have a lot more money and you write down entries as if you invested in certain stocks at a specific moment (date and time) at a specific price. Then you follow it. If you become concerned about a particular stock, then sell out, note it, and then reinvest in another company. Track your losses and gains. As you do that, you will learn lessons without losing actual money. It is a great investment exercise. You can do that over a number of years and hone your skills. As you get better at it, then use your skills with real money.\n\nWhen you put in an order to buy or sell, put in a limit order, not a market order. Look up the technique and learn about it. Don't worry so much about what the stock will do in the next hours or days. Only be concerned about what it may do over the next few months. \n\nStay away from options until you have years of experience with regular, long-term investing. Most people never get into options. Your portfolio is more likely to be successful if you avoid options.\n\nThat's a pretty good template you can follow for at least the next 3 years that will get you going.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Really nice suggestions.

{"title": "Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024", "selftext": "Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024, echoing trends observed in 2023. Tech firms persist in cost-cutting, efficiency improvement, and adapting to a cooling labor market. The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, a near 50-year low, yet recent months have seen a slowdown in job gains. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added 105,000 workers in October, 173,000 in November, and 216,000 in December, below the 2023 monthly average of 225,000.\n\n Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) confirmed on Thursday that it is laying off hundreds of staff across its voice assistant, hardware, and engineering teams. A Google spokesperson mentioned organizational changes, including role eliminations globally, aligning with product priorities.\n\nFitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are reportedly leaving the company after Google's $2.1B acquisition in 2021, amidst competition with the Apple (AAPL) Watch. Alphabet also made several cuts in 2023, including an announcement in January to eliminate roughly 12,000 jobs.\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) announced a 25% staff cut this week, aiming to restructure and refocus its core business for long-term and profitable growth. Approximately 1,800 employees are impacted, with the company unable to reasonably estimate costs associated with the reduction until the first quarter of 2024. Despite revenue growth, Unity has struggled to turn a profit, leading to a 20% decline in shares over the past six months.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to cut several hundred employees in its media units, including Prime Video and MGM Studios. Reports suggest a 35% reduction in the Twitch workforce, affecting around 500 workers, and a 5% cut in the Audible workforce. Like tech counterpart Alphabet, Amazon made various employment cuts in the previous year.\n\nXerox (NASDAQ:XRX) announced a 15% reduction in its workforce in the first quarter of this year as part of a restructuring plan. The plan focuses on improving and stabilizing the core print business, increasing productivity through a new Global Business Services organization, and directing Digital Services and IT Services capabilities towards more profitable markets.
