The debt of all of those companies is entirely manageable.  The stocks are at low valuations because demand is weak and manufacturing costs, particularly labor, are increasing.  Companies like Toyota and Honda have similar balance sheets, and they are performing well.

So, here are a few of your sillier ideas:\n\n>High debt is an historical issue across the capital-intensive automaking industry\n\nYou keep repeating this, and it is still wrong.  Debt of 1-2x EBITDA like most automakers have is objectively low.  This is the crux of your argument, and you are just pulling it out of thin air.\n\nYou simply ignored my point that some carmakers, like Honda and Toyota, are doing quite well with high debt loads.  If you can't address my points, that shows that your argument is baseless.\n\n>Stock markets are forward looking, so they are already discounting that we are out of an inflationary period and costs have stopped increasing.\n\nNo, this shows a complete lack of knowledge of the industry.  Ford and GM just gave huge raises to their employees - the effects of these raises are just starting to take effect.  You are just wrong to say the costs have stopped increasing for them.\n\n>Stellantis is at an insane discount vs. peers\n\nI specifically noted this by referencing their low valuations.  You don't seem to understand the significance of this.  Low valuations means that the market does not have confidence in the company.\n\nYou specifically argued that Stellantis was doing well because it doesn't have debt.  The fact that the one major carmaker without net debt has a *lower* EBITDA than all the others shows that you are completely wrong - having lower debt is not an advantage to Stellantis; if it were, then they would have a higher EBITDA than other carmakers.

{"title": "What market trends are you BULLISH on in 2024?", "selftext": "Hey all! Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn’t wanna go overboard \n\n**Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**\n\n The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.\n\n  \n**GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**\n\n Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining. \n\n**Uranium (BHP, NXE )** \n\nThe demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you betting on any of these?

In a theoretical alternate reality where electrical vehicles became the primary vehicle of choice and the electrical grid would have needed to accommodate them, then money, manpower, and whatever other necessary resources would have been provided to make it happen.  Why?  Because it would have been necessary to do so regardless the cost.\n\nWe work with what can be considered impossibilities every day.  Microchip companies need to keep creating new chips with impossibly smaller and smaller process nodes, and they keep doing so despite people saying that it isn't possible to keep going long before we hit the true physical limit (the atom itself).  How?  Because more money and manpower keeps getting thrown at the problem due to the necessity to push the limits of processing power vs deployment cost and physical (size/thermal/etc) limitations.  We continue to see progress happen, because it needs to happen, and therefore the necessary resources are provided to make it happen.\n\nIn this theoretical alternate reality where EVs dominate the roadways, the surrounding infrastructure would be heavily invested in to ensure that it all gets supported.  There wouldn't be infrastructure in place for ICE vehicles because they wouldn't really have been developed.  Homes would have been built with the expectations of needing to charge an EV.  There would be EV charging stations in place of gas stations.  Gasoline transportation to gas stations wouldn't happen, and the cost of all that daily trucking could instead go to core electrical infrastructure development and maintenance.  Power plants would be more heavily invested in and there would be more of them to support the increased electrical demand.  This would have all been ramped up over time, not all dumped on the grid in one go, and therefore wouldn't hit the same issues we would have *right now* if it were dumped on us *right now* out of nowhere.  The same problems would ultimately still be faced, transmission grid congestion would still be a problem, but our grid in this theoretical alternate reality would still be much greater to handle the greater consumption because the money and manpower would have gone to build it up because it would have been necessary.\n\nIn however many years when we're at this theoretical point that could support all these theoretical EVs, we will have the infrastructure in place to support it, right?  It won't be an impossibility then, right?  Just imagine that, but developed sooner because it was necessary to have it sooner and therefore the funding and manpower went towards it to make it happen sooner.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

The world is going to look a lot different in 15-18 years...an equal or greater difference than the past 40 years of technology change. As it stands, factory robots have also been in development for 40-45 years, and are poised to make a jump to the next level of human-like utility.

Current CPU architecture doesn't really do AI workloads well and really wasn't designed for it.\n\n ..but other chips and tech are well into development and even pushing into production on CPUs to handle AI specific loads.. something AMD and Intel are both working on, which will shift some workload from GPUs as necessary. This development is also what will bring more AI workloads locally to devices like phones because currently it's too powerful hungry and mostly done off-device (and less secure/private)\n\nThis is a large part of why Nvidia wanted to buy up ARM/RISC5 tech (also the same chip tech that Apple's 'in-house' chips are based on).. it's a big architecture shift and at the same time computing loads are changing a lot from what they used to be. Nvidia wanted a foothold in what's coming and a headstart if they even want to compete in non-graphics and AI workloads.\n\n It's going to take a little bit and it'll be a struggle but as soon as Microsoft is confident AND they can get software devs online and more familiar, we're going to see a huge change up in how computers handle things (even if it won't really be seen by end-users).\n\nSmall example is for both Intel and AMD - they both have decent (not amazing) integrated graphics working on CPUs without being huge power hogs, causing overtemps of CPU etc.. they also both have the dedicated AI chips implemented into some CPUs coming.. again, neither are huge but it's a step towards there being 0 market for low end GPUs and AI loads.. it'll only get better and Apple is making good strides of their own but they have wayyy less complications and variables to address because they only do their own ecosystem.. but there's been more basic game things popping up on Apple products recently.\n\n\nNeither AMD nor NVIDIA have their own production, they're at the mercy of places like Samsung and TSMC etc. Intel at least has their own fabs and is trying to get fabs going back on US soil.\n\nI think Nvidia is very strong but not bulletproof and I think when lower power, dedicated AI chips are better and integrated into new architectures for all our devices.. Nvidia might not have such a stronghold in the long run. Companies DON'T want to be doing all the processing for you (openai bleeds money in processing people's memes). They want it on your devices because it's way cheaper, but people can't strap a 4090 to their phone.. so there's big interest in NOT having huge power monsters being the way forward.

Cards used for AI training can be referred to as GPUs even though they can be quite different in design.\n\nFrom an article about a 4090\n> AI-acceleration: The RTX 4090 is equipped with powerful AI-acceleration capabilities, such as Tensor Cores and CUDA Cores, which can be used to speed up AI and ML tasks. These features can help to increase the speed of training models and improve their accuracy, leading to more efficient and effective research\n\n\"Tensor Cores\" are specially designed for these types of computations, while graphical computations are going to be different. True graphics cards are going to focus on shader and ray tracing cores.\n\nFrom the [H200 data sheet](https://nvdam.widen.net/s/nb5zzzsjdf/hpc-datasheet-sc23-h200-datasheet-3002446) (next gen NVIDIA AI GPU) there are a total of 11,000 TFLOPS of Tensor operation (spread out over 8bit - 64bit)\n\nFrom the [4090 \"data sheet\"] (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/) the 4090 as 1321 AI TOPS. It doesn't specify what bit level these are, so they could be 8-bit only. \n\n[Good breakdown of core types from Quora](https://www.quora.com/At-an-architectural-level-how-are-tensor-RT-and-CUDA-cores-different-What-makes-tensor-and-RT-core-so-much-better-at-DLSS-and-ray-tracing)\n\n>**RT cores**\n\n>RT Core is a hardware accelerator which performs ray-to-box checks or ray-to-triangle tests. These tests need something between 12–30 32-floating point operations each, so it probably contains multiple floating point units to perform these tests, so that it can maybe perform at least 12 floating point operations per cycle. It also contains a load unit to the main GPU memory so that it can load the geometry data, and it might also have looping and queuing system (with private queue memory) so that it can go through the whole tree independently. It might not need to have a store unit to the main memory if it passes the result (the id of the triangle where the ray hits first) directly to a CUDA core via some direct communication channel.\n\n>But the RT cores cannot be used for anything else than these intersection calculations.\n\n>**Tensor cores**\n\n>Tensor core is an accelerator for convolutional neural networks. It is optimized for performing huge amount of convolutions on low-precision data types. Convolution is practically the same thing as dot product, each convolution needs to perform N multiply-and-add operations where N is the length of the convolution filter. But the same convolution filter is typically used for huge array of data, which in image processing workloads is 2-dimensional. So the tensor core is logically organized in a 3d grid where there are two inputs of MxN-size grids and it produces MxM results, each result being calculated by N multiple-and-add operations, for total of 2 * M*M*N mathematical operations.\n\n\n>In case of the convolution filter is longer than the native supported by the hardware in single cycle, partial result is calculated in one clock cycle and the convolution for the same data is continued on later clock cycle with the remaining part of a filter. With narrower data types, N can be longer and still calculated in single cycle.\n\n>Typically, on 16-bit floats, the native size of N and M is 4, so one tensor core might be able to perform 64 16-bit floating point multiply-accumulate operations (128 flops) per clock cycle. With 8-bit integers maximum N for single-cycle throughput increases to 8, giving throughput of 128 multiply-accumulate operations, 256 ops per cycle, and with 4-bit value types, maximum N for single-cycle operation is 16, giving throughput of 256 multiply-accumulate operations, 512 total ops/cycle.\n\n>But the tensor cores cannot be used for anything else than these calculations of these grids\n\nNote: TOPS aren't exactly equivalent to TFLOPS\n>No, TOPS are Tera operations per second, i.e. 1 trillion operations (integer, float, etc.) each second.\n\n>TFLOPS are Tera floating point operations per second, i.e. 1 trillion (usually single precision) floating point operations per second.\n\n>The numbers get really nonsense when you see that modern architecture support a bunch of different data types which are then processed in a vectoring approach, e.g. 2 floats instead of 1 double, or 4 float16 instead of 1 double. So TOPS or TFLOPS is just a rough idea for comparing NVIDIA to NVIDIA, but the competition may measure something else.
