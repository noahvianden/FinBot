Growth estimates started changing sometime in q3. Now currently expected \\~20% growth in revenue. Possible\n\n5. Other cars are expected to grow fast in self driving.\n\n6. Used cars saturating market.\n\n7. Macro risks - CC/student loans(payments just started) at all time highs. Unemployment ticking up. Market at all time highs carried by chips. Fed rate hike lag effect.\n\n8. Elon wants more shares\n\n9. Sales causing more margins to reduce.\n\n10) Losing market shares overseas rapidly to china. BYD is oging to be a killer once it gets Auto driving.\n\n11) Alot of tesla models were disqualified for the tax credit according to Elon in 2024.

I had so many arguments on here about PFE last year and it's perplexing to me the level of enthusiasm and energy that this sub had about a company whose shareholder returns over the last couple of decades have been crap. \n\nPYPL is not a bad company, it's not a great company though and the decline over the last couple of years or so should be telling people that there are issues with legacy fintech - in 2020/21, you had every other fintech going, \"now with crypto!\", \"now trade stocks!\" Fighting over checkout real estate to get their \"buy now\" button.

A year from now if I'm right I don't care about some sort of bragging rights or something. I hope you do well, but Reddit used to be great for back-and-forth, balanced discussions all the time, not \"in a year we'll see who is right\" kind of things.\n\nFor me, I  can't own everything I like, I'm not going to own something where I don't like the business because - inevitably - it will quickly be replaced in the portfolio by a business that I do like or will be re-allocated if an opportunity comes up in an existing position where I want to add more.\n\nAnd everyone likes different things and that's fine, but for me, there's too many great companies to potentially own to devote time to one where I don't think it's a great business. If someone can make the case that there's a substantial catalyst in the coming months - maybe, but rarely is that the case and even more rarely do you have a Meta-like bounce: most major declines don't have similarly major comebacks.  And that's not really PYPL's fault (although I did like Adyen more when I did like fintech) as much as the industry became oversaturated and you have to compete against Apple.\n\n It's more of a broader issue with this sub over the last year where a significant focus has been on problematic (PYPL, DIS, WBA/CVS, MMM, etc) or outright lousy (PFE, WBD) companies and then there were countless complaints and doubling and tripling down when the stocks continued lower.

There's a lot of questions on this sub looking for opinions on something and when you offer concerns/issues about the company it feels like those are largely ignored. Not directing that towards you, but it really does feel (and Reddit didn't used to be this way) on here a lot of the time that when people ask about a name, they might as well say \"...and only good things.\" \n\nPersonally, I want something that is doing reasonably well/well and has a strong chance of continuing to do well. There's a few people on this sub like u/creemeeseason who do bring up some great, high quality names that go into that categry. \"It's not doing well and it might do well again someday\" - there's WAY too many well-managed, high quality companies out there imo to pile into something with issues and no catalyst in the near-term.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for respective increases of 0.2% and 3%.\n\nOn a monthly basis, core inflation increased from 0.1% in November. However, the annual rate declined from 3.2%. The 12-month rate is the lowest since March 2021.\n\nIncluding volatile food and energy costs, headline inflation also rose 0.2% for the month and held steady at 2.6% annually.\n\nThe release adds to evidence that inflation, while still elevated, is continuing to make progress lower, possibly giving the Fed a green light to start cutting interest rates later this year. The central bank targets 2% as a healthy annual inflation rate.\n\nMarkets took little notice of the data, with stock futures indicating little change at the open and Treasury yields mostly lower.\n\nAs inflation drifted closer to the Fed’s target, consumer spending increased 0.7%, stronger than the 0.5% estimate. Personal income growth edged lower to 0.3%, in line with the forecast.\n\nThe data indicated that consumers are dipping into savings to pay for their expenditures. The personal savings rate fell to 3.7% for the month, down from 4.1% in November.\n\nWithin the inflation numbers, prices for goods declined by 0.2% while services prices rose by 0.3%, reversing a trend when inflation began to spike. As the pandemic forced people to stay home more, demand for goods spiked, adding to supply chain problems and exacerbating price increases.\n\nFood prices increased 0.1% on the month while energy goods and services rose 0.3%.

In reality its a mix of both. \n\nOver the decades interest rates have fallen as population growth slows and the baby boomers go into retirement. We saw the same in Japan. Those demographic trends are more much more similar in the US in the 2010s than 1980s. I'm not sure I buy the argument that the entirety of the 2010s rates were just the unwinding of the financial crisis, a period of twelve years when asset prices largely bottomed out in the first four. And rates in the 2010s weren't just low, they were effectively pushed into negative territory with how much QE was increasing the supply of money.\n\nHave we really gone from effectively negative rates to rates not seen in several decades? I personally doubt it. A number of commentators seem to suggest the long run neutral rate may have increased, say in the 2-3% range, but we don't (and can't) know either way, as JPow frequently mentions. Even then that's still significantly below 5.5%.\n\nWhat we do know is the GDP has increased significantly while the money supply has been decreasing. How long is that trend really sustainable for? There other trends too that seem completely unsustainable, one is high government spending holding up the economy, another is a frozen house market which has only not crashed due to the increased prevalence of cash buyers and a decrease in sales. Its also meant some industries such as furniture stores have taken a nose dive. As a whole things are fine right now, but all these trends can't continue forever, something has to give eventually.

Some new companies were created with that same goal.\n\nI wonder if it will be a repeat, a lot of companies giving up on their investments and the rest mostly changing their ultimate goals.\n\nOne day, there will be fully automated driving and really functional humanoid robots. Since both things have never been achieved (discounting geofenced, high fidelity 3D map  and a giant suite of sensors dependant vehicles combined with humans taking over remotely an unreported number of times) it's kinda impossible to say when it will happen.\n\nWhat are your best guesses and based on what?\n\nI've always followed tech, but I never worked in tech and don't have tech friends who are working on these things. From reading other articles, in fields I do know about, I know articles can be a dumbing down and exaggerated. So I don't know how people in the field think about these things. My best guess would be at least 2 years away before an FSD version that is actually usable 100% of the time (not flawless, but better or equal to a human 100% of the time). For bots I could see them doing easy single task jobs already, functionally replacing  humans (for select day jobs) also at least two years away.\n\nI think for both I think that is the most optimistic, 2 years, I would rather guess 3-4 as more likely and 5 or more for FSD not unlikely. But since given my lack of background I don't have much faith in my own predictions.\n\nI would guess that both technologies would develop around the same time, though FSD may be lagging behind because of the inherent dangers and bigger need of law adjustments/liability/insurance vs robots in factories or even doing household jobs.\n\nIf both are realised and the bots can be manufactured in high quantity, the world will change an insane amount in a short amount of time. We may experience a very sci-fi world in the near term, not flying cars, but automated transport and repetitive/mundane/low skill jobs disappearing over a short amount of time. The amount a human wage cost vs what is needed from a machine can be a big difference.\n\nI do hope Tesla only leases out their bots to other companies and not sell them, I also hope the same for the semi's, at least for the first 100K.

{"title": "Bullish on NVDA after Intel Guidance", "selftext": "As many of you know the Intel guidance dropped and it’s had an impact on NVDA and AMD respectively. The issue here is that intels drop in demand is for specifically for “chips used in the traditional server and personal computer markets”. https://www.reuters.com/technology/chipmaker-intel-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-below-estimates-2024-01-25/\n\nThat is to say nothing to do with the AI chips that NVDA and AMD are building on their inventory which the hype is blasting off of. \n\nIn a separate statement the CEO goes on to say that they expect “$2 billion worth of orders for its AI chips and expects better sales later in the year”.\n\nWho gives a damn if their laptop and server business is dying? The future is AI. The drop we’re seeing in aftermarket for both NVDA and AMD is unrelated to what they are producing compared to Intel.\n\nWith NVDA expecting 20 billion in revenue it’s absurd to correlate the dying performance of one company with the stellar sales of another.\n\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-nvda-what-to-expect-in-2024#\n\nNow I understand the market is irrational and there will most likely be a dip on open but it really don’t make any sense to me.
