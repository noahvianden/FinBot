{"title": "Why I’m Buying Rivian Stock", "selftext": "Individual stock picking is for smart people who wear expensive suits. I’m not very smart and I hate wearing suits. I’m a boring index-fund guy. After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And that’s what I do with most of my money.\r  \n\r  \nBut sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it.  \n\r  \nI recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post.\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. \r\n\n# Point #1 – Big Picture - EV’s Will Win… Guaranteed.\n\nOver the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out:\n\n1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis.\n2. Government’s will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact.\r\n3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. We’ve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we ain’t gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable.\r\n\nI know I’m painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go…\r  \n\r  \nNow, just because EV’s will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesn’t mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEM’s like Ford, GM & Stellantis are starting to produce and sell EV’s… right??? Won’t Ford and Toyota and others crush Rivian at the EV game? Nope… not a chance. Keep reading and I’ll show you why.\r\n\n# Point #2 – Pure EV Makers like Rivian & Telsa Will Crush Traditional Auto Manufacturers\n\nFord, GM, and Stellantis don’t stand a chance against Tesla & Rivian. Even if they start making compelling EV’s for customers, OEM’s will be at a long-term structural disadvantage to Rivian & Tesla. Here is why:\n\n1. Rivian does not have a dealership sales model. Dealerships are a useless 3rd party which customers hate. Removing the dealership permits Rivian to sell its vehicles for cheaper than it otherwise could, but also make more profit than it otherwise could. This will be a long-term structural competitive advantage over OEMs.\r\n2. Rivian does not have unions. Unions uniquely harm the automobile industry because the cost of strikes and the cost of artificial wage increases after the strike ends increase the cost of vehicles. The 2023 UAW strike is a good example. If Rivian treats its employees with dignity and respect, they should avoid unionization. This will be a long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.\r\n3. Rivian will make money from servicing and repairing vehicles. In the current OEM-dealership model, the dealership makes more money from the service department than it does selling vehicles. While it generally costs less to service and maintain an EV, collisions & accidents can be more expensive to repair than ICE vehicles. There is a lot of money to be made by repairing & servicing EVs and Rivian has it’s own service department. As such, it will capture that revenue as opposed to giving it to the dealership. This will be another long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.\r\n4. Rivian is vertically integrated (especially when it comes to software). Traditional auto companies are not. These companies suck at software. Meanwhile, customers want high quality software in their vehicles that works seamlessly with their phones, homes, and other devices. Rivian, at its core, is a software driven company. This allows them to update their vehicles over-the-air. This will give them an enormous advantage in the long run at improving, iterating, fixing and keeping their customers happy.\r\n\nOkay, okay, okay… I’ve convinced you that pure EV companies are going to have inherent advantages over traditional auto. That still doesn’t mean that Rivian is going to be a winner. After all… Tesla is crushing them right now. Rivian isn’t even profitable yet. If you’re going to bet on a pure EV, why not pick Tesla???\r  \n\r  \nTesla is great. I’ve got nothing bad to say about it. They make amazing cars, they have a genius founder, and it has amazing long-term potential. But this write-up isn’t about Tesla. I don’t think Rivian is better than Tesla. It’s not. \r  \n\r  \nThis write-up is more about the timing of things for Rivian. I think Rivian’s stock is uniquely undervalued right now relative to where it should be. I personally feel like this value disparity is easier for me to see for Rivian than it is for Tesla. \r  \n\r  \nAnyway, lets continue….\r\n\n# Point #3 – Rivian Makes Wonderful Vehicles that Customers Love\n\nRivian makes beautiful vehicles and customers love them. The outdoor-adventure brand is on point. Aesthetics and brand really matter to buyers, and Rivian vehicles rock. \r  \n\r  \nWhile most people hear the name “Rivian” they think of Rivian’s truck (R1T). But in reality their higher-priced SUV, (R1S) is far more popular. The CEO said on an earnings call that the demand is for 2 R1S’s for every 1 R1T. \r  \n\r  \nNow, I see a lot of R1T’s and R1S on the road here in CA. And I see more and more of them each week. Just about every single R1S driver I see here in California is good-looking mom driving her kids to soccer. That’s a good sign. I’m convinced that middle & upper-class women absolutely love the R1S. I think the R1S is going to be enormously popular. Remember how popular Range Rovers were about ten years ago? I think the R1S is going to be that kind of popular….\r  \n\r  \nBut the R1S doesn’t just appeal to soccer moms. I want one. And I’m a guy who likes to go off-roading, camping, and hiking. I’m a dude, and I love Rivian vehicles. I think the R1S is going to be a massive hit. \r  \n\r  \nWhether you believe me or not, no one can dispute that outdoor adventure brands really resonate with humans. Maybe that is why Rivian was ranked highest in customer satisfaction by JD Power in 2023. There is a lasting durability to selling adventure. I think Rivian’s brand is built to last.\r  \n\r  \nMoreover, I really like Rivian’s management team. The CEO, RJ Scaringe, and CFO, Claire McDonough, just seem to work hard with their heads down. I personally like that RJ is an engineer who went to MIT. While they have clearly made a few mistakes, I don’t think they have made any big ones. They are not flashy or full of crap (think Nikola…).\r  \n\r  \nBut EVEN if I’m right about everything so far, that still doesn’t mean Rivian is a good stock to buy. Keep reading to hear the good stuff….\r\n\n# Point #4 – Rivian Has Enormous Upside Right Now\n\nWhy would anyone want to invest in Rivian right now? At a surface level, Rivian looks like they have big problems:\n\n* Currently, Rivian is losing money on every R1 vehicle it sells. It allegedly makes money on its electric delivery vans but does not disclose how much.\r\n* Moreover, Rivian got crushed in 2022 in the supply chain shortage that delayed vehicle production. Theoretically, that could happen again.\r\n* Then interest rates started rising in 2023 making it more expensive for normal people to get a loan to buy these pricey vehicles. Most people who buy vehicles finance or lease them. Very few people buy them with cash.\r\n* Rivian has had growing-pains with their vehicles. They’ve had recalls (steering issue), mechanical issues (tonneau cover defect), accessory issues (wireless phone charger defect), and a bunch of other minor problems. These growing pains would really frustrate me if I spent $95k on a vehicle.\r\n* Rivian will be shutting down its production line for a few weeks in Q2 of 2024 to make improvements to the manufacturing line. This is definitely going to slow their numbers for that quarter.\r\n* Beyond that, even if Rivian miraculously scaled production to max capacity tomorrow at their Normal, Illinois, manufacturing plant, (150,000 vehicles) and sold every vehicle at their current prices, I don’t think the company would be profitable to a level that would excite me. \r\n\nWell all this sounds terrible! Why on earth would anyone buy their stock now??? Oh boy… let me tell you why….\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Mass-Market Vehicle Announcement** \\- If you’ve been following Rivian, you know that it does not have a chance of long-term success unless it introduces and starts selling a mass market vehicle much like Tesla did with the Model 3 in 2017. \r\n   * The Model S really launched Tesla into the public eye in 2014/15. But it didn’t start making real money until the Model 3. The R1 line at Rivian is meant to be Rivian’s “Model S.” It has successfully done that. People love the product. Now, the only way Rivian will become profitable is if it starts building it’s own Model 3. And that is about to happen.\r\n   * Rivian plans to introduce the R2 on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, CA. This is supposed to be an affordable midsize SUV costing anywhere between $40,000 and $50,000 per vehicle. If it is anything like the R1S, I suspect it will be beautiful and a high-quality competitor to the Model Y – the most popular selling EV in the world. \r\n   * Rivian is currently building a manufacturing plant in Georgia to produce the R2. It has broken ground and should be finished in early 2026. Once up and fully scaled, it should be able to make 400,000 vehicles per year.\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Steadily Marching to Profitability** \\- As it continues to scale up production, Rivian’s loss per vehicle is shrinking dramatically quarter after quarter. In Q3 2022, it lost $139,277 per vehicle. That egregious. But that number was expected at the time and now it is shrinking dramatically. In Q3 of 2023, it lost $30,600 per vehicle. That is still a lot, but the change from one year earlier is monumental. \r\n   * Management claims they will be gross margin profitable per vehicle at the end of Q4 2024. Management says the delta they are chasing is literally baked into contracts it has with its suppliers. As they increase and improve production throughout 2024, the margin on labor per vehicle and parts from suppliers gets better and better.\r\n   * On the 2023 Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “Overall, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high-teens adjusted EBITDA margin target, and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.”\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Interest Rates Will Go Down** \\- Despite a full year of rising interest rates, Rivian’s demand has been so high it has not needed to reduce prices in order to sell its very expensive vehicles. In fact, it raised prices in March 2023. Meanwhile, other EV manufacturers like Tesla have slashed prices. \r\n   * In December 2024, the federal reserve signaled it will no longer raise interest rates, and will probably start cutting them slowly over the next few years. This means demand for Rivian vehicles will only go up as their production scales up. That sounds like perfect timing. \r\n   * Moreover, when the fed starts cutting rates, trillions of dollars will start flowing back into the market, increasing valuations. Read Warren Buffet’s 1999 Fortune article called Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market. IMO, it is highly likely that “speculative” stocks like Rivian and Tesla will be enormous beneficiaries of all this buying. The fed may start cutting rates as early as the end of Q1 2024 (but more likely Q2 or Q3 2024).\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **EV’s Have Been Unfairly Beaten Up in the News Lately** – Starting in mid/late 2023, there has been a lot of speculation in the financial news that EV’s are overhyped and will not take over the market as previously thought. This fear, uncertainty, and doubt has suppressed the share prices of all the pure EV players. If this FUD has any validity at all, it is only a short-term speed bump.\n   * Remember, the inherent and structural advantages of pure EV manufacturers will win out in the long run because the costs to buy EV’s will be lower than ICE vehicles (See Point #1 & 2 above). Over time, this will prove decisive. Moreover, for some reason, the conservative side of the news media loves to bash EVs. This is just silly politics and will end with time. I mean, why on earth would conservatives honestly dislike American made vehicles with ridiculous amounts of horsepower! The bashing will end with time. I’m confident of that.\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Rivian could announce new EDV deal at any time…**\r Right now, Rivian has orders to sell about 85,000 more EDV’s to Amazon by 2030 under their 100,000 vehicle contract. This deal used to be “exclusive” with Amazon, but this contract was recently changed and now Rivian can sell EDV’s to other delivery companies. That is fantastic.\r\n   * What is even better is that on November 7, 2023, RJ Scaringe said in Q3 earnings call that “We’ll be announcing soon a range of different pilot programs that will perceive much larger orders, as these large fleets start to plan the electrification of their infrastructure.”\r\n   * A month later, in December, Rivian recently announced a pilot deal to sell an undisclosed number of EDV’s to AT&T. This shot Rivian’s share price up and made investors happy. This could lead to a much larger deal in the future.\r\n   * I strongly suspect that several more pilot programs with other delivery companies will be announced in the coming months. Over time these deals will mature and large orders will be placed.\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Attractive Price** \\- In 2021, Rivian made its IPO during the EV stimulus-uphoria at $78/share. I did not buy a single share back then. That sounded crazy overpriced for an unproven capital-intensive car company. The share price immediately jumped near to $130/share and it has done nothing but go down ever since. It’s down over 85% to $15.50. We are close to its all-time lows. I think this presents an amazing opportunity to buy at a discount.\r\n   * Rivian’s Value Compared to Competitors – Right now, Rivian’s market cap is $14.5 billion. This is small compared to Ford’s at $44 billion, GM’s at $47 billion, and Stellantis at $63 billion. While Rivian clearly sells less vehicles than these competitors, Rivian’s future is much brighter. I suspect a forward-looking stock market will quickly buy shares of Rivian over the next three years if it continues to make strong gains. While it will take a long time for the market to see Rivian as a premier competitor like Tesla or Toyota, I can easily see Rivian’s market cap soaring past Ford, GM, & Stellantis in the next three years if it’s R2 launch is successful. \r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Tesla Supercharger Access**\r\n   * Range anxiety is a real thing. Until America’s EV charging infrastructure is as dependable as gas stations, it’s going to be a big factor in the buying decision. Fortunately, Tesla has paved the way and built an amazing supercharging network across the country that is extremely dependable. While Rivian is building its own network (Rivian Adventure Network), it will never be as robust as Tesla’s. Until recently, Tesla chargers were for Tesla drivers only. But not anymore….\r\n   * Tesla recently announced it was going to permit competitors vehicles like Rivian to access and use its network. This is enormous news for future buyers as it will absolutely quell most of the range anxiety concerns.\r\n   * Rivian also announced it was adopting Tesla’s North American Charging Standard plug. This is the plug that Tesla uses on its vehicles. Starting in 2025, Rivian vehicles will come standard with this plug. I don’t know about you, but I think this will help hundreds of thousands of people make the decision to switch from an ICE car to an EV. \r\n\nIf you’ve been around the market for any length of time at all, you know that the stock market is forward looking. It is constantly trying to figure out what the future holds based on all available data and placing its bet accordingly. I think most of the seven points I just made are largely unappreciated or discounted by the smart people in suits. And that is why the share price is lower than it should be. That is where our opportunity lies.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, this investing thing is not for weaklings….\r\n\n# Point #5 – Not Gonna Lie… There Are Big Risks:\n\nI’m not some delusional nerd who doesn’t understand how hard it is to make accurate predictions like this. There are some big risks here. These are the biggest ones that I see:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What if the R2 Vehicle Announcement Falls Flat?**\r\n   * When the R2 is announced on March 7th, it’s possible that the reaction will be poor. The SUV could look terrible, the specs could be unappealing, or the price could be too high. \r\n   * I think this is unlikely. Considering the care, consideration, and thought that has gone into the R1S and R1T, I expect the R2 to be a big hit and a full extension of the outdoor-adventure brand.\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What if there is a Demand Problem?** \r\n   * It’s possible there is a demand problem for the R1 vehicles and the sales are not as good as I believe they are. It’s possible that inventory is rising. In early January 2024 Rivian announced it produced 17,541 and delivered 13,972 in Q4 2023. When these numbers were announced, the stock dropped 10%. \r\n   * Why the 3,569 difference? Well, between making a vehicle and selling it to a customer, it takes some time to sell, ship, and for the customer to take possession. For vehicles made in December, you can easily imagine some of those don’t actually get delivered until January. \r\n   * But why 3,569? That seems like a lot to account for that simple lag between production and delivery. According to the Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, “As a reminder, because Amazon limits the intake of new commercial vans during its peak holiday delivery period, we expect a more significant gap between production and deliveries in Q4 relative to prior periods.” I find this explanation pretty satisfying. \r\n   * But if this large gap remains at the end of Q1 2024, or grows, I’m gonna start to get worried.\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What if Building the Georgia Plant Runs into Problems?**\r\n   * It’s possible that there are major roadblocks to building the brand new R2 plant in Georgia. My imagination can go wild thinking about delays, permits, politics, protests, bureaucracy, accidents, and the “production hell” issues that Elon Musk talks about. \r\n   * The good thing is that Rivian has gone through the production process on three different vehicles in Illinois and that experience should speed the process up. But who knows what kind of disasters could come up building a plant from scratch.\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What if the March to Profitability Stalls or Reverses?**\r\n   * It’s possible that Rivian’s current march to profitability will slow to a crawl, stop, or reverse entirely. This would be bad. In the next quarter earnings statement on February 21st, Rivian better post a smaller loss than $30,600 per vehicle (Q3 2023). It better be in the mid $20k or better… Absent a really good and logical explanation, I’m going to be seriously alarmed if it doesn’t get somewhere in that range.\r\n   * If this happens, that would be a strong signal that Rivian is just making too good of a car and they either need to increase the price, or make it cheaper.\r\n   * I honestly doubt this will happen. The way the CEO and CFO handle their earnings calls inspires confidence in their managerial ability. But that is my suuuuper subjective perspective. \r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What if they Issue More Debt and/or Dilution?** \r\n   * Rivian will probably have to raise more money to complete the plant in Georgia. But they are going to spend $5 billion to build the R2 plant in Georgia and they need to continue ramping production in Illinois. That’s a ton in capital outlay. \r\n   * Luckily, that fat IPO set Rivian up nice. Currently, Rivian has very little debt ($3bil) and a strong balance sheet (they have like $8-9 billion in cash/equivalents).\r\n   * But raising capital will either come in the form of more debt or share dilution. Either way, it won’t be great for the owners of the stock. But Wall Street already knows this, so nobody is going to freak out if it’s a small capital raise. But if its huge, yeah, I’m gonna freak out too.\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What if Interest Rates Rise?** \r\n   * Inflation could spike back up like it did in the 70’s. That would prompt the fed to raise interest rates again. I think this is unlikely, but it would be a bad for every auto company if it happened.\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What if Repair Cost Fears Grow?** \r\n   * The last big risk is something I don’t hear very many investment folk talk about. Repair costs.\r\n   * Repair costs seem to be very high for EV vehicles, and Rivian’s in particular. There are many stories of a medium size dent on a fender costing the customer $20-30k. This kind of stuff, if true, will drive up insurance costs. This is a red flag/danger area that will deter some cautious buyers. \r\n   * I’m not terribly worried about this. In theory, as more cars get made, repair costs will go down. But this will take time.\r\n\n# Point #6 - Rivian is Not the Next Tesla (But it Doesn’t Have to Be)\n\nI feel like everyone just wants to compare Rivian to Tesla. I think that is unwise when evaluating this investment.\n\nRivian only produced 57,000 vehicles in 2023. In the same timeframe, Tesla produced 1,850,000. These two companies are not even in the same universe. Tesla is at least 7-10 years ahead of Rivian. But that doesn’t matter at all for the question of whether or not you should own Rivian stock.\n\nThe great thing here is that if Tesla continues to win with the Model Y and Cybertruck, that will likely be a net benefit for Rivian. Tesla has smashed the entrenched auto-industry to bits, and Rivian is poised to take advantage of rebuilding it in the new vision of the future. The customer needs alternatives to Tesla. And Rivian is better positioned to capture market share from Subaru, Jeep, Land Rover, Toyota, Chevorlet and other brands that make adventure style trucks and SUV’s.\n\nTesla’s stock went from $15 a share in September of 2019 to $235 by the end of 2020. That meteoric rise was the result of a decade of work, becoming profitable, and the stimulus froth of the Covid recovery.

A hybrid car is a car that uses the charger/ avoids need / cost of gas, however, when the speed is above 35mph the car automatically, on its own, switches to Using Gas? OR do you, the driver, have to remember to manually change the mode from Electric to gas use? \n\n- are all hybrid vehicles designed the same way? Able to use charge as energy , until a certain MPH? \n\nThat said, why is it that you do not have to charge the Capstone? (hybrid)?

Or does the capstone-hybrid, make the change in energy source, seamless? \n\n3. Why couldn’t you drive the Rivian 300 mile distance? If you charged the Rivian to 100% capacity, would that still not be enough charge to drive 300 miles without having to stop and charge the EV/Rivian? If so, how many miles can the Rivian travel / cover with a 100% charge? Is the 100% charge  equal to a specific amount of time or a specific distance? \n\n4.

I am not one who has ever received inside tips in stock- that said, I don’t think it would be difficult for the engineers at Rivian, to either figure out how to make the ‘bigger battery’? Is it the size of the battery that makes the Tesla go a farther on a 100% charge compared to the distance a Rivian can travel on 100% charge? \n—— if the engineers at Rivian could not figure it out - how to make a larger battery, then couldn’t they find out from an engineer at Tesla?

You’ve stated that because Rivian can use the Tesla charging network people will not be concerned about range.  That is unlikely to be true.  People don’t like having to map out their fuel stops.  They want to get into their car and drive or if they have a schedule they will plan it around their own families rest/entertainment/food/refreshment needs.  They don’t want to be worried about getting stuck at the side of the road. \n\nb.  You did not address the concern of time required to recharge?   How long will it take?  What if all the charging stations are taken?   What if some are non functional?  Will that double the duration from 30 mins to an hour or more?  That’s not going to be acceptable in the USA.  This is the land of 1800 Mattress where even though you’ve had the same mattress for 10 years, when it’s time to replace, it simply must be delivered the very next day!\n\nc.  There is a valid cost of ownership concern.  You brushed it off but it will impact sales.  \n\nd.  Currently Americans prefer hybrids over EVs.  EVs are sitting on lots unsold.  Customers just aren’t buying.  That’s a situation that may not change in the near future.  It actually may never change.  \n\ne.  Hertz are selling 20,000 Tesla EVs as customers don’t want to rent them and they’re too expensive to repair.  That’s not a great sign for the future of EVs. Who knows more about buying and maintaining cars than Hertz?  Why don’t their customers want to rent them?  If you don’t know you should find out. \n\nf.  You stated the government will accelerate the transition to EVs in the next 2-3 years.  In history that has never happened.  The government cannot change consumer behavior with incentives and mandates.  Their behavior charges when consumers recognize the benefits are worth the cost.  The behavior charges when people see value.  That is not on the horizon any time soon.  \n\ng. Thinking that ice vehicles are just going to go away after being an American icon for 100 years is presumptive and wrong.  You underestimate Americans’ love for their vehicles. \n\nh. How is Rivian going to service every vehicle in the country?  They would need thousands of service centers which they don’t have. They have less than 50.  You either  expect people to drive several hundred miles for a service or maintenance or you expect Rivian to add thousands of locations.  How much will that cost?\n\nI’ll stop there.  You did your DD which is a lot more than most people do so congratulations on that.  But I think you’ve misjudged the American car buyer.  They are not all hot soccer moms in California.\n\nEdit:  adding one more point.  I just reviewed an EV magazine today. There are at least 20 other really nice EV SUVs on the market.

Any consumer-oriented business that depends on government subsidies to make their product attractive/keep the business afloat is not a sustainable business.\n\n2. Sure, oil is finite, but there's still a shitload of it in the US. Advances in fracking technology have unlocked previously inaccessible shale deposits; eastern Ohio/western Pennsylvania alone sits atop an absolutely massive shale deposit that's barely been touched. \n\n3. Even with access to Tesla charging stations, charging infrastructure is still absolute buttcheeks. Just about any review of a \"cross-country\" EV trip has resulted in \"this was a fucking miserable experience to the point that long-distance EV travel isn't really feasible in its current incarnation.\" This is all well and good if you're a coastal city slicker who travels a total of 40 miles a day, but once you get away from the coasts and big cities, this becomes a huge problem, and guess who buys the most trucks/SUVs? Hint: it's not the city folk. \n\n4. Auto sales in many states *must* go through an independent dealer; it is actually *illegal* in these states for the manufacturer to sell directly to the customer. The reasoning for this is complete backwards bullshit and is stupid, but dealer network owners carry a lot of weight in state and local governments, so this isn't getting overturned anytime soon. Tesla already had to deal with this; they were able to open a few stores before they got challenged on these grounds and future storefronts were blocked, while the existing ones were \"grandfathered\" in.\n\n5. The type of vehicle Rivian makes doesn't really sell outside of the US. That, along with the range problems, severely limits its market. \n\n6. Companies like this are always compared to Tesla, but few people seem to remember how close Tesla came to absolute ruin on a few different occasions. Their cash burn was insane, they had manufacturing difficulties, they were missing production numbers, and they nearly defaulted on their debt. They were, quite literally, staring down the barrel of a gun loaded with a whole lotta bankruptcy. What saved them was a couple rounds of debt restructuring and a few equity raises, both things that were made viable largely because of ZIRP. Now, we no longer have ZIRP, so if a company like Tesla were to run into those sorts of problems, it would most likely fail. Tesla barely made it through during a period of 0% interest rates and easy access to debt; how do you think a similar company will perform without either of those things? \n\nThis one's a \"no\" for me, dawg.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate your feedback and read every single one of your counterpoints. Thank you for taking the time to make them. I have a few counterpoints I think are worth mentioning.\n\n  \n1. Dependence on subsidies doesn't sway me. The oil industry is dependent on U.S. subsidies. That is especially true if you think of part of our defense budget as an oil subsidy. Because in an indirect way... it is. Moreover, I don't think Rivian will be dependent on Govt subsidies. The gov't is there to spur a dirty industry towards a greener version. Its not perfect, but gov't incentives work.\n\n2. Yes, there is a shit load of oil still. I'm not disputing that. But EV's are not going to completely eradicate the need for fossil fuels. Frankly, I'm not sure EV's are going to ever be good enough to replace diesel in some areas of industry (tractors, semi-trucks, etc). I think those remaining oil reserves should be used to fuel those uses, not our daily commuter.\n\n3. Charging infrastructure is not buttcheeks, dude. Yes, it needs some work. But if you talk to 100 Tesla owners, 98 say it's no problem. The 2 who do are usually hyper-conservative folks who drink right-wing propaganda all day.\n\n4. Dealerships will die. I think this is inevitable. I bought a Toyota from a dealership three months ago. I felt like a cheap hoe who got dirty when I walked out. The kind of artificial prop-up of a dying industry will not last forever. Politics change when customer preferences change.  \n\n5. I agree with this. The R1S & R1T are probably only ever doing to do well in America. But the R2.... That might be a different story. BUT even if I'm wrong about that... I think the stock could still crush it for a few years before the limitations of the market are realized.\n\n6. I know... fuck. I know.

On a six- month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent, though when you look at supercore and shelter, they are, of course, stickier.

I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates is that policy would be, it would be too late. I mean, **you’d want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2 percent** because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot, if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity.

With individual bonds this often doesn't matter if you planned on holding to maturity since you still get the same fixed payment each period.\n\nSo if this doesn't happen with a bond fund because they buy and sell bonds does that mean losses are locked in, or does that just mean that it takes a longer period of time to average out.\n\nIn other words as the funds slowly add higher coupon rate bonds and phase out the older ones, does that mean it will swing back the other way if rates are cut in the future?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Great question!\n\nIt's because bond funds reflect the market value of the underlying bonds. When interest rates go up, bond values go down and vice versa. The longer the duration, the larger the effect. If you hold an individual bond, the market value still changes as you hold it, you just don't see the price actively changing unless you sell it before maturity. \n\nBond funds don't remove bonds unless they're actively managed. Passive bond funds allow the underlying bonds to reach maturity and then purchase newly issued bonds with the proceeds. The reason the fund's price fluctuates is because investors are trading shares of the fund, effectively buying and selling the underlying bonds before they reach maturity. So if you buy a bond fund with a 5-year duration and hold it for 10 years, it's exactly equivalent to holding the underlying bonds to maturity twice and then fully reinvesting into new bonds each time. \n\nJust like with any investment, losses are only locked in when you sell. Bond funds pay out coupon payments as dividends over time and they also appreciate in price when interest rates decrease. \n\nThe problem we had recently was that bonds had been in a bull market for 40 years. From 1982, bond rates went from 16% down to 2% in 2021. So bonds were appreciating in price for 39 of the 40 years, iirc. Then they went from 2% to 5% in a year, the most drastic increase that I know of. It's basically the most extreme form of bond market whiplash because bond rates aren't linear. Rates going from 2% to 3% causes significantly more of a loss than rates going from 15% to 16%. Add in a long duration to the equation and you saw 30-year bond funds losing 50% of their value in a year. That sort of volatility is characteristic of equities, not bonds. Many banks were holding those types of investments for regulatory reasons. \n\nAll that to say, when buying bonds (a fund or otherwise): longer duration means more risk and lower interest rates also means more risk. Bonds are different from equities in that their risk and return can actually be quantified to a greater extent.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Makes sense thank you!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": -34, "replies": [{"body": "Or maybe the people at the fed are not as dumb as you thought and vice versa.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Literally, people in this subreddit think they know more than people who have degrees in these topics and have decades of work experience.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "They fucked up by saying \"inflation was transitory\", which evidently invalidates all of their experience and expertise in favor of random internet commentators.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Pretty amazing no recession.

Chriss has called 2024 a \"transition year\" for PayPal, and has promised to grow revenues beyond transaction-related volume.  \n\"The data that we have and our ability to actually see what people have bought and know what merchants are trying to target, that's where I think AI is the huge opportunity for us,\" Chriss told Reuters in an interview.  \nPayPal will this year roll out a platform that uses AI to enable merchants to reach new customers based on their prior shopping history, using data from the roughly half a trillion dollars' worth of merchant transactions it has processed globally.  \nMerchants will also be able to use a separate AI-based tool called \"smart receipts\" to recommend personalized items to shoppers in their email receipts, along with a cashback reward.  \nPayPal is introducing a \"one-click\" checkout feature called Fastlane, which in early testing has accelerated checkout speeds nearly 40%, along with new features for Venmo business profiles, the company said.  \nThe S&P 500 index climbed to its fourth straight record high close on Wednesday, fueled in part by a rally in technology stocks on AI optimism.

{"title": "Some thoughts. Perspective.", "selftext": "Alright. The short-term results are not great and it's been feeling like that for a while now. I think we need to take a bit of perspective as I'm seeing so much bias and misinformation my mind was almost starting to go off course.\n\nSome context here: French guy. English teacher, been to the US/CA many times. Lived in NA for a few years. Always been interested in predicting the future. I remember in the late 90s/ early 2000s asking my dad why people were still buying Kodak cameras and why cars were not electric (which of course, he answered in perfectly rational and practical arguments). Started following tesla  kind of late in 2017, went all in in 2019, at the lowest point, after patiently waiting for years. Been ridiculed so many times in 2019 for investing in \"a company that's going to go bankrupt\".\n\nAs I said the short-term results are not great. But whoever invested in Tesla for the sole car business is insane.\n\nLet's talk about the car business though. No legacy automaker can make a good electric car profitably, including the market leader, which is actually the worst-positioned. The only guys who can do that aside from Tesla are the Chinese, and although they are good at it they lack brand image.\n\nLet me tell you something as a teacher: most students are crazy about Teslas. Not just because they are new, but because they get it, unlike many boomers. Also, and I'm not kidding, 95% of my students have iPhones. Which wasn't the case a few years ago. See, brand image takes time to fully develop itself.\n\nAnd it's going to be the exact same for Tesla. Currently a vast majority of people who are looking for a new car are just clueless. The media has done an amazing job at spreading misinformation about EVs and more particularly Tesla, and it's fucking insane. But even if they hadn't, adoption takes time. And I'm not worried about iPhone sales, the same way I'm not worried about Tesla sales in the long run.\n\nStory time: after I bought my model 3 in early 2021, 5 people around me bought one including 4 in 2023. Including my in-laws, who are 65. When people see things for themselves they understand, but often they do need to see it from someone they know.\n\nAnother story: my dad told me yesterday \"hey did you see how Teslas don't work in the cold?\" - he literally sees me going to work every day with below freezing temperatures but still believes the media. Keep in mind we are in France so he saw it from the French media. Even though it happened in Chicago.\n\nTo sum things up: legacy auto sells to boomers, the news loves to trash Tesla, zoomers will buy Teslas like they buy iPhones.\n\nNow that we're done with the car business, let's talk about FSD.\n\nYes, Elon has overpromised and underdelivered. Progress seems slow. But his fundamental thesis is still intact: photons in, controls out. Just like a human. I truly believe that this is the only approach that will work on a large scale. Waymo is great but geofenced, and costs 200+k per vehicle! Looking at FSD12, and even prior builds, it absolutely is an AI, not a hardware problem. How is LIDAR going to help you in an edge case scenario? I think we can all agree that current interventions in FSD are inference and understanding problems, not hardware problems. It is going to take a lot of time to be perfected enough (I do think we need AGI) and once we get it it will need regulatory approval which will take a long time, but it is the only scalable approach.\n\nNot even taking other products into account.\n\nTL;DR: Car is fantastic AND profitably made, with Apple-like brand image.

Additionally, he sounded sober, a big contrast to some previous calls where I got the impression he had been under the influence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the financial results,\n\n* Operating Margin improved.  It was 7.6% in Q3 '23 and 8.2% in Q4 '23.  I'm hesitant to say that it bottomed out, but I note that OpEx decreased slightly from Q3 to Q4, despite Q4 being generally the busiest time of year.\n* Cash Flow is very healthy.  Net cash from operations was **+4.37 Billion.**  The reason I focus on cash flow is that some of the profit/loss accounting is a bit of a fiction.  For example, equipment is generally depreciated on a set schedule for tax purposes, but that depreciation often does not accurately represent the actual consumption of that asset.   Tesla's cash flow was 2 Billion *more* than its Capital Expenditures.  The company is comfortably able to self-fund expansion efforts.  This bodes well for funding AI R&D, expanding factories for NGV-platform vehicles, and building new campuses. \n* Tesla's cash on hand now tops 29 Billion.  The balance sheet is very strong.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn future progress,\n\n*  Although growth will slow in 2024, things may pick up in 2025 as Cybertruck ramps.  2026-2027 may be massive years for growth due to NGV production.\n* Drew Baglino mentioned that Megapack capacity should double from 20 to 40 GWh as Lathrop becomes fully operational.  \n* FSD remains a wildcard.  Beta 12's progress is something to closely monitor. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI acknowledge that many of us, including myself, have been frustrated at the lack of any durable gains since the end of the S&P500 squeeze.  While I believe that Mr. Musk's behavior related to Twitter has unnecessarily damaged Tesla's valuation, the business continues to self-sustain its expansion.  Absent the Twitter controversies, I'm fairly certain we'd be wealthier, but I also think that we could still get much more wealthy in a few years.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor folks who are still accumulating, the next few months for TSLA might be like 2022 was for PLTR.

I'm not looking for additional economics; I just want to be an effective steward of very powerful technology.

You only take that difference if it’s positive. If the difference is negative you take 0. The option itself costs money, which will change depending on how likely it is for the difference to break into the positive numbers. The option also has an expiry date. If the difference is negative at expiry the option expires worthless. Note the actual mechanism for achieving a profit would be to use the option to buy or sell a share at the agreed price (strike price again), which lets you buy/sell at the more favourable market price. This is called exercising the option, and often requires you to have enough left over money to buy either the shares to sell or to buy the shares off the other option writer. To avoid this you can always sell the option on the market instead of going through the exercise process, instead letting someone else exercise the option instead. The less likely an option is to break into profit, the cheaper it is. This is where your large gains come from. On average, approximately 80% of options expire worthless, because they start out of the money, requiring significant market movements in the right direction to become profitable. For example, company ABC May be trading at 40 dollars today, and a 6 month 60 dollar call is trading at 2 dollars. You make money if the price breaks above 62 dollars and you exercise or sell the option. You lose your 2 dollars if the price never gets there and you hold it for the 6 months. If the price were to reach 70 dollars, you make 8 dollars (70-60) - 2, leading to 400% profit, for example.
