{"title": "$2K to $50K in 90 Days - Options Trading Challenge (Day 1 +$250 Unrealized)", "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nAs the market has been rallying recently, I have been noticing an increase in the number of questions regarding getting started trading. People are asking where to begin, how much capital is required, what to trade, etc. So I've decided now is a good time to do one of these small account challenges publicly. Hopefully, this will provide some guidance for new traders looking to get started without much capital. I'd also like to prove the traders claiming trading short-term options is impossible and technical analysis doesn't work wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Background**\n\nI have been in the market for 5-6 years and started trading options heavily in 2020. I got lucky with my first few months of trading which enabled me to get a lot of experience without losing any of my initial capital investment. I had some big gains and even bigger losers. It's been quite a grind and a rollercoaster of emotions. I finally started to get better in late 2021 and into 2022. I've been able to quit my job and have been profitable for a while now. I have traded several small accounts up over 1,000% and blew up my fair share as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Rules**\n\nI started today with a $2,000 cash account at Schwab and will be using Street Smart Edge to trade and mostly TradingView for charting, will sometimes use thinkorswim as well. I'm giving myself 90 days to hit my account target of $50k. I will allow myself one blowup, but will only refund the account with an additional $1k. I think this is a good idea because it can be hard to build a cushion early on and everyone who wants to attempt this should have more capital they are willing to risk outside of this account. So $3k is my max loss, if I hit that I will consider it a fail and end the challenge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Trading** **Plan**\n\nI mostly prefer to trade SPY or SPX options, anywhere from 0DTE to 2-4 weeks out. I also trade QQQs and some individual stocks. Some positions will be day trades, others I may hold for 2-4 weeks. This is a very aggressive approach, which is usually how I trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Day 1 Trades**\n\nAMD and NVDA have probably been on everyone's radar lately, showing insane strength. A large percentage of my profit so far this year has been on AMD calls, so I've been actively looking for dips to buy. AMD opened at a new ATH this morning but sold off over 5% after an analyst downgrade. If you look at the AMD daily chart, you'll see that it bounced almost right at the previous ATH at $164.46.\n\nAround the same time, ES and NQ were trading slightly below their session lows, but UVXY was also near its session lows. UVXY also didn't react as it should have after a 20 point sell off from the highs on ES this morning. This told me that the break of the session low on ES and NQ was most likely going to cause a bounce. That gave me the confidence to long AMD at that level so I added 5 1/26 $170 calls. My analysis turned out to be correct. AMD started rallying with the rest of the market, ES and NQ did end up dropping almost back to session lows before the end of the day, but still no life in the VIX.\n\nAMD dropped a little before close as well, but as of the close, I was up about $250 or 21% on the position. I need to see AMD continue to hold above $164.46 and NQ to rally along with it. I'm not going to mess around with this position if that doesn't happen, it is very risky to long a stock that has rallied this much recently.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1i4mm8yrl3ec1.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=626c5cc41e600be70c2d17c4aa85d1271ef7224c\n\n**Order Details**\n\nThat's it for now, adding the order details below for full transparency. If there is interest I will continue making these posts. Possibly daily or maybe weekly if I go several days without placing a trade.

I used it to trade AMD today for the challenge but also added longs in another account based off it. Generally if ES is going to sell off it will require a strong VIX. So when I see ES break below session lows but the VIX is weak, I expect retail traders to chase shorts below the lows and get trapped after a quick bounce back above the previous low, which fuels the market higher.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If you're doing this you are", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "You can not reliably make 25x in 90 days.

Only once in a while do they train the backbone. The architecture has gotten much much more complex since then (remember Ashok saying the NN visualization software broke trying to render the full network), but the rationale should be the same.

Once a bolt is installed, it's torqued and striped.\n\nAlso, things are generally designed with tolerance stack-ups that allow parts to be installed slightly differently, but still correctly every time because not all components are made perfectly.

Netflix has an army of ML scientists and software engineers working on their algorithm as it is their bread and butter; pirates nor competing billion dollar streaming services can even compete. \n\nAnd what is the quality on Stremio in terms of bitrate? Netflix is 18 Mbps HEVC, Apple TV is 25-40 Mbps, Disney+ is ~22-27 Mbps for reference. It is not enough to match the resolution if you are providing half the data.\n\nThe fact is, the higher bit rate the higher the cost of business. It is not in the provider’s interest to provide high levels of quality as the server costs will skyrocket for them. Their clientele is not the type to care about the best possible visual quality because those looking for it on high-end TVs will pay for services. \n\nSo unless you provide evidence for Stremio consistently the same or higher bitrate for 4K HDR content, I don’t believe it.\n\nEdit: I just looked it up and see that Stremio isn’t a streaming service but rather a “pirate movies and store them for easy accessibility” service, kind of like Plex.

Netflix catalogue is smaller than the entire movie and serie industry available, which is also available on Trakt and Stremio.

People want accurate recommendations. A good algorithm does this very well. People have unique tastes, and it’s never as simple as “here’s other Action movies!” or “here are some other Leonardo DiCaprio movies!” Netflix has recommended me shit I never would have clicked on before but they knew me well, whereas your standard run-of-the-mill recommender system will provide exactly what I expect to be recommended and already knew about. \n\nContent discovery on Netflix is second-to-none, and it shows in the social media hubbub that crops up every now and then for random Netflix shows with unknown actors.\n\nHere is a thread of Stremio users wishing for a Netflix-like algorithm no less: https://www.reddit.com/r/Stremio/comments/15clptd/netflixlike_recommendation_system_announcement/\n\nAlso, just did a little digging and found that Stremio does not show the bitrate for streams. You are only exposed to the file size, but this doesn’t correlate directly with quality in the way one might think. Because 25 Mbps H.265 is 30% more information than 25 Mbps H.264 for example, so a 60GB movie isn’t guaranteed to be better quality than 40GB movie of same length for example. And it also depends on the content in the particular file such as amount of audio tracks, color depth, etc. \n\nIn other words, you have no evidence that quality and bitrate are higher as you are not exposed to that information. You just have Resolution, Dynamic Range, File Size, etc. but no bitrate or the encoding algorithm used. According to Redditors that use it anyway (was going through some Reddit threads).\n\nI think you are giving a sub-par software too much credit, and are underestimating the amount of money ($15 lol) people will pay to get a premium experience of curated content, ease of access, gorgeous UI, availability on major devices, and not needing to worry about installing “AddOns”, comparing seeders and file sizes, etc. You say people just aren’t aware of Stremio, but people *are* aware of Plex and it’s done nothing to replace any service. It is niche and will stay that way for reasons stated above.\n\nPeople want content curation these days (see: TikTok “For You”, Spotify recommendations, etc. ). Very rarely is someone looking to search for what they want to watch, because chances are they are bored or wanna binge something new and the service needs to give them something that they will definitely like. \n\nSaying Stremio is better than Netflix is like saying pirating music is better than Spotify. People know they can easily download all their favorite songs to their phone. Why do they subscribe to Spotify? Because of features like playlist “enhance” with recommendations, curated playlists like Discovery Mix, Time Capsule, Year in Review, etc. \n\nSoftware is king. Stremio is ancient software whose pride and joy is “our UI isn’t that much worse than mainstream streaming services!”, and you are misunderstanding what entails “good software.” This isn’t the Stone Age man! Content. Curation.\n\nThis is the “For You” era of software, and it’s dominating because it’s so much better than what we had before. The dominant services have the best “For You” algorithms, it’s why TikTok cropped up out of nowhere and ate YouTube and Instagram’s heart out. This shows it’s not about being the top dog in brand recognition, but rather the top dog in algorithm design. \n\nWhy would people go back to 2007 with something like Stremio?
