For example, by selling 100% of their cars DTC they can sell them at retail prices to consumer whereas legacy auto sells their cars to dealers at wholesale prices. During a recessionary period, this will serve to benefit Tesla. As customers defer purchases of cars, prices will typically fold (this has started to occur with the most recent series of inflation reports) When you have 22% gross margins and 12% FCF margins, you can drop prices far lower and be profitable than when your competitors are at \\~12% gross margins and \\~1% free cash flow margins.\n\n· It appears that this advantage is not done being flexed. Even with a lower overall volume of cars being sold combined with a significantly higher growth rate, Tesla’s revenue/employee continues to soar. Currently it is about the same as Ford and GM. I would expect in future years with additional growth, Tesla will surpass them.\n\n§ Intangibles\n\n· As a brand, Tesla is the undisputed leader in EVs. Having said that, Elon’s moves into twitter and more importantly politics of late have caused some people to put their nose up at Tesla. I personally feel this will be a passing thing, particularly as Elon has announced his intent to step down as CEO of twitter, although that does not mean he will stop tweeting. Despite this headwind, Elon and Tesla have been able to grow the brand through fanfare and organic attention rather than spending blocks of marketing dollars.\n\n· Vertical integration. Tesla owns production and the service center network. This has allowed them to offer far better services. Currently, when your Tesla is in the shop, they attempt to give all customers fully loaded up-to-date versions of their current car to get them to salivate for an upgrade. They also make house calls and are sometimes able to repair your car in your driveway. Additionally, by vertically integrating the design and production process, they own the IP for the core components of the EVs. This gives them another cost advantage. They put the core components of their cars in at cost, other players put them in at a markup from their suppliers.\n\n· First mover advantage. Tesla has outfitted with what they believe to be the necessary equipment for self-driving technology since October of 2016. This allowed them to have customers subsidize the cost by buying the car and gave them more data than any other company to develop this highly complicated technology. They also have a large charging network. Admittedly this benefit will likely lessen as the charging network infrastructure matures.\n\n· Legacy costs. As in Tesla has none of them, whereas legacy auto has all the transition issues. Imagine trying to be Ford or GM and you know the future is EVs. What do you do with your unionize gas engineers? Will a layoff cause a strike? You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost disadvantage, how do you cut them out of the deal? States have regulations that don’t allow dealers and manufactures to be owned by the same entity. How do you cut out dealers for sales but keep them for service? How do you solve the above issues while also maintaining profitability because you are heavily indebted in a fairly high interest rate environment? These aren’t so much strengths of Tesla, but are weaknesses of legacy auto.\n\n· It is really hard to put into words all the changes Tesla has made. For example, they sell cars on their website without a model year advertised. This small but subtle change should help deal with the seasonality affect of ordering. Additionally, they have been able to add differentiated features to the car that nobody else has done before causing viral free advertising just for being cool. Ludicrous mode with the Spaceballs animation, verbal commands like “open your butthole” to access the charging port.

We are seeing the EV market soften, which is really putting the squeeze on Tesla's margins as they cut prices to maintain growth and the stock price.  Those price cuts are destroying resale values of Tesla vehicles, which will cause long-term harm to the brand...no different than how the Big 3 destroyed resale values by flooding rental markets with fleet vehicles in the 80's and 90's to juice sales.

The whole middle management layer of mechanical engineers is a bit of a liability, because they don't understand the mindset you need to create good software.

It's a lot easier to have working software with less interaction between distributed systems.\n\nMost legacy cars have hundreds of simple CPUs interacting over the CAN bus.

Tesla sells direct to consumer and gets paid a retail price. To compete on cost this means legacy auto has to cut out dealers and then also rebuild a DTC platform or just accept lower margins\n\n3. Legacy employees are trained on ICE, would require retraining for EVs\n\n4. Legacy auto are basically assemblers and manufacture nothing.

An example is Mini that has just been through the procedure all over Europe and I imagine all over the world. \n\n3 - LOL! You do know people can learn and legacy carmakers have training centers that rival any university in terms of technology and technical data? Techs have started receiving training in Hybrid and EV cars since the 2010’s. That is a bullshit argument.\n\n4 - Do you think Tesla builds everything in house? You’re delusional and completely out of touch with the industry. Carmakers are logistic experts, imagine having all the parts on the plant at the same time and having to own the production of all kinds of components from car seats to electric harnesses to injected plastics to metal casting, airbags, seat belts, upholstery, etc etc etc. You have any idea how many components there are in a car and how many factories work directly with automakers?

Source: https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/research/blog-can-the-grid-handle-evs-yes/\n\ntldr: the US currently produces 4.2 trillion KWH electricity, and if every vehicle mile driven today was converted to electricity it would only consume another 950 billion KWH.\n\n> They are also trying to block nuclear, and trying to push low output electric generation like wind and solar and doing nothing to expand electric grid production. At the same time, they are banning, increasing regulation, and suing over copper mines which are critical to a massive expansion of electric production. Banning hydro, coal fired plants, etc as well.\n\nCoal plants are terrible for the environment and human health and should be banned. Most good sources of hydroelectric are already tapped. Natural gas plants are still being built in many areas, and existing coal plants are being converted to natural gas as it's a lot less destructive. New nuclear technologies are seeing a resurgence in interest, but it seems likely that solar and wind are going to be a large part of the long term solution at this point. \n\n> Despite the PR claims, it doesn't look like they have real intent to covert to electric vehicles, which is good, because the tech isn't suitable for most use cases. It's all smoke and mirrors.\n\nThere's an absolute shit ton of misinformation being peddled to try to discredit EV technology. If you think about it for even a moment, you will realize that the fossil fuel industry has a massive vested interest to slow or kill the transition away from ICE vehicles, not to mention a number of other large power blocks including the legacy auto manufacturers and car dealerships. EV technology is in it's infancy right now, with massive advances in battery technology and charging infrastructure coming every year. Even if 100% of new vehicle sales were EVs today (which they won't be for quite some time), the majority of the vehicles on the road would still be ICE for another 5+ years.

{"title": "(Bloomberg) Apple Vision Pro deliveries are delayed to March", "selftext": "\"*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.* \r  \n\r  \n*The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple’s website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited — or something in between.*\n\n*Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.* \r  \n\r  \n*With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.* \r  \n\r  \n*The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn’t comment on the sales performance of new products.*\r  \n*Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that’s “immaterial.”*\n\n*Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset — making it cheaper and more comfortable — and find compelling applications for the device.*\r  \n\r  \n*In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it’s under particular pressure in China. The company’s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters — its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*\n\n*Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*\r  \n\r  \n*It’s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren’t too tight.*\n\n*Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever — about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*\r  \n\r  \n*The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals — a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer’s field of view — in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.* \r  \n\r  \n*And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*\r  \n\r  \n*Another concern that’s cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google’s YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*\r  \n\r  \n*But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they’ll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls “spatial computing.”*\r  \n\r  \n*To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.*\r  \n\r  \n*A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn’t have a closed-in feel — a complaint with VR headsets.*\r  \n\r  \n*“From the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,” he said. “It really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.”*\r  \n\r  \n*That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer’s eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. “It was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,” Rockwell said.*\r  \n\r  \n*Apple also developed an interface that doesn’t require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*\r  \n\r  \n*One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they’re in the same place.*\r  \n\r  \n*“It’s the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,” Rockwell said. “It changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.”*\n\n.................................\n\n*https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/apple-to-get-first-taste-of-consumer-demand-for-3499-vision-pro/ar-BB1gVwvZ*\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "19c5iic", "created_utc": 1705850131.0, "score": 268, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 135, "comments": [{"body": "VR PornHub fridays delayed?

We recognize faces so well because our near-field vision kicks in the detailed and fast visual recognition that our brains adapt for. Our near-field vision is responsible for us instinctively backing away when someone invades our personal space, and on the positive side, is why we tend to get our largest doses of oxytocin when face to face with our friends and family, because it hits differently when someone is right there - our brains are tuned for it.\n\nWe see people up close in full scale, and we hear sound coming from people's lips in 3D space.\n\nVideocalls and phonecalls fail to represent all of this meaningfully, and they certainly don't facilitate shared 3D spaces to actually do things in together, which is why people use videogames to hang out online instead of videocalls. We yearn for that togetherness with people we are close to but aren't physically with. The world is a big place, and there are lots of distant friends/families, in addition to many places and live events that people want to but will never get to go to.\n\nYou could have all sorts of fun and useful experiences with others: \n\nConventions, festivals, concerts, fishing, golfing, work conferences, museums, talent shows, talk shows, stage plays, recording booths, dance clubs, movie theaters, music video creation, virtual photography, virtual schools, virtual offices, sports stadiums, new virtual sports, painting and sculpting, birthday parties, acting and roleplaying, paintball, tabletop and card games, regular video games, and so on.\n\nThese don't need to be literally as perfect as the real thing because you are facilitating connections that wouldn't happen in real life in the first place (or can spice them up and go beyond real world physics). My friend 3000 miles away is not suddenly going to be able to go to a movie theater with me tomorrow. I can't suddenly travel 5 hours on a whim to see my favorite band.

On streaming as well, it boasts a strong slate; they just announced that Percy Jackson (currently running) clocked 26mil views; that's House of the Dragon-level numbers. Disney should dominate 2023 Nielsen's top streamed films list released in the next two weeks.* \n\n*Plus the argument that bad content will translate to worse park attendance is a falsehood; Disney's content had a terrible decade in the 2000's but the parks flourished. It doesn't make sense that parents and kids stop going to their parks cause an original animated film that year flopped. That may have an effect in a decade, but not short-term.*\n\n*\\*****India Merger****: it's looking more and more certain. It will be a merger of equals with equal representation in the board. Regulatory concerns are allayed by the fact that it's a deal with Mukesh Ambani who's well connected and is a close friend of the prime minister, he's know to get things quickly.*\n\n*\\*****ESPN****: is back on a growth curve last quarter in all metrics. If the NFL deal goes through, it's a game changer; Peacock's streaming number for the latest play-off proves that and Disney is best poised for the deal with ESPN/Disney having massive footing in both linear and streamer.* \n\n  *\\*****Technicals****: chart looks to have struck a bottom and it recorded a golden cross.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Of course,* ***linear networks*** *declining is a major overhang; but it's a secular decline pressuring all media companies.

Gunn is also out of the MCU so having this movie be one of the best in years doesn't bode well for the MCU)\n\n3) Antman 3 - 476.1 box office (a flop that devalued Kang)\n\n4) Wakanda Forever- 859.2 Box office (again seems like a lot but underperformance per expectations. Also less people will care about BP now which hurts future movies)\n\n5) Thor 4 - 760.9 Box office (alot but again underperformance, also massive brand damage. This is where many gave up on the MCU sans event films)\n\n6) Doctor strange 2 - 955.8 box office (made a lot of money but the false advertising joining NWH and this soured people and hurt the brand)\n\n7) NWH - 1.916B (it's a W)\n\n8) Eternals - 402.1M (people didn't like this movie, even with covid it is deemed a flop) \n\n\nSo out of the last 8 movies you have two wins (NWH and DS2), 3 profitable but underperforming movies, (Thor 4, WF, GOTG3), 2 flops (AM3 and Eternals), and 1 bomb (The Marvels)\n\n>Plus, Marvels came out in a year where Marvel had several huge successes in films, streaming and even video games where Marvel released the fastest selling video game in PlayStation history.* \n\nThe films and shows weren't that big this year.

So, turning fast in a game while not turning fast IRL can make you sick. Obviously not every VR game is going to rely on full human motion, so in the games that have turning being an option on a joystick, one of the ways they've mostly eliminated motion sickness was by inserting black frames or a heavy black vignette on the screen while you turn via joystick.

Despite not launching innovative products for more than a decade I dare to say, and, yet worse, adding only marginal improvements year after year to its bread and butter iPhone, the company managed to keep its share price on all time highs. \n\nThe last wave of surge in the price stemmed from an obscure AI secondary rally following TSMC’s optimistic growth perspective based on the assumption that AI applications will drive the demand for semiconductors. This context would then push demand for more new iPhones as people switch their older phones (11, 12, 13), to newer more capable devices. \n\nAnother thing that potentially makes Apple a unbeatable Wall Street darling is that it keeps its structure lean. Differently from most of its FAANG (or MAANG) counterparts it did not enter the pandemic hiring craze. That helped keeping costs tight to compensate revenue lost from dwindling new iPhone sales. The difference is evident now when google and Amazon for example are promoting layoffs while Apple is not. Traditional market participants, such as pension funds, also like the fact the company is cash rich and pay decent dividends. \n\nThe other side of the coin though can drastically change this perspective. With fewer new hires, the company stagnates and is not able to achieve breakthrough innovation much needed in tech. Yet worse, the very likely bust of its main innovation bet, its overpriced and overhyped VR device (Vision Pro), may lead stocks to plunge like Meta’s in the aftermath of the metaverse flop. Do you know any early VR adopter who is willing to pay over 3 grand for something that even Netflix doesn’t want to invest, hence the withdrawal of a project to develop a specific app for the platform? And we are talking of one of the most likely uses one can give to such a device, which is watching movies. \n\nI know Apple’s fundamentals and solid base of long term investors favor its stock’s unparalleled resilience in comparison to Meta’s all in mindset.

{"title": "Disney to at least $120", "selftext": "Please do your own due diligence this is just based on my findings. Disney's Business model has to the best of any other entertainment company. They make money in the box office (hopefully) then they add it to streaming, where it attracts more and more people to pay for Disney+. This is relatively standard for most entertainment companies, but here is where things take a turn. The most successful movies they can add as rides to their theme park, crafting whole new worlds, and these childhood memories are something the children who go there will remember for the rest of their lives, turning some of them into lifetime Disney fans for life.  The only other company who does this is Comcast, owning Universal Studios, but I think Disney is much stronger due to the fact that CMCSA is heavily oriented around Harry Potter, and zero new content is coming out from that franchise. Their Nintendo  partnership stands to benefit them, hence the success of the Super Mario Movie. Universal is rapidly gaining ground, however Disney announced a 60 billion dollar in its parks over the next 10 years... I don't know if that will fully materialize., but if it does, it will be a huge blow to Comcast.\n\nThat was a very very basic image of their business model. I didn't even mention the rapidly growing segment that is cruises, licensing, merchandise, etc. There are other posts about Disney in AI link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/19bbjb3/dis_the_mega_ai_bull_case_for_disney/).   \n\nWhen we get into the multiples this company looks even more attractive. Price to book is 1.6, forward PE is 21, and although I never use PEG as a reliable metric it is only 0.49. In 2019 (fiscal) the profit margin for DIS was almost 16 percent. If we can reach the point where streaming gains offset losses from linear TVs decline, (expected to generate later this year!) margins could return to 10ish percent is my estimate, which when you apply revenue growth means that it could have a PE below 10 in coming years if the price remains stagnant. I think next year will be better for Disney's box office, I think they could break or near 1 billion on two films this year, Deadpool 3, and Inside Out 2, which might pull them out of their slump and take things back to normal with their box office woes. When you combine all these factors, my calculations gave it a fair value of 122.66, but do it yourself before investing!\n\nI'm surprised you read to the end of this, have a great Sunday!\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "19c4y08", "created_utc": 1705848498.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.41, "num_comments": 148, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|17|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n^^[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I couldn't be any happier than this...I log into Reddit and immediately see two bullish posts in WSB about Disney.
