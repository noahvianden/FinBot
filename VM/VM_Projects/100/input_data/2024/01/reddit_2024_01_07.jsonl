We don't want to just buy after every bad news for obvious reasons. In an exaggerated example, if the Fed announces unemployment catastrophically jumped to 35% in December, that is certainly not a good time to buy: That's the makings of Great Depression 2.0 right there.\n\nIt's certainly risky. We don't want to buy after every bad news for obvious reasons. In an exaggerated example, if the Fed announces unemployment catastrophically jumped to 35% in December, that is certainly not a good time to buy: That's the makings of Great Depression 2.0 right there.  we would now be at 928 dollars. In essence, after bad news is published, the sellers do not all immediately cash in and let the bulls have fun. They usually gain complete control of the stock for some time afterward, and the bulls slowly come back in.\n\nWith less exaggeration, there was the Apple watch ban. After it was banned, AAPL dropped some 2%, but it kept going. As we saw this past week, AAPL dropped 2%, then another 2%, once again some 1.5%, and on Friday it dropped .5%. If we bought $1000 of AAPL right after the initial 2% drop, we would now be at 928 dollars. In essence, after bad news is published, the sellers do not all immediately cash in and let the bulls have fun. They usually gain complete control of the stock for some time afterward, and the bulls slowly come back in.\n\nAnother problem is that often, bad news piles on top of each other. We can look at Boeing for an example. The Alaskan Boeing 737 Max 9 experienced technical problems and this news is bad enough, but then agencies started to get on Boeing's butt, forcing them to temporarily decommission a number of Boeing 737 Max 9's for inspection. This happened over a weekend, so we don't see how this would have played out, but I am pretty certain that we would have seen a sharp decline after the initial news, then it rises back up, and then another sharp decline after the news part 2.\n\nThis happens with lawsuits a lot. There seems to be a little bit of a dogpile culture with lawsuits. Some random publisher sued Microsoft (MSFT) for alleged copyright, and then the New York Times (NYT) jumped on with their own lawsuit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, it certainly is a plausible idea to find stocks that are currently being beaten up by the stock market, wait a bit to see how they move, and then decide how to move forward from there.\n\nOne last thing: If you handpick stocks, they should be ones outperforming the market as a whole.

It’s worth nothing that it is not “owned” by Meta. Its software license lies with MIT. It’s just one more example of how Meta isn’t innovating. It is piggybacking off of the brain power of people that don’t work there.\n\nJust like in my field, most of the technology and patents come from the university setting so that isn’t inherently a problem. R&D is expensive and most companies don’t want to put money into it. The problem is that it’s open source. It’s a data library. So everyone has access to it. Meta maintenance of React gives them nothing esoteric or proprietary to give them a competitive advantage to would be competitors. Meta tried to patent it and couldn’t. \n\nIn the five minutes of research, I identified at least ten alternatives to React. React runs on JavaScript to help developers quickly develop apps for HTML but a bunch of other libraries offer the same JS tools for the very same thing. \n\nIn the Intelligence Age to come, JavaScript will be pretty much like Facebook as well. Some programmers argue Python is a superior programming language, but at some point they will the progenitors for a more robust language that will be more plain. That’s my opinion, purely speculative there. \n\nThere are other alternatives to React, and you don’t need React to make an app in the most ubiquitous programming language. \n\nFor the aforementioned reasons, React is just one more example of how Facebook runs on technology created by others. It’s open source so the technology isn’t proprietary making it hard to see how investors should put capital behind it based on Meta’s affiliation with it. \n\nMoreover, what distinguishes a front end UI developer that uses ReactJS with any other JS developer? \n\nNothing, and that’s why I cannot see how it adds any value to Facebook’s ability to remain an industry leader in the Intelligence Age.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Lol how do you believe that with the fact that Facebook itself is still growing users YOY and currently has billions using it monthly", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "20 years from now, will it still be growing at that rate?
