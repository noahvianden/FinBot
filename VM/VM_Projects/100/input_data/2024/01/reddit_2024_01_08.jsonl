They cannot afford to not buy and miss out on a rally. They've got numbers to hit, profits to make.\n\nAnyone that is on the short side (e.g. commonly hedge funds) see these strong positive algo-driven moves, and they have to quickly cover their shorts to prevent losses. Covering their shorts causes even more buying pressure (because for shorts, you have to buy to close).\n\n That's what gets you the kind of 2 sigma move today that you noticed in SPY and others.\n\nYou might have noticed that with the market, price doesn't just move logically up and to the right.

It's all forward looking.\n\nObviously people have invented indicators (RSI, etc.) trying to determine if a market is overbought or oversold, but those are all backwards looking. They look at the historical price action and make an assumption based on some static statistical formula that gets run on all of the pricing data. And oftentimes, they are hysterically wrong, or only work in extremely short term time frames.\n\nInstitutions have extremely complex predictive machine learning models they've built to try and determine ideal forward price for a given asset. These models take into account a variety of information (price action, inflation, interest rates, fundamental data, options markets, treasury yields, etc.) and use that to inform their buying/selling activity. These models are managed by teams of highly compensated quants. Your average joe doesn't have access to this kind of thing.\n\nEven if you had an indicator that could accurately tell you when a market is overbought or oversold - you could still lose money using it.

United had begun some preliminary inspection work in the past few days.\n\nNo one was seriously injured in the accident aboard the Alaska Airlines flight, though the blown-out panel produced a force so violent that some headrests and seatbacks were ripped from the cabin and the cockpit door was flung open, according to initial details of a federal safety investigation. No passengers were seated in the two seats next to the panel.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board said the accident would have been worse at cruising altitude when passengers and crews are walking around the cabin.\n\nBut the accident places fresh scrutiny on Boeing, which has spent years trying to clean up a host of quality defects, while also ramping up aircraft production, including of the 737 Max. CEO Dave Calhoun has spent months trying to assure airlines, investors and financial analysts that the company is improving its supply chain and working to resolve its quality problems.\n\nCalhoun canceled a company leadership summit this week and plans to hold an all-employee call on Tuesday.\n\nAlaska Airlines, which is set to inspect its fleet of more than 60 737 Max 9s, didn't immediately comment on whether it, too, has found loose bolts.\n\nThe FAA declined to comment on United's findings. Boeing didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nThe 737 Max is Boeing's best-selling aircraft, with more than 4,000 orders to fill. However, the more common Max 8, which is not affected by the grounding, makes up the majority of those orders.\n\nAviation publication The Air Current first reported that United had discovered the loose bolts.", "id": "191zpze", "created_utc": 1704756926.0, "score": 1446, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 217, "comments": [{"body": "Wow they really are shit atm, this is like basics in aerospace manufacturing, but mutiple recurrences....\n\nIn aerospace manufacturing; it usually goes like this, the shopfloor worker has a WO that he has to auto certify, his team leader has to certify this guy's job, then a QA person does the same and when it goes to the next station / plant / hangar, an incoming QA check is done and these guys take great pleasure in telling the previous guy he screwed up, as it gives them an excuse to say potential production delay is the fault of the previous staton. The previous station has to send guys over to the next station to fix their shit.\n\nThen the airline comes for inspection as payements are made during different build phases of the airplane, for example at Airbus, Airlines inspect fuselage sections from the hamburg and st nazaire plants before delivery to the FAL's. Then there is a final check by the airline at the delivery center prior to the ToT for FOD and other stuff.\n\nIn this case, entire QA chain with all the checks and balances failed, this dosen't or should never happen.

When it originally aired in 2018, a lot of circumstances worked against it being anything remotely successful. The TV airing was, to put it as delicately as possible, an absolute disaster. SHAFT is a studio notorious for problems with their TV productions and this one had them all. It was even more famous for being largely made without a working complete script, because while Kinoko Nasu himself wrote the treatment for this show, the problem was that Nasu turned in something that was reported to be hundreds of pages long for an anime that was supposed to be 13 episodes. In order to cobble together a script, a great deal of material had to be cut, resulting in this shambolic mess of a story. \n\n\n\nAnd then there's the fact that because it was exclusively streamed on Netflix in those early days of Netflix having anime, it suffered from a 6 months delay from Japan TV airings to International release. The result was that really, really, really terrible fansubs were released for this show after the JP airings and the already impenetrable terminology characteristic of Fate was rendered utterly unintelligible by awful machine translations from Chinese translations of the dialogue. The story was confusing enough even with a good translation, but without one your chances of knowing what was going on were zero.\n\n\n\nThe original TV airings of the show stopped at 10 episodes, with the final 3 episodes released a few months later due to the previously mentioned production problems. People who thought that was the end of the show were probably more than a little pissed, because it obviously wasn't anything resembling an ending. The show was finished when the last 3 episodes were released, but by then most people had probably moved on with their lives after having written it off. The complete series is all 13 episodes, those last 3 episodes are not your typical fluff added for DVD/BD releases.\n\n\n\nIt's usually a bad thing when I need to write a novel about the production problems of a show before actually talking about the show itself. And I'm going to acknowledge from the very start that the story is almost incomprehensible unless you meet a fairly strict criteria which I'll lay out here. (1) You must have played through the 2010 video game Fate/Extra, and given that it was a PSP game released late in that system's life, this isn't something many people have done. (2) You must have prior knowledge of Fate/Stay Night, because characters who are but also aren't F/SN characters are in the Extra game and this show. (3) You would benefit a lot from having played FGO, because even though this show has nothing to do with FGO's corner of the Fate universe, terminology introduced in FGO which wasn't in Extra and the F/SN VN is used here just to make it even more confusing. All the Servants from Extra have long been in FGO, so you'll know them all from there too.\n\n\n\nAssuming you meet these steep qualifications, you are probably already a pretty dedicated fan of Fate. If so, what you'll find here is something akin to a beautiful disaster, like a flower blooming in the bottom of a flooded basement in a city destroyed by war. It is, quietly, one of the best flawed shows I've ever watched. It's quite literally my favorite mistake, because everything about this show's premise is fatally flawed from the start and yet ultimately it qualifies as one of the best things Nasu has ever written. It is the best bad show I've ever watched, or maybe it's the worst masterpiece I'll ever experience. It's simultaneously baffling in it's story progression and probably the best epilogue and coda for Fate/Extra anyone can imagine having written should you reach the finale. It really is the Last Encore because when Nasu was writing what would become this TV show and the game Fate/Extra CCC, FGO had not yet taken off and Nasu truly believed he was writing Fate material for the last time as it was by then a commercial failure.\n\n\n\nI never finished this show when it was originally airing, but the recent fan translation release of Fate/Extra CCC after a long 10 years wait sort of brought me back to this. I watched the BD release version of it, and characteristic of SHAFT, a lot of the animation was cleaned up and it looks better than I remembered from the TV airings 6 years ago. The typical SHAFT-isms are present, including neck-snapping head tilts and large sections of still-life like static images. The metaphorical nature of SHAFT style animation fits this show's themes well, and in fact SHAFT was brought back to animate this show because they animated the opening animations from CCC. The show looks unexpectedly beautiful in many places, like walking through a forest which was burned to charred stumps by a wildfire a year ago and finding the whole place green with new life as fresh plants have sprung up in the wake of total devastation.\n\n\n\nIf you've made it this far in my completely pointless review of this show, because realistically only about 1,000 people on Earth really should watch this show, then you'll probably wonder if you are insane. I assure you that while you are in fact insane, you should at least take solace in the fact that most people on Earth are insane and you really fit right in. So don't worry about it. All I can say is, for the truly dedicated who can meet the strict criteria outlined above, they will find something oddly rewarding and wonderfully charming. Just make sure you don't watch the Netflix stream or any of the original TV airings. It required a lot of dedicated work from good fansubbers later on to repair the translation script and those vastly improved scripts are typically included with BD release versions of this show, obtainable only by sailing the seven seas.\n\n\n\nFinal Rating: [CODE CAST]/{{System Error}}*{{Imaginary Number - Integer Overflow}} out of 10", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "A Bill Ackman post 🤣", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": ":: scratches his neck erratically :: \n\nya’ll got any of them…. cliff notes?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ketamine overhang, it happens, flu like symptoms", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Tesler flu game wen?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Wen tesla starts delivering profits instead of promises", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "this is all biden and immigrants fault", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Media: Elon, yes or no, do you use illegal drugs?\n\nElon: I have never tested positive, even for alcohol!", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "In the context of Lance Armstrong and his team managing to evade drug screening for years, Elon's denials do seem weak.

Now, all the super precision components used in these machines are manufactured by Western companies (zeiss makes the mirrors for example, so smooth/precise that noone else can make them).\n\nSure TSMC makes chips, but the secret high precision work is in the machines that are manufactured in Western countries.\n\nClearly, you have absolutely no clue what you are talking about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I wish you good luck with that attitude.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "😂 \n\nIntel is **not** mass producing 4nm for customers\n\nThey literally don’t have any customers , because again , they’re not a fab \n\nFor “intel 4”  if it’s so great and at such “mass scale” as you said , Where *are* the chips? December 14 came and went and there’s nothing. They don’t exist. \n\nAnd ask yourself : why did they used tsmc for the other 3 semis in the core ultra? They can’t even make their whole own core ultra in house.  \n\nReally some crazy mental gymnastics to think they’ll become the worlds fab by December. \n\nAnd lastly — 🤣 the secret sauce is clearly not just EUVs.

Have you been asleep for 12 months or something?\n\nThe reason they are using TSMC for the non-CPU tiles is to increase production capacity and to focus on getting to 18A faster. If you weren't so blinded by your bias it wouldn't be that hard to see... A quick google would've also told you that, im sure.Its not unusual for businesses to hire competing businesses while they focus on expansion etc...\n\nIts also, important that their packaging is able to combine different tiles so that gives them an advantage when they open up their fabs to external customers, so they can mix and match tiles.\n\nThe EUV machines are very much the secret sauce, thats why China can't make these chips.\n\nIn fact, Intel has the advantage they received the first High-NA EUV machine a few days ago before samsung or TSMC. Intel also has secured to get 6 out of the 10 that will be available in 2024.

Super grateful\n\nI did stick to the trade, genuinely saw it shifting and even told private group text chat about it like I did here\n\nNo discord or public chat room\n\nI am self taught and have traded for about 19 years now.\n\nFair warning I'm very direct\n\nOk idiots for 2024..\n\nSo you are all still rather bearish with your double top talk and the media has been more bullish lately. The big money stole your shares when SPY was 355-410ish. Theyre not selling those and you WANT a crash to rebuy them. So big money is already winning and gives zero fcks. They want to pump this beast and so does team Blue. Imagine going on campaign saying the market is at historic highs. Anyways all that is bullish.\n\nThen we have had 2 major wars begin, gold breaking out, rate hikes, job layoffs literally everywhere in MULTIPLE waves, and rampant inflation. Lets not forget the sell pressure from QT all year.. YET after all of this, THE INDEXES ARE AT OR NEAR ATH. Fcking wild yes indeed. So that means its all been digested and yet the market still doesnt give af.\n\nThe good data from a month or two ago had an amazing reaction where indexes ran 2-3% in a few days. So any good news seems to cause more gains whereas bad news may not cause more losses (as demonstrated through 2023 while we went up).\n\nALSO, even more bullish as rates are going to go down, and QT ends in mid 2024 to alleviate some sell pressure.

It's well up on the price that day now and it turns out /r/stocks sentiment was wrong (wow what a surprise!).\n\nThe statement i made about the IPO being funky still holds though. There's actually a very small percentage of ARM trading publicly since a single organization still holds 90% of the stock and 3 other organizations hold over 5% (leaving a very small amount that's publicly traded). Anyway the funkiness right now points to get in on this initial small batch release. Wait till it doubles and get out before the other 90% drops.\n\nIt reminds me of Telstra T1 vs T2. https://www.smh.com.au/money/investing/telstra-good-value-or-value-trap-20180409-p4z8ir.html 10% of Telstra was issued, the stock doubled and then the other 90% let loose.

Assuming that her owner liked bitcoin, what does her drinking schedule tell us about btc?!?! Let me tell you!!\n\nFirst, let's break this down the  crypto-catty way! First, we must acknowledge that cats, much like Bitcoin, are enigmatic and operate on their own unique schedule. Now, consider this: my cat drank water three times a day - morning, afternoon, and evening. This is clearly a tri-pattern schedule.\n\nHow does this coorelate to BTC? Well, Bitcoin also follows a pattern, albeit more complex. The most notable is the 'halving,' which occurs approximately every four years (or every 210,000 blocks mined). Just like my cat’s predictable yet enigmatic drinking schedule, Bitcoin's value has historically shown to surge post-halving.\n\nSo, if we use my cat's drinking schedule as a model, we could theorize that Bitcoin follows a 'tri-halving' pattern - a surge in value at three critical points post-halving. It's almost as if each time my cat took a sip of water, she was predicting a Bitcoin bull run!\n\nIn conclusion, my cat's hydration habits directly influenced the crypto market, her routine being that of a mirror to the mysterious and patterned nature of BTC's behaviour. Due to this breakthrough, we should keep an eye on cats for market predictions.

Mind you the idea of the 737 MAX is to allow current pilots who have flown 737 for _decades_ to fly a MAX with only a little extra training. Crucially, in the original 737s leaving the anti-icing feature on has no detrimental effects on flight safety, but on a 737 MAX it can instead _overheat and kill both engines in as little as five minutes_. Mid-flight.\n\nPilot associations are now to _pleading_ with the FAA to _force_ Boeing to fix this issue. It literally seems only a question of time before the next MAX disaster occurs that is caused by this or one of the other MAX design issues - some of which (like this one) are known faults where Boeing instead uses its influence with FAA to avoid having to fix it ASAP.\n\nOh and yes - all the MAX planes already in the sky have this same known fault. This news is only about people asking FAA to stop certifying more MAXes before this issue gets addressed.\n\nInstead of fixing critical safety issues like this one (and the previous MCAS fault that killed 300+ people), why does Boeing keep exerting pressure on FAA to give it free passes?
