{"title": "American Companies Plan on Becoming Employers’ Landlords by Building Company Towns", "selftext": "https://decodetoday.com/american-companies-building-company-towns/\n\nArticle body:\n\nThe housing crisis in the United States has prompted some major companies to consider building company towns. Instead of relying on traditional rental properties, companies such as Google, Tesla, and Meta are exploring the idea of becoming landlords themselves, building company towns, and purchasing large pieces of land to provide housing for their workers.\n\nIn the early 20th century, company towns were a common sight, designed to provide housing, schools, stores, and a sense of community for workers. Fast forward to the present day, and Silicon Valley giants are revisiting this concept, exploring the creation of self-contained communities for their workforce. While the concept of company towns is not new, this modern approach involves providing a range of amenities and services within the community, such as parks, restaurants, and shops, to create a sense of community and improve the work-life balance of employees.\n\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is planning to build an entire town near Austin, Texas, where three of his companies, Boring, Tesla, and SpaceX, have operations. The new company town is intended to offer below-market rents to his employees, providing an attractive solution to the housing challenges faced by many workers. Similarly, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is also considering the construction of a company town to provide housing for its employees. Google is already in the process of building a 153-acre neighborhood near its headquarters in Mountain View, California, which will include over 7,000 residential units and 26 acres of public parks and open space.\n\nWhile the idea of corporate-built company towns addresses the pressing issue of housing shortages, it has also sparked concerns about employee flexibility. With health insurance already tied to employment, intertwining housing with work could further limit an individual’s freedom to change jobs or locations. Critics argue that this deliberate entanglement is an attempt by companies to exert greater control over their workforce.\n\nIn response to these developments, legislation has been introduced to address the growing need for affordable housing. The proposed Workforce Housing Tax Credit Act seeks to provide states and developers with a new source of funding for the production of affordable rental housing. The Workforce Housing Tax Credit (WHTC) Act aims to incentivize the creation of housing for middle-income families. However, skeptics question the true intentions behind the legislation, speculating that it may serve as a tool for companies to claim tax credits while gaining additional influence over their employees.\n\nThe trend of companies building towns for their employees is not confined to the United States. Globally, mega-projects like NEOM are emerging as examples where entire towns are being constructed to accommodate workers. This global phenomenon highlights the evolving nature of the employer-employee relationship and the growing influence of corporations in shaping the living environments of their workforce.", "id": "1981mys", "created_utc": 1705407594.0, "score": 886, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 474, "comments": [{"body": "Lose your job lose your house.

Marketing Challenge: Apple has priced the Vision Pro, which has ”limited battery life, an unwieldy design and no killer app,” at* ***$3,499***, *Gurman said in the* *weekly Power On newsletter*.\n\n*The company is bracing for an initial sales surge, courtesy of the early adopters, followed by a tapering off of demand, he said, adding that retail stores may need twice as much inventory space “during the opening weekend than afterward.”*\n\n*With Apple’s previous devices such as the iPod, the iPad, the iPhone and even the Watch, shoppers didn’t require a lot of ”coaxing and coaching,” the columnist noted.*\n\n*”The Vision Pro will be a different beast. Few consumers are accustomed to wearing a mixed-reality headset, and Apple's model requires particular care,” Gurman said.* *“If the device isn't fitted to someone's head correctly — or is missing the right lenses — the entire experience could be ruined, potentially costing Apple a $3,499 sale forever.”*\n\n*Apple Does Groundwork: ”Apple has prepared its most sophisticated sales pitch ever, including a demo lasting up to 25 minutes — longer than it takes to watch your favorite sitcom,” Gurman said. The company has also trained several hundred employees at its offices in Cupertino, he added. “To make sure retail staffers get everything right,” Apple hosted several hundred employees at its offices this month in Cupertino to walk them through the process, the columnist said.*\n\n*Gurman noted that the customer* ***demos will begin at Apple’s U.S. retail stores on the launch date***, *with sign-ups beginning at 8 a.m. local time. More than a dozen demo units will be made available simultaneously at the largest stores, with dedicated sit-down areas where presentations will take place, he said*.\n\n***The Modus Operandi: Gurman outlined the demo process as follows:*** *retail store worker scans user’s face with an app, similar to setting up Face ID. Scan will help decide on the light seal, foam cushion and band size that suits the customer*. *If the user wears glasses, the store worker will use a device to scan lenses for prescription information. All these details gathered by the worker will be handed over to a staffer in the store’s backroom to assemble the demo Vision Pro with correct accessories. The store employee will then hand the demo device to the customer and explain how the interface works, including how to control the pointer using a user's eyes, how to gesture to make selections and how to hold the headset. Once the headset is on, the customer will need to calibrate the device with various tracking and tapping exercises so it can follow their eyes and hands. As the 20- to 25-minute demo begins, the user will be directed to the photo apps followed by examples of panorama shots. The customer will then see 3D images, following which the user will be shown how to use the device as a computer or iPad replacement. The customer will then be shown 3D and immersive movies, including clips of wild animals, the ocean and sports. Demo devices will be preloaded with various third-party apps that are launching with the device next month*.\n\n*”The goal of the demos is giving users an experience that's compelling but not exhausting — ideally leaving them itching for more,” Gurman said. The key issue, the columnist said, is making sure customers stay comfortable while wearing the Vision Pro. This, however, could be challenging, as several retail employees have already said that they felt their heads were tired and sweaty after only using the device for a half hour, he said. Apple also aims to ensure that product reviewers will get the best experience by having them participate in two in-person sessions with the company before being sent a device, Gurman said.*\n\n*Still, none of these measures will ensure success within the next year or two as the product is just too expensive and cumbersome to win over mainstream consumers, he said.*\n\n*“But looking out a few years — once the price and weight go down, and there are more compelling features — Apple may have laid the groundwork for something big,” the Apple specialist said.*\n\n*Apple ended Friday’s session up 0.18% at $185.92, according to Benzinga Pro.*\n\n***..........End of article........***\n\n***Source:*** [*https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-preps-most-sophisticated-sales-pitch-ever-for-vision-pro-debut-on-feb.-2-with-demo*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-preps-most-sophisticated-sales-pitch-ever-for-vision-pro-debut-on-feb.-2-with-demo)", "id": "19875yx", "created_utc": 1705423025.0, "score": 434, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "> Apple has prepared its most sophisticated sales pitch ever, including a demo lasting up to 25 minutes — longer than it takes to watch your favorite sitcom\n\nWhat a strange benchmark to use in 2024 to describe how long 25 minutes is.", "score": 234, "replies": [{"body": "It's a trend of bad writing and attempt to fill space.

{"title": "Time to sell", "selftext": "Look I understand the hype. Tesla has helped bring EVs into the mainstream and has genuinely pushed the industry forward. The supercharger network was a coup de grace and may be a profitable side business as EVs overall expand. The stock has had an insane run but this valuation cannot continue. I'll post my bear thesis knowing you guys are probably true believers and will downvote me but here I go!\n\n1) Autonomous driving\n\nMERCEDES has the first approved level 3 car in the US. Mercedes! Not the company that has been promising this for ten years. FSD is a joke, no other player in the autonomous industry thinks that ONLY CAMERAS will provide adequate safety. There is HUGE liability from pending NTSB investigations and the software is clearly advertised beyond its limits\n\n2) Technology moat\n\nTesla has unfortunately not created a moat around battery technology, range or charging. Many EVs have similar stated ranges, and Lucid currently holds the range crown. Experienced automakers are coming into the market and can likely compete on thin margins/loss for market share. BEVs are fundamentally simpler than ICE cars and Tesla clearly hasn't created an insurmountable barrier to entry.\n\n3) The \"cool\" billionaire\n\nPlenty has been said about this, but Elons purchase of twitter and clear endorsement of the alt-right is an absolutely terrible move from someone selling environmentally sensible cars. If anything he should be pandering to liberals, but being clearly republican isn't gonna help when they condemn EVs routinely.\n\n4) ItS NoT a cAr CoMpaNy!!\n\nLet's be real. Tesla has no significant foothold in robotics, residential solar or AI. This is a car company typically valued at 5-10 P/E currently at 70. It's not car tech, if Mercedes beat them handily. Tech companies spend more than 4% annual on R&D.\n\n5) Quality issues, recalls\n\nHertz drooped out of buying after about a year. The repair costs are astronomical. Suspension issues, poor plastic interiors, poor service and panel gaps will not survive the wave of better EVs. Polestar, Ioniq, Lucid and Rivian are already making better cars. It won't be long.\n\nFeel free to debate, shit on, but this is my bear thesis. I am short TSLA since $273 in ATM puts.

In saying that (and I know this can ruffle some feathers but), going through with the legal gymnastics to get L3 approval is likely to be a vanity win at best, and a waste of time/resources at worst.

Once again, I do not work in Tesla so this too is conjecture, but perhaps one of these possibilities might click for you: \n\n(1) Perhaps the regulatory **requirements** for L3 and L4 have less overlap than we think. By this, I am referring to the actual set of test documents that need to be provided by Tesla. I am NOT referring to the commonly cited blue-and-green SAE J3016 visual chart illustrating what L0-L5 entail, that, I agree shows reasonable overlap between L3 and L4.\n\n(2) Perhaps the regulatory framework of L0-L5 is imperfect. Consider this, when SAE International and all its engineers, researchers, legal folk did their digging to formulate the J3016 standard, no one individual nor company had claimed to have a fully-autonomous system ready to go. I have no doubt that the folks there are smart. However, they too did not have **full certainty** of what the pathway towards full autonomy should look like. As such, it is within the realm of possibility that the team at Tesla does not believe that the path to L4 is an extension of the path to L3 - it could instead be two diverging paths. \n\nWith regards to optics, I agree that getting L3 approval at or around the same time as Mercedes would have looked better. However as an engineer myself, I have believed for the longest time that at all levels of engineering, there is a somewhat-thin veil that separates what *looks* good and what *is* good. I do not speak for Tesla on this, but given what we do know about Tesla's engineering prowess, I can see there being a probable preference for focusing their engineering efforts on making FSD something that is good, rather than just looking good.\n\nDigging deeper into Mercedes' implementation - the choice of colored lighting is as you suggested, a choice. Design choices rarely meet the preferences of every single person in the market. Whether it be cost-driven, UX-driven or something else completely, we don't yet know. However, the neat thing about Tesla is that they truly do have the upper hand when it comes to swapping things in/out when they decide to - yes, Tesla can be seen as stubborn at times, but you can count on them to budge when it matters. \n\nLastly with regards to Tesla Energy - I know that it is almost cliche at this point to say \"oh, Tesla is more than just a car company\".

In fact, a lot of the greatest follys in military history were more a result of the individual unit leaders making bad decisions than the doctrine itself.  So it's like a double edged sword where leadership doesn't have to be great and unique in the presence of robust training and doctrine, but it can help in some very specific situations.  That being said, picking the wrong leaders, especially outside the presence of robust training and doctrine, can be disastrous.  Civil War has some great examples of this on both union and confederate side- specifically at Gettysburg where unit level leadership was often some rich politician who could afford to field a unit and was looking to advance in the political and social realm via battlefield glory rather than some hardened unit leader brought up over decades in the legions.  \n\nOverall, I'd say that Elon does seem to have a unique ability to impart an organizational philosophy, and he's not afraid to fire people, so that lends itself to good doctrine and discipline.

As with a at home setup you can buy a NAS server without drives and buy those separate on sale for a reasonable price if you are willing to invest more up front to save more long run (such as I have a 24TB NAS server that I got setup for around $500 while 12TB cost $60/month for iCloud). Doing this you have more control over type of disk, speed, and size of disk so you can control where you are willing to have your limit. You can also then take your server (if you know some networking and how to secure your network and server) and have the backup server be able to be connected to from anywhere and even have it as a file server that your friends and family can back up their devices to without worrying about reaching a max device limit (I have my mom and sisters phones hooked up to auto backup all photos and pictures for them the second they are taken). I am not trying to say iCloud is bad just keep in mind one of the major sells of cloud computing/storage is getting to be hands free so you don't have to swap out disks or make changes.
