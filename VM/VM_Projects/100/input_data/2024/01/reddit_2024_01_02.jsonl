{"title": "I went through the biggest 1,500 stocks by size one by one and picked out the 248 best. Here's the list:", "selftext": "# LINKS AT BOTTOM\n\nThis is not a holy grail list, nor investment advice. It is merely a starting point for those that want a small enough list to go through, filtering out to only consistently growing companies, no stunted/stagnant growth. There is also a list for a further refine into 72 \"most consistent\", and 35 & 38 value stocks currently at a discount from the \"most consistent\" list, but read the disclaimer about this, an expensive stock could stay expensive and vice versa for \"cheap\".\n\n# ***METHODOLOGY:\n\n1. I have analyzed each company blind, meaning I cannot see any information about the underlying stock including but not limited to; ticker, sector, industry, price, etc. This is to help eliminate bias.\n2. I am sparingly looking at price movement to discern good companies, I will speak more about this later.\n3. I am using 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, 4Y, 5Y, 10Y, 15Y, 20Y, 25Y time periods and select periods within each timeframe. Aggregation Periods range from Quarterly to 10Y.\n4. The financial metrics I am analyzing; Revenue, Net Earnings, Free Cash Flow, Operating Cash Flow, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, FCF/Expenses, etc. as well as price/metric for each of these per timeframe.\n   1. Using each of the various time periods, I plot a logarithmic/exponential regression of each of these financial metrics. Along with the regression, a correlation coefficient (R\\^2) is pulled to measure consistency. and consistency of that consistency over time.\n5. Now, the analysis;\n   1. The first deal breaker is low revenue growth or negative (which is immediately thrown out). Everything within a company can be stellar but no growth in overall sales is simply unsustainable for true long term growth unless it changes in the future. I am defining low revenue growth as 5% or less, although 10%+ is preferred and ultimately for the most part are the only ones that made it through to the end.\n   2. The next filter is every other basic financial metric (EPS, FCF, OCF, BV, etc), is it growing? is the growth consistent (high correlation with the regression). With these the cutoff is minimum 10%+ / year average growth. If any of these don't meet the par, they are tossed.\n      1. Income, FCF, Revenue Growth 10%+\n      2. Current & Quick Ratio >1\n      3. A high FCF/Expenses ratio is very attractive, as it means they have a lot of leftover cash : total expenses. Let's say it's 30%, all else equal they can increase their expenses by 30% (if they spend all their leftover cash) and in turn (all else equal) increase everything by 30% roughly speaking.\n      4. And an overall high R\\^2 to measure consistency & stability of each.\n6. Growth Adjustments:\n   1. Price metrics, is their PE growing? Is their PEG growing? these don't dictate wether a stock stays or gets tossed directly, I am only using this to adjust the growth of the stock to fit PE appreciation/depreciation which \\*could\\* toss out an all around 10%+ growth stock because of consistently depreciating PE.\n   2. Dividend Yield, this just turns the above return into total return which can make a significant difference in the case of an average growing company but one that pays a substantial dividend.\n7. Full IRR Calculation, for both growth & value:\n   1. This is how many years it would take to get a full IRR, rounded up to an upper bound (slower turnaround), given 3 things *this does not fully count stock price appreciation yet, just actual IRR, I will try to workout the equation for that too*:\n      1. Intrinsic Growth Rate (CAGR of intrinsic value of company)\n      2. PE (EPS as the current point in the regression of the EPS over each timeframe, to help smooth out outlier earnings in an otherwise stabling growing EPS)\n      3. PE Growth (Regression of PE over each timeframe, average growth rate then annualized)\n      4. I will be adding FCF % of Market Cap to account for buyback potential\n   2. The equation is as follows: ---  x=‚à´‚ÇÄ^(y)  (g + 1)\\^y da  ---  x is PE, g is Intrinsic growth rate, y is \"Years to full IRR\". You can access the graph [HERE](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pz4kmefqzw)\n8. FOR THE \"MOST CONSISTENT\" index, the methodology is the same as above with much stricter cutoffs; there can't be (if any) periods of stagnant growth over any time frame outlined above, and R\\^2 must be fairly high (>0.9) for most financials in general. One great example is FICO (R\\^2 of 0.93 for EPS Growth, Revenue Growth @ 0.98, FCF Growth @ 0.98). \\~0.95 correlation to a return of 25% yearly growth with 0 volatility, over decades is so hard to accomplish. Even .75 is difficult for most companies to sustain.\\*\\*\\*METHODOLOGY ABOVE\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*This is not investment advice, I am not a CFA or anything like that to be giving any direct investment advice, this is just my personal list of stocks I believe have good strong consistent growth, however it‚Äôs possible for some of them to underperform expectations, just as any stock\n\nEdit: The 248 list is still solid and on the side managed to bring it down to the 72 most consistent, the google sheet & image have been adjusted to also show this last refination(? if that's even a word). this 72 represents the most consistent and noticeable growth in fundamentals and financials over multiple time frames, out of the original 1,500, represents only 4.8% that met those requirements. Interestingly enough, it's almost exactly the 2 STDEV percentile aka. 95% percentile.\n\nEDIT: PART 2; link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18x1w5i/part_2_of_i_went_through_the_biggest_1500_stocks/)\n\nI'll get straight to the point; I went through the entire S&P 500, 400 & 600 (S&P 1500) one by one, looking at each individual company's financials and price accordingly. Refined the list from the base 1,500 to just 248 that had the most consistent growth on; income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and share price ratios to each respectively. Any companies that showed a recession in growth or a decline in financials were immediately eliminated. The broad index does not discriminate between growing and declining companies, just on size so there's a solid amount of stocks that drawdown the performance of the underlying index, my effort is to \"refine\" the index to only contain consistently growing companies.\n\nI don't have enough time or space to show the analysis of each, and recommend anyone taking this list to research any given company themselves because I am not that qualified to blindly suggest any stocks.\n\nI will organize the list in a readable and easily navigable manner as much as one can for and index of 248 companies.\n\n\\*\\*In an attempt to take out all biases when picking each stock out, I evaluated them blind (not looking at the ticker or any information that would tell me what the company is, some of the results from this from types of stocks \\*not\\* chosen and types of stocks that \\*were\\* chosen to be on the list were slightly surprising and sort of interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, here it is:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Separated by Sector, then Market Cap in Descending Order:\n\n[~~248~~ 254 Stock List](https://imgur.com/a/k8yoHcj) image (mid resolution, not updated, better if using the google sheets & PDF links)\n\n\\*\\*\\*[Link to Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ScMIY7Aw23rKEjLMMxg43joPfl9zsuKGy-igCNgS-Uo/edit?usp=sharing)\\*\\*\\* THIS IS THE MAIN ONE\n\n\\*[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Yk8AcAUmK5jSBYlcNON87coeReYL8mO/view?usp=sharing) of 254 base list (from 1,500, 1/6 size down)\n\n\\*[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnBRV9M9ehUp7X0qYCiGRLjKHAA2d14l/view?usp=sharing) of 72 Most Consistent (from 254, from 1,500: 1/21 size down)\n\n\\*[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZXBwhNK92U7yqH46hsMJy3TNIjLfsrRL/view?usp=sharing) of 38 Most Consistent Refined (from 72, from 1,500: 1/42 size down)\n\n[Link to THINKORSWIM watchlist](http://tos.mx/fUy0Klg)\n\n[TradingView watchlist](https://www.tradingview.com/watchlists/134344514/), curtesy of u/hello_laco\n\nDesmos graphing function for calculating full IRR, using PE & EPSG, [HERE](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qcnlosqzzm)\n\n\\*EDIT 2: I have adjusted the google sheet for 2 things: 1, the most consistent stocks are underlined (in fundamentals, regardless of price because you can't use price the same way as measuring consistency of financials). 2.
