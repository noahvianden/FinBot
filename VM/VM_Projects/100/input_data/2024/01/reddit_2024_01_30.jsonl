That also pivots to Yellen who twisted issuance to short dated, which clamped down on long dated bond vol. All of these forces come together to paint quite an arguable narrative of a vol driven cycle that we just went through, and from there you can argue we are not as late cycle as consensus. And from there, the biggest risk would be a vol shock (inflation ticking higher even slightly could do it if it moves the ultra aggressive cutting expectations).\n\n\nThat's just how I see it though.

That rate and trajectory is pretty stagnant. \n\nSo in relation to gold, in relation to property prices. Stocks adjust up because they also are an asset. That's if nothing else changes, that's the short story on that question. It has to do with the reduced purchasing power of the dollar along with a revaluation of the equity in relation to everything around it. Everything is connected. Currency pairs, gold, real estate, it's all connected in some way shape or fashion. We use money to purchase these things but when you get down to it, we're a bunch of hairless apes collecting stuff. Hoarding assets, you get the idea. If one asset becomes undervalued. It attracts attention. When you start putting economic growth arguments into stocks that's just juicing them. The final point is we are in a situation we have never been in so you have people who are bearish and they are looking at, a variety of things. They may think rates are going to stay higher longer, they may think growth will suffer, they may look at the very real situation of productivity not being as dialed as it was in 2019. There's always a negative story with stocks. Even in the '90s. It's a bubble, which of course it was. Most the time the negative narrative is wrong. That's what I was saying about statistics and why you have to be long all the time. You're never going to figure it out and if you did once. You think you could do it again and again and again. So that's the problem. We are along for the ride, we want to accumulate assets over the course of our life and it's fun to try to understand what's happening but you will only be able to figure out so much simply because there are so many moving pieces that it's not really realistic or even possible to get all of the information and make sure that that information is actually factual.

Net income, at $21.87 billion, or $2.93 per share, increased from $16.43 billion, or $2.20 per share.\n\nThe company’s Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.

The segment comprises Windows, Surface, Bing and Xbox.\n\nDuring the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft closed its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever.

AMD added that it expected all of its major businesses, including server and PC chips, to decline sequentially during the quarter.\n\nNet income in the fourth quarter was $667 million, or $0.41 per share, versus $21 million, or $0.01 per share a year ago.\n\nAMD makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are needed to train and deploy generative artificial intelligence models. While that market is currently dominated by Nvidia, AMD has said that its new AI chips introduced last year will challenge Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for some applications, and investors are looking for significant growth in the company’s data center segment over the next few years.\n\nIn October, AMD said it expected $2 billion in server GPU sales in 2024.\n\nBut historically, AMD’s main business has been central processors, or CPUs, for PCs and servers. Compared to AI chips, that part of the semiconductor industry has been flat or shrinking over the past few years, as PC sales have suffered post-pandemic.\n\nData center, which includes server CPUs and AI chips, rose 38% on an annual basis to $2.28 billion in sales. It’s now firmly AMD’s largest business and the company said that much of the increase in revenue was attributable to “strong growth” for sales of its Instinct graphics processors, which are used for AI.\n\nHowever, AMD’s overall performance in the business was in line with a $2.29 billion FactSet estimates for the Data Center business.\n\nAMD’s client group, which is comprised mostly of chips for PCs and laptops, rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.\n\nSales in AMD’s gaming segment, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a “significant” double-digit percentage in the current quarter.\n\nAMD’s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/30/amd-earnings-report-q4-2024.html", "id": "1af0cc0", "created_utc": 1706651147.0, "score": 387, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "Pretty solid report but lower margins than NVDA.

However, a Delaware judge voided this package, ruling that the company’s board of directors failed to prove “that the compensation plan was fair”. The judge found that the process leading to the board’s approval of his compensation was “deeply flawed”.\r  \nAs for the composition of Tesla’s board, it included individuals with close ties to Musk. For instance, one member was Musk’s brother, Kimbal. Another was Antonio Gracias, a chief executive of a private equity firm, who had personal ties with Musk, including vacationing together and attending family events. Other board members were also noted to have personal or business ties to Musk. These relationships have led to criticism and legal challenges regarding the independence of Tesla’s board.\r  \nIn 2018, Tesla’s board of directors consisted of the following nine members:\r  \n**1.\tElon Musk: Chairman**\r  \n2.\tElon Musk: Tesla’s Chief Executive Officer and co-founder\r  \n3.\tBrad Buss: Served as chief financial officer of solar panel installer SolarCity for two years before retiring in 2016.\r  \n4.\tRobyn Denholm: The first woman to join Tesla’s board, Denholm is chief operations officer of telecom firm Telstra and the ex-CFO of network gear maker Juniper Networks\r  \n5.\tIra Ehrenpreis: Founder and managing partner of Ehrenpreis venture capital firm DBL Partners, which is an investor in Tesla\r  \n6.\tAntonio Gracias: Lead independent director at Tesla Gracias since 2010.

Jurvetson was an early investor in Tesla and served on its board from 2006 to 2020. As for DFJ, it still held 689,676 shares of Tesla according to SEC documents.\r  \nRegarding Musk’s own voting power, as both CEO and Chairman, Musk held a significant stake in Tesla. In 2018, his ownership stake was reported to be 22.1%. Musk’s voting power came directly from his ownership shares in the company.

Did you even *try* to read the synopsis and understand it in good faith?\n\nThe court is saying that the shareholders were misled because the board produced official communications about its own independence that were factually untrue.  Period.  \n\nThat's it, that's the beginning and end of that part of the reasoning.  \n\nThere's a real effort in here to try to shoehorn this decision into a broader conversation about whether the compensation package was \"good\".  That has relatively little to do with whether the board complied with DE law, which it did not.  This is kind of frustrating to read over and over again - whether shareholders *like the deal anyway* doesn't change the fact that the law was broken in how it was prepared and communicated with them.  They can pass a new deal with the same terms easily, and I'm sure they will.  \n\n>This is clearly bad for Tesla and bad for shareholders. Elon is a huge asset to Tesla, and him leaving\n\nThis was actually quite relevant to the decision too.  One of the things underpinning it was the simple fact that Elon *wasn't* going to leave, regardless of the compensation package.  All sides, including Elon's, testified to that.   \n\nThe fact that a package of this scale was, in Elon's own words, not necessary to retain Elon was a pretty big element of the ruling.  The judge puts it pretty well:\n\n>According to the defendants, the deal was “6% for $600 billion of growth in stockholder value.” At a high level, the “6% for $600 billion” argument has a lot of appeal. But that appeal quickly fades when one remembers that Musk owned 21.9% of Tesla when the board approved his compensation plan. This ownership stake gave him every incentive to push Tesla to levels of transformative growth—Musk stood to gain over $10 billion for every $50 billion in market capitalization increase. Musk had no intention of leaving Tesla, and he made that clear at the outset of the process and throughout this litigation. Moreover, the compensation plan was not conditioned on Musk devoting any set amount of time to Tesla because the board never proposed such a term. Swept up by the rhetoric of “all upside,” or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?\n\nMusk was going to stay, Musk already had ludicrously high incentive to create growth because of his existing large ownership stake, so the board really had no cause to give him as much as it did in a competitive negotiation.  It could still choose to do so, of course, but not while also misrepresenting its own independence and the existence of any negotiation at all.  \n\n>If this decision isn't appealed and overturned, that would be extremely disturbing and a huge signal on the amount of corruption in Delaware.\n\nThis decision is routine and represents normal DE law.  The existence of laws like this is actually a major reason so many companies are HQed in DE.   This situation, a minority controlled board misrepresenting its own independence while passing an anomalously large compensation package for the benefit of the controlling minority, is the exact situation the law is meant to prevent.

They've instructed pilots to use de-icing in these planes sparingly as overuse could cause that housing to overheat and fall off.\n\n-Last month they instructed airlines to inspect planes for loose bolts in the rudder control system. That could be even more catastrophic than the loss of a door plug. Similar to the jackscrew issue on Alaska Air 261.\n\n-Max deliveries have been halted to check the long list of things wrong with them.

It's the opposite. It's a PR move to save face and save sales. \n\n-Southwest is the biggest 737 customers and they've removed the Max 7 from their fleet plans until the FAA has fully certified it. If Boeing loses the trust of Southwest and that airline so much as considers buying Airbus, that's going to be brutal. \n\n-Boeing has withdrawn their request for a safety exemption. The exemptions have been the thing that kept Max airframes in delivery mode. \n\n-The halting of production, the loss of airtime, grounding of fleets, checking and replacing parts, lobbying the FAA and regulators, courting airlines not to look toward Airbus, etc... this is all at cost to the company so far this year.

The window pop out incident will have real material effects on next year's guidance:\n\n1. FAA is limiting production output. This is #1 downside pressure. Boeing is currently in massive debt and losing money and will continue to lose money unless they can get their rate up. FAA has said the rate is now capped. When will they un-cap? No one knows\n2. 737-7 and 737-10 are delayed again, which will lead to cancellations and/or customer concessions\n3. Alaska and United are demanding concessions for the 737-9 grounding\n\nAnd here's the real kicker.\n\nCalhoun and the other Boeing boys are first and foremost politicians. This isn't a knock on them, this is them understanding their dependence on the US government, both for military contracts and for FAA approvals.\n\n\\#1 thing Boeing needs to get production rate growth going again is to get the FAA off their back, which means get the angry public and Senators off their back.\n\nImagine the stock goes up tomorrow. What message does that send? That Boeing can cut corners and investors will still be rewarded. That will fuel the anger and empower the FAA to keep crushing them.\n\nImagine the other side. Stock dumps on poor years guidance, Boeing takes the black eye, FAA asserts dominance. Public and Senators are satisfied and move on, giving Boeing more maneuvering room with FAA to get rate going again.\n\nAnd then one or two quarters from now, Boeing can raise guidance and price goes back up. Stock dumping tomorrow is the best long-term option for Boeing, and Calhoun is too smart not to take it.\n\nThere is no good news coming for Boeing, at least not this month\n\nedit: forgot to mention - one thing you have to realize about a production rate cap is that its not simply a reduction of revenue. Boeing is in long-term contracts with their suppliers (since suppliers need assurance that $ will come in before they tool the production). This means that Boeing will be paying for parts they cannot use\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usveukm6amfc1.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=de7d649d14c3007fa12a52af118a1acfa1e6be22\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xzvlt7t2amfc1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4924217a4074c408f6aeceef16d9a5dace0f8e\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "1aeut1v", "created_utc": 1706637781.0, "score": 67, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|41|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/180rzxf/im_yoloing_into_msft_heres_my_dd_that_convinced_me/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1950692/boeing_safety_crisis_what_happened_week_1/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxc6jf/missed_wayfair_jump_get_ostk/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194er83/boeing_safety_crisis_part_2_why_i_give_a_damn_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aeut1v/boeing_will_tank_tomorrow/) \n**Account Age**|13 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "How are your PUTS going you regards?

The downside is you cap your gains. \n\nSo OP stated his spread at max value would be a 7 bagger. The 185c costing 3.60 and the 200c costing like 1.60. So 3.60 - 1.60 = 2. 2.00 is the cost of that spread. The max gain would be the strikes 200 - 185 = 15. So max gain per spread would be 15.00. 15.00 / 2.00 = 7.5.

During this time Apple has reorganized its teams around dedicated project managers, whose job is to manage the project from beginning to end. There are no silos. This is a big deal. Cook and the executive management give their product leads the visionary direction, financing, staffing, and tools to make their project successful. While these project managers do report to executive leads, they have the autonomy needed to make certain their project succeeds.\n\nThis type of management style is being studied now in business schools and other board rooms as this shift in how Apple gets things done is gaining serious notice.

But the brand that Steve Jobs created is why people still buy the products. \n\nTim Cook is an investor and Wall Street Darling. Which as a shareholder,  I'm content with. But Jobs was an inspiration. \n\nThere's an interview where he once very famously said that his influence from Apple will truly be gone a decade after he leaves the company. \n\nHe was different.
