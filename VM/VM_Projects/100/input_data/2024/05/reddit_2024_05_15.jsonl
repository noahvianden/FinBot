With time and money any company can figure it out (after the initial stages of design and approvals) given competent leaders who are not frauds (that would be the original founders) but financing it is the hard part. This is where many of the newer eV companies struggled. The only one, I believe, who managed to get the financing (of the recent startups) is Rivian. I think Lucid is working on one but im not sure of status.\n\nAs to who financed it all, well that would be tax payers. Yea money came from individual investors into Tesla but ultimately no one would have invested a penny if not for all the freebees early on (Teslas original factory was basically a gift from the state of CA) and then it was buyer incentives and carbon credits that saved Tesla later when even Musk was trying to get out (by his own admission).

In fact, gas/oil got 35 years of 100% subsidies (yes thats not a typo).

First of all, they claim a fleet of 1 million cars driving one hour a day would take 3 years to cover all the edge cases to increase improve MTBF one order of magnitue from 10\\^6 to 10\\^7 hours, and therefore it the pure E2E approach can't be done. Yeah ok, so on average a car may actually drive less than that, lets say half an hour, but Tesla's non-FSD fleet (which can be sampled from as well) is already 5 million, and growing by 2+ million every year, so actually it might take a year or so, not three?\n\nSecond, they have good points about the bias variance tradeoff, and reducing variance by having a sensing state branch of the network with ground truth LiDAR might work, but they're completely missing what's around the corner: world models. World models would essentially predict the next internal sensing state from the last state plus the action taken. For example, the model would observe a ball at two different locations at times t and t+1, and will have to predict that at t+2 it will have rolled a bit further still. Thus it will learn about balls and how they work just from observing the world over time. Current FSD doesn't do this, it looks at the video and tries to predict the best action given what it sees, but if all the video it's been shown of balls have been on the side of the road, it won't have learned that it should break for it if it rolls into its path, it's just learned that balls can be ignored. Adding world model prediction will reduce the variance way more than adding ground truth LiDAR, and it's the clear next step.\n\nWorld models can be the pre-training step for a system like FSD, just like ChatGPT is fine-tuned with RLHF on GPT-4, which has just been pretrained on unprocessed raw internet data. The next state prediction of the world model can then either be thrown away at inference time (in the car), or used to simulate possible futures (thinking really hard about the problem).", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Mobileye bankwupt yet?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Despite everything they're in the best position still, they have long standing partnerships with OEMs, shipped several generations of hardware etc. Wayve has the better tech, but seems like MobilEye really have to put their heads the sand to lose.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Balls, hihi", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "V12.4 will be on version 2024.15.5", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "🥪🙏", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "FYI I just bought one from a gas station for $5.99 gfy", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "What did u get it for last year?

Because I think existing premiums are jumping too right. Are they just using inflation as an excuse to increase profitability or am is my tiny brain missing something obvious that increases there costs?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It all plays a role.  Cost of repairing cars has gone up 20% a year recently.  This is largely due to the higher value of vehicles and the enhanced safety features and electronics on new cars.  A broken windshield on a Subaru 15 years ago would be around $400 to replace.  A new one is several thousand dollars.  Its because they have a camera that is attached to the windshield that requires recalibration when you remove it.  When the value of cars increases (like it has), the cost of both your property damage coverage will increase even if your car stays the same.  This is because the amount of damage you would do to an average car on the road is more than it was when cars were worth less.  So multiple coverages are increasing just from cost of repairs and cost of new cars.\n\n  \nThen add in the nuclear judgements (thats the actual term) against insurance companies for injuries.  Juries are awarding ridiculous amounts for injuries and lawyers are the ones coming out on top.  The juries think they are sticking it to the insurance company and \"corporation bad\", but all it does is get passed on in inflated insurance costs for everyone.  \n\n  \nAs for how these companies are still in business with these ratios ... Its due to float.  If the insurance company pays out $1 for every $1 they bring in, they can still be profitable at the end of the year.  They take the unearned premium (the pre-paid insurance essentially) and invest it.  They then hopefully have a profit on that money that hasnt been applied to the insurance payment yet.  Thats why the insurance wants you to pay your full 6 months or 1 year policy at once, so they can invest the unused portion.  Think of it like this.  GEICO is owned by Berkshire Hathaway.  If GEICO had a 100% ratio, spending all of its money it brings in, every dime ... It can still send that money it brought in to BH to invest.  BH in return gets an interest free loan to invest in other businesses.  If GEICO didn't exist for BH, they would have to go to a bank to get that loan and it would cost the going interest rate.  Insurance companies can survive at around 100% ratio, they cannot survive at State Farm's 129% ratio they were running though.

You can't imagine....  \n  \nSo here's the story, DD, TA, and some fucking rage for those corporate criminals  \n  \n**Fire**  \n  \nPG&E was supposed to turn off the power due to weather conditions - they announced this 4 days ahead of time. But they didn't, to turn an extra dime, and go figure: it started a massive fire. Soon, chunks of bark were flying miles across the sky, due to the high winds, igniting the town from all sides.

It would be a few years before getting any of it, though, leaving survivors SOL. All the while, the lawyers and admins in charge of distributing the trust rack up $98 million in fees.  \n  \nAnyways here's the kicker, and why survivors struggled without this money for years. The stock that funded the wasn't enough to make the payouts. We would have to wait, [FOR THIS CHART](https://imgur.com/uMA1GOB), to recover. We saved NOTHING, none of our belongings, home, car, clothes nothing escaped from this fire. And we were holding our breath on a setup that needs years of accumulation. They seriously paid the trust in worthless stock and said wait for it to bounce.  \n  \nLet's just say PG&E had better lawyers than whoever was representing survivors.\n\n**3. Trust sold out**  \n  \nWe're all sucking hopium that PG&E, the company the ruined all our lives, gets a nice rally in. So we can buy shoes. But finally they start making payments.   \n  \nAt some point they had to sell. Couldn't tell everyone to \"just wait another couple of years for recovery\" while a large percentage of survivors are \\*still\\* homeless.   \n  \nIt won't be 100% of what the lawsuit entailed, but 3.5 years later, we got something. You know where I'm putting it.  \n  \nAs of December, the trust has sold all of the stock. 5 years to sell 477 million shares, nearly a quarter of the float.  \n  \n4, Chart  \n  \nSimple idea - main resistance is top of relief bounce.

The Fire Victim Trust announced that it sold the last 67.7 million shares of PG&E stock in December 2023. This final sale marked the end of the Trust's efforts to liquidate its holdings of PG&E stock, which were originally provided as part of PG&E’s bankruptcy reorganization plan. In total, the Trust sold 477 million shares of PG&E stock over several years to fund the compensation for fire victims.\n\nAs of the final sale, the Trust has disbursed over $11.21 billion to fire victims, addressing claims related to the 2015 Butte Fire, 2017 North Bay Fires, and the 2018 Camp Fire. The sale of these shares added significant liquidity to the Trust, enabling it to increase the pro rata payment percentage to 66% for all claimants​ ([Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240312613317/en/Fire-Victim-Trust-to-Increase-Pro-Rata-Payments-to-California-Fire-Survivors-to-66/))​​ ([Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231213203932/en/Fire-Victim-Trust-Announces-Sale-of-Remaining-67.7-Million-Shares/))​.\n\n  \nwas pcg trying to keep the price low while the trust held shares? \n\nChatGPT\n\nSearched 5 sites\n\nThere is evidence suggesting that the activities of hedge funds and the structure of the Fire Victim Trust (FVT) may have contributed to keeping PG&E's stock price lower during the period when the trust held significant shares. After PG&E emerged from bankruptcy, hedge funds collectively dumped 250 million shares, which put downward pressure on the stock price. This affected the returns for the fire victims, as their compensation was heavily tied to the value of PG&E stock​ ([IJPR](https://www.ijpr.org/wildfire/2021-10-13/hedge-funds-cash-out-billions-in-pg-e-stock-california-fire-survivors-suffer-and-wait))​​ ([KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/11891626/hedge-funds-cash-out-billions-in-pge-stock-fire-survivors-suffer-and-wait))​.\n\nMoreover, the intricate arrangement of the trust, which included a significant portion of the settlement in PG&E stock rather than cash, created a complicated situation for the fire victims. They became major shareholders in the company and had to bear the risk of stock price fluctuations​ ([KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/11872328/survivors-stuck-in-limbo-as-pge-fire-victim-trust-pays-out-50-million-in-fees))​​ ([Home](https://www.capradio.org/articles/2021/05/06/survivors-stuck-in-limbo-as-pge-fire-victim-trust-pays-out-50-million-in-fees/))​. This situation was exacerbated by the hedge funds' sell-offs, which further depressed the stock value, making it difficult for the trust to fulfill its financial obligations to the victims promptly​ ([IJPR](https://www.ijpr.org/wildfire/2021-10-13/hedge-funds-cash-out-billions-in-pg-e-stock-california-fire-survivors-suffer-and-wait))​​ ([KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/11891626/hedge-funds-cash-out-billions-in-pge-stock-fire-survivors-suffer-and-wait))​.\n\nIn summary, while there isn't explicit evidence that PG&E itself directly manipulated stock prices to keep them low, the actions of hedge funds and the financial structure of the settlement likely contributed to the stock's underperformance during a critical period for fire survivors awaiting compensation.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
