{"title": "More Tesla employees laid off as bloodbath enters its fourth week", "selftext": "Tesla’s brutal round of layoffs entered its fourth week, with more employees posting on LinkedIn and elsewhere about receiving notice that their time at the company has come to an end.\n\nThe most recent layoffs, which were first reported by Electrek and Business Insider, appear to be hitting different segments of the company, including software, services, and engineering. Employees said they received layoff notices over the weekend and on Monday.\n\nIt’s unclear how many employees have been affected. Business Insider reported at least seven employees posted about being laid off on Sunday.\n\nThe layoffs first started last month, when Tesla began laying off what was said to be at the time 10 percent of the company’s global workforce of 140,000 people. The layoffs included Tesla’s head of EV charging, Rebecca Tinucci, as well as her entire 500-person team. Tesla’s head of the new vehicles program, Daniel Ho, was also let go.\n\nOn X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company needed to be reorganized every five years. And in an email to employees, he said the company needed to be “absolutely hard core” about the cuts and that staffers working under executives who “don’t obviously pass the excellent, necessary and trustworthy test” would be out of a job.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Musk privately expressed a desire to lay off at least 20 percent of the company because its quarterly vehicle deliveries fell by that much.\n\nTesla is going through one of its toughest financial situations in years, with sales dropping and profits down 55 percent year over year. The company is experiencing increased competition, both in the US and in China, while also dealing with waning demand for EVs globally.\n\nAnd Musk has been downplaying Tesla’s vehicle business in an effort to position the company as a leader in autonomous vehicles, promising to unveil a fully autonomous robotaxi later this year.\n\nSource: https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/6/24150274/tesla-layoffs-employee-fourth-week-elon-musk-ev-demand", "id": "1cm22gu", "created_utc": 1715051785.0, "score": 903, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 266, "comments": [{"body": "Yeah pissing off your remaining employees.

If you are just trying to chase the AI wave of investment money I can't really help you. Speculative bets on companies trying to apply AI to their current business are akin to putting money on the roulette table IMO. Or more accurately you're putting some money down on a headline and hoping when the next headline appears someone else will buy your stock for more.\n\nIf you want to invest in the products and applications of AI, the more tangible players are limited right now. I think most companies investing are going to discover that LLMs are more limited in application than they thought. It'll turn out that putting an LLM next to their current business process doesn't just magically make everything faster or more cost effective. IMO its akin to hiring last season's MVP for the NFL and making them a top executive at your company. They are undeniably a top player in their field, but they probably don't know shit about running a major corporation. So you end up spending a ton of money in this exercise to just discover that maybe AI wasn't the right fit for your company's product. This exact same thing happened a few years ago when everyone went nuts over Web 3.0 aka blockchain. It turns out that blockchain is very slow and has a very limited application space. If your product boils down to getting results quickly to a customer on the web, your best bet is still a classic server + database + frontend architecture that we've been iterating on since the 90s.\n\nThere ARE applications though! Microsoft probably has the best application with Copilot currently. I'm unsure if the Office version is any good, haven't used it, but the coding version is very helpful and I'll advocate it at any company I work at from now on. Applications where AI can help \"un-stuck\" you and make you more productive seem like great investments. There's some heated debate in the art community right now over AI-generated images, but I get the impression that AI will win over creatives eventually because it will help them produce more. Productivity boosts seem like great long-term investments. Most of my stock is in Microsoft because they saw the opportunity and the product and they've been putting massive investment into OpenAI.\n\n> The issue is creating the software for actual use of AI and generating cash flow.\n\nYes, but consider that AI software has existed for a long time. The chips took off because they made LLMs more usable. My company has been using Google Vision for over 4 years though, long before any of this current trend took off. LLMs are probably going to be an important milestone but not the only AI application going forward. Small Language Models are beginning to pick up some steam right now. They require small amounts of power and help drive data discovery in sensors. There's probably a big use-case waiting for this type of software that no one has landed on yet.\n\nMeta saying \"we are going to put AI in the metaverse\" is one of the most baloney statements I've ever heard.

That may not compare with the $8.71 loss expected by LSEG\n\nRevenue: $243 million vs. $212.8 million expected by LSEG\n\nRevenue climbed 48% from $163.7 million a year earlier. The company reported $222.7 million in ad revenue for the period, up 39% year over year, which is a faster rate of growth than at its top competitors.\n\nDigital advertising companies have started growing again at a healthy clip after brands reeled in spending to cope with inflation in 2022. Meta’s ad revenue jumped 27% in the first quarter, followed by 24% growth at Amazon and 13% growth at Google parent Alphabet.\n\nReddit reported a net loss of $575.1 million. Stock-based compensation expenses and related taxes were $595.5 million, primarily driven by IPO charges.\n\nFor the second quarter, Reddit expects revenue of $240 million to $255 million, topping the $224 million expected by analysts, according to LSEG. The midpoint of the guidance range suggests growth of about 32% for the second quarter, up from $183 million from a year earlier.\n\nReddit, which hosts millions of online forums on its platform, was founded in 2005 by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the company’s CEO. \n\n“We see this as the beginning of a new chapter as we work towards building the next generation of Reddit,” Huffman said in a release Tuesday.\n\nReddit began trading under the ticker symbol “RDDT” on the New York Stock Exchange in March. The company priced its IPO at $34 per share, which valued the company around $6.5 billion. When tech valuations were red hot in 2021, Reddit’s private market valuation reached $10 billion.\n\nThe stock climbed past $58 in after-hours trading on Tuesday before coming back a bit. Should the stock close above $57.75 on Wednesday, it would be at its highest since March 26, its fourth day of trading. The shares closed that day at $65.11, their highest yet.\n\nThe company reported 82.7 million daily active users for its first quarter, up from the 76.6 million expected by StreetAccount. Average revenue per user worldwide rose 8% to $2.94 from $2.72 a year ago.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/reddit-rddt-q1-2024-earnings.html", "id": "1cmmlqj", "created_utc": 1715115718.0, "score": 634, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 194, "comments": [{"body": "Always inverse reddit, but how can you inverse reddit when the very thing you’re inversing is reddit on reddit?", "score": 427, "replies": [{"body": "Reddit inception.

Example - I'll be picking over DIS this morning at market open.\n* 21 to 30 DTE for the first opening is the sweet spot.  Gives you incremental chances to roll out and down (or up in the case of calls).  You have a lot more steps before you become really trapped in something.\n* Avoid garbage!  Stick to indexes as much as possible, then blue chips.  The more \"meme\" you get, the bigger your risks and sleepless nights.   If you wouldn't own it (and be brutally honest with yourself), don't bet on it.\n* If the market looks like shit and you aren't feeling it, don't force the trades for \"income\".  Sit on your hands and come back later.  I average about 6 trades a week, mostly set on Monday and closed by Friday.\n* Take the profit if it means clearing your risk off the board.  If something moves and gives you a 30 to 50% profit just a few days into your trade, take it and re-visit later.  No need to wait 2-3 more weeks for that other 30-50%.

It's the equivalent of systematically selling covered calls. You can interpret this as realized volatility tends to be lower than implied volatility and the market has positive expected value.\n- Wheeling is a safe strategy if you expect the market to be going up over the long term (assuming you don't blow up in between) -- you will always be long delta. You can get rekt if it chops and you get assigned at unfavorable prices several times in a row. It's not probable but it is possible.\n- Margining options is dangerous if you don't have an exit strategy. Keep in mind liquidity dries up when volatility is high and high volatility is very strongly correlated with market dips (meaning your puts will eat shit from delta, vega, and gamma). Also, liquidity in the options chain is significantly thinner than in the underlying.\n- Circuit breakers do hedge out some of your risk with ETFs, but I wouldn't rely on them to be your stop loss.\n\nAdditional thoughts:\n- You shouldn't be selling directional options if you don't have an opinion on direction AND volatility.

Having universal healthcare is a trade off a society makes for certain obvious benefits at the expense of innovation and quality of service. A wise government could come up with a system that could mitigate this trade off, maximize the benefit and minimize the downside, but I have yet to see a wise politician. In general American conservatives take this disappointment in the political class as a rule of nature, lionize capitalist growth, and are terrified of stagnation, so have just chosen a system that incentivizes innovation in the hopes that society (or healthcare, in this case) will advance at the cost of the poor.

Would that seem fair? There are countless diseases that are absolutely horrible that could be treated but aren't. What about a situation where everyone gets free healthcare but advancement comes at a snail's pace - one discovery per century, say? Still kind of unfair, no? What about free healthcare but you have to wait in the emergency room for hours and potentially die, or wait months for an MRI like in Canada (ask me how I know). \n\nWell the American conservatives have done that math and figured that since providing the service to everyone is inefficient and slow, the least slow and the most efficient way to advance medicine is to have it be _not_ free. It's not my fault that humans are driven by greed, and it's not my fault that innovation and quality service come as a result of that motivation. It's not American conservatives' fault, either. It's just true. \n\nAgain, I am _for_ universal healthcare and think that some concessions must be made in efficiency for the sake of helping out those who are downtrodden or poor.
