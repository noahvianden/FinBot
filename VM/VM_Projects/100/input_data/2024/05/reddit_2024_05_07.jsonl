{"title": "More Tesla employees laid off as bloodbath enters its fourth week", "selftext": "Tesla‚Äôs brutal round of layoffs entered its fourth week, with more employees posting on LinkedIn and elsewhere about receiving notice that their time at the company has come to an end.\n\nThe most recent layoffs, which were first reported by Electrek and Business Insider, appear to be hitting different segments of the company, including software, services, and engineering. Employees said they received layoff notices over the weekend and on Monday.\n\nIt‚Äôs unclear how many employees have been affected. Business Insider reported at least seven employees posted about being laid off on Sunday.\n\nThe layoffs first started last month, when Tesla began laying off what was said to be at the time 10 percent of the company‚Äôs global workforce of 140,000 people. The layoffs included Tesla‚Äôs head of EV charging, Rebecca Tinucci, as well as her entire 500-person team. Tesla‚Äôs head of the new vehicles program, Daniel Ho, was also let go.\n\nOn X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company needed to be reorganized every five years. And in an email to employees, he said the company needed to be ‚Äúabsolutely hard core‚Äù about the cuts and that staffers working under executives who ‚Äúdon‚Äôt obviously pass the excellent, necessary and trustworthy test‚Äù would be out of a job.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Musk privately expressed a desire to lay off at least 20 percent of the company because its quarterly vehicle deliveries fell by that much.\n\nTesla is going through one of its toughest financial situations in years, with sales dropping and profits down 55 percent year over year. The company is experiencing increased competition, both in the US and in China, while also dealing with waning demand for EVs globally.\n\nAnd Musk has been downplaying Tesla‚Äôs vehicle business in an effort to position the company as a leader in autonomous vehicles, promising to unveil a fully autonomous robotaxi later this year.\n\nSource: https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/6/24150274/tesla-layoffs-employee-fourth-week-elon-musk-ev-demand", "id": "1cm22gu", "created_utc": 1715051785.0, "score": 903, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 266, "comments": [{"body": "Yeah pissing off your remaining employees.

The smaller iPad costs $599 for 128GB of storage, and the larger iPad starts at $799.\n\nApple has also moved the front-facing camera to the longer side of the device ‚Äî landscape mode ‚Äî to be better for videoconferencing, matching Apple‚Äôs more-expensive iPad Pro models.\n\nThese are the first new iPad models Apple has released since Oct. 2022, the longest time that Apple has gone without updating the product line since its launch in 2011. The iPad Air, Apple‚Äôs mid-tier model, was last updated in March 2022, and comes in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and a gold color.\n\nIt will be available in stores next week.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the biggest day for iPad since its introduction,‚Äù Apple CEO Tim Cook said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/apple-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-2024-announced.html", "id": "1cmcwmk", "created_utc": 1715091203.0, "score": 506, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 197, "comments": [{"body": "Today's announcement marks the biggest needle-mover since the invention of the needle", "score": 520, "replies": [{"body": "People working really hard to move that needle!", "score": 73, "replies": []}, {"body": "It moved 10x as much as the first time Apple moved a needle.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "In 2024 apple worked hard and delivered a 10x smaller needle ü™°", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> moved the front-facing camera to the longer side of the device\n\nYOLO calls on Apple.

The buyback this time was too big because this is a great time for Apple to spend it's giant pile of cash on AI. I am pretty sure that the big announcement will be on-device multi-modal AI. Several weeks ago, Apple researchers released a paper of a small efficient on-device LLM model that could be very useful.

If you are just trying to chase the AI wave of investment money I can't really help you.

Or more accurately you're putting some money down on a headline and hoping when the next headline appears someone else will buy your stock for more.\n\nIf you want to invest in the products and applications of AI, the more tangible players are limited right now. I think most companies investing are going to discover that LLMs are more limited in application than they thought. It'll turn out that putting an LLM next to their current business process doesn't just magically make everything faster or more cost effective. IMO its akin to hiring last season's MVP for the NFL and making them a top executive at your company. They are undeniably a top player in their field, but they probably don't know shit about running a major corporation. So you end up spending a ton of money in this exercise to just discover that maybe AI wasn't the right fit for your company's product. This exact same thing happened a few years ago when everyone went nuts over Web 3.0 aka blockchain. It turns out that blockchain is very slow and has a very limited application space. If your product boils down to getting results quickly to a customer on the web, your best bet is still a classic server + database + frontend architecture that we've been iterating on since the 90s.\n\nThere ARE applications though! Microsoft probably has the best application with Copilot currently. I'm unsure if the Office version is any good, haven't used it, but the coding version is very helpful and I'll advocate it at any company I work at from now on. Applications where AI can help \"un-stuck\" you and make you more productive seem like great investments. There's some heated debate in the art community right now over AI-generated images, but I get the impression that AI will win over creatives eventually because it will help them produce more.

The chips took off because they made LLMs more usable. My company has been using Google Vision for over 4 years though, long before any of this current trend took off. LLMs are probably going to be an important milestone but not the only AI application going forward. Small Language Models are beginning to pick up some steam right now. They require small amounts of power and help drive data discovery in sensors. There's probably a big use-case waiting for this type of software that no one has landed on yet.\n\nMeta saying \"we are going to put AI in the metaverse\" is one of the most baloney statements I've ever heard.

That may not compare with the $8.71 loss expected by LSEG\n\nRevenue: $243 million vs. $212.8 million expected by LSEG\n\nRevenue climbed 48% from $163.7 million a year earlier. The company reported $222.7 million in ad revenue for the period, up 39% year over year, which is a faster rate of growth than at its top competitors.\n\nDigital advertising companies have started growing again at a healthy clip after brands reeled in spending to cope with inflation in 2022. Meta‚Äôs ad revenue jumped 27% in the first quarter, followed by 24% growth at Amazon and 13% growth at Google parent Alphabet.\n\nReddit reported a net loss of $575.1 million. Stock-based compensation expenses and related taxes were $595.5 million, primarily driven by IPO charges.\n\nFor the second quarter, Reddit expects revenue of $240 million to $255 million, topping the $224 million expected by analysts, according to LSEG. The midpoint of the guidance range suggests growth of about 32% for the second quarter, up from $183 million from a year earlier.\n\nReddit, which hosts millions of online forums on its platform, was founded in 2005 by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the company‚Äôs CEO. \n\n‚ÄúWe see this as the beginning of a new chapter as we work towards building the next generation of Reddit,‚Äù Huffman said in a release Tuesday.\n\nReddit began trading under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúRDDT‚Äù on the New York Stock Exchange in March. The company priced its IPO at $34 per share, which valued the company around $6.5 billion. When tech valuations were red hot in 2021, Reddit‚Äôs private market valuation reached $10 billion.\n\nThe stock climbed past $58 in after-hours trading on Tuesday before coming back a bit. Should the stock close above $57.75 on Wednesday, it would be at its highest since March 26, its fourth day of trading. The shares closed that day at $65.11, their highest yet.\n\nThe company reported 82.7 million daily active users for its first quarter, up from the 76.6 million expected by StreetAccount. Average revenue per user worldwide rose 8% to $2.94 from $2.72 a year ago.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/reddit-rddt-q1-2024-earnings.html", "id": "1cmmlqj", "created_utc": 1715115718.0, "score": 634, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 194, "comments": [{"body": "Always inverse reddit, but how can you inverse reddit when the very thing you‚Äôre inversing is reddit on reddit?", "score": 427, "replies": [{"body": "Reddit inception.

Tell me why it will not end well.", "selftext": "I have positive experience with the wheel but I want growth with less taxes now, so I want to keep ~100% of my money in ETF and collect credit from selling options. I'm not in a hurry, doing my research to at least think I know what I am doing, especially when it concerns margin which I have not used before.\n\nOne strategy I thought of was the wheel, but more cautious (lower delta) on put side to reduce chance risk of assignmen  and more aggressive on call side, potentially selling stock without call contract in case price bounces back, to pay back margin loan asap and reduce interest payment. The size of all wheels (sum of margin loan and puts assignment costs) is limited to 20% of ETF part of portfolio. Stock choice limited to higher quality to reduce random crash chance.\n\n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Does it make sense? Or does experience show that it is one more strategy which does not beat my own ETF portfolio and just ends up as a loss, requiring me to sell some ETF? Does 20% limit mentioned above look reasonable or I under/over-estimate the risk?\n\n2. Because of margin loan interest would it be better to use stop loss and buy back puts for loss instead of assignment? Maybe use put credit spreads instead?\n\n3.

Keep in mind liquidity dries up when volatility is high and high volatility is very strongly correlated with market dips (meaning your puts will eat shit from delta, vega, and gamma). Also, liquidity in the options chain is significantly thinner than in the underlying.\n- Circuit breakers do hedge out some of your risk with ETFs, but I wouldn't rely on them to be your stop loss.\n\nAdditional thoughts:\n- You shouldn't be selling directional options if you don't have an opinion on direction AND volatility.

My main point is that your argument brings race and gender needlessly into a conversation about cars. What is your reason for bringing that up? Why exactly does it matter if white men are more likely to drive an EV than black women? And why is it that you give a shit-stained sneer toward the people who do buy EVs? \"\"White men can pretend they care about the environment.\" I'm sorry, but is your claim that Chinese women care more? How about Indians? What's Africa's record on environmental protections?\n\nYou're doing what has become fashionable and shoehorning race and gender into everything while shaming people for no reason at all.

A wise government could come up with a system that could mitigate this trade off, maximize the benefit and minimize the downside, but I have yet to see a wise politician.
