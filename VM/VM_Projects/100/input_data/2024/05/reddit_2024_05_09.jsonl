I usually take 3-5% profit with limit orders. Usually preset at the beginning and ready to adjust if placed too far. You hold too long, hoping you score big - you become entrapped in the sideways business. \n\nWhat I do is get my strangles right in the middle between the strangle bounds if the market price falls in there. That's where it is the cheapest on average. It is logically true for strangles, as puts and calls are same distance OTM at that midpoint. The best is when the price sticks right in the middle and doesn't move uncontrollably around it. So that when it suddenly finds a direction, that is when you score. I have 2-3 stocks open and usually just wait for a slight cool down. Be especially mindful when the price moves back to where you bought the strangle (price of it decreases tremendously if that happens fast with great volatility). It gets even worse in that situation if you hadn't bought the strangle in the middle. So it's best to wait for a slight cool down to avoid this. Strangles work best in the first 1-2 hours of the market. Later hours are mostly sideways action as I have gathered with experience. Unless you're trading SPY at the time when one of those FED guys are talking.\n\nIn the rare event I want to gamble, I may, for example, leave 1 strangle open out of, let's say, 20 (after having sold 19), to score or lose additional $200 if I already scored $400+ for the day.

If someone fails to follow the amendment, it’s human error. But what about before that? Was it a Boeing issue or a human error. It depends. One such example is the deicers on current 737 Max which require pilots to manually adjust the duration the deicers to not exceed 2 minutes. This is a design flaw that Boeing has stated they will address, and in the meantime pilots must follow the technical bulletin. Through the NTSB categorization, a pilot failing to follow this is considered a human error. But is it? Boeing admits it’s a design flaw and not one found in the Airbus equivalents of A3xx. \n\nLastly, I am not a whistleblower.

ASML is the only photolithography equipment manufacturer who figured out how to make EUV commercially viable. As for why? My understanding is as light wavelength decreases, it starts to interact with glass lenses and air itself, producing artifacts and losing energy, so the process was not commercially viable. However, ASML has a close partnership with Zeiss and through joint R&D was able to make incredibly smooth mirrors, and using those mirrors and clever engineering, get the desired wavelength.\n\nMany other tool makers, such as Canon and Lam, make blue and DUV range photolithography machines.

There are also a ton of washing steps.  \n\nThe patterns drawn via photolithography expose layers underneath which then dictates where the deposition and removal steps work.
