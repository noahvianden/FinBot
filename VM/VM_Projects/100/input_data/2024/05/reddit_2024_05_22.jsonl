So if they take on a positive delta situation when you open a position with them they will take an action that is negative delta. If you open a position that would make them delta negative they will take an action that is positive delta. If they can do all that while closing both long and short positions without having to resort to actually buying or selling shares I suppose they could do that, but its quite possible there is an imbalance and they have to buy or sell a lot of shares. \n\nMy understanding is that NVDA had somewhere around a 90/10 call to put ratio for this earnings report. That could to result in a violent swing in the morning as market makers have to get ahead of this. Remember they are here to make money and someone is going to lose out on this. Alternatively we may have gapped far enough past the implied move that they will simply race to buy shares and we could see a substantial move up as a result. \n\nIf I had to guess in the morning a bunch of people who bought options are going to close their positions. If the market makers bought shares when they opened that contract they will likely sell those shares as those positions close out. If enough people go that route the price will drop until it hits some equilibrium. The other option is that enough people hold their options and the market makers have to hold those shares to meet their needs when contracts are resolved. Now imagine you are someone with an option with a $950 strike price. Do you close it in the morning? Do you exercise it? If you exercise it thats one thing, but if you close it the market maker can sell some shares and that will make a dent in the supply/demand balance. If that happens enough the market price drops below $1000 and then those option holders are out of luck and the market makers can continue to sell shares. If on the other hand more people hold the options and those shares aren't sold the price will drift up. \n\nIn the morning we will likely find out in an hour or two how things are going to play out.

{"title": "Target's earnings miss, sales fall as consumers buy fewer groceries and home goods ", "selftext": "Target on Wednesday posted a year-over-year sales decline and missed Wall Street‚Äôs earnings estimates, as consumers fatigued from high prices bought both fewer discretionary items and groceries. \n\nThe Minneapolis-based discounter‚Äôs revenue was about in line with expectations. On a call with reporters, CEO Brian Cornell said the company‚Äôs results reflect ‚Äúcontinued soft trends in discretionary categories.‚Äù\n\nHe said the company wants to make sure it offers customers value and communicates that in a clear way, with moves like its relaunched loyalty program. Target also announced Monday it was cutting prices on thousands of everyday items, including milk, bread, paper towels and diapers.\n\nTarget stuck with its prior full-year forecast, saying it expects comparable sales will range from flat to up 2% and adjusted earnings per share will be $8.60 to $9.60. \n\nHere‚Äôs what Target reported for the three-month period that ended May 4 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.03 vs. $2.06 expected\n\nRevenue: $24.53 billion vs. $24.52 billion expected\n\nIt marked the first time since November 2022 that Target missed earnings expectations. \n\nTarget‚Äôs net income for the period fell by less than 1% to $942 million, or $2.03 per share, from $950 million, or $2.05 per share, in the year-ago quarter. \n\nTotal revenue declined about 3% from $25.32 billion in the prior year.\n\nLike other retailers, Target has tried to win over consumers who are not spending as freely on clothing, home goods or other discretionary items. The cheap chic retailer has been particularly hurt by the dynamic because it gets less of its sales from food than rival Walmart, which draws about 60% of its U.S. sales from groceries. That compares to roughly 20% at Target.\n\nInflation cooled slightly in April, but the consumer price index was still up 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. The key measure gauges how much goods and services cost at the cash register.\n\nTarget acknowledged that challenge with this week‚Äôs price cuts. \n\nThe company is also competing with other discounters, including Walmart, Aldi and Lidl, that are chasing deal-hunting shoppers.\n\nWalmart, for example, has gained market share from higher-income shoppers and recently introduced a premium food brand with most items under $5. The company‚Äôs CFO John David Rainey also said last week that customers are turning to its grocery aisles for cheaper meals because of the rising prices of fast food.\n\nTarget‚Äôs sales challenges\n\nIn Target‚Äôs first quarter, customer traffic, which includes online and stores, fell 1.9%. The average amount that customers spent on those visits dropped 1.9%, too.\n\nDigital sales grew 1.4%. It marked the first increase in digital sales in more than a year.\n\nComparable sales, also called same-store sales, tumbled 3.7%, as shoppers bought beauty items but less of other discretionary categories like apparel and home. That decline was in line with what analysts expected, according to StreetAccount.\n\nDiscretionary merchandise wasn‚Äôt the only part of the store under pressure. Sales in frequency categories, food and beverage and beauty and household essentials, declined by low-single digits, Chief Growth Officer Christina Hennington said on a call with reporters.\n\nStill, Hennington said Target is seeing some encouraging trends compared to recent quarters. Sales of apparel improved by nearly 4 percentage points from the fiscal fourth quarter, as customers bought outfits for spring.\n\nShe said Target‚Äôs limited-time collection with Diane Von Furstenberg drove millions of unique visits to the retailer‚Äôs website each day of the launch week and lifted the size of customers‚Äô baskets by around 15% on average.\n\nOther unique items also drove spending, she said. They included its partnership with tennis and lifestyle brand Prince to sell pickleball gear and Taylor Swift‚Äôs latest album, which Target capitalized on with in-store events and photo ops.\n\nShares of Target closed Tuesday at $155.78, bringing its market value to $72.07 billion. As of Tuesday‚Äôs close, shares of Target are up about 9% so far this year, lagging the S&P 500‚Ä≤s nearly 12% gains.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/target-tgt-q1-2024-earnings.html", "id": "1cxx28c", "created_utc": 1716374054.0, "score": 309, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "And this my friends is how inflation goes down", "score": 391, "replies": [{"body": "It's true.

{"title": "Amazon plans to give Alexa an AI overhaul ‚Äî and a monthly subscription price ", "selftext": "Amazon is upgrading its decade-old Alexa voice assistant with generative artificial intelligence and plans to charge a monthly subscription fee to offset the cost of the technology, according to people with knowledge of Amazon‚Äôs plans. \n\nThe Seattle-based tech and retail giant will launch a more conversational version of Alexa later this year, potentially positioning it to better compete with new generative AI-powered chatbots from companies including Google and OpenAI, according to two sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Amazon‚Äôs subscription for Alexa will not be included in the $139 per year Prime offering, and Amazon has not yet nailed down the price point, one source said.\n\nAmazon declined to comment on its plans for Alexa. \n\nWhile Amazon wowed consumers with Alexa‚Äôs voice-driven tasks in 2014, its capabilities could seem old-fashioned amid recent leaps in artificial intelligence. Last week, OpenAI announced GPT-4o, with the capability for two-way conversations that can go significantly deeper than Alexa. For example, it can translate conversations into different languages in real time. Google launched a similar generative-AI-powered voice feature for Gemini. \n\nSome interpreted last week‚Äôs announcements as a threat to Alexa and Siri, Apple‚Äôs voice assistant feature for iPhones. NYU professor Scott Galloway called the updates the ‚ÄúAlexa and Siri killers‚Äù on his recent podcast. Many people use Alexa and Siri for basic tasks, such as setting timers or alarms and announcing the weather.\n\nThe development of new AI chatbots in recent months has increased the pressure internally on a division that was once seen as a darling of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the sources ‚Äî but has been subject to strict profit imperatives since his departure. \n\nThree former employees pointed to Bezos‚Äô early obsession with Alexa, describing it as the Amazon founder‚Äôs passion project. Attention from Bezos resulted in more dollars and less pressure to make a return on those dollars immediately.\n\nThat changed when Andy Jassy took over as CEO in 2021, according to three sources. Jassy was charged with right-sizing Amazon‚Äôs business during the pandemic, and Alexa became less of a priority internally, they said. Jassy has been privately underwhelmed with what modern-day Alexa is capable of, according to one person. The Alexa team worried they had invented an expensive alarm clock, weather machine and way to play Spotify music, one source said.  \n\nFor instance, Jassy, an avid sports fan, asked the voice-assistant the live score of a recent game, according to a person in the room, and was openly frustrated that Alexa didn‚Äôt know an answer that was so easy to find online. \n\nWhen reached for comment, Amazon pointed to the company‚Äôs annual shareholder letter released last month. In it, Jassy mentioned that the company was building a ‚Äúsubstantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business,‚Äù adding that that included ‚Äúan even more intelligent and capable Alexa.‚Äù\n\nThe team is now tasked with turning Alexa into a relevant device that holds up amid the new AI competition, and one that justifies the resources and headcount Amazon has dedicated to it. It has undergone a massive reorganization, with much of the team shifting to the artificial general intelligence, or AGI, team, according to three sources. Others pointed to bloat within Alexa, a team of thousands of employees.\n\nAs of 2023, Amazon said it had sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, giving the company a foothold with consumers. \n\nAlexa, were you too early?\n\nApple, Amazon and Google were early movers with their voice assistants, which did employ AI. But the current wave of advanced generative AI enables much more creative, human-sounding interactions. Apple is expected to unveil a more conversational Siri at its annual developers conference in June, according to the New York Times. \n\nThose who worked on the Alexa team describe it as a great idea that may have been too early, and that it‚Äôs going to be hard to turn the ship around. \n\nThere‚Äôs also the challenge of finding AI engineering talent, as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google recruit from the same pool of academics and tech talent. Plus, generative AI workloads are expensive thanks to the hardware and computing power required. One source estimated the cost of using generative AI in Alexa at 2 cents per query, and said a $20 price point was floated internally. Another suggested it would need to be in a single digit dollar amount, which would undercut other subscription offerings. OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT charges $20 per month for its advanced models. \n\nStill, they point to Alexa‚Äôs installed user base, with devices in hundreds of millions of homes, as an opportunity. Those who worked on Alexa say the fact that it‚Äôs already in people‚Äôs living rooms and kitchens makes the stakes higher, and mistakes more costly if Alexa doesn‚Äôt understand a command or provides unreliable information. \n\nAmazon has been battling a perception that it‚Äôs behind in artificial intelligence. While it offers multiple AI models on AWS, it does not have a leading large language model to unseat OpenAI, Google or Meta. Amazon spent $2.75 billion backing AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment in the company‚Äôs three-decade history. Google also has an Anthropic investment and partnership.\n\nAmazon will use its own large language model, Titan, in the Alexa upgrade, according to a source.  \n\nBezos is among those who have voiced concern that Amazon is behind in AI, according to two sources familiar with him. Bezos is still ‚Äúvery involved‚Äù in Amazon‚Äôs AI efforts, CNBC reported last week, and has been sending Amazon executives emails wondering why certain AI startups are picking other cloud providers over AWS. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/amazon-plans-to-give-alexa-an-ai-overhaul-monthly-subscription-price.html", "id": "1cxzyrt", "created_utc": 1716383717.0, "score": 172, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "I would never pay even $1/mo for Alexa.", "score": 332, "replies": [{"body": "I wouldn't even have Alexa if they paid me.

Now they say that a ten for one split stock is going to happen, and it happens when it was just trading at $100. There is now an additional nine shares released for each share already existing as issued shares, the shares that are held by people that are not the company. So, because there are more shares now in existence, each share loses value. In this case, someone who owns one $100 share will receive nine new shares for a total of ten shares.

With more manufacturing experience and more/larger facilities, major automakers are going to be gobbling up that Tesla market share through higher quality and more refined vehicles. Keep in mind that we are now beyond the \"early adopter\" phase, where early adopters are much more likely to be OK with fit and finish issues and bugs, now electric vehicles are mainstream. The people now buying electric vehicles expect the same fit and finish as their ICE vehicles and also are more likely to be brand loyal.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Rivian? Lucid? Fisker?

If you sell a call at $24 and tomorrow it opens at $34 you've lost $10/contract. Unrealized losses are still losses.\n\nYou don't get to ignore unrealized losses just because you don't feel like it. Entire hedge funds have been liquidated by unrealized losses from selling calls that never went ITM. The broker liquidated them because as the unrealized losses mounted, their margin requirements to maintain the short call increased until they have no liquidity left.\n\nYou need to spend some more time educating yourself about how options work. I suggest this highly relevant and funny video from Benjamin about how a hedge fund went bust selling calls that never went ITM.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGNRIRoG9mI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGNRIRoG9mI)\n\ntldr: unrealized losses are still losses.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "His whole theory \"NVDA‚Äôs fat margins are under pressure\"\n\nand NVDA reported almost 80% margin\n\nlol", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Someone mentioned guidance is for lower margins, so not exactly wrong on that count", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "990C.
