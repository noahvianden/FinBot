Yes Apple has declining revenue and IPhone sales are down but that is more an Apple specific problem then a sign of the economy. \n\nEveryone already knew Tesla earnings would be shite, they are a highly interest rate sensitive stock and will continue to struggle until interest rates are cut. \n\nAmazon had great earnings, all their different business segments are growing just fine and they barely guided revenue down, which they will most likely beat. \n\nMeta had the same deal as Amazon and smashed their earnings estimates and barely guided down on revenue.

I usually ignore YouTubers because their opinions are no more valid than the endless opinions I can find here on Reddit. However, in this case I recognized the location in the video. Irrelevant but interesting to me so I watched for a second.\n\nThe guy seemed rational, knowledgeable, and interesting so I gave him a chance and watched the whole thing. In the end my instincts were correct, nothing but more opinion. Sad, I was hoping for more.\n\nSad but I did have a couple realizations during the video. Not because of what's in the video but because of what isn't there. Metadata, you might call it. I thought others might appreciate that metadata so I came back here to post it.\n\nIn the video he rattles on about how bad it is for Tesla to reduce their Supercharger staff. How so many future contracts will be cancelled, the loss of expertise, loss of trust, gain for the competitors, blah, blah, blah. That's called Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. It's a survival instinct our human brains use to keep us focused on something scary that we don't really understand. It not information, it's our brain warning us there's something we doesn't understand and it might be a threat. Once we understand the subject, if it's not a threat, suddenly it is dismissed so we can focus on the next thing. In other words, bad news gets us riled up, good news is boring. Seems obvious right. But knowing this doesn't magically make you immune. It's how our brains work. Bad news keeps us engaged, good news is boring. I'm sorry but this is about to get boring.\n\nThat location in the video used to be crowded all the time yet in the video he was the only one there. You can see and hear the busy freeway (I-70 north of Denver) in the background. For many miles in either direction, including two largish cities, plenty of cars in need of charging yet he's the only one there. A beautiful day like that, this place would typically be crowded. Where is everyone? \n\nI guarantee the guy in the video knows even though he doesn't mention it. Everyone is at the brand new, much larger Buckees a few miles down the road. It's kind of a spectacle to people around here. I wouldn't be surprised if the new location is mentioned or shown in one of his other videos. The location in this video is nothing but a hotel parking lot (with the only bathroom around). The new Buckee's has plenty of bathrooms, food, more food, and all the stuff that comes with Buckee's. It's not just a boring parking lot, it's a destination. If you've been to a Buckee's, you know what I mean.\n\nWhy is that relevant? Because we're talking about Tesla cutting a large part of their Supercharger staff. The conclusion (based on opinions, not facts) by many is that cutting staff is a sign that Tesla is weak. They made a mistake to cut stuff. Growth, not cuts, that's a sign of strength.\n\nI'd like to propose that maybe these things have some momentum. That Buckee's down the road didn't just overnight. They build them fast but in this context the word fast is probably about two years minimum. That's two years from the first moment someone says \"we should build another one\" until it is open for business. That includes site selection, corporate approval, financing, designs, land-use studies, government permits, utility company permits, construction contracts, all before anything is actually built. Two years would be very fast.\n\nTwo years ago, where were you early May 2022? TSLA was in the $250 range. The all-time high had been only six months prior. Nobody was talking about slowing demand, everyone was talking about trying to keep up with explosive grown. People at the location in the video were probably upset at having to wait in line. Nobody was talking about \"weakening demand for EVs\".\n\nNow let's imagine that Tesla didn't just reduce their Supercharger staff. Instead they kept going full speed ahead even after so many other manufacturers have scaled back or canceled their EV plans. Two years from now there'd be a ton of unused Superchargers everywhere. People would be like \"Look at all the empty chargers, what a waste, nobody wanted those. It looks to me like Tesla is nowhere near their projected demand.\"\n\nIf you think future Cybertruck owners are going to sue Tesla, you have every right to that opinion. I'm not going to argue with you, in fact I agree that there will be lawsuits. With a company like Tesla, there are always lawsuits. I'm not a huge fan of Elon but in this case, any competent CEO would also ignore potential lawsuits and make the correct business decision to reduce staff. Although maybe a little more delicately and privately than how Elon does it.\n\nMy opinion, which is just another useless opinion on Reddit, is that Tesla did the correct thing, laid off the appropriate portion of the staff, and is still moving forward as fast as ever but in a slightly different direction than before.\n\nDon't worry, I'm sure future Cybertruck owners will have plenty of ways to charge their vehicle.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Have you seen the email to contractors, there was no plan here.

In a house it works well because you get one for each vehicle, they are cheap, and you never have to worry about jockeying cars around for charging. But in an apartment complex, someone would park their car, plug it in, then go in for the evening. Once the car is charged, the charging capacity is taken up because people are not moving their cars. This is why charging works in places like grocery stores - the turnover allows the capacity to roll over.

The description suggests that the Guadi 3 emits a floral aroma that is likely to be soothing and generally well-received in most settings, making it the most universally acceptable choice.\n2. **MI300x**: Ranked second, the MI300x is described as having a smell reminiscent of¬†**farts**. While this is certainly not a traditionally pleasant scent, it may be less offensive to some people compared to the smell of rotten eggs. The decision to place it above the H100 is based on the general consensus that, while both are unpleasant, the smell of farts may be considered more tolerable or less intense than the smell of rotten eggs in certain contexts.\n3. **H100**: Placed last in the ranking, the H100 is said to have a¬†**rotten egg smell**, which is often caused by hydrogen sulfide, a compound known for its distinctive and highly offensive odor. This type of smell is commonly associated with decay and is generally considered one of the most disagreeable scents. It‚Äôs likely to be perceived as more intrusive and unpleasant than the MI300x‚Äôs odor, leading to its position at the bottom of the list.\n\nThe ranking is based on the assumption that the intensity and persistence of the odors are similar across all three products. It‚Äôs also important to note that these assessments are made based on societal norms regarding scents and the descriptions provided.

I‚Äôll also use round numbers to make the math easy for you regards.\n\nIf $NVDA is at $900 and I think it will close somewhere around there by the end of the day, I can do four basic things. There‚Äôs so many other strategies that could be used, but here‚Äôs the basics:\n\nBuy a $950 put and sell a $925 put. (A)\nSell a $850 put and buy a $875 put. (B)\n\nBuy an $850 call and sell an $875 call. (C)\nSell an $925 call and buy an $950 call. (D)\n\nAll four of these are called vertical spreads because the options are the same expiration date, same type (call or put), and differ only in the strike price (one above the other, hence the name vertical). Each one has a $25 difference in strike price.\n\nI‚Äôll start with (C) because it‚Äôs probably the easiest for crayon eaters to understand.\n\nGenerally you want to buy low and sell high if you‚Äôre long a position. Or, conversely sell high and buy low if you‚Äôre short.\n\nIf I buy the $850 call that means I‚Äôm buying the stock at $850. Obviously that‚Äôs a good deal because the stock is already at $900 and I think it will stay there. Since the stock is at $900 and I‚Äôm buying it for $850, the intrinsic value of the $850 call is $50. But obviously someone is going to want me to pay them a premium for me getting that kind of a $50 off deal, and that premium gets added on based on a lot of things: how long until the option expires, the volatility of $NVDA, etc. That extra premium is what makes the $850 call cost more than $50.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo to offset that cost, I‚Äôm going to sell someone my stock that I bought at $850. I will do this by selling them an $875 call. Just like the $850, the intrinsic value is $25 because whoever buys it from me can buy my stock that I sell them for $875 and sell it at $900. But they‚Äôll have to pay me a premium as well, so I‚Äôll get more than the $25 to just flip the stock. Since I‚Äôm selling this option, I will be getting paid. I won‚Äôt get paid as much as what I had to spend on the $850 call, but I will at least have something to offset my cost.\n\nThis difference in what I paid and what I get paid is not going to be very much. But, if I‚Äôm willing to risk the $25 (that I could potentially lose if $NVDA drops to $850 and my call option becomes worthless), then that means it‚Äôs like free cash. I‚Äôm buying the stock for $850, selling it for $875 and only have to pay (hypothetically) $24.50 for the deal.\n\nThere is a certain type of person to whom this will appeal. Risking $2,500 to make $50 probably doesn‚Äôt sound appealing. But if I‚Äôm x% certain that it‚Äôs going to close around $900, then I don‚Äôt really think about it as ‚Äúrisking $2,500‚Äù so much as ‚Äúrisking 100-x% that an event y will happen at time z.‚Äù\n\nEither way, this is a debit spread because I‚Äôm paying $24.50 for the deal hoping it will be worth $25 by the close.\n\nOn the other hand, with a strategy like (A) I‚Äôm buying the higher put and selling the lower, and just collecting the premium difference between the two prices (maybe it‚Äôs $0.35). If $NVDA explodes to the upside those puts I bought are going to lose value much faster than the ones I sold, so I could end up having to buy them back for the max difference of $25. But if it doesn‚Äôt, then I just get to keep the $0.35 (x100) for selling the spread. This is why this is called a credit spread rather than a debit spread because I‚Äôm not paying the $2500 up front (although your broker would almost certainly still hold it in the liability that it did blow up and you lost everything).\n\nThe other two strategies are similar, and which one you deploy depends on the implied volatility pricing that goes into calls vs. puts, which ones are the best deal, and the probability that the stock might actually move up or down away from $900.\n\nThis is an income strategy because it‚Äôs not purely dependent on the direction that $NVDA goes in but will be profitable either way; it‚Äôs very popular with stocks that are lower volatility because they‚Äôre more predictable and don‚Äôt move as much, but also you get less premium from it too.\n\nObviously it can go very wrong very fast if you‚Äôre risking something like $25,000 to make $500 on a consistent basis, so risk management is key.\n\nSeveral good strategies for this usually begin about 45 days out and then close the position 20 days away from expiry.\n\nIt can also be deployed on a daily basis with SPY 0dte options which lose value very quickly later in the day. Usually you would want to close the position out after a p% gain rather than hold them to the end of the day, but if you don‚Äôt get bothered by some of those sharp late day moves then you can hold it for the full premium, but statistically your risk goes up when you do.\n\nTLDR: There is no TLDR.

Lots of news dwell around QQQ every single day. Even world conflicts like breaking news on Israel-Iran will cause QQQ to pump up a lot or dump like crazy. Fed Speeches that happens during market hours could cause QQQ to spike up or dip so much just like Neel Kashkari (apparently he's speaking on Tuesday, 5/7 at 11:30am EST so that's one thing to add to a list of events). \n\nTake advantage of Jpow speeches on FOMC meetings. His next FOMC speech is on June 12. It's always at 2:30pm EST. I made $1.67k from his speech as you could see in my photo, but honestly, that would have been $14k+ if I held on longer while he's speaking. But, I'm used to just taking 20-30% profit and walking away. \n\nA lot of those profit days in the photo could have easily been $1k+, but like I said, I take 20-30% and just stop trading.

Lesson costed me 72% of my gains, leaving me with only $1.5k profit besides my account fund. \n\nSo yeah. I take a lot of time reading news and preparing for events.
