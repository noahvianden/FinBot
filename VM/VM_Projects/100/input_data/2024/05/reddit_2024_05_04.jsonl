{"title": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cut Apple investment by about 13%", "selftext": "Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway cut its gigantic Apple stake in the first quarter as the “Oracle of Omaha” continued to downsize his one-time favorite bet.\n\nIn its first-quarter earnings report, Berkshire Hathaway reported that its Apple bet was worth $135.4 billion, implying around 790 million shares. That would mark a decline of around 13% in the stake. Apple was still Berkshire’s biggest holding by far at the end of the quarter.\n\nThis is the second quarter in a row that the Omaha-based conglomerate has trimmed the stake in the iPhone maker. It sold about 10 million Apple shares (just 1% of its massive stake) in the fourth quarter. This filing, when accounting for the change in Apple’s stock price, would imply Berkshire sold about 116 million shares.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha became a big fan of Apple after one of his investing managers Ted Weschler or Todd Combs convinced him to buy the stock. Buffett even called the tech giant his second-most important business after Berkshire’s cluster of insurers.\n\nMany has speculated that the 93-year-old investing icon reduced his favorite stake due to valuation concerns. Apple’s stock gained a whopping 48% in 2023 as megacap tech shares led the market rally. At its peak, Apple ballooned in Berkshire’s equity portfolio, taking up 50% of it. The shares are trading at more than 27 times forward earnings.\n\nShares of the iPhone maker got a big boost in the past week after the firm announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in company history. However, Apple posted a decline in overall sales and in iPhone sales. The shares are down more than 4% so far this year amid concerns about how it will revive growth.\n\nIt’s not without precedent that the Berkshire CEO would adjust the Apple bet. He sold a bit of the stock in the fourth quarter of 2020, but Buffett admitted then that it was “probably a mistake.” Also it’s not usual for Buffett to trim a position that has grown so large.\n\nEven with the sale, Berkshire is still Apple’s largest shareholder outside of exchange-traded fund providers.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/04/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-cut-apple-investment-by-about-13percent-in-the-first-quarter.html", "id": "1cjze2n", "created_utc": 1714826348.0, "score": 1176, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 241, "comments": [{"body": "must be a block trade with Apple, under the buy back process", "score": 507, "replies": [{"body": "Explains the 110b buyback.

The statement is an absolute and that's not accurate. A block trade CAN be done privately arranged. However, remember the UNDERLYING is traded on the RTH exchanges and the trade price WILL reflect the relative spread EVEN IF the party/counter-party are making the trade privately. \n\nMost block trades happen throughout the day and you never even see them. They're right there in the bid/ask. \n\nNot just that these types of trades often result in floors/ceilings in price temporarily.  This is perfectly normal.  There's nothing wrong with organizing counter-parties or making these trades in blocks at specific price ranges. The resulting action reduces overall beta for that instrument in the short term and provides market stability. \n\nThe difference if they just slammed SELL x10MM would be a huge market impact driving down price aggressively against the actual respected market value of the asset which would cause chaos to all other market participants and would be unduly disruptive to standard market fairness. It would be manipulation. \n\nWhen execs sell huge chunks of stocks they do so through blocks that they don't control in order to avoid market manipulation. This is the proper way. \n\nYou can walk through a few examples but here's one...\n\nSay I want to sell 10MM shares outstanding but I restrict my price to $100. Know what happens? The market stays at $100 until I'm done. I'm not willing to sell at $100.5. Just $100. So IF price breaks above, any buyers after easily get liquidated on any push back to $100 which immediately gets slammed with my existing sell orders at $100 and until I'm done the stock doesn't move. That's incredibly disruptive at scale. If you're doing 1,000 shares of something like AAPL it's fine. But 10MM scales horribly. Similarly on the flip side... Anyone with a brain is knowing that I'm selling at $100 so they're buying ANYTHING below that because they know there's supply wanting to sell AT $100 and it pins upward too. \n\nBy using blocks, discretely, they can average several areas of ranges without impacting the market price by absorbing knowing large liquidity looking for a counter-party. \n\nNext, even if traded OTC OR ETH it's still an open market.

Skip to pages 8-9 if you are short on time.\n\nThe gist is that (real) returns come from the following sources: dividends, valuation changes, and real earnings growth. To repeat last decade's returns, you either have to see the US demonstrate *exceptional* earnings growth (say 6-8% *real* earnings growth) AND still see major multiple expansion. Is this possible? Sure. Is it likely? \n\n> If we are even more optimistic and assume\n6% real earnings growth, which is roughly\nthe best ever outcome over a 10-year period\nduring normal, non-recessionary times, the\nmarket would still need to trade at all-time-\nhigh valuations (CAPE of 51) to match the last\ndecade’s excess-of-cash performance.\n\nThe TL;DR:\n\n> Here is the rub: to forecast a repeat\nperformance from equity markets, you\nmust forecast earnings growth at levels\nunprecedented in a non-recession economy\nand the market to trade at its richest level ever\nat the end of the decade. While it’s impossible\nto rule out this scenario, it is an implausible\nbaseline assumption.\n\nYes, revenue/profits and the like will continue to rise. The question is how much is already priced in and how that will impact your future returns. There are some tailwinds from the past decade like relatively low corporate taxes / tax cuts, abnormally cheap energy (due to the shale revolution), QE reducing interest expenses, etc. that may not always be in play.

Simply put you used to get the presidency or any other government role by printing money in a way that caused Americans to think you were doing good and the wealth gap expansion is just a natural process.\n\nNow Washington DC has doubled down on spending in order to help the incumbents at the poles and it's not doing anything. You can't just adjust the inflation number or formula and play pretend. Whenever I argue with bulls they use new inflation numbers to skew data but you don't really need to. We all can tell it's bullshit. The method to get to office or stay in office was printing money. Soon enough the candidate to combat inflation WILL be the one to win. Once that's the narrative, the recession will take root and the market will be priced accurately without all the artifical price increases. It's bearish for the fact that it's repriced lower and that alone. \n\nUnfortunately the bulls have this side scenario where Washington DC triples downs or quadrupled down etc. Hyperinflation or permanent higher inflation. I can't take that stance. I can see people still elect dumbasses to DC even with high inflation, but 100% whoever crashed the market from Hyperinflation will take office.\n\nThe fact that I am open to a crash in either direction has helped my trading immensely BTW. Final note, in the case of Hyperinflation, the S&P is probably undervalued right now, but bears don't want to hear that lol. Just know in times of uncertainty the market goes up on most days. Even if it's flat for the year it goes down fast and violent on very few days.

{"title": "Attempting An Earnings Play Marathon", "selftext": "Have you ever dreamed of taking your small portfolio to over multiple six figures in just one trading week? Let me be honest with you up front, the chances of either of us executing and getting correct every directional play are extremely low. I’m currently down 95k this year and have dreams of making my money back. \n\n\nI have allocated 25k to my Robinhood account for this challenge. Yes, i see the irony that gambling on earnings plays have gotten me into a deep hole. Yoloing on earnings got me in, and Yoloing can potentially get me out! If you want to follow my journey this next week save this post. \n\nLet’s be honest with ourselves here, there is only one way to make a lot of money in one week and that is to gamble. No strangles or straddles, just calls or puts and hold overnight and pray. We sell the next morning at open and prepare to yolo again if we don’t blow up. \n\nThe most important thing when attempting an earnings marathon is having your plan and sticking to it. If you don’t execute your plan, you will get to the end of the week and wonder “why” you didn’t buy those contracts and hold them after close.   This doesn’t mean you’re correct in your play. It just means you have the balls to see it through. I was planning on doing this earnings marathon this past week and looking at the simplest method to achieve the goal I believe i would have pulled it off if i would have committed. The problem was I got scared and didn’t pull the trigger. \n\nI have made peace with the fact that I’m going to lose this money in an attempt to recover substantial losses.
