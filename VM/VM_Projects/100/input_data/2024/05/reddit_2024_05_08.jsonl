The reasoning is that when these products are sold, the writers hedge their risk using the underlying index which is increasingly based on S&P. In the process known as dynamic hedging, dealers buy when price goes down and sell when it goes up which effectively dampens price behavior.\r\n Since the value of these options are directly influenced by volatility, the sale of autocallables is increased during times of lower volatility, and autocallable sales dampen volatility, a self sustaining feedback loop is created that make the sale of autocallables more attractive as more are sold. However, when volatility increases, it increases the likelihood of the underlying asset hitting the specified price, the frequency of coupon payments are effected, and the overall risk profile of the product changes.

As an example, when GM went bankrupt, they had over 200 different part numbers for “horn” assemblies.  That is mind-blowing.  It is like a mess of spaghetti when you think about all of the engineering diagrams, and also the overlap of design.  So picture you have some issue where a screw hole is having fatigue fracture after a few years in one specific part of the horn assembly. Stuff like this is very common in newer designs for example.  You literally learn by trial and error.  Then the engineers really study the hell out of what is going on, and make a version 2 with the modifications.  At Toyota they only had 2 models of horn assembly, so when you fix a problem like this, at absolute most, you only have to fix it in 2 different part numbers.  But at GM depending on the design overlap, you may have to redesign hundreds of different assemblies.  It is a literal nightmare.  You would have so many updates to do, you would literally have to have a gigantic team of engineers overhauling all of these horn assemblies.  There is no way around that short of just not making replacement parts for your vehicles, which would be like a nuclear bomb blowing your brand value to pieces. \n\nOver a product life-cycle, you will literally have potentially dozens (or more) revisions to the part diagrams. Meaning you keep learning from little mistakes, failures in production, and manufacturing inefficiencies (meaning parts that are hard to build) and you redesign them to be easier to build.  And then a company that is doing things “very well” like Toyota is like “Holy Shit!  That horn assembly right there… we have revised that design 100 times, and it is literally absolute perfection.  We can build that thing to 6 sigma reliability where you have fewer than 3.4 defects per million. This is like the holy grail!”\n\nThe key being that it takes a tremendous amount of effort and revising to get a product to that level of maturity.  Lots of money, and lots of hard work.\n\nBut this is where the Tesla advantage comes in\n\nSee, by Tesla mostly having no buttons or switches, they eliminate at bare minimum dozens of parts and wiring assemblies, and Assembly Instructions for assemblers, or assembly coding for robots, that all have to go through these product revision processes.  And there is a huge economic moat for Tesla in this regard, because they started it this way pretty much from the beginning.  So the cars have mostly been designed for well over a decade now with none of this.  Yet for Toyota to compete on this, or Ford, Honda, GM, Stellantis, all of them, they have to take their holy grail button/wiring/connector designs, that have gone through literally 100s of revisions, and possibly 10s or 100s of thousands of engineering man hours to get them to this stage, and chunk them in the trash, and redesign everything.  This would cause a reliability problem in the vehicles which would tarnish the brands in the interim.  And this is a massive advantage. So while Tesla did all of this stuff right from the beginning and built everything with this focus on efficiency of design and manufacturing, these others are doing everything the same, because “If it ain’t broke, not only don’t fix it, but please don’t take all of the engineers 1000s of hours, throw them in the trash and make us start from scratch again”\n\nAnd the cherry on top of all of this, is that if you build a button on the side of a seat in a regular car for example, and people bitch about it in car reviews like “I think it’s kind of hard to reach this button. It should be next to the steering wheel” - from an engineering perspective, that is like “Oh my god, we have to redesign the whole fucking seat and dash.” Because when you move a switch panel, all the interior of the seat has to be moved around. Same on the dash. All the wiring assemblies have to be carefully routed through ridiculously cramped spaces, and assemblers have to have AI (assembly instructions) to tell them how to do all of it.  So all that has to be redone.  On a Tesla, if someone thinks its confusing to adjust something, you just send an update over wifi to the UI.  Almost like magic.  All the cars are just fixed probably by one or two software guys writing the code to fix it.  Compare those two from a cost perspective.  THIS is one huge reason why Tesla is kicking ass on the net margins.", "id": "1cnbci2", "created_utc": 1715192055.0, "score": 114, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 149, "comments": [{"body": "That's a lot about buttons.  But I think it's more than buttons.  \n\n\nI think it's the systemic way that Tesla integrates everything in to everything with the whole car being a whole system all tied together in software.   Using the drive units as coolant/battery/car heaters. Using the battery pack as a thermal storage bank for the whole car. The Octovalve/Supermanifold that can move heat around in 15 different modes. The liquid cooled MCU/FSD/Audio amplifier that puts that waste heat in to the main pack. Turn up the radio, it doesn't matter, that energy is recycled to heat the battery.  Yeah, this has a liquid cooled Ryzen, that heats the battery pack.  And that heat can be heat pumped to the cabin. The 5 pound 7 amp hour lithium ion low voltage battery that has its own micro controller communicating to the main car computer so its charge can ultimately be regulated by the power conversion system. Everyone else is using 30-40 pound dumb blocks of lead acid batteries from 100 years ago!  The software defined motor controllers that measure the amps to the window motors so it knows the motor load and can reverse a window to detect a pinch. Every part is doing multiple jobs.  And since the controller is software it can do a table lookup to compensate for ambient temp and not nuisance reverse on a cold day.  They measure how much resistance the air conditioning blower is under. When you turn off climate, it RECUPERATES THE HVAC BLOWER MOTOR ENERGY in to the low voltage system as it stops the blower motor from spinning.  Because they can, and because it's cool, and because it stops the blower motor very quickly. Who else does that?!  They calculate the thermal watts of evaporator load based on ambient temp/dew point.  The fact that the cars go out and silently update a Tesla wall charger plugged in over the charger lines. The fact that over the air updates are all the time and rarely ever cause problems. The fact that every seat adjustment looks at car interior temp, and causes a real time temperature variable to be calculated for the seat motor to prevent it from being over used and burning out. And that Tesla owns the software to every single chip on every single subsystem in the entire car and can always make it work together in ways that other OEMs could never dream of doing.  That's Tesla's advantage. They are a vehicle software company.  They went to 42 volts, because they could.  \n\nAuto high beams? That's not a separate system, that's FSD. Adaptive high beams were to work through the same system. Lines of code in FSD. Auto wipers (ok, ok, bad example) and canceling turn signals?  All FSD software.  It's all software integration.

When a company buys the raw materials to build a car, they go straight to the balance sheet as an asset (not yet a cost or \"capitalized\").

At that point, Auotpilot couldn't even distinguish between red and green traffic lights.  It was left to Elon's cousin James to quickly implement a solution.

Does that progress cancel out the fraud?\n\nIf I secure enough investment money by lying to actually build a product that works, was fraud committed? Personally, I'd still say yes, even if investors end up doing really well, since they unknowingly took a risk, which could have ended very poorly, like Theranos investors.\n\nTo me, FSD has been making serious progress, but it is still just active driver assistance. it isn't anywhere close to being able to drive without a driver. It tried to run a red light during Elon's live drive on X through Silicon Valley. So, even though it has been getting better, I think it is still solidly \"terrible\" in that you'd likely crash, and potentially severely in just a few hours of using it. \n\nWith seven years and billions of dollars invested in FSD, you'd expect Tesla's autonomous driving capabilities to be well beyond what was achieved in 2016. Even though the video was faked, if investors did well and the technology performs better than what was portrayed in 2016, you'd have some mitigating factors.

The lots were always full of H2's and super duty trucks. Their employees were raking in enough dough these guys would spend 2hours at lunches every single day. Then the crash happened, and those trucks disappeared. Most of those guys went BK, the spec homes they built were sitting unsold, some rotting, some never completed. The ripple effect went all the way to the hispanics who moved into the town to help build. The housing market was a wasteland, and many people I knew went personally BK, some took their lives, most lost all of their jet skis, boats, nice cars, homes, and they had to figure out how to live without.

The reason? BS articles like this are being spread by the news that misattributes ARM's increase in pricing to the AI boom (of which it has no relation):\n\n[https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsmc-morgan-stanley-hikes-pt-on-arm-ai-cpu-boost-3426842](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsmc-morgan-stanley-hikes-pt-on-arm-ai-cpu-boost-3426842)\n\nNormies eat this shit up and if SPY ain't peaking in the morning we're going to see a decrease or flat market at best bleeding into Friday. \n\nCall/Put skew further shows that traders are consolidating at $900 into the pre-pre-earnings week:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3wfjhk9dbazc1.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4fa3ea1fa1878a5ee298e5b16d03b5a6a80a9d1\n\n[https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/VolatilitySkew/](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/VolatilitySkew/)\n\nThe gist of this is that if we have really good news, NVDA could hit $920 but with poor market news could hit a bottom of $875 by this Friday.\n\nWith VIX (a measure of market volatility, which measures fear) being below 16 and hovering around 13, Market Makers are likely to feed into trends and buy dips so this is bullish in the market overall.\n\n# May 13-17th: the slight recovery then deep decline\n\nHeading into next week we are likely to see a recovery in price from the dip this week followed by a decline preceding earnings the following week. Why? Hedging. Wall Street as well as some retail investors are aware that the previous guidances issues were made under completely different macroeconomic expectations. \n\nPreviously we were under the assumption that 3 rate cuts were coming whilst now only 1 possibly? The result is a drop in price akin to the previous earnings cycle but worse, given the poor earnings we've seen from fellow semiconductor manufacturers. \n\nThe previous earnings cycle was actually positive across the board and what did we see?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3j7wvaqdazc1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f638b22d3b0eb198b7d9237993892b15121bd0\n\nRoughly a $75 decline in share price during the week preceding earnings. And this was off of good news in the market. We could see the price hit sub-800 if everyone cashes out all at once in this week, if previous market behavior is anything to go off of.\n\nDepending on CPI on Wednesday and Jobless Claims on Thursday this could be mediated but we shall see. The likely range is 845-895 based on previous volatility around earnings.\n\n# May 20-22nd: Earnings END-GAME\n\nNvidia will most likely continue it's drop from the previous week but this isn't a problem for us. Why? Because we know NVDA is the shit. I mean it truly is in another league of it's own. It quite literally is the industry standard that only those on the know are aware of. Their platform is what pretty much everyone who trains AI is using and will continue to use due to how optimized it is.\n\nWe're talking about the comparison of an iPhone in 2008 to a flimsy flip phone. It's just so much more advanced that they are crushing the competition. This is why regardless of AMD, INTC, SMCI, all of their failures, NVDA will absolutely crush EPS, Revenue, and Guidance. \n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-is-nvidia-what-do-they-make-ai-artificial-intelligence-rcna140171](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/what-is-nvidia-what-do-they-make-ai-artificial-intelligence-rcna140171)\n\nThey are the backbone of all AI training models right now and as it stands, no one is even close to touching them. Thus they will destroy expectations and rebound to even higher highs than Wall Street has expectations for due to their monopoly-like control of the industry. Barring a world war or FTC intervention, there is no way this stock can go down.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "1cniy8t", "created_utc": 1715211444.0, "score": 622, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 365 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18t0m69/nio_dd_bullish/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18nuia3/roblox_dd_bullish_regrettably/) \n**Account Age** | 9 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/i61wump4kazc1.jpeg?width=274&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=924607db506406f03840263ca1f9e45ebc93633e\n\nYou see baby my calls will go up, dont worry we didnt need that car anyways", "score": 392, "replies": [{"body": "You'll never afford a car with funds like that.", "score": 83, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Stfu 🤡", "score": -6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I’m dying , I’m legit dying 😭😭😭😂😂😂", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Someone come help this man before he dies 😢", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "She’s underaged", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Buying calls", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "He calls her baby for a reason", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "TLDR: it might go up, but it might also go down", "score": 172, "replies": [{"body": "Puts on sideways", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Probably sell those puts", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You think OP is secretly talking about investments in the former Austrian currency **“Schilling”** ?  \n![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The longer the texts, the more confident that convinces me to do the opposite", "score": 127, "replies": [{"body": "Another bro did a lengthy one on ARM saying it will drop post earnings.
