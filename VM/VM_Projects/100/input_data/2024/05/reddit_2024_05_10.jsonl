You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "1colg2i", "created_utc": 1715333410.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": ">(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. saw April sales jump 60% to NT$236 billion ($7.3 billion) as sustained artificial intelligence demand was helped by the beginnings of a recovery in consumer electronics.\n\n>The world’s largest contract chipmaker is running well ahead of estimates for revenue growth in the current quarter, after sales increased by 34.3% in March, buoyed largely by insatiable appetite for AI semiconductors.

In the aftermath of the initial layoffs, Musk addressed the Supercharger news on X, stating that the network will grow at “a slower pace” for new locations.\n\nAutomakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others had signed up to access the Supercharger network, and incorporate Tesla’s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace.\n\nTesla was likely getting an earful from its NACS partners, questioning what they were getting exactly after signing deals to access the Supercharger network.\n\nIn addition, contractors and others working with Tesla on existing Supercharger projects were getting their emails bounced back with no feedback on what to do next. Tesla also apparently backed out of leases at four upcoming Supercharger sites in New York, per EV blog Electrek.\n\nCharging network provider EVgo told Yahoo Finance that it was “actively engaged” in the development of the NACS network and was adding more locations to take advantage of Tesla’s move to backtrack its expansion.\n\nEVgo competitor Blink Charging is also poised to move on the opportunity, claiming potential Supercharger customers contacted Blink about future orders in the wake of Tesla’s move.\n\nEven oil and gas stalwarts like BP are moving in on Tesla. With its BP Pulse charging network, the company said it “is aggressively looking to acquire real estate to scale our network, which is a heightened focus following the recent Tesla announcement.”\n\nThe company’s top executive is even telling Tesla’s jilted partners to give him a ring.\n\n“If there are stranded real estate partners who are looking for someone to call, they should feel free to pick up the phone and call me or look me up on LinkedIn,” BP Pulse Americas CEO Sujay Sharma told Bloomberg.\n\nSource: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-backtracks-on-supercharger-network-halt-says-more-chargers-coming-170947263.html", "id": "1covdpg", "created_utc": 1715362854.0, "score": 376, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "The point isn't whatever Elon's latest decision of the hour is, it is that he has no idea what he is doing, is probably high, and cannot be trusted. ", "score": 462, "replies": [{"body": "Some folks can become deranged after attaining obscene wealth.

It gutted decades worth of expertise and institutional knowledge that they never ended up being able to reinstitute with a “new team”. I watched leadership have to beg some of the technical experts to return, and a couple did as consultants at a much higher pay(good for them). We just moved on and no leadership was ever held accountable for the poor decisions and the negative impact it had on the business  until the board eventually booted the CEO because the actual problems were not being caused by the technical experts delivering profitable technology but the leadership that gutted the technical capabilities for short term profitability. This is the classic subject matter experts vs. generalist MBA battle that goes on in the private sector. You can see the damage it has done in once great companies like GE or more recently at Boeing that is struggling to gain trust from investors, customers, and consumers because the consequences for the choices there leadership made are a matter of life and death.

First a rough timeline for FSD progress and approval in general.\n\n**Now - October 2024**\n\nGetting FSD feature complete, meaning it can do anything a human would under almost all situations. It doesn't need to be be perfect yet and it won't be, but it will hit a threshold where it really is usable for many if not most people. Many people will have virtually no disengagements other than because some nitpicking or preferences but no safety disengagements. This is where you will see Elon basically trashing everyone and their mom on twitter because he will stop caring about any and all car sales going forward.\n\n**November 2024 - June 2025**\n\nExpand to EU and China. Simultaneously releasing versions to the entire fleet that are trained on the entire dataset from all over the world, and start to compile several regional nets that only use data from select areas that are targeted for robotaxi release first. This net will be overfit of course. These builds are tested by employees throughout this period and basically perfected and validated. These results will be used to get the green light for limited and local robotaxi rollouts in US and CN. Somewhere in 2025 robotaxi factories in all 3 continents get the green light.\n\n**July 2025 - June 2026**\n\nRobotaxis roll out H2 2025 with several tens of thousands, targeting areas in Texas, Vegas etc. The global build is basically going to be perfected for the next 12 months using the ever increasing data set and compute. Regulators will be alerted about the next step and massaged with the data coming out of these builds.\n\n**July 2026 - 2028**\n\nRobotaxi roll outs in many cities world wide, maybe even in Europe. These use a global build that is good enough to reach safety thresholds everywhere. Robotaxi gen3 production starts late 2026 and gets to volume in 2027 simultaneously everywhere, scaling up to end of the decade.\n\n**2028 and later**\n\nAs the global net reaches limits on safety and efficiency, the ever increasing compute will be used to create many thousands of smaller nets that have a better fit to the location. The robotaxi downloads the net it has to use based on GPS location.\n\nAnd let's be clear that whenever Tesla reaches the size of maybe 2M robotaxis it will then suddenly be the most profitable company on the stock market. Even if current hardware isn't capable of it, every year the production surpasses 2M is a year where a revision would create a fleet to get there in under 1 year. Profits on just a 1M fleet would already exceed $100B and it really just depends on when that is. Even if you have to use tele-operators for a little while it barely makes a dent. Long term the price elasticity will likely put a ceiling on profits where the profit is basically the commodity margin plus the cost per mile advantage over competitors. Even at $8c of profit per mile on a 50M fleet at 50k miles per year is $200B and you need several hundred million robotaxis world wide eventually.\n\nFrankly the car business is a safety net for when FSD doesn't work out like we want it to. Market cap with just cars will not exceed $1T, not even with 20M units if there isn't a software component. Likely 10M units at 12% operating margin and $40k ASP x 12 PE as a saturated car company you're looking at \\~$600B, max $1T if they do get to 20M units somehow.

We can all already see core parity in Granite Rapids as well as rumors of more cache and other interesting architecture elements - primarily because Granite Rapids is in production on Intel3.\n\nBut... And this is a reason to be excited. Intel has already bought all of the next gen High NA EUV machines that will be sold this year. They have already built at least one and are the only company to do so. This immediately puts Intel in the lead for what comes next 14A, 10A, etc. They have executed on 5 nodes in 4 years. Everyone doubted it and mocked them, but it looks like they might just do it. PowerVia and Ferveros packaging are also really exciting technologies that Intel is clearly leading on.
