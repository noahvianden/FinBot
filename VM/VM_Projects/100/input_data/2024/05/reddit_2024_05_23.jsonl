I recently wrote about one, Sylvia Bloom, late last year.\n\nHere's another secretary, though, who's just as inspiring -- and instructive. Grace Groner teaches us real life lessons from her success that we can draw from, and help us to grow much wealthier.\n\n**Meet Grace Groner**\n\nGrace Groner attended Lake Forest College. That's relevant because upon her death at age 100 in 2010, the college received a rather hefty donation from her -- to the tune of **$7 million**. But, the thing is, Grace never made more than $20,000 a year.\n\nGrace grew up, went to college, got a job as a secretary at Abbott Laboratories, and stayed at Abbott for 43 years. She never married or had children, and lived in a simple one-bedroom apartment, until she bought a small one-bedroom house. She didn't own a car, but did enjoy traveling.\n\nSo how, exactly, did Grace end up a multimillionaire by the time she passed away? Well, she invested in stocks, and as you may know, the stock market is one of the best ways to build long-term wealth. It seems she actually only bought three shares of stock **(for a grand total of $180, that‚Äôs about $60 per share)**, in her employer, Abbott Labs. She bought these three shares in 1935 and held on to them -- for decades.\n\nSo, what did she do right, that we too might do, in order to get as wealthy as we can? Here are the smart things she did:\n\n* She invested in stocks.\n* She invested in a company she was quite familiar with, instead of one that was being hyped up in the financial media.\n* She bought shares of a healthy dividend-paying stock, which means she got quarterly payments from the company no matter whether the country was prospering or in the throes of the Great Depression. (Abbott has paid dividends for 385 consecutive quarters -- that's more than 96 years.)\n* She hung on to those (three) shares, through thick and thin.\n* She wasn't swayed by emotions, selling in a panic when the market crashed or getting greedy and looking for more exciting stocks.\n* She reinvested her dividends, which helps investments grow even faster.\n* She let the principle of compounded growth work its magic on her investment -- over 75 years, from 1935 to 2010.\n\nYou get the idea by now. You, too, might find some healthy and growing dividend-paying stocks and invest in them for many decades, reinvesting your dividends.\n\n\\*\n\n**Coca-Cola IPO Lists on the NYSE**\n\nIn 1889, the Coca-Cola formula and brand were sold for $2,300 (roughly $71,000 in 2022) to Asa Griggs Candler, who incorporated the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta in 1892. In 1919, a group of businessmen led by Ernest Woodruff purchased The Coca-Cola Company from Candler for $25 million. Later that year, Coca-Cola made its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), for $40 per share.\n\nAs of the 2016 annual report, Coca-Cola shares have risen so that the company‚Äôs market capitalization is roughly $180 billion, and has had 53 consecutive dividend increases.

The interesting part is that doesnt have to be an EV. If Tesla pulls it off it will be something to behold. The rub will be getting Musk to license it at a reasonable price so it will be mass adopted. My issue with it right now as a person with a Tesla 3 is that it runs fine and then without warning has an issue. During the freebie test period I found it had major issues with the train tracks I cross everyday (it wanted to drift lanes a small amount during the crossing) and it had major issues when turning right immediately afterwards. It almost hit the curb until I took control. The turning issue popped up once or twice in a few other spots. Beyond that it was fine. However that not fine moment was caught because I was paying attention and reacted before it became an accident. An inexperienced or inattentive driver will have accidents with this version.\n\nI know the idea of self driving cars on the face of it seems risky, but it might actually be the better alternative if they get it truly working well. When they get it running really well it may actually be a case of insurance rates going down if you are letting the car drive you. Im certain we will always need to be able to drive ourselves to a degree for off pavement stuff or unmarked parking lots, but for a lot of people this is going to be the better path.

There is just zero way that they get approval for unsupervised FSD at this time without massive improvements to this technology. Personally I would guess that with the current hardware unsupervised FSD is just not possible, unless they put the ultrasonic sensors, LIDAR, or some other sensors to complement vision back in. Operating FSD completely based on cameras was a cost cutting measure pushed for by Elon Musk and it was a real bonehead move because it's just not technically feasible for a variety of reasons.\n\nGet back to me when Tesla enables all the features they had even a few years ago, as currently Smart Summon and Autopark are still disabled after a couple of years since removing the ultrasonic sensors.

Restated, while not in humans nor provably required to accomplish self-driving, Lidar could be helpful in more quickly getting self-driving cars on the road.\n\n>Months not years.\n\nIf you think Tesla will achieve L4 in months not years, I've got a bridge to sell you or a bet to make with you or something. This is wildly inconsistent with the facts. I personally used v12.3.6 in SF just a few weeks ago. While it was incredibly impressive when it worked, it didn't instill confidence with tons of small errors constantly, like stopping well before an intersection, or starting to get incredibly close to things. It was hesitating constantly and generally kept me on edge in a city that should be a disproportionate amount of the training set. Definitely still just a fun toy and not super useful. Getting off work and popping on FSD to relax sounds good until you realize you have to monitor the screen for nags (fixed maybe?) and the road to make sure the car isn't crashing. Somewhat difficult compared to the fairly trained task of just driving a car. The owner of the 2024 MY AWD said he only used it a few times and won't be subscribing after the trial. The auto-park feature was interesting, but would pause when pedestrians walked by on the sidewalk, needlessly blocking traffic, so I had to intervene 2 of the 4 times I used it. There are lots of videos of it running red lights online and an incredibly small number of people recording.\n\nIt should be hundreds of thousands of miles (or more) between red lights being ran to be \"clearly better\" humans. Thus, If 1% of FSD users are vloggers and they vlog 25% of their drives, we should only have 13 recorded red light violations vlogged after 1.3B miles driven if FSD could achieve 1 in 250k mi acceptable level.
