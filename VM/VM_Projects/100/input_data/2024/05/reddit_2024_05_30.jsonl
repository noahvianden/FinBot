I've never shopped on there personally, but I know a lot of people who do and there's many times where I've complimented a friend on their clothes and they said it was from Shein, so it seems like they have some good quality stuff. But it's still shipped from China which means returns are a hassle and generally not even gonna be worth doing unless you live in China. That goes for Temu too of course, but it has a lot more drawbacks that I'm aware of. The app is horribly spammy and ugly and riddled with annoying popups and other garbage that try to get you to buy whatever bullshit possible, lol. Not to mention a lot of the stuff on there is complete garbage, making that lack of easy returns even more prominent. It's really just a massively downgraded AliExpress. Also I wouldn't say any of the China sites are exactly the same stuff as Amazon. While there is indeed a lot of the same stuff and more of Amazon's stock becomes whitelabeled generic Chinese stuff, there are still numerous American brands and such you just can't find on Shein, Temu, AliExpress and the like because literally all of their stuff is Chinese products (as far as I've ever seen).\n\nOn the other hand, I can buy a ton of clothes or anything else from Amazon and return anything or everything very easily at no cost if it turns out to be garbage or not fit or if I simply changed my mind fro any reason. The experience is miles ahead. Same goes for their reviews; while they're not as great as they once were and definitely are subject to seller manipulation, if you actually read through them and use your best judgement, they are overall reliable and more useful than Temu.\n\nBut I don't shop on Temu because one time was more than enough. üòÇ AliExpress is MUCH better. It has a few of the problems Temu has like being shipped from China (though they have some stuff shipped from the US too), the reviews usually being not too helpful or non-existent, as well as listings sometimes having wrong or misleading mockup photos and things like that (I still find it less deceptive than Temu though). If anything they are far better positioned to take away from Amazon, if only they marketed more like Temu does.\n\nI'm constantly blown away by how many people don't know about AliExpress or have heard of it but still don't shop on there. I think they just don't realize how good it actually is. Still though, Amazon's amazing logistics and all the benefits than come with can't be beat unless the gov decides to step in and break them up or allow Chinese companies to set up more shipment centers in the States. And as much as our gov likes to pick on big tech, they like to pick on China more and surely won't let a Chinese company overtake an American one if it has to happen on our soil. \n\nI've used AliExpress for years and always loved it for things I could wait on, and recently they've totally upped their shipping game. Now they've got a lot of stuff in their \"Choice\" program which is a bit like Amazon's fulfilment service where Ali handles the logistics so it's quick. The shipping is only $2 or free if you spend >$10 which is easy to hit without trying. And no annual subscription for that service so it's quite a nice option compared to Amazon especially if you don't have Prime. And I've found it to be very fast every time. They've really done an impressive job with it! I get Choice orders in about a week usually, which is on par with more and more stuff on Amazon these days as Prime gradually falls more victim to enshittification. \n\nWhew that was a lot.
