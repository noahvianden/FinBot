But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.\n\n>That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.\n\n>The government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.\n\n>A government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.\n\n> The government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.\n\n>Government prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.\n\n>The government has yet to say what precise remedy it desires should it prevail against Google. If the government does win on any of its claims, a separate remedies phase of the trial would be held.", "id": "1ckv9wx", "created_utc": 1714926877.0, "score": 467, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 177, "comments": [{"body": "IOW, is the market about to be deFAANGed?

{"title": "Vote For will not dilute the stock price by 10%. Here is why", "selftext": "The market had already accounted for the dilution resulting from the stock grants in the 2021-2022 compensation package. What the market did not anticipate was the Delaware judge’s ruling that voided this pay package. If this ruling is anti-dilutive, should the stock price not have risen by 10% following this decision? Instead, the stock price fell nearly 10% the same week and continued to drop until a recent rally, following Elon’s visit to China to accelerate FSD deployment in the Chinese market.\n\nSo, why did the stock price fall? It fell due to the uncertainty resulting from this ruling, and the market dislikes uncertainty because it’s a risk that is hard to quantify, requiring a higher risk premium on the underlying asset. Another factor the market dislikes is conflicts between shareholders and executives, and potential proxy fights. A vote against the pay package would exacerbate this uncertainty and risk, potentially further tanking the stock price and causing more permanent damage to market confidence in repairing the relationship between shareholders and executives. This might lead some major investors to sell to protect their investments, with fewer buying before the conflict is resolved.\n\nTherefore, a vote FOR this pay package would not only avoid diluting shares—since this has long been priced in—but also restore market confidence in Tesla and its management’s ability to lead the company in the long term.\n\nPS: I understand many people here are upset with Elon due to something he recently posted on X, but I’m trying to convince you that for the long-term benefit, Elon remains the best leader to grow Tesla from $500 billion to $5 trillion in the era of AI/Robotics. Achieving that level by focusing solely on the car business is implausible. And I tend to think it’s easier to motivate the leader to dedicate more time and effort to Tesla by rewarding him with more shares, as Charlie Munger said: \"Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.\"\n\nedit: For those who think Mercedes and Google are ahead of Tesla. You can hate Elon but please stop insulting Tesla. I’m quite speechless. You should talk to some Waymo engineers about this… Here is a recent ex Waymo engineer who jumped Waymo for Tesla because he believes Tesla’s FSD. https://x.com/charles_rqi?s=21\nThis dude join tesla because Elon’s focus on FSD development, because Elon would spend billions of dollars to build AI infrastructure, and cutting costs from other departments accordingly. This time, supercharger department is affected, unfortunately. I wish Tesla has unlimited resources to play in this game but unfortunately GPU and topnotch AI talents cost lots of money. So before you vote against the pay package, I want you to seriously consider did Elon really failed at leading when Tesla is the top leader in autonomous vehicles?
