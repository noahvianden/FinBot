But maybe U should also ask yourself, 'What would Charlie do?'\n\n**What were Charlie Munger's favorite stocks?**\n\nCharlie Munger, the legendary investor and partner of Warren Buffett, was known for his buy-and-hold investment strategy. He believed that good investment opportunities were few and infrequent. When Munger found a good idea, he simply continued to hold that stock and allowed compounding to work for him. As Munger once said, \"The big money is not in the buying and the selling, but in the waiting\". This means that Munger was not active in daily buys and sells. Rather, he worked hard to identify positions he felt were as close as possible to a sure thing and held them, often for years at a time. So, in essence, he was a buy and hold investor rather than an active trader. Munger had a few favorite stocks that he often discussed. Here are some of them:\n\n1. BYD Company (BYDDY): Munger was particularly bullish on this Chinese electric vehicle company. He saw it as having a competitive advantage against Tesla, especially in China.\n2. **Costco (COST):** Munger appreciated Costco’s value-driven approach, which mirrored his own investment strategy.\n3. Wells Fargo: This was Charlie Munger’s biggest position.\n4. Bank of America: This was Munger’s second largest position.\n5. Alibaba: This was Munger’s third largest position.\n6. US Bancorp: This was the fourth and final position in Charlie Munger’s portfolio\n\nAt the time of his passing, Munger reportedly held shares of just three stocks in his personal investment portfolio: Berkshire Hathaway, Costco, and Daily Journal Corp. As of November 2022, Charlie Munger directly owned about **187,180 shares of Costco**, which was worth about $95 million. His ownership was second from an individual holder perspective, behind only longtime Costco CEO Craig Jelinek’s 196,095 shares.\n\nCostco also pays a dividend. As of April 2024, Costco has an annual dividend of $4.64 per share, with a forward yield of 0.59%. The dividend is paid every three months. The last ex-dividend date was on April 25, 2024. Munger owned about 187,180 shares of Costco. Given that Costco’s annual dividend was $4.64 per share, we can approximate that the **annual dividend income that Munger was receiving from Costco was approximately $868,755.20.**", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "good company but the stock isn’t good value", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Costco is one of the few brick and mortar stores that will never seem to go away, plus their food courts and gas stations are best value too.

Here are some key points of differentiation:\n\n\t1.\tNature of Business:\n\t•\tEnron: Primarily an energy company, Enron was involved in trading gas and electricity and later expanded into other commodities. It became infamous for its accounting fraud and the manipulation of energy markets.\n\t•\tTesla: Tesla is a technology and automotive company focused on electric vehicles, renewable energy products, and energy storage solutions.\n\t2.\tBusiness Practices:\n\t•\tEnron: Engaged in widespread corporate fraud and corruption. Enron used complex accounting practices to hide debt and inflate profits, leading to its collapse in 2001.\n\t•\tTesla: While Tesla has faced scrutiny over various issues such as production delays, workplace conditions, and CEO Elon Musk’s public statements, it has not been involved in fraudulent accounting practices on the scale of Enron.\n\t3.\tOutcome:\n\t•\tEnron: The company’s fraudulent activities led to one of the largest bankruptcies in U.S. history, with severe consequences for its employees, investors, and the energy market.\n\t•\tTesla: Despite challenges and controversies, Tesla has grown to become one of the most valuable car manufacturers in the world, playing a significant role in the transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles.\n\t4.\tRegulatory Scrutiny:\n\t•\tEnron: Its collapse led to stricter regulations on corporate governance and accounting practices, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\t•\tTesla: While subject to regulatory scrutiny, particularly regarding its autonomous driving technology and CEO’s market-moving statements, Tesla has not faced the same level of regulatory fallout as Enron.\n\nOverall, while both companies have been highly influential and controversial, their similarities are limited. Enron’s downfall was a result of deliberate and systemic fraud, whereas Tesla’s challenges are more related to its aggressive business strategies, innovation-driven risks, and market dynamics.\n\n- ChatGPT4", "score": -61, "replies": [{"body": "Well if ChatGPT says so.

Enron had Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, while Tesla has Elon Musk. The cult-like following around these leaders contributed to the companies' mystique and influence.\n\n3. **Volatility**: Both companies experienced extreme stock price volatility. Enron's stock price soared before its collapse, fueled by questionable accounting practices and inflated earnings. Tesla's stock has also been highly volatile, driven by investor sentiment, quarterly results, and Musk's tweets.\n\n4. **Controversy**: Both companies faced controversy and scrutiny.

The measure isn’t saying it WILL move this far, only that it SHOULD since the price of the calls and puts combined represents the totality of market expectations about how far it should move in either direction.

Consensus seems to be that they are dominant and order book backlog so should readily beat both earnings and revenue. They also have a huge backlog of orders so hard to imagine any hint of lowering guidance. In fact, probably raise guidance.\n\nBut here is the kicker, this is what most people think and expect. This has a tendency or raising expectations significantly even beyond “whisper” numbers.\n\nI have been burned many times by companies beating estimates, solid guidance but flat or decline share price.\n\nExpectations are:\n- EPS = $5.18 (Q4 was $4.92 and LY q1 was $0.82) this is massive earnings growth. I think 5% earnings growth QoQ is too conservative. They grew 32% last QoQ. I am gonna estimate 20% increase from $4.92 to $5.90.\n\n- revenue = $24.27B. (Q4 was $22.1B and LY Q1 was $7.2B) They increased revenue 22% QoQ. Estimate is to increase 10%. Revenue is harder to scale with backlog and actual limiting of shipping demand. But they are also shifting to higher cost chips and margin. I think 15% rev growth is reasonable so $25.4B rev.\n\nOf course these beats would also go into the full year guidance and even if they just incorporated the Q1 beat, would raise 12-month guidance. But likely raise future quarters as well as it would seem artificially low given Q1 beat.\n\nThis is all my speculation and my point is even if this happens, because so many people including institutions expect this sort of beat, the stock may not jump as expected.\n\nAlso, that 1000 ceiling is very real.

A recession is a time of deflation. The Fed uses the interest rate to try to tame inflation by raising the interest rate to try to drive demand down.  It has a mandate to keep inflation in check at 2% - but our Fed also has a second mandate of maintaining full employment which is unemployment at less than 4%.  If it cannot reach it the “break glass” action is to send the economy into a recession.\n\nSo all the current talk about a recession is since the Fed has jacked up interest rates the inflation readings have basically told JPow to F-off and have still increased.  This is due to multiple reasons but JPow’s job is to act and our job as the market is to react.  So long as we still have full employment he needs to get money out of the system and find ways to reduce demand.  If he acts and pulls the rug out, the system is fragile enough that demand won’t just gradually decrease - it will fall off the cliff. This is the difference between a soft landing and hard landing.  Historically, landings have been hard.\n\nThe sticky parts of inflation are housing equivalents which they’ve been patiently waiting to see come back down to earth.  It was a little better but not great.  This indicator is extremely lagging as rental lease times are fixed annually and housing equivalents tend to be more fixed.  If JPow was getting impatient the only tool he has left now is to send the economy into a full blown recession by jacking rates.  A few hawks think we should be adding another hike.\n\nPersonally, we’re in this weird stagflation period where the hikes are working, just slowly since there is so much money in the system now.  Once the money dries up we should start to make more progress but the employment mandate might catch up first. We saw it in the last claims report.  PPI data is basically unreliable and useless.  CPI is somewhat better.  The PCE coming up will tell us a lot.  So it’s not bad Powell has been cautious.  The last PPI showed a revision that actually brought in deflation and the difference was more than the first numbers (last Q went from .2 to -0.1).

This can be seen mostly in autos where car insurance rates are still sky high. Lack of replacement parts and the cost of those parts lead to higher rates.\n\nSo I call this weird stagflation as the gig economy has helped prop things up enough to keep it from going over the deep end quickly and the system has mostly removed any real means of a long term deflation cycle.
