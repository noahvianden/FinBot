{"title": "Elon Musk laid off the Tesla Supercharger team; now he’s rehiring them", "selftext": "Two weeks ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk enacted widespread layoffs throughout the company, including the 500-strong team responsible for the brand's Supercharger. Now, Tesla is looking to hire some of them back, Bloomberg reports, as Musk promises to spend $500 million expanding the network.\n\nThe Supercharger network is inarguably Tesla's crown jewel. The company recognized early on that, even though its owners slow-charged at home each night, knowing they had the ability to rapidly recharge on the road was critical in making an electric vehicle an acceptable alternative to existing vehicles.\n\nSince then, it has built out more than 2,000 charging stations in the US alone, with more than 25,000 plugs. More than that, the chargers invariably work, something that is often not true for other charging networks.\n\nSo successful is the Supercharger network that, over the course of last year, virtually every other automaker that sells or plans to sell EVs in the US has announced it will drop the CCS1 connector for the J3400 standard, originally developed by Tesla. But those announcements were about more than just switching plugs. Each time, the OEM also revealed it had negotiated access for its customers to the Supercharger network.\n\nThat made Musk's dismissal of the entire team responsible so hard to fathom. While the Supercharger network accounts for only about 5 percent of Tesla's revenues, that percent is poised to grow as more OEMs gain access. And although the charging experience for Tesla EVs at Superchargers is usually flawless, that's because it's optimized for a single make of car with just five different models; there's no guarantee that will prove true when cars from other brands try to charge.\n\nThe layoffs also appeared to put Tesla's plan to build a more powerful charger that would benefit cars using 800 V or 900 V architectures, including Audi, Porsche, Lucid, and others, on hold.\n\nWorse yet, dozens of Supercharger sites that were in the works have stalled out, according to multiple reports.\n\nBut last week, Musk announced that Tesla would spend more than $500 million building out more chargers, just days after saying the focus would instead be on uptime at existing locations. And to do that, Tesla will need to rehire a whole bunch of people.\n\nThat started with Max de Zegher, who was an executive under the previous head of Supercharging, Rebecca Tinucci. (At the time of the layoffs, Electrek reported that Musk got rid of the entire team because its Tinucci did not lay off enough workers on her own.)\n\nThis is not the first time Musk has had to back-track an impetuous business decision. In 2019, he decided to close all of Tesla's retail locations to pay for a cheaper version of the Model 3 sedan. Within two weeks that decision had been reversed, in no small part due to the legal consequences of breaking so many leases.\n\nSource: https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/tesla-does-180-on-superchargers-rehiring-laid-off-staff-amid-new-plans/", "id": "1cs3775", "created_utc": 1715720775.0, "score": 785, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "Fire low, hire high", "score": 336, "replies": [{"body": "Or hire and fire while high.", "score": 62, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Absolute fucking clown show", "score": 914, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 148, "replies": [{"body": "wdym? announcing firings is the best way to make your stock price go up because \"the company will have more money\" and then announcing hirings also makes your stock price go up because \"growth\"\n\nelon doing his best manipulate the stock price like always", "score": 194, "replies": [{"body": "Not to mention firing people scares the fuck out of your employees.

I guess 10x the price in five years is such a bad investment.\n2. I'm hearing a lot of people talk about declined EV sales from TSLA. What they won't mention is Audi, Renault, Mercedes, BYD, VW, NIO, Polestar, Xpeng, and Geely all have declined EV sales with Toyota being the only car manufacturer with positive EV growth from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 and Toyota only sold 30k. Only other car company coming close to selling as many EV's as Tesla did in Q1 was BYD at 300k. Tesla sold 387k. This just proves it's a market issue and not a TSLA issue.\n3. Now, which one of the auto companies I have mentioned are working on robots, self-driving, and is actually profitable selling EV's? One thing people seem to always ignore is that EV is the future. Companies that do not move to EV's will fail to exist. So when people compare TSLA margins with the auto margins, what they ignore is the negative EV margins that the other car makers incur. That's the real margin gap you have to look at. There's a reason why GM/Ford and other legacy OEM's are slowing down EV innovation. It's because EV sales are down and also, they would be bankrupt if they sold more EV's because it takes away from their ICE sales and they're losing tens of thousands per EV sale. Let's say they make $15k per ICE sale and lose $30k per EV sale. Do you think these legacy OEM's can survive losing $40k per electric vehicle sold? So why would I be upset that TSLA is still the only profitable EV maker? BYD is TBD because they bulk in all vehicle sales so you can't really tell for sure whether their pure EV's are profitable.\n4. Elon is also the CEO of SpaceX. SpaceX sent the largest space rocket into space. If you're going to call Elon a scammer, please explain to me how a scammer can do something no one has ever done before.

And this is the designed see-saw of a two party system. Republicans cut taxes so democrats can raise them. Democrats tax everything to pay for anything because that’s how they maintain a political base - rob Peter to pay Paul because you know that eventually republicans will come back around to rob Paul to enrich Peter. \n\nOn the other side of this is the issue of the Aging U.S. population. By 2030, the number of people aged 75 or older is expected to grow by 96%. Older populations typically vote conservatively in effort to maintain what they’ve “worked for” so to speak. The only two ways to offset this trend are either a boom in births (unlikely) or an increased acceptance and alignment on boosting immigration (also unlikely). \n\nThe very idea of a crash, is too untenable an idea between the aging population and republican governance - both of which do not like the idea of radical, systemic, change. \n\nI’d put my money on more helicopter money or money printing that kicks the can down the road as far as they can. \n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2021/number-of-people-75-and-older-in-the-labor-force-is-expected-to-grow-96-5-percent-by-2030.htm", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "He's giving you a good trade idea and you're being a prick.\n\nSince you don't know what he's talking about, I can only assume you didn't trade during the original GameStop rally.\n\nWhat he's saying is that when Gamestop rallied, the price of pretty much everything else went down.\n\nIt would appear that retail sold their positions in everything else and went all in on GameStop.\n\nI was thinking of doing the same trade he is.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Um.
