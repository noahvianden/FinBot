{"title": "Peloton CEO Barry McCarthy to step down, company to lay off 15% of staff", "selftext": "Peloton announced Thursday that CEO Barry McCarthy will be stepping down and the company will lay off 15% of its staff as it looks to cut costs by $200 million.\n\nMcCarthy, a former Spotify and Netflix executive, will become a strategic advisor to Peloton through the end of the year while Karen Boone, the company‚Äôs chairperson, and director Chris Bruzzo, will serve as interim co-CEOs. Jay Hoag, another Peloton Director, has been named the new chairperson of the bard. Peloton is seeking a permanent CEO.\n\nThe company also announced a broad restructuring plan that will see its global headcount cut by 15%, or about 400 employees. It plans to continue to close retail showrooms and make changes to its international sales plan.\n\nThe restructuring is designed to realign Peloton‚Äôs cost structure with the current size of its business, it said in a news release.\n\n‚ÄúThis restructuring will position Peloton for sustained, positive free cash flow, while enabling the company to continue to invest in software, hardware and content innovation, improvements to its member support experience, and optimizations to marketing efforts to scale the business,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúUpon full implementation, the company expects the plan to result in reduced annual run-rate expenses by more than $200 million by the end of its 2025 fiscal year.‚Äù\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/02/peloton-ceo-barry-mccarthy-steps-down-15percent-of-staff-laid-off.html", "id": "1cid0rc", "created_utc": 1714648469.0, "score": 761, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 204, "comments": [{"body": "They‚Äôve already had tons on layoffs.

Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. \n\nCook told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. \n\n‚ÄúIf you remove that $5 billion from last year‚Äôs results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,‚Äù Cook said. ‚ÄúAnd so that‚Äôs how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.‚Äù \n\nApple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year‚Äôs increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.  \n\nMac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment‚Äôs high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company‚Äôs new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.  \n\nOther Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. \n\nDuring the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple‚Äôs major product lines.  \n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only scratching the surface there so we couldn‚Äôt be more excited about our opportunity there,‚Äù Cook said. \n\nApple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.  \n\nCook also said Apple has ‚Äúbig plans to announce‚Äù from an ‚ÄúAI point of view‚Äù during its iPad event next week as well as at the company‚Äôs annual developer conference in June.  \n\nServices was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That‚Äôs how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple‚Äôs App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.  \n\nSales in Greater China, Apple‚Äôs third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.  \n\n‚ÄúI feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,‚Äù Cook said. \n\nCook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. ‚ÄúThat may come as a surprise to some people,‚Äù Cook said.  \n\nIn addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple‚Äôs $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple‚Äôs previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.  \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q2-2024.html", "id": "1ciq1fw", "created_utc": 1714681940.0, "score": 2984, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 523, "comments": [{"body": "Wish they used that $110 billion to acquire my crappy tech stocks I acquired during the pandemic", "score": 1263, "replies": [{"body": "Gonna go straight to Cathie Wood's house and ask for my money back", "score": 374, "replies": [{"body": "Bro you interested in some ARKK at 120?", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "How tf does an etf that‚Äôs 12% nvdia fall that hard?

Musk needs to prove that this sudden pivot to AI is something he can deliver on and is not just a carrot on a stick for investors to distract from the stalled progress on many things that have been in the pipeline for years. If he can deliver and show progress a year from now, and regain shareholder confidence in the growth of the company, I will happily vote yes, but until that happens, I cannot in good faith trust him. \n\nIf Tesla were still a startup I would forgive most of his behavior and decisions but it is too big now to be cleaning house, aggressively pivoting business focus, and have a CEO who seems distracted from the mission. I still love Tesla and its mission but Musk does not seem to have his head in the game like in the past. I hope to be proven wrong about Musk in the next year and hope that he delivers like he did in the 2010s. \n\nRegardless of my vote, I still expect it to pass, I don't think the majority cares too much about his decisions as we do.

Imagine the price of $TSLA if Elon didn't fire a bunch of people, invested in several new models, poured more money into 4680, FSD, Optimus, Semi, Roadster, Dojo, NGV, unboxed manufacturing, supercharger deployment and development, service centers, better warranties, etc. I would gladly pay $15.50/share, if I thought the money was going where it needed to go to put the company in a better position. There's no debating that this would be massive for the company and share price within a year. Maybe it wouldn't be worth $15.50/share, but it would be worth SOMETHING. By giving it to Elon, I'd say there's a good chance it will be akin to setting money on fire, more or less.\n\nI don't think Tesla's largest problem is Elon not getting paid. He wasn't really working hard on Tesla before he got un-paid. He only started working hard now because of the vote.

How much scrolling is he doing in between each \"!!\" or \"Concerning\". If, and a big IF, the pay package motivates Elon to go hardcore again working day and night at Tesla, not tweeting about the border or wasting time resuscitating his bird, it isn't clear that his presence will solve the problems that are plaguing Tesla's financials.\n\nWhat can Elon do to change the profitability of the auto business, which currently contributes primarily to the bottom line? His direction could potentially make an impact in 4-5 years, but I think that means things could get much, much worse. What can Elon personally do the speed the progress of FSD?

I think only a small number of people is scared away by his behavior but they are really the loudest group of people on social media that makes people think the brand is damaged. In fact, lots of people in America don‚Äôt even know who build Cybertruck, so I think there is still much room for fufure growth.\n\nEven if Elon‚Äôs recent behavior caused some damage to Tesla brand, I would think it‚Äôs short term damage, and it can be fixed in the long term. It‚Äôs definitely not something irreversible. And I think replacing him simply because of his recent behaviors will cause irreversible damage in long term. I don‚Äôt think Tesla can convince AI talents to join without Elon. There are many big techs in Silicon Valley that are willing to spend big money to attract the top talents, why would they want to work at Tesla without a truly visionary leader? So i truly hope we can focus on the long term goal (AI, autonomy, robotics, energy storage), just give this guy some shares so his interests can be perfectly aligned with our interests.\n\nPS remember what happened after OpenAI board ousted Sam Altman? All AI talents threat to leave with ‚ÄúOpenAI is nothing without its people‚Äù. I believe the same thing would happen to Tesla if Elon decides to leave. Elon can easily go start a new company and raise billions of dollars and successfully convince all Tesla AI talents to join, and these AI talents will probably all leave Tesla for Elon‚Äôs new company.

Hololens 2/IVAS is about as close as any of them have gotten to the mythical \"AR glasses\", and barring massive developments in computing and optics it's probably within a stone's throw of where we're going to be for the foreseeable future. \n\nI didn't even talk about all the cameras! Cameras have physical, optical limits on how small they can be before their performance cannot be improved through higher quality. At a certain point they can't be made smaller without sacrificing quality, no matter how expensive they are. Some of the Vision Pro's biggest flaws are due to it's need to use small cameras, and how those small cameras can't really measure up to the human eye. And it has 12 of them! These headsets/\"glasses\" need these cameras for tracking and vision, and they need space on the device to put them.\n\nIt's just too much stuff to put into a pair of glasses. I keep seeing people talking about how the Vpro is just the first iteration, \"I can't wait until they're just a pair of glasses.\" And I'm just not seeing how that is going to be *physically possible* within at least a decade.
