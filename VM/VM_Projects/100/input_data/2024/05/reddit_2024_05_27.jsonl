There's always a bear case, even though it's improbable it should be a part of the understanding. \n\nLet's pick out the Cloud services. \n\nLate 2000s to mid 2010s companies were wanting to take on more distributed computing services. Their architectures were struggling scaling horizontally - AWS was significantly more nimble versus the current company process of provisioning servers with IT, getting approval from Finance, securing those servers and deploying the teams to manage them. AWS made it so easy. \n\nBut late 2010s come along and more of the AWS style functionality becomes increasingly more accessible to on premise architectures - improvements in tools like Ansible (IBM), Terraform (Hashicorp/IBM), Kubernetes (from Google) (and countless others) made it easier for on prem departments to deploy \"cloud native\" services. But still, even after that, on prem IT departments need super expensive engineers to code out all of the complexities of a departments infrastructure. And companies need a lot of those expensive engineers to reach a critical mass of knowledge to keep those services automated/running/etc. Documentation is arcane, solutions are complex, time and money blah blah.\n\nBut then last year gen ai hits the ground running - gen ai is not coming for people's jobs, no, but it is making certain things easier. Gen ai is very good at writing the code that is input for these systems. These system design languages have a much more structured approach to defining system architecture (than regular development languages), and because of that it can really boost productivity. So now, IT departments can develop a lot of services quickly, and might think twice before immediately defaulting to the cloud.\n\nAdditionally you have another move towards \"cloud native\" and the approach to being cloud agnostic - meaning the company can shop around cloud providers to some degree (you would still need to move the data). That's why the EU made them reduce/remove data egress fees - https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/03/aws-egress-fees/#:\\~:text=AWS%20has%20recently%20announced%20free,or%20on%2Dpremises%20data%20centers.\n\nCloud has high margin - but there are a lot of threats in the space that could force a reeval. \n\nThat said.

{"title": "My regard story", "selftext": "My story\n\nI started trading right when COVID hit. At first I was just buying a few shares of things that were popular at the time and slowly building an account from zero. Maybe $20 at a time. Eventually I got interested in Metamaterial science and discovered a company called Meta Material would be reverse merging with an oil and gas company called torchlight and shares of torchlight were .23ish cents at the time. I started buying them like mad in September 2020.\n\nMy Dad who has always dabble in the market was impressed that I got into investing and informed me I had $16K in a VOYA account and my parents quickly helped me link that to an ETrade account since I had only been using Robinhood at the time (again, pretty inexperienced at this point.) Shortly, those .23¢ shares hit almost a dollar and that’s when I started tracking my investments on the app you see here.\n\nBy June 2021, at the peak my account hit $460K. I was so excited. I really had no idea what I had stumbled upon, what I had done. Shares hit well over $10 at the peak and the merger was hours away from being complete.\n\nMy Dad essentially begged me to sell but I said I couldn’t because the merger hadn’t completed. The merger completed on my birthday and I lost $100K that day. Followed by $100K the next day.\n\nI didn’t sell my shares through the first reverse split. I didn’t sell my shares through all the signs I needed to bail ASAP. I didn’t sell my shares until it eventually hit .16¢ and they had announced a 1:100 RS.\n\nI had the win of a life time brand fucking new to the market. I’ll probably never have anything close to touching the gain I had from September 2020-June 2021.\n\nI pulled everything out of the market last September and now I’m taking a crack at day trading options. I recently posted that I was down 65% (about $4000) on that and got some flack, specifically one guy from here that DM’d me and suggested I quit trading.\n\nBeing brand new to options and being down $4000 is nothing to me. I’d rather learn a lesson in my first month of options trading than get cocky when I’ve had some major wins as I did a few years ago.\n\nAnyway, that’s my regard story.
