No investment is risk free, so no one can completely answer that question for you. However, you should always reserve enough for emergencies, accounting for safety nets, like being able to live with your parents if you can't pay rent. Let me give you some examples:\n\n1. Let's say you have $50,000, and your job pays $150k a year. NVDA isn't going to drop to $600 anytime soon, and even so, a short term $20k loss can easily be recovered with that salary, especially if you're not in a really high cost of living area. Invest everything except the emergency fund.\n2. If you're in a HCOL area and barely scraping by, losing $20k could be really bad. You may need to be more conservative.\n\nHere's some painfully learned advice: no matter how strong the company is, macro conditions will drive any stock down. In the last 5 years, we've had covid (crashed nasdaq > 25%), interest rates went up by 7x (crashed nasdaq > 35%).\n\nWhat many new investors fail to take into account is that when the market is crashing, other things tend to be going bad too. Like inflation going through the roof, stocks crash and the cost of living shoots up. Be sure to have enough backup so you don't need to sell shares if everything goes sideways.\n\nOtherwise, you'll be forced to sell at the lowest point in the market to fund living costs, and that money is lost for good when the market recovers in a year or two.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "great advice. to be fair, at this point I do not mind going up to 20% of my savings as I do believe I can comfortably live and go through about my day as if these 20% don‚Äôt exist (holding the stock).\n\nbtw, I do not live in the US. while obviously a us market crash (which as you outlined does come with higher cost of living) will influence me, but hopefully not too much where I‚Äôd even consider selling the stocks at their low.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "20% of your savings seems pretty conservative.

It‚Äôs a little different for live events of course but you get the jist.\n\n\nNow it‚Äôs all about subscriber growth but imo advertising is where they could shine. With all their internal data they could present more useful advertising instead of that gay drug for your grandma who has a rare condition from going to an Australian trip or something. And if they show better advertising then that translates to better conversions and brands will prefer to buy spots there. The ad platform is not theirs so that sucks but still. \n\n\nThe future of entertainment seems to be Disney/hulu , Warner and Netflix. \nNetflix might be able  also start (or increase) selling older shows and movies to other studios and broadcasters. \n\nAnd the next frontier is live events like Apple going hard on soccer and Amazon trying as well. \n\nI don‚Äôt know if it warrants the level of stock price but in general Netflix will be around and in good standing for a while. What‚Äôs more, Disney and Warner have scaled back immensely from content spending. So much so that Los Angeles is the only place with a recession and unemployment going up.\nSo I think in the future People will again be starved for more and new content and streaming companies might have a chance to up the price without much issue.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "FCF generation is extremely high due to how high the amortization costs are, and operating margins continue to improve to the point Netflix is predicting 30% operating margins within the decade.

I personally think that they could either license their IP out of Universal or build their own park based on original IP that could be really successful. \n\nNetflix is also currently the best company in entertainment from a risk perspective.

At current potential, Nvidia is worth 5-6x its peers on P/S and 2x on P/E.\n\nGiven its monopoly position, margins are indeed prohibitive, but first, AI datacenter expansion is being done by only a few dozen companies globally and there are no plans to expand the list due to the high entry threshold, and second, large capital expenditures are highly cyclical and such a frenzy will not happen in 2-3 years.\n\nNvidia no longer has the \"key to success\" as all other business segments (Gaming and AI PC, Professional Visualization, Automotive and Robotics) are literally insignificant on the scale of current results, generating about $12-14 billion in revenue per year with a declining trend. These segments will generate $15.1 billion in 2020, $15.5 billion in 2021, $11.5 billion in 2022, $13.1 billion in 2023, and the potential for up to $13 billion in 2024. Prospects - None, all the potential is in data centers only.\n\nIt is impossible to extrapolate the current growth rates of Nvidia's financial indicators - the results are already close to the limit, given the hype, and in 2-3 years the results will begin to decline, and the margin will shrink, because competitors - primarily AMD - can come to the profitable place. Google, Amazon and Intel are also trying to enter the market.\n\nAll of Nvidia's dominance is due solely to data centers, i.e. almost 90% of revenue is now generated in this segment. In 8 years, revenue has grown by two orders of magnitude (100x) in supplying data centers under AI.\n\nEven if Nvidia achieves potential results, the current capitalization is already 2.5x the market. Even in the most favorable scenario, buyers of nVidia at 2.6 trillion capitalization already have no realistic upside (suicidal and crazy), but have unlimited downside in the long run.\n\nThere is no doubt that Nvidia will repeat Cisco's 1999-2001 pattern (see the historical chart).

Currently trading at $69. My target price is 140$.¬†\n\n# What happened?\n\nBasically due to bad CEO decisions operating margin decreased from 7,5% to around 1,5%. This was caused by a mess in the company supply chain, an increase in the SG&A costs and store comparable sales metric stopped growing.¬†\n\n# What are the good news?\n\nThe necessary steps to fix this situation have been taken:\n\n1. Former CEO was fired,¬† and in Q3 2023 Shane O‚ÄôKelly was appointed as new CEO. Prior to that, O‚ÄôKelly worked as CEO of Home Depot Supply, a subsidiary of Home Depot. This is the kind of CEO we need to fix the supply chain issues. Also he has brought with him a new CFO and some other management leaders.¬†\n2. Operating margins are going to increase. Not to the prior 7,5%, but management is guiding at least 3,2% in 2024. New CEO laid off 400 people in his first week and is cutting $200M in SG&A annually.¬† The AAP Canada business is on sale and he is also selling another part of the business called WorldPac. Proceeds from these sales are going to retire all debt and save additional 90$ in interest expenses annually. Also concentrating business in the US will boost margins.¬†\n3. An activist investor, (Dan Loeb) has taken a stake in the company and has appointed 3 board members with experience in the auto parts industry ( prior board members lacked this experience). Also legendary Michael Burry also took a position in the company.¬†\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/13/how-third-point-and-saddle-point-may-help-boost-margins-at-advance-auto-parts.htmlFrom](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/13/how-third-point-and-saddle-point-may-help-boost-margins-at-advance-auto-parts.htmlFrom)\n\nA macro perspective shows the stock fundamentals are solid as the US consumer is hurt and new vehicles sales are being impacted leading to a higher maintenance cost from older vehicles.¬†\n\nAlso US elections are going to take place in November and it is safe to assume that the worst case scenario is that the stock market won‚Äôt crash. A FED rate cut in September can also help.\n\n# Upcoming catalysts?¬†\n\nIt reports earnings on 29th May and if it reaffirms the guidance they gave in February and some of the steps management is taking materializes, then stock can fly to more than 100$ per share.¬†\n\n# What I have done?\n\nAlthough I think the stock will rise on next week earnings release, I think it is better to buy long dated call options. I bought 100 calls of the longest dated option which is January 2026. Strike 90$ at 11.25$ for a total cost of $100k dollars.

I just disagree they are the third best player.  2018-2019 was just a good industry to be an investor in...regardless of the player you chose.   I think AAP is definitely the 3rd best PUBLICLY traded player but definitely NOT the 3rd best player.  Go to 5 garages and ask them where AAP ranks.  Remember AAP relies more on garages than ORLY and AZO.  DIFM is AAP's leading end market.  Also, AAP HAS to rival ORLY and AAP.  Garages literally have a list of their auto parts provider by rank they call when they order parts.  Pricing is irrelevant since they pass it on to customer.  So they have to convince the garage to call AAP before AZO/ORLY.  I disagree with your premise that they don't have to rival ORLY and AZO based on my understanding of how car garages order parts.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zse5njaneo2d1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd9ba82ed1aed376d5ba1613b9b10bb51789136c", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yes I meant third best publicly traded player.

This meant that the rotors had to be significantly shortened compared to the \"ideal\" rotor diameter for that size of aircraft\n- this shorter rotor disk meant that the blades had to spin faster to generate the same amount of lift.\n- the fast-spinning small rotor blades caused the aircraft to easily fall into Vortex-Ring-State (VRS), something that wasn't well understood until late in the development, and led to a significant amount of the initial accidents involving Ospreys.\n\n- The V-280 is a SIGNIFICANT improvement over the Osprey in this regard.  The engines don't rotate (much more reliable), and the rotor blades are MASSIVE compared to the size of the cockpit.\n- It is much more challenging to enter VRS because the rotor diameter has been optimized for the aircraft since it doesn't need to fold up at all.\n- the overall FBW system is much more redundant and reliable than Osprey\n- the driveshaft technology has improved dramatically since the V-22 was initially designed, and is less complex than the V-22's\n\nBasically everyone said that V-280 is the aircraft that the V-22 should have been (ideally), but the V-22 got wrecked by requirements that compromised the usability of the vehicle.\n\nI agree that we'll have to see how the V-280 performs, but I have a high level of confidence that it will far exceed V-22's track record, I'm extremely optimistic.

At current potential, Nvidia is worth 5-6x its peers on P/S and 2x on P/E.\n\nGiven its monopoly position, margins are indeed prohibitive, but first, AI datacenter expansion is being done by only a few dozen companies globally and there are no plans to expand the list due to the high entry threshold, and second, large capital expenditures are highly cyclical and such a frenzy will not happen in 2-3 years.\n\nNvidia no longer has the \"key to success\" as all other business segments (Gaming and AI PC, Professional Visualization, Automotive and Robotics) are literally insignificant on the scale of current results, generating about $12-14 billion in revenue per year with a declining trend. These segments will generate $15.1 billion in 2020, $15.5 billion in 2021, $11.5 billion in 2022, $13.1 billion in 2023, and the potential for up to $13 billion in 2024. Prospects - None, all the potential is in data centers only.\n\nIt is impossible to extrapolate the current growth rates of Nvidia's financial indicators - the results are already close to the limit, given the hype, and in 2-3 years the results will begin to decline, and the margin will shrink, because competitors - primarily AMD - can come to the profitable place. Google, Amazon and Intel are also trying to enter the market.\n\nAll of Nvidia's dominance is due solely to data centers, i.e. almost 90% of revenue is now generated in this segment. In 8 years, revenue has grown by two orders of magnitude (100x) in supplying data centers under AI.\n\nEven if Nvidia achieves potential results, the current capitalization is already 2.5x the market. Even in the most favorable scenario, buyers of nVidia at 2.6 trillion capitalization already have no realistic upside (suicidal and crazy), but have unlimited downside in the long run.\n\nThere is no doubt that Nvidia will repeat Cisco's 1999-2001 pattern (see the historical chart).

How long does it usually take for interest rate impact to fully kick in and reflect into the economy? We had just experienced the fastest rate hike in the past few decades. Fed literally took just 1 year (2022) to raise rate to peak. So we really only had 1 year ish since we stopped raising rates.  Based on various research (don't take my words for it, feel free to Google), it takes AT LEAST 1 year for each rate hike's impact to reach the overall economy.  You should wait at least till end of year to see the actual impact by rate hikes.  \n\nIn addition, I still have doubt about the fed being accommodating. People were way too optimistic. Recall the market rally since end of 2023? They just printed articles saying fed may reduce rate as early March! (At one point the sentiment was showing over 60% probability of that.)

How are many of these companies pushing for crazy valuation and all time high stock price? I think devil's in the details. You look at actions not what they're saying.  Buffet saying it's great time to save on taxes. Regardless, he's selling to accumulate cash position. This goes along with other CEOs/directors of major corp... Jeff Bezos, mark Zuckerberg, the Walton family, Jamie Dimon, Leon Black  etc are ALL selling. U think retail investors who's dca on a monthly basis will have as much impact as ppl such as Jeff Bezos selling like 8 billion dollars ?  \n\nI don't know the market inside out and I sure don't have as much info than these ppl. But if they're beginning to offload their shares in the billions, should we really not consider that as a potential sign at all? \n\n\nMy 2 cent, feds will NOT lower the rates until something major happen. Feds usually only lower rates in an aggressive manner when the market needs saving. So for people who are expecting the feds to lower the rates rapidly, I just don't share the same sentiment. There's a higher chance that feds rate will remain at the current level much longer.

Under normal market conditions, valuations are usually some-what removed for equities that don't see much volume and or attention. However, when the top 7 equities are removed from proper valuations for several years without any sign of this changing, that usually means we're in a bubble.\n\nEven though this may happen and possibly go on for awhile, all bubbles eventually pop. I know I can't say when this will happen but what I can say is that it's unlikely for any of this to continue as it is for another five years. This isn't speculation, it's math backed by data available to the public. Data that supports serious fundemental problems with our economy that didn't exist in the 08' GFC.\n\nNot only are we seeing many of the red flags that happened leading up to 08', but as mentioned above, red flags showing serious issues with the overall economy itself. All of this is happening while markets find new ATH every month. This relationship alone should be sign enough something is very wrong with markets today.\n\nSo, if you think now is a great time to begin long-term investing in equities, you might want to re-evaluate what is driving today's markets because it‚Äôs certainly not what most people perceive it to be.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Can you drop some keywords for me to research about the 'red flags we never thought we'd see'.

Each of these are all in a dire state as a result of inflation and increasing fed rates and many of them require lower rates and lower inflation in order to be stable. Problem is, in order for inflation to go down, rates need to go up. Macroeconomics is subject that teaches you about inflation and how it is addressed. We had 10 years of near zero percent rates and in those 10 years, society was built around a lifestyle that has access to readily available cheap cash without consideration (protection) for when rates eventually go up. The extent of this structure reaches in all sectors of our entire economy starting with the policy makers themselves in DC (Congress).\n\nMacroeconomics and the math behind it support the need for rates to go up given how inflation has moved in the past four months. Doesn't need to be a large rate hike, but the longer the fed waits without addressing inflation going up (leaving rates where they're at), the higher the rate hike will need to be in the long run. The fed is gambling that inflation will go down with rates at 5.25% and is probably under insane political pressure to lower rates which would violently increase inflation and the need to subsequently raise rates more.\n\nTLDR\n\nThe economy is still overheating and to preserve some kind of future 20-30 years down the road, rates will need to go up and things will need to break so that inflation can go down.

{"title": "Apple reportedly seeks to lock out its competitors from TSMC's 2nm process, by booking all of its manufacturing capacity", "selftext": "Apple has long been cozy with TSMC, the manufacturer of the chips that end up in ever-popular iPhone, iPad and Mac products. When you've got as much cash on hand as Apple does, it puts it in a favorable position to negotiate deals with the Taiwan-based chipmaker. Now it is reportedly seeking to lock in 100% of TSMC's bleeding edge 2nm production capacity, giving it a competitive advantage when products eventually make their way to the market.\n\nAccording to¬†[9to5mac](https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/20/secret-meeting-between-apple-and-tsmc-reported-possibly-to-reserve-all-2nm-capacity/)¬†(via¬†[Extreme tech](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/report-apple-met-with-tsmc-to-secure-all-of-its-upcoming-2nm-capacity)), Apple's chief operating officer met with TSMC bosses to negotiate terms to secure 2nm capacity. The report cites 'local sources', so there needs to be a pinch of salt here, but given Apple's track record of locking up TSMC's capacity, this would certainly come as no surprise.\n\n[TSMC's 2nm process](https://www.pcgamer.com/tsmcs-upcoming-2nm-chip-tech-could-make-for-incredibly-fast-but-painfully-pricey-graphics-cards/)¬†is currently scheduled to enter risk production in 2025, with volume production set for the second half of 2025. That means the upcoming iPhone 16 family with A18 chips will stick with 3nm, but it could mean the high end iPhone 17 Pro and Max could be the first in line to be built with 2nm technology.\n\nThe specifics of deals between TSMC and its customers are obviously not made public, but it is widely accepted that¬†[Apple booked all of TSMC's 3nm capacity](https://www.pcgamer.com/apple-books-exclusive-access-to-tsmcs-3nm-chipmaking-capacity-for-a-whole-year/), at least for a period of time. These chips, including the A17 and M3 families made their way into the latest generation iPhone 15 Pros and MacBooks. That would make Apple's 2nm play unsurprising.\n\nIt's easy to see why Apple would attempt to secure the maximum amount of 2nm capacity. It will give it an advantage over its competitors, as 2nm chips will allow Apple to pack in more transistors into a given area, leading to better performance or lower power consumption‚Äîif not both.\n\nSamsung has its own manufacturing capacity, and future Exynos chips will be built in-house, but 2nm Snapdragon and possibly Google Tensor chips may have to wait in line behind Apple. Even mega-companies such as Google and Qualcomm don't have the cash on hand to outbid big daddy Apple.\n\nIt's not just Arm competitors that will be disadvantaged. Nvidia will want every possible power and performance advantage it can get as it dominates the market for AI processors, while AMD will also have to wait for access to the best nodes. Even Intel could find itself at a disadvantage given some of the tiles for its chips are manufactured by TSMC.\n\n  \nFull article: [https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/apple-reportedly-seeks-to-lock-out-its-competitors-from-tsmcs-2nm-process-by-booking-all-of-its-manufacturing-capacity/](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/apple-reportedly-seeks-to-lock-out-its-competitors-from-tsmcs-2nm-process-by-booking-all-of-its-manufacturing-capacity/)", "id": "1d0kpmc", "created_utc": 1716668669.0, "score": 931, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 235, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 96 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Calls on tsm", "score": 389, "replies": [{"body": "Been calling.
