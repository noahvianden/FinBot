The reason I think we'll see this is attention fatigue: as the system gets better it lulls the drivers in a false sense of security. Attention is a resource that needs to be spent wisely. Perhaps in conjunction with the removal of the steering wheel nag we'll eventually see a relaxation of the in-cabin camera surveillance while there is a low probability of disengagement. Perhaps they will use a chime to indicate when a higher level of attention is needed. I think they'll try to keep the system L2 for as long as possible though, but using this approach there is a clear path to L3.\n\nIdeally the model should predict the probability disengagement under the current learned policy, but I think using disengagements from the past few releases to train the next model should be a workable solution.

Meet Nateleb, a creature of peculiar luck, navigating the treacherous waters of the stock market.\n\nNateleb, a humble investor, possesses a keen desire to harness the elusive power of the markets. Armed with hope and determination, he ventures forth, seeking to secure his slice of prosperity. But alas, fate has not been kind to our protagonist.\n\nWith each investment, Nateleb casts his die into the tempestuous sea of stocks, hoping to ride the waves of fortune to success.

He watches helplessly as stocks plummet, his hopes sinking with each downward tick.\n\nBut do not mistake Nateleb for a quitter.

Ok, so Toyo goes and buys the Mirai, probably cost him in total $25000.   \nAt first everything was great. Then eventually the cost of hydrogen became 3x the price of gasoline. In addition, the refueling stations were so limited, he would only be able to refuel in the center part of the cities. On top of that, guess what, the hydrogen fueling stations were poorly managed and always breaking down. He ended up only being able to refuel in a few places and was always worried about the next trip.\n\nAfter I got my Tesla and we had a conversation, he told me how he regretted buying the Mirai so much. I told him, every day I wake up and my Tesla would almost be fully charged. He had a look of helpless defeat. His wife knows it too. They tried trading in the vehicle but the value was trash. He said he will keep using the fuel credit until it runs out and find a way to sell the damn Mirai.\n\nSo there's that story, in case you ever wanted to get a Mirai.

{"title": "The AI bubble bursting will be the catalyst for the incoming housing market crash. Here’s why. ", "selftext": "Inventory in almost all major areas is extremely high now. Bubble hotspots like Austin, Boise, Phoenix, Asheville, Jacksonville, Las Vegas etc etc haven’t seen much price reduction even though inventory has returned to pre pandemic levels. Inventory is sitting for months.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause there is no active suffering. There is no current pain for most people who own homes. Anyone who is holding stocks is doing pretty damn good right now. 401k’s are nice and fat for most people of homeowner age. The people in pain right now are those who don’t own assets, aka most consumers. Future home buyers. \n\nThe only thing holding the entire stock market together is AI. AI is in massive hype mode right now. It’s in the “this time it’s different” phase. While it really does produce a massive productivity increase, it’s not the magic people seem to think it is. It’s more like Excel or a calculator. Or the original computers. A productivity and efficiency booster in short. Investors seem to think it can replace everything. It won’t. At least not anywhere in the near term.\n\nWhen the reality of this sets in, and it will, the entire market will start coming down to reality again. \n\nWhy?\n\nEvery single company is reporting that consumers are in a very weak spot right now. Demand for almost everything is coming up less than anyone predicted. Companies are downgrading expectations for the year. People are fed up with inflation and the massive cost of living increases. Salaries are not rising to keep up with the cost of living. Even companies that are historically bulletproof such as McDonalds are surprised by a very weak consumer. Credit card debt is higher than ever right now. Student loans are sky high and aren’t being forgiven. People are graduating from STEM degrees and Master’s degrees yet they can’t find jobs in their field to pay back their loans. People are extremely risk adverse due to layoffs right now. Job openings for anything other than low paying jobs are worse than during the beginnings of COVID. \n\nDirect consumers make up 66% of the entire US GDP. The consumers are at their weakest in a very long time yet many companies and the broader market are near all time highs\n\nWhy? \n\nMarkets are being propped up by AI hype within a few certain companies. \n\nWhen this hype dies, the domino effect of pain and suffering will ensue. The panic selling of housing will ensue. No one will want to buy because no one can time a bottom (but they will try). People will be worth a whole lot less with no way to buy and will seek to off load their houses as quickly as possible to make up for their net worth loss. When retirement accounts and markets are down, this causes severe financial duress on people - mentally and literally. If we had current inventory levels during the crash in 2022, real estate would have crashed as well. Instead, it was propped up by low interest rates and an extremely strong job market. Picture the current weak consumer, with his 401k now cut down severely. \n\nWhen will this happen? I don’t know. How much more can hype propel the market? I don’t know. How low will the bottom be? I don’t know. It’s almost impossible to accurately time the market. But this will be the catalyst.

You can see it in consumer sentiment as well.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is what the robot said \n\nLet's go through each point you raised:\n\n1. **GDP Growth**: You mentioned a GDP growth rate of 1.6%, which is correct. While this is the slowest rate since before the 2008 crash, it's important to note that positive GDP growth indicates an expanding economy, not a recession, which is defined by consecutive quarters of negative growth. This slower growth does point to an economy that is cooling but not contracting [oai_citation:1,Gross Domestic Product, First Quarter 2024 (Advance Estimate) | U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/gross-domestic-product-first-quarter-2024-advance-estimate).\n\n2. **Job Market Growth**: The figures you cited for job creation seem to be a misunderstanding. There's no indication that job creation was expected to be as high as three million in a quarter. Recent reports show that while job growth has slowed, it is still positive, which contributes to ongoing employment opportunities, albeit at a slower pace than before [oai_citation:2,2024 Current State of the Union: US Economy](https://usafacts.org/state-of-the-union/economy/).\n\n3. **Fed's Inflation Target**: The Federal Reserve aims for a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Recent reports show that inflation has been around 3.5% as of March 2024. While this is above the target, it doesn't necessarily indicate a failure of policy but rather the challenges of managing post-pandemic economic conditions and external factors like energy prices [oai_citation:3,May 2024 Fed Meeting: Rates Hold Steady | J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/outlook/economic-outlook/fed-meeting-may-2024) [oai_citation:4,Current US Inflation Rates: 2000-2024](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/).\n\n4. **Credit Card Defaults and Charge-offs**: Indeed, there have been increases in credit card defaults and charge-offs, which could signal financial stress among consumers. This is a point of concern, suggesting that not all segments of the population are experiencing economic recovery equally [oai_citation:5,State of the US consumer | Deloitte Insights](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/consumer-pulse/state-of-the-us-consumer.html).\n\n5. **Consumer Spending and Loan Stress**: You noted rising everyday prices and the impact on consumers, which is supported by data showing increased spending pressures, especially in housing and energy. However, overall consumer spending has been holding up, driven by accumulated savings from the pandemic period, though this is expected to normalize in the coming years [oai_citation:6,State of the US consumer | Deloitte Insights](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/consumer-pulse/state-of-the-us-consumer.html).\n\n6. **Fed's Monetary Policy and Housing Market**: The Fed has indeed kept interest rates steady recently, suggesting a balancing act between not stifling economic growth and controlling inflation. Housing market adjustments, such as changes in first-time buyer interest and housing market times, are local and can vary widely across different regions. These issues do not necessarily reflect Federal policy failures but rather localized market adjustments and broader economic conditions [oai_citation:7,May 2024 Fed Meeting: Rates Hold Steady | J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/outlook/economic-outlook/fed-meeting-may-2024).\n\n7. **Employment Patterns and Part-time Work**: There's a noted increase in part-time employment and underemployment, which could be indicative of an economy that isn't robust enough to support full-time jobs universally. This does reflect a shift in employment patterns, possibly driven by changing business needs and technological impacts [oai_citation:8,2024 Current State of the Union: US Economy](https://usafacts.org/state-of-the-union/economy/).\n\nIn summary, while there are certainly areas of concern, such as credit health and part-time employment increases, the broader economic indicators like GDP growth and overall employment figures do not currently support the view that the U.S. is in a recession or experiencing stagflation. It's a nuanced picture with both positive aspects and challenges.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit. It's Chad Dickens.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No.\n\nTheoretically speaking, a company could grow at 100%/yr indefinitely and lose market share every year.

Tesla is only one of many companies in these fields.\nAnd Teslas first mover advantage is only noticeable in the US. In the other markets they are only one out of many companies.
