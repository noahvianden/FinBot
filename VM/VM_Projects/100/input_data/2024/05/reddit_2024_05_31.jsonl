I'm sure companies with deep pockets like Microsoft, Apple and Google are going to try and develop their own stuff in time and I'm sure they will but for now Nvidia is so far ahead right now it's crazy. They are a mile ahead in the race and are running faster than everyone else. \n\nIt would take a lot of time and money to catch them so this stock is a safe bet for the next 2-5 years. Longer term I get more skeptical as I think the demand for these GPUs is eventually going to fall off as the infrastructure for this stuff gets built out.\n\nFor me I think the 2 biggest threats to Nvidia in the next 2-5 years are going to be that the expected ROI in AI is not as big as it companies buying in think and China invading Taiwan which I don't think is going to happen as it would disrupt the world's supply chain of chips in general and the US and allies would for sure come to the aid of Taiwan.

So in terms of a percentage, 200% of what you’re willing to risk should be a minimum profit target, and ideally you shouldn’t be risking more than 5% of your account value. If you’ve done the math that means that the “riskiest” possible trade will have a minimum of a 15% gain to the overall account size. But the more important measure is how you’re managing your risk:reward with every trade you enter.\n\nAgain, there are a lot of factors and variables that depend on your strategy, investment objectives, etc. Many of the credit-selling trades you’ll find on r/thetagang will involve selling puts 45-60 dte and then halving the position after a 50% gain and repeating the process until the week of expiry. With this strategy your gains will be different on a % basis than a call/put debit strategy, with different RRR and timeframes as well.\n\nThe main thing is to be educated and disciplined, keeping your losses small, and letting your gains grow.\n\n In a trending market it’s going to be easy to get stopped out if it moves in the opposite direction, because everyone always thinks they’ve just piled in on the next correction, and then all of a sudden it turns back around on them and you miss out because your stops were too tight. In a volatile market on the other hand, you can do very well with that kind of strat because you get those opportunities to re-enter below or above your stop and do it again. But the point is know what market you’re in so you understand how loose to keep your stops and then keep your losses small. Focus on risk management and don’t be afraid to step up to the table when your rules require you to do it.\n\nIf you do those few things consistently over time you will develop the psychological resistance to closing a position too early because you’re afraid of losing. Keeping losses small is important for capital preservation, but the other half of the problem is letting the big wins run.\n\nTLDR: There isn’t a fixed “rule” for what % is a good profit target, that will vary greatly from one individual to another, but you should usually be looking to 3x your risk capital.\n\n[“Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon, I found it one of the hardest things to learn.” —Edwin Lefevre](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/2014/05/16/old-turkey)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Too long now it shall be known as the 90 day fiancé", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "That means 10% of accounts are up 10% in 10days - if my regarded math is correct, I’m all in!!!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "How can I only trade against new day/options traders?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sell OTM 0DTE options, there's not an experienced trader alive that buys them.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I feel like an imposter cuz I say I’m an options guy, but I only sell…hardly ever buy.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "just take care - never ever leave yourself naked short options..

Dont touch anything else for day trading. Buy other ticketr for medium to long term holding but dont do options on those.

Those kind of losses can be devastating, especially when going all in. Yes 0dtes are the equivalent of fentanyl laced cocaine, risk management should be revised.

It will take some time to rebuild some of the self-confidence you lost - even if, in essence, it was hubris, greed and luck that gave it to you in the first place. One should accept those parameters. I believe most people know when they are gambling, but heavy loss can lead to denial, and hope is a force that transcends a lot of mental barriers, good and bad.\nAccept those facts, know yourself, and play way smaller next time. Options warp time perception. If you are the kind of gambler/trader that worries at all time about the value of your trades, you have two paths : accept that you played too big without the required confidence OR realize that you're after a high/chase, in that case you need to  find a way to compartimentalize this aspect of yourself before going in.\nNo judgement here.

Though, unlike stocks (and other vehicles), mostly a mean for investmet or especulation where one tries to at least preserve their capital and make a profit, movie tickets are for leisure, thus the \"fair value\" formation (or perception) is mostly emotional/sentimental (which is also applicable in some cases in stocks like when one is willing to buy at higher price with the fear of missing out or sell at lower prices to stop loss). Now re-read the first two lines of this paragraph again, but replace \"movie tickets\" at the beginning with \"IPO\".

{"title": "Top proxy advisor ISS recommends against Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package ", "selftext": "Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended Tesla shareholders vote against the re-approval of CEO Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package and withhold their support from the re-election of News Corp. scion James Murdoch to the automaker’s board.\n\nTesla’s shareholder meeting is on June 13.\n\nThe report, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC, comes after the other influential proxy advisor service, Glass Lewis, also recommended shareholders vote against Musk’s pay package. Tesla’s board is seeking shareholder approval to reinstate Musk’s pay after a Delaware court voided the package earlier this year.\n\nISS said “cautionary” shareholder support was merited for Tesla’s plans to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas, although the proxy advisor also warned that there are concerns over how Tesla’s board decided to reincorporate and over the “unknown” nature of Texas’s business law framework.\n\nThe proxy advisor recommended support for some shareholder proposals that Tesla management opposes, including one that would declassify Tesla’s board. A classified or staggered board is considered by some advisors to be an effective defense against a takeover bid.\n\n“At a mega-cap company like Tesla, what is perhaps even more relevant to shareholders is that a staggered board can hinder shareholders from holding directors accountable for poor responsiveness,” ISS said of its support for the declassification proposal.\n\nPay package push\n\nTesla has been courting shareholder support in both time-tested and novel ways. The company engaged communications firm FGS Global and proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A to win votes, and has bolstered apparent grassroots support from its large network of social-media influencers. The company also launched a website, VoteTesla.com, and has offered shareholders the chance to win a tour of Tesla’s Gigafactory facility in Austin.\n\nTesla seeks shareholder approval for Musk’s payday and concurrently to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas. The company has characterized the Delaware chancery court ruling that overturned Musk’s stock package as unfriendly to shareholders, noting the value that Musk has created for investors.\n\n“Over the last several years it has become clear that Delaware is no longer the right jurisdiction for us,” Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a letter to shareholders earlier this week.\n\nTesla has adopted tactics other companies have used in contested shareholder meetings, whipping votes and launching a concerted public-relations effort to win support. While Tesla is not facing any sort of meaningful organized opposition to its efforts to reincorporate or re-approve Elon’s pay package, some shareholders have come out against it. Billionaire Leo KoGuan has repeatedly said he will vote against the package. KoGuan says he owns around 0.75% of Tesla shares, worth around $4.9 billion.\n\nProxy advisor pull\n\nISS and its smaller peer Glass Lewis are an important factor in how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Their recommendations are closely watched in contested situations but are not definitive calls. Still, they have developed a reputation for being important bellwethers and seek to advocate for shareholders.\n\nThey’ve also been the direct target of Musk’s ire. Earlier this year on an earnings call, he compared ISS to the terrorist organization ISIL, also known as ISIS. Musk also said they “effectively control the stock market” on X in 2023, saying they had outsize influence over so-called “passive” or institutional shareholders.\n\nInstitutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard, however, do not always vote with ISS recommendations. While voting decisions are generally not disclosed until well after a shareholder meeting, those institutional shareholders have due diligence teams that help them decide how to cast the millions of shares they manage on behalf of their investors.\n\nISS in its report said its prior concerns over the pay package, which dates back to 2018, had not been mitigated and that it “remains excessive,” noting that “the board has effectively only offered shareholders an ‘all or nothing’ option in this vote.”\n\nThe proxy advisor alluded to Musk’s myriad other business ventures such as social media platform X, his AI startup xAI and SpaceX, as another reason why Tesla shareholders should not support the pay package.\n\n“The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board’s other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,” ISS said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/31/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-pay-package-shareholders.html", "id": "1d4w5ni", "created_utc": 1717163578.0, "score": 645, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 218, "comments": [{"body": "If I was a TSLA shareholder I would be so sick of this guy", "score": 325, "replies": [{"body": "I have a total market index fund and I'm very sick of this guy", "score": 151, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting chart today.\n\n* near closing, a bunch of \"small trades\" ratchet up the stock price\n* then, right after close, someone dumps \\~$1.2 billion in shares\n\n\n\n    www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.\n\nit%2F66iqv08omt3d1.png%3Fwidth%3D1006%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Decb505bb09d92226da7322389a7d12d7c54fac89\n\n\nThis is market manipulation right?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Without more evidence hard to say, but it certainly appears like that.

They both signify that the board is putting Elon's interests above what is best for Tesla. A no vote on both issues is probably best for the long term health of the company and the value of the company stock. But I don't own individual shares of TESLA, and I'm not representative of the average stockholder. Ultimately it is the degree of their faith in and loyalty to Elon will likely have a huge impact on the short term valuation in response to this vote. \n\nIt's hard to say what will happen to valuation of Tesla, but it's easier to interpret the implications for the health of the company.\n\nFirst, to over simplify the Delaware court's ruling, they basic threw out Elon's pay package because the board failed in its fiduciary duty to negotiate a fair pay package on behalf of the stockholders. In short, when the board was supposed to represent the stockholders, they really acted in Elon's best interests. With this context the current this vote has two important aspects 1) it basically offers Elon the same pay package and 2) it re-incorporates Tesla to Texas. \n\nA positive vote on the pay package will only embolden Elon and the board to disregard their fiduciary duties to shareholders. It reinforces that idea board should do what's best for Elon, and not what's best for Tesla. This is a very dangerous precedent, and in the long run is an unhealthy for any company. While Elon's and Tesla's interests are often aligned, they are not perfectly aligned. Negotiations over Elon's pay is one area where the competing interests are highlighted. But there are other areas where the two interests may diverge. In these case you want a board that does what is best for the company not the CEO. \n\nIf the pay package is passed, then there will likely be legal challenges. This gets complicated because of the second vote on the move to Texas (more on this below). Based on the outcome of that vote, these legal challenges might be heard in Delaware or Texas. There may even be challenges to which court hears the case. If the case is held in Delaware, then I suspect the package will be quickly thrown out based on the prior ruling. If it's heard in Texas, then there will likely be a long drawn out trial with an uncertain outcome.\n\nIf the pay package is rejected, then I doubt Elon will quit despite his threats. Elon owns a lot of Tesla stock, and he has a lot of debt tied to the value of his Tesla stock. If he quits, then it will likely tank the value of Tesla. This will have cascading effects on his personal wealth as his creditors will come knocking. For this reason he's not likely to quit. But if he did, then get out the popcorn because it will be a master class of self-immolation.\n\nIf the pay package is rejected and assuming Elon doesn't quit, then this will put pressure on the board (and Elon) to act in the best interests of stockholders. Hopefully they will respond by negotiating a reasonable pay package. Then there will be a future vote on the outcome. Honestly, this is the best outcome for Tesla.\n\nFinally, the vote to move to Texas introduces additional concerns. Most companies incorporate in Delaware because the Delaware courts of Chancery are the experts in business law. There are decades of business related case law, which makes the outcome of cases easier to predict. The judges and their staff are experts in business law, enabling them to make timely ruling on very complicated matters. It's often far better to lose a case quickly, then to have you assets tied up in legal limbo for years while a case is ongoing. From a business standpoint, the predictability, the expertise, and the timeliness are hugely important. No other state in the USA has the courts that can provide these three things. Texas is trying to establish a similar court of chancery, but frankly those courts are in their infancy. \n\nElon wants to move to Tesla because the Delaware courts ruled against his pay package. But it's not clear that the Texas courts would rule differently, and it will likely take the Texas courts longer to make a ruling. But the real kicker is that Tesla will have to suffer through all the early adopters pains. The outcome of all cases in Texas will be far less certain, the judges and courts will be less familiar with standard business practices, and the cases will take longer to resolve. It's not clear what Tesla gains by moving to Texas, but Elon hopes to benefits by having his pay package heard in a different court. I suppose Texas might offer some companies some minor incentives for being early adopters of their courts. But frankly it's hard to see them being worth the added legal issues. So voting to move to Texas is really a vote to do what is best for Elon, not what is best for Tesla.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> ISS said “cautionary” shareholder support was merited for Tesla’s plans to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas, although the proxy advisor also warned that there are concerns over how Tesla’s board decided to reincorporate and over the “unknown” nature of Texas’s business law framework.\n\nWhat could possibly be the shareholder benefit of such a move?

Professor Charles Elson (2024) has suggested in a proposed brief submitted to the Delaware court that there is no such thing as a statutory ratification of a fiduciary breach, where the breach refers to the circumstances associated with the 2018 award that the Court took issue with. He contends that section 204 was meant to only cover technical defects, based on his review of 32 reported and unreported cases citing section 204.\n\n>Prof. Elson goes on to say that “any attempt to revive the award after judgment is, in substance, a transfer of corporate assets ... for which no consideration at all is received. Such a transfer is in effect a gift” that can only be approved by a unanimous shareholder vote.\\[1\\] Hence, in Professor Elson’s view, ratification will not reinstate the original option contract even if a majority of shareholders vote to approve the 2018 CEO award.\n\nProfessor Elson (https://weinberg.udel.edu/our-team/) is a founder of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.\n\n>shareholders need to be aware that if the ratification is successful in restoring the 2018 award, it will likely lead to a hit to Tesla’s earnings of a number around or upwards of $25 billion.\n\n>ASC 718, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule governing stock option accounting, assigns a great deal of sanctity to the distinction between ex-ante and ex-post events associated with performance-based stock option compensation. Rescission of the award by the Delaware court fundamentally changed the nature of any action taken now by shareholders.\n\n>\n\n>ASC 718 states that the fair value of such a deep-in-the-money option should be expensed as compensation expense. If a successful ratification vote has the legal effect that Tesla says it does, it will give back to Mr. Musk an immediately exercisable 303,960,630 options, whose intrinsic value is $51 billion.\n\n>Tesla’s 2024 proxy statement seem to hint that a new award of equivalent economic value could result in a charge of around $25 billion to factor in discounts for mandating that Mr. Musk hold the vested stock for five years. **Tesla’s statement that a vote to ratify and restore the prior award—with an identical economic effect—will not involve any incremental accounting charge seems implausible to me.**\n\n>Even if we were to go with the conservative $25 billion number, Tesla will have to book that number as compensation expense. That charge will potentially wipe out Tesla’s pre-tax profits for the last two years of $14.9 billion and $12.5 billion.\n\nIf Tesla's board opts to continue awarding Mr. Musk's 2018 options after a successful shareholder vote for reinstatement, expect further legal challenges to both that action and Tesla's financial reports.\n\nThis could drag on for several more years.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "🎯", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "So July puts on tsla?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Public already knows this", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I feel a great disturbance in the Force....", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is why vote to reincorporate in Texas needs to be passed in congruence with comp package vote.

I look for well-established stocks that have been suffering lately. Ideally, said stocks should have a solid history of consistent, if choppy, growth on the 5-year chart and maybe further.\n2. I consider whether the stock is truly undervalued. I do some research on the industry, read up on some news about the company. I have two main checks. First, I imagine the likelihood of the company falling apart within a year or a few, absent of something extremely upredictable. If that thought is laughable, I then see if there is substantially negative news with lasting repurcussions to justify a sustained drop. If I see the business sticking around, with no news of the sort I mentioned, I go to the next step.\n3. IMO, technical analysis is a weird self-fulfilling prophecy. Whether or not it makes sense, enough people trade off of it that it can be accurate, particularly with supports and resistances. So, I check if the stock price has consolidated or slightly rebounded from a support. If the stock has already tanked, but hasn't hit the next lowest support, I don't buy. I'll wait until it hits, and see if it stops dropping once it does.\n4. Finally, I will monitor the stock after buying it, with alerts if it drops below the support I initially referenced. I'll sell if the support is broken and watch the stock when it hits the next-lowest one. That's how I dodged the last LULU drop and bought back in at $300. We'll see how that pans out with earnings coming up.\n\nStocks I recently bought: ULTA, SBUX, HSY, SHOP, CVS, NKE, LULU.\n\n*Disclaimer: I've only been investing seriously for near two years, so we'll see if my strategy holds up in the long-run or if it's a load of bullshit. I usually hold my picks until it goes below the support, like I mentioned, or until it has gone up a few dozen percent at the least. I also make the occasional regard play, like a small bet on \\*bank stock that shall not be named\\* recovering after all the bank stuff last year. Spoiler alert, it didn't. My latest regard bet is ASTS at $7, so we'll see if that one pays off.*\n\nEDIT: I've been told that Fidelity calculates returns from changes in balance, including withdrawals and deposits.

{"title": "Now I sell a course, right?", "selftext": "I see a lot of loss porn and crazy stuff on here and so I’ve decided to share my 5 year portfolio since 2019 to now. I hope this will inspire those who have lost a lot or think it’s impossible to make money. I did it at 18 with 0 experience. And although it is hard to see I’ve been down 30-40-50% at times which felt awful but just like in life you never know when things are going to turn around. You’ve just gotta build a good strategy and constantly keep improving. If you’re curious of a more in depth walk through of my journey and strategy, I’ll put it under here but the gist of my post is: \n\n- USE MONEY YOU CAN BURN (with 0 pain)🔥✍️\n-INVEST AS MUCH AS YOU CAN WHEN YOU ARE YOUNGER (18-25)\n-START WITH ETF AND SAFE BETS UNTIL YOU MAKE “RISK” MONEY (more below)\n-STOP SELLING BLUE CHIP STOCKS MONKE (idc if it’s down 2% today 😀) \n- READ BELOW 👇 AND IF THATS TOO MUCH WORK THEN YOU ARE COOKED ALREADY. \n\nSo yeah I turned 18 just before C*ckvid 19 and that sucked because I had just started investing when the market died. I lost 70% of my $100 dollars and almost gave up then. That’s the dip #1. If I could give someone advice who is starting like I was I’d say: YouTube, Google, and honestly ChatGPT now. Start simple. Look up what terms are: Stock, ticker, Dow, S&P, Points, Limit buy/sell, Broker, Hedge Fund, Private Equity, EPS. DO NOT FUCKIGN LOOK UP THE WORD OPTION YOU DODO BIRD. 🦤 I did not trade an option until that third spike. But yeah I lost %70 and sold like a dummy but I came back with $50 more bucks (a lot at the time) and I bought a few of those same stocks that tanked. (Travel stocks, cannabis stocks were hyped, Tesla) I bought stocks with low costs so id see higher gains if they went up. (3-5$) Amazon is great but not early value investing. I made back my $100 and some more. I got up to $250. I felt good so decided to buy some risky penny stocks with the extra. I lost my money lol but the key here is I never went below my line and I never gave up. I researched and found a stock that looked good “sundial” and I put in some extra money I had made. It actually sky rocket and I made $1k. Nice. \n\nTHIS WAS AFTER 1 YEAR OF WAKING UP AT 8am everyday and learning and trying and being patient. I “lost” money and made small amounts a lot before this. Please understand that this takes time. If anyone wants a break down of the rest I can share or questions, but this got too long real quick. Sorry. I hope my little story and tips help you guys recover or build. I started with $25 and a free stock. I ended up with $3,000 a year later. Not typical!!! But the bigger point is I put that money in ETFs and now have 10k in savings and make half my rent each month. I have both my cars and college paid off. Stocks are not a way to be rich 🤑 they are a way to grow money. Please be proud of your $20 gains. That’s $7,300 a year if you can do it each day. Love you guys. STAY AWAY FROM OPTIONS.
