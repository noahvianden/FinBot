Tesla is sitting on some potentially globe changing technologies, yet in the midst of all of this the only thought most people on Reddit seem to be able to manage is that he's a threat to the democrats, who are frankly so incredibly corrupt that I have trouble figuring out how the vast majority of you are still seeing the left vs right dichotomy in America as some existential threat when both sides have been doing the same thing all along, empowering corporations and making sure the money keeps going to the already wealthy.\n\nEverything about the political discussion you keep insisting is more important than a company that's efforts legitimately seem to be steering the entire world away from dying choking on exhaust fumes is a distraction from the way every single person on the political stage is more interested in keeping donations from big business coming in, before it was abortion, or some vague idea about taxation that's never been true for either side, but now that it's identity politics and protectionism nothing's changed, as social manipulation is not an appropriate mandate of government and never has been.  \n\nTesla takes a lot of shit every time growth slows, sales growth slows, every single company on the globe will go down in value and Tesla will significantly less and that's the proof to so many of you Elon Musk is ruining to the company.

You can't really hate everyone, left, right, they're all reacting to their feelings, one sides feelings are that things were fine before they were changing, one is that things are wrong and need to change, but they're just feelings and don't contain valid plans for any real kind of future.\n\nBut Tesla does, and it was built by Elon Musk.

The automarket for EV's in general is in a shifty situation. This is the auto industry. Periods of bad sales during economic headwinds is cyclical.\n\nCapex spending is in line with other quarters. Not really a big deal and a company like Tesla needs capex for obvious reasons. It's a company where you are investing into the future - not present. This isn't Walmart or Costco. It's an innovation company.\n\nCosts will decline in the upcoming quarter with layoffs and a more normalized production.\n\nThis year will be a rough one for vehicle sales but once the headwinds are over, interest rates are back down, and consumer sentiments improve worldwide, Tesla will be in position to get their sales back.\n\nOne thing that people have to realize is that ICE is a dying industry. It's either hybrids or EV's heading into the next decade. Every year will result in a lower ICE market share. When you look at other automakers losing billions selling just a few EV's and Tesla is still making billions, it puts into perspective how well-positioned Tesla is despite the negative outlook. If Ford, GM, or any traditional automaker were selling millions of EV's like Tesla, they would be bankrupt in a single year. Am I supposed to be upset that Tesla made billions in profit?\n\nI'm not overly optimistic about Tesla in the next few Q's but by the end of the decade, I don't see any any company out-innovating Tesla.\n\nApple sells phones and runs a store that takes 30% of purchases.\n\nMicrosoft is just software. Same with Amazon.\n\nNvidia just designs chips but many companies are going to start designing their own. Around 50% of Nvidia's revenue are just from a handful of companies.\n\nAssuming Tesla is legitimately working on Optimus, FSD, and other projects planned, we're talking about revolutionary type shit.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "“Nvidia just designs chips”.  \n\nSays everyone since 2002.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": ">If Ford, GM, or any traditional automaker were selling millions of EV's like Tesla, they would be bankrupt in a single year.\n\nWhy would that be?

Japanese hybrids are some of the most efficient vehicles in the market. The problem with pure EV's is it is difficult to charge if you're living in an apartment or do not have access to a charger.

{"title": "This is what it looks like when you actually take money out. Protect your profits!", "selftext": "I take out $10,000 a month to keep me from doing me things… Being too greedy. \n\nI don’t fuck with 0dte. It’s too hard to thread the needle and outpace the theta drain. Right now, I am buying July at the money calls. I pretty much just play the big boys of Mag 7. I just made a killing with Apple and Amazon monthlies, took my $10k withdrawal for May, and now I’m sitting cash waiting for a bloody day to re-enter.\n\nI am a Permabull. The only time I went short is that the beginning of the pandemic. Stonks usually go up.\n\nI’m usually too optimistic and get into early but if your calls still have a couple months until expiration, there is time to recover. \n\nI keep my account close to balanced, 50% shares and 50% calls. That way if there’s a disaster, you’ll still have your shares. I use the margin off the shares to play options.\n\nNow that I’ve taken out $150,000 and spent it on building a bad ass guest house on my ranch there’s no way I could ever end up in the hole. The trick is finding a way to protect yourself from your own greed. It’s easy to make your account go up but most of us stay in too long and get wiped out.  If you move money into a hard asset you can’t go tits up. I learned the hard way.  Got wiped out a few times and recovered.  But now that I stick to the plan it’s been a solid extra 6 figure income for me.\n\nMy main money is in my Fidelity retirement account and RH is my play account where I do riskier plays.  \n\nI’ve been on WSB for over 5 years.  Gained a lot of insight into sentiment so I thank you all for that.  I made this post to thank you guys and share my method for protect myself from my greed.  We’re all greedy as fuck but if you move some chips off the table after a big win you’ll be just fine.\n\nIf you want to see more about my method you can see my earlier posts about printing stoned tendies.

{"title": "DD: $TKO will SKY ROCKET after earnings on Wednesday", "selftext": "Hello there fellow regards.  Let me break down why TKO Group Holdings, the parent company of WWE and UFC, is an earnings play worth getting some equity in before their earnings call after market close on Wednesday\n\n#WWE IS THE HOTTEST IT HAS BEEN SINCE THE 90'S\n\nThere was a time that WWE (WWF at the time) was at the forefront of pop culture thanks to Stone Cold, The Rock, and the NWO.  The industry ended up becoming seen as lowbrow entertainment less than a decade later, but thanks to the work of Paul Levesque (formerly HHH) pro wrestling has been restored to it's former glory.\n\nDon't believe me?  Here are some numbers from Q1 this year:\n\n- In the run up to WrestleMania in Q1 of this year, WWE sold out weekly televised arena shows for eight straight weeks https://www.pwmania.com/wwes-incredible-run-of-television-events-is-over\n\n- Shattered attendance records for untelevised shows in multiple markets, including the highest attendance for an untelevised show since 2001 https://www.ringsidenews.com/2024/02/20/wwe-live-show-sees-record-attendance-not-seen-in-over-two-decades/\n\n- Wrestlemania in April set both viewership and attendance records, with 145,298 live fans across the two night event and 660 million views across media platforms https://www.si.com/wrestling/2024/04/09/wrestlemania-40-ratings-record-rock-roman-reigns-wwe\n\n- WrestleMania broke the WWE Youtube channel's record for views in a 24 hour window with 67 million views\n\n- Broke their record for merchandise sales at Wrestlemania in a collaboration with Fanatics, seeing a 20% increase over merch sales at last years Mania\n\n- Signed a $500 million /yr deal with Netflix on January 23rd\n\n#UFC CONTINUES TO BE HOT\n\nIn addition to WWE's record setting quarter, the UFC has seen a great Q1 of their own\n\n- UFC just had an incredibly successful UFC 300 with a $16.5 million gate\n\n- UFC 300 was the UFC's 11th consecutive arena sellout\n\n- UFC 300 prelims on ESPN peaked at 2.49 million viewers\n\n- UFC 300 set the record for most merchandise sales ever at an arena show\n\n- UFC 300 set the record for highest grossing sponsorship for a UFC event\n\nNgl I lost patience finding sources for each, but I created the DD over the weekend using sources and everything can be verified.\n\nAll in all, I am expecting a MASSIVE earnings call after market close on Wednesday.
