This plan, approved by shareholders in 2018, is highly performance-based and does not include any regular salary or bonuses. Instead, Musk's compensation is tied to achieving specific, ambitious milestones. Here's a detailed look at the plan and the challenges involved:\n\nKey Specifics of the Compensation Plan:\n\n1. No Salary or Cash Bonuses: Musk does not receive a regular salary or cash bonuses from Tesla. His entire compensation is tied to the company’s performance.\n   \n2. Milestones and Tranches: The plan consists of 12 tranches. Each tranche is unlocked only if Tesla meets both market capitalization and operational milestones.\n\n3. Market Capitalization Milestones:\n   - The plan requires Tesla’s market capitalization to increase in $50 billion increments, starting from $100 billion, up to $650 billion.\n  \n - This means Tesla must reach market values of $150 billion, $200 billion, and so on, up to $650 billion.\n \n  - Achieving these milestones is extremely challenging, requiring significant growth in the company’s stock price, influenced by investor confidence, market conditions, and overall company performance.\n\n4. Operational Milestones:\n   - For each tranche to be unlocked, Tesla must also meet at least one of the following operational targets for the previous four consecutive quarters:\n  \n   - Revenue Milestones: Ranging from $20 billion to $55 billion.\n  \n   - Adjusted EBITDA Milestones: Ranging from $1.5 billion to $18 billion.\n\n5. Tranche Breakdown:\n   - **Tranche 1**: $100 billion market cap, $20 billion revenue or $1.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 2**: $150 billion market cap, $22.5 billion revenue or $3 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 3**: $200 billion market cap, $25 billion revenue or $4.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 4**: $250 billion market cap, $27.5 billion revenue or $6 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 5**: $300 billion market cap, $30 billion revenue or $7.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 6**: $350 billion market cap, $32.5 billion revenue or $9 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 7**: $400 billion market cap, $35 billion revenue or $10.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 8**: $450 billion market cap, $37.5 billion revenue or $12 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 9**: $500 billion market cap, $40 billion revenue or $13.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 10**: $550 billion market cap, $42.5 billion revenue or $15 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 11**: $600 billion market cap, $45 billion revenue or $16.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 12**: $650 billion market cap, $55 billion revenue or $18 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n\n6. Stock Options: Upon achieving a tranche, Musk receives stock options to purchase Tesla shares at a pre-determined price. The value of these options depends on Tesla’s stock price.\n\n7. Potential Total Value: If all 12 tranches are achieved, Musk would have the right to purchase up to 20.3 million Tesla shares at a fixed price, potentially worth up to $56 billion based on the stock's current value.\n\n8. Difficulty and Achievements:\n   - These milestones are extremely difficult to achieve, requiring Tesla to perform exceptionally well in both market valuation and operational metrics.\n   - Despite these challenges, Elon Musk has managed to unlock several tranches, demonstrating his ability to drive Tesla’s extraordinary growth.\n   - Under his leadership, Tesla has become one of the most valuable companies globally, surpassing the initial market cap milestones and achieving significant revenue growth, reflecting the company’s expansion and innovation in electric vehicles and energy solutions.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "ETF has voting right?

Even if they did make it legal, I don't think SpaceX should do it\n\nHard disagree on Musk being bad. I'm actually extremely impressed with how he's held up under so many unsubstantiated attacks. It's freaking crazy how bad it is. I see anti Musk articles pop up every day. Almost none of them have stood up to fact-check scrutiny for me. And by scrutiny I mean \"Oh, this article quoted Musk? Let's watch the interview where he said that... Wtf! He didn't say what they said he did! (or he clearly meant something else)\". And when they post his tweets I read the whole thread and generally agree with him over the article's conclusions.\n\nAnd then there's all the \"Tesla is failing!\" or \"SpaceX rocket EXPLODES they're screwed!!!\" click bait floating around when Tesla is financially better off than it's ever been and SpaceX intentionally launches rockets that blow up (when they're in their testing phase) to see what makes them blow up to design around it. Trust me, I have a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering and have been following SpaceX for years.\n\n99% of Elon news is literal fake news. It's disgusting. If you have any articles that you're like \"wait what about this one?\" please send them to me. I can elaborate, and I can also almost guarantee you that there's something wrong with the article\n\nEdit: also, imo, the louder the bleating from the media gets the closer Tesla/SpaceX/Twitter/Musk is to winning. He's disrupting cars, energy, rocket launches, legacy media (yes, Twitter is actively taking ad revenue from them, that's part of why they're attacking him so hard. He is their competition), etc. When you declare war on so many businesses of course they all work together against you.\n\nRemember how many \"Tesla killers\" there have been over the years? Remember how a year ago Twitter was screwed and was going bankrupt? Yeah, same thing. They're both here and doing fine. Also, Musk's new company xAI recently increased it's valuation by $6 billion. The media has always been wrong about him and will continue to be wrong.

It's not about having the best hardware, but having the best performance per $, and best performance per watt. That's what matters in cloud. These big customers don't like to overpay for hardware and have the capabilities to write their own hardware too.\n2. Number #1 is important but irrelevant now. Because right now the most important thing is to get products and models as powerful as possible, release and get market share. To Microsoft it's more important that it gets thousands of people everyday on Copilot, Copilot for desktop and all those things than looking at their hardware bill.\n3. Nvidia's lead isn't as important in hardware as it is in software. Nvidia has been the only vendor that cared that their GPUs played well when machine learning started being a thing a decade ago or so. They contributed a lot both to software and their own drivers. This led to a very powerful effect where software was written and tested mostly on Nvidia, thus making Nvidia GPUs faster and further giving reason people to buy Nvidia in the field. Not only that but Nvidia was generous with research labs, open source contributors, etc, to make sure relevant people in the field made sure software run on their systems.\n4. If you understood number 1, 2 and 3, you can see why Nvidia has a huge lead: Nvidia has the best offering, that runs best in a market that values launching products over sparing costs.\n\nNow, let's get back into Intel:\n\n5) Intel definitely has the capabilities to make very good GPUs for AI. In fact there isn't really that much magic here in transformers: you're doing matrix multiplication on huge arrays in parallel. It's not really rocket science, you're taking matrixes with weights and do matrix math on them. It's not even important that they are the fastest, they just need to be more either cheaper, or draw less power, or be immediately available. But lacking in software integration, right now, Intel either has to catch up on software (anything from Pandas to whatever), or collaborate with a huge customer to make sure their hardware works fine for the customer's use case. E.g. Microsoft by now, may have clear what are their needs to run Copilot for developers and start looking into optimizing the software and hardware bundle to run it.\n\n6) Intel is trying to retake their role as a great foundry, where they have been doing bad for 10 years. Having your best hardware built at TSMC is embarassing. But their 1.8 nm node samples have been very good, in fact Nvidia's CEO has publicly stated that the sampled chips are promising. If Intel can keep pushing there and execute well, for once, avoiding the mistakes of their terrible 10nm node, Intel is going to be positioned in a wonderful position where they will not only be able to produce great chips for themselves, but also customers. So selling wood and iron to shovel makers, in the usual analogy.\n\n7) Intel has lots of assets and patents, the sum of those is likely not that far their market cap value.\n\n8) Intel is poised to receive tens of billions from US and other governments around the world, which will allow them to invest a lot, without spending a dime.\n\n9) Intel's price is severely depressed. Comparisons with IBM are imho a bit blind, the most similar situation at that scale is actually AMD's comeback 10 years ago. Where it was laughed left and right for losing their good foundry business and making a crap chip after the other, especially on CPU side. Yet, AMD executed well several plans and even got profitable and has a moderately good outlook for tomorrow. Intel has more turnaround potential than AMD so if they execute well on the foundry side and can find a good customer to work on with their GPU hardware I see no reason why can't they make a very huge comeback.\n\nNobody here has the crystal ball, I personally hold some Intel, but if I was sure they are a great turnover company i would have more. And I don't. So even though I think there's huge upside potential, I am quite cautious on it till I don't see more positive informations, at least on their foundry business.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Their biggest 2 business lines are for sales management and service cloud - the latter of which is basically selling licenses used by call center employees. Guess what? Call center jobs are the first casualty or AI. That means license count reductions across the industry for Salesforce.\n\n3. Salesforce’s own foray into AI has been and is still crap.

And it doesn't exactly matter so long as other companies keep buying them at the rate they are which shows very little signs of stopping. There is a reason AI has so much hype it has the ability to redeveloped the working landscape. \n\nI am not as over the moon as some folks over in r/singularity but I would say it is safe to imagine some form of Artificial general intelligence will happen in our lifetime. Maybe not superintelligence but at least as smart as a human. Hell the Turing test has already been blown out of the water a bit ahead of schedule. \n\nAI easily has potential to generate trillions of dollars in revenue, so 2 trillion seems low to me. And until someone else's GPUs can compare to NVDA it's gunna keep going up. Especially now they have all the means to buy out competitors and the necessary talent to stay on top. Intel isn't even close, AMD hasn't touched their best GPU, Qualcomm? Ha\n\nTo say it will not happen or that it is overhyped to me would be like dogging Humphry Davy for inventing the lightbulb saying no one will use this. Or like the Internet in the early 90s when no one knew what it was. AI will be integrated into every piece of software going forward and it will require GPUs to run and develope. Not to mention they still posted a profit margin of 50% this babys definitely got some more gas in her.\n\nPlus markets don't always react rationally. \n\nBut to me this is like in the CA gold rush the people who made the most money where the stores that sold the pans, shovels, and dynamite for others to go do the hard work finding gold. NVDA is in the perfect spot as long as companies keep racing to build AI they will need NVDA for the tools to build it.

This will be paired with the B-2 and B-21 strategic long range stealth bombers. In the future they will also be paired with NGAD, the US 6th gen long range stealth air superiority fighter. The US also has over 400 bases in the Pacific, making the total destruction or relocation of US assets near impossible. As for Chinese hypersonics it’s a simple matter of math and physics, unless those missiles are made of pure Gajin Stalinium they are burning up at those speeds if they try to make any turn larger than a small course correction of at most a degree. Any object moving that fast generates a field of plasma around it, meaning a sudden direction change of even a couple degrees will result in the projectile incinerating itself. China does not make true hypersonics. Their “hypersonic” glide vehicles slow down as they’re approaching their target to allow for increased maneuverability. Congratulations, you have slapped a fancy label onto a ballistic missile. Even if every hyped up thing the Chinese and the Russians said about their wannabe hypersonics was true it does not change the fact that while your projectile may travel at Mach 10, the laser defense system linked to the AEGIS system on an Arleigh-Burke class destroyer travels at light speed, meaning all it does is point and shoot, no fancy course projections needed. It’s the same reason I laugh when people think drone swarms would be a legitimate issue to an actual first rate military. The US DoD already developed counter measures to this stuff decades ago. Finally, China would not attack the US mainland because 1. They lack the strategic assets for it 2. They know this will simply enrage the US, causing the US to commit to not just the defense of Taiwan but the capitulation of the CCP, an enraged US is a terrifying prospect for them. The Three Gorges Dam would last a month tops, cutting a significant amount of Chinese power production and causing the deaths and displacement of millions. 3. It would drag in dozens of other countries who would be obligated by treaties to defend the US (congratulations, this is starting to look more like Iraq by the second) 4. The US can quite literally starve the Chinese out via blockade and by applying diplomatic pressure to anyone who does, it’s the perks of controlling the global reserve currency. Any case of a third world war would be incredibly lopsided in the US favor simply because the US controls the global economy.
