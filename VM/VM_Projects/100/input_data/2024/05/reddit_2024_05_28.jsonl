This plan, approved by shareholders in 2018, is highly performance-based and does not include any regular salary or bonuses. Instead, Musk's compensation is tied to achieving specific, ambitious milestones. Here's a detailed look at the plan and the challenges involved:\n\nKey Specifics of the Compensation Plan:\n\n1. No Salary or Cash Bonuses: Musk does not receive a regular salary or cash bonuses from Tesla. His entire compensation is tied to the company‚Äôs performance.\n   \n2. Milestones and Tranches: The plan consists of 12 tranches. Each tranche is unlocked only if Tesla meets both market capitalization and operational milestones.\n\n3. Market Capitalization Milestones:\n   - The plan requires Tesla‚Äôs market capitalization to increase in $50 billion increments, starting from $100 billion, up to $650 billion.\n  \n - This means Tesla must reach market values of $150 billion, $200 billion, and so on, up to $650 billion.\n \n  - Achieving these milestones is extremely challenging, requiring significant growth in the company‚Äôs stock price, influenced by investor confidence, market conditions, and overall company performance.\n\n4. Operational Milestones:\n   - For each tranche to be unlocked, Tesla must also meet at least one of the following operational targets for the previous four consecutive quarters:\n  \n   - Revenue Milestones: Ranging from $20 billion to $55 billion.\n  \n   - Adjusted EBITDA Milestones: Ranging from $1.5 billion to $18 billion.\n\n5. Tranche Breakdown:\n   - **Tranche 1**: $100 billion market cap, $20 billion revenue or $1.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 2**: $150 billion market cap, $22.5 billion revenue or $3 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 3**: $200 billion market cap, $25 billion revenue or $4.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 4**: $250 billion market cap, $27.5 billion revenue or $6 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 5**: $300 billion market cap, $30 billion revenue or $7.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 6**: $350 billion market cap, $32.5 billion revenue or $9 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 7**: $400 billion market cap, $35 billion revenue or $10.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 8**: $450 billion market cap, $37.5 billion revenue or $12 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 9**: $500 billion market cap, $40 billion revenue or $13.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 10**: $550 billion market cap, $42.5 billion revenue or $15 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 11**: $600 billion market cap, $45 billion revenue or $16.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 12**: $650 billion market cap, $55 billion revenue or $18 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n\n6. Stock Options: Upon achieving a tranche, Musk receives stock options to purchase Tesla shares at a pre-determined price. The value of these options depends on Tesla‚Äôs stock price.\n\n7. Potential Total Value: If all 12 tranches are achieved, Musk would have the right to purchase up to 20.3 million Tesla shares at a fixed price, potentially worth up to $56 billion based on the stock's current value.\n\n8. Difficulty and Achievements:\n   - These milestones are extremely difficult to achieve, requiring Tesla to perform exceptionally well in both market valuation and operational metrics.\n   - Despite these challenges, Elon Musk has managed to unlock several tranches, demonstrating his ability to drive Tesla‚Äôs extraordinary growth.\n   - Under his leadership, Tesla has become one of the most valuable companies globally, surpassing the initial market cap milestones and achieving significant revenue growth, reflecting the company‚Äôs expansion and innovation in electric vehicles and energy solutions.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "ETF has voting right?

It's not about having the best hardware, but having the best performance per $, and best performance per watt. That's what matters in cloud. These big customers don't like to overpay for hardware and have the capabilities to write their own hardware too.\n2. Number #1 is important but irrelevant now. Because right now the most important thing is to get products and models as powerful as possible, release and get market share. To Microsoft it's more important that it gets thousands of people everyday on Copilot, Copilot for desktop and all those things than looking at their hardware bill.\n3. Nvidia's lead isn't as important in hardware as it is in software. Nvidia has been the only vendor that cared that their GPUs played well when machine learning started being a thing a decade ago or so. They contributed a lot both to software and their own drivers. This led to a very powerful effect where software was written and tested mostly on Nvidia, thus making Nvidia GPUs faster and further giving reason people to buy Nvidia in the field. Not only that but Nvidia was generous with research labs, open source contributors, etc, to make sure relevant people in the field made sure software run on their systems.\n4. If you understood number 1, 2 and 3, you can see why Nvidia has a huge lead: Nvidia has the best offering, that runs best in a market that values launching products over sparing costs.\n\nNow, let's get back into Intel:\n\n5) Intel definitely has the capabilities to make very good GPUs for AI. In fact there isn't really that much magic here in transformers: you're doing matrix multiplication on huge arrays in parallel. It's not really rocket science, you're taking matrixes with weights and do matrix math on them. It's not even important that they are the fastest, they just need to be more either cheaper, or draw less power, or be immediately available. But lacking in software integration, right now, Intel either has to catch up on software (anything from Pandas to whatever), or collaborate with a huge customer to make sure their hardware works fine for the customer's use case. E.g. Microsoft by now, may have clear what are their needs to run Copilot for developers and start looking into optimizing the software and hardware bundle to run it.\n\n6) Intel is trying to retake their role as a great foundry, where they have been doing bad for 10 years. Having your best hardware built at TSMC is embarassing. But their 1.8 nm node samples have been very good, in fact Nvidia's CEO has publicly stated that the sampled chips are promising. If Intel can keep pushing there and execute well, for once, avoiding the mistakes of their terrible 10nm node, Intel is going to be positioned in a wonderful position where they will not only be able to produce great chips for themselves, but also customers. So selling wood and iron to shovel makers, in the usual analogy.\n\n7) Intel has lots of assets and patents, the sum of those is likely not that far their market cap value.\n\n8) Intel is poised to receive tens of billions from US and other governments around the world, which will allow them to invest a lot, without spending a dime.\n\n9) Intel's price is severely depressed. Comparisons with IBM are imho a bit blind, the most similar situation at that scale is actually AMD's comeback 10 years ago. Where it was laughed left and right for losing their good foundry business and making a crap chip after the other, especially on CPU side. Yet, AMD executed well several plans and even got profitable and has a moderately good outlook for tomorrow. Intel has more turnaround potential than AMD so if they execute well on the foundry side and can find a good customer to work on with their GPU hardware I see no reason why can't they make a very huge comeback.\n\nNobody here has the crystal ball, I personally hold some Intel, but if I was sure they are a great turnover company i would have more. And I don't. So even though I think there's huge upside potential, I am quite cautious on it till I don't see more positive informations, at least on their foundry business.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

This will be paired with the B-2 and B-21 strategic long range stealth bombers. In the future they will also be paired with NGAD, the US 6th gen long range stealth air superiority fighter. The US also has over 400 bases in the Pacific, making the total destruction or relocation of US assets near impossible. As for Chinese hypersonics it‚Äôs a simple matter of math and physics, unless those missiles are made of pure Gajin Stalinium they are burning up at those speeds if they try to make any turn larger than a small course correction of at most a degree. Any object moving that fast generates a field of plasma around it, meaning a sudden direction change of even a couple degrees will result in the projectile incinerating itself. China does not make true hypersonics. Their ‚Äúhypersonic‚Äù glide vehicles slow down as they‚Äôre approaching their target to allow for increased maneuverability. Congratulations, you have slapped a fancy label onto a ballistic missile. Even if every hyped up thing the Chinese and the Russians said about their wannabe hypersonics was true it does not change the fact that while your projectile may travel at Mach 10, the laser defense system linked to the AEGIS system on an Arleigh-Burke class destroyer travels at light speed, meaning all it does is point and shoot, no fancy course projections needed. It‚Äôs the same reason I laugh when people think drone swarms would be a legitimate issue to an actual first rate military. The US DoD already developed counter measures to this stuff decades ago. Finally, China would not attack the US mainland because 1. They lack the strategic assets for it 2. They know this will simply enrage the US, causing the US to commit to not just the defense of Taiwan but the capitulation of the CCP, an enraged US is a terrifying prospect for them.

Any case of a third world war would be incredibly lopsided in the US favor simply because the US controls the global economy.
