What do you think buying a stock is about? Looking at a ticker symbol on a screen and hoping it goes up?

I’m not trying to be mean - I’m being serious when I say plenty like you got completely wiped out in the 2022 bear market as they had no idea how much anything was worth and kept selling with the trend. \n\nAs for my valuation - when I bought the stock it was with 20% revenue growth expectations till 2026 (as guided by their own investor days), gross margins of 55% and net profit margins 20% (this is assuming their effective tax rate remains low at 10%). From this I estimated a 2026 revenue and net income which I slapped a 20 p/e multiple on. This gave me a market cap of 220 billion usd in 2026. Assuming the share count remains the same that’s a 2026 share price of roughly $140. That’s double my money in 4 years (I bought at $68 in 2022). \n\nOf course I didn’t anticipate the AI boom narrative so we reached that much sooner and I have sold out my initial capital for safety.

Both pass. Musk stays and continues as CEO, A) is a vote of confidence for Musk and this gives him reassurance that he has enough support to see through his plans regardless what happens in the Delaware compensation case (it might not get reinstated either way, but doing so would certainly be the easiest), a new compensation package (2024 CEO compensation package) is introduced with the help of supervoting shares to get Musk to 25% of voting control. If the Delaware case is not overturned in appeal then this package needs to probably be much more dilutive.\n2. A) passes, B) fails. Musk still has the backing of the shareholders so he most likely stays but things get more complicated as the Delaware court can basically keep blocking any new compensation package as unreasonable. The failure to reincorporate needs 50% of outstanding shares to vote yes, those that do not vote are automatically counted as \"No\" votes, even Elons and Kimblas shares as they are recused due to Musk tweeting about the move. This means even if the move would be supported in principle by the majority, people don't vote or can't vote (latter is the case in many European brokers).\n3. A) fails, B) passes. This seems very unlikely, but might work similarly as scenario 1) just with Musk having less trust in the shareholders with the risk of some of his plans starting to get blocked. If Musk thinks people still want him as CEO but just want to add the old package into a new comp package somehow and that one is approved with the help of newly created supervoting shares, he could still get the 25% control and stay. This scenario is just very, very unlikely as it generally seems to me that the move is less popular, but not only that it is mechanically more difficult as it needs +50% shareholder approval from all shareholders, not just the ones voting.\n4. Both fail. Musk might still stay, however that is not guaranteed. To stay, there would need to be a way to get to 25% and without the old comp package that gets close to 20% and supervoting shares, that just seems somewhat unrealistic. Buybacks aren't realistic to get from 13%->25% in the semi-short term.\n\nWhat happens if Musk decides to leave Tesla/can't get to 25% control with the current situation? The 25% is about having control to go after the projects he personally thinks are the best without the whims of the (mostly) short term public shareholders but it is also about powerful AI/robot system not getting into the wrong hands from his perspective (doesn't really matter if you agree with him on this, what matters is does he think this or not).\n\nThere are some different scenarios how Musk starts doing the AI/robotics thing if 4) happens, but in most of them retail shareholders don't get to share in those gains.\n\n* Musk leaves Tesla and buys the Optimus program from Tesla with (a portion) of his shares. The markets do not really value Optimus yet and Tesla isn't seen as an AI company. In some sense Tesla is just one of dozens of companies starting to do humanoid robots. So this isn't really that impossible. Retail don't get Optimus gains.\n* Musk leaves Tesla, divests from Tesla (slowly or quickly, who knows) and builds a new humanoid robot program in a new company or inside xAI for instance. Optimus was started just a few years ago so he would be starting from behind but like with xAI compared to OpenAI, but you could argue less behind as its only about 3 years instead of 5. There would probably be lawsuits, but would the lawsuit stop this? I don't think so. Depending on who stays in Tesla to lead and what happens to the board and so on, its not impossible for Optimus to just get cancelled alltogether as some pointless moonshot (this is not an uncommon sentiment anyway). FSD still gets over the finish line as its very close to happening anyway, Musk has said it will happen with or without him and many AI engineers that have left to their own startups recently have also said that FSD is on a trajectory to working. FSD v12.4 should be dropping now and will eliminate the wheel nag for instance.  Retail don't get Optimus gains.\n* Musk leaves as CEO, Tesla gets re-rated as a car company and the stock drops. If it drops enough, Musk might have enough leverage from his other companies and perhaps some partners to take Tesla private (Musks non-Tesla holdings are valued at about 90-100bil right now and Starlink is just starting to grow). He gets sufficient control. Retail doesn't get FSD/Robotaxi gains nor Optimus.\n* Musk leaves as CEO, Tesla gets re-rated as in the above scenario, but Musk buys back to get sufficient control and still keeps Tesla public.\n\nThere could also be a combination of these scenarios, say Musk leaves, starts competing with respect to a humanoid robot, the Tesla Optimus programme flounders without him, he buys it from Tesla or the floundering means Tesla gets slowly re-rated as just a car company and Musk buys Tesla and then either takes it private or gets sufficient control to be comfortable in actually building it in Tesla after all and lets say Tesla then buys xAI to fold all of that in.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "I'll vote for everything yes if he posts a diddy style video for 2022", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think it's highly unlikely Elon leaves under any scenario listed here, it's not in his nature.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Petty, vindictive, and willing to lash out, making decisions not in his own or his company's best interest?\n\nYou sure?

Inflation peaked around 18% in 1946 and 1947 due to pent-up consumer demand and the removal of wartime price controls. \n\nIn the 1970s, inflation surged due to Nixon ending the gold standard, oil shocks, and extremely loose monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Today, in 2024, post-COVID inflation is prevalent. While many economists compare this period to the 1970s, it is more akin to the 1940s due to rising government debt despite high interest rates of 5%.\n\nTo make it short:\n\n1940s: The government was spending a lot of money on stimmy checks.\n\n1970s: Excessive bank credit creation and supply shocks were the main driver of inflation.\n\nPeople look at the 1970s playbook and think that raising rates to tighten new credit creation to the point of banks going bust is the way to got.\n\nThe problem is, that todays inflation is a mix of both, but mostly direct fiscal stimulus to the consumer (child tax credit, PPP loans, student loan forgiveness, welfare state programms, etc.)\n\nThe real problem is government spending.\n\nThe Fed can somewhat influence fiscal policy by raising rates and making debt unaffordable (look at the US debt clock), but we all know the Fed has no balls and will crack under the political pressure to lower rates.\n\nThe input: Government spends more money on state programs, debt or long term investments.\n\nThe problem: The divide between rich and poor will get a lot bigger, because this time the money creation isn't only in the financial sector. We will see people living in tents next to gated villas. It's either lambo or cardboard box.

But nobody wants to cut social security, etc. because a lot of voters are dependend on it. The state also has to shrink, or we have a bloated state as the main employer and not the private sector.\n\nThe endgame: This usually leads in the restructuring of the currency and the goal is to hold 10-20% in asstets that the state couldn't take away from you by taxing it to death or simply knocking on your door to buy it back from you at market price.

The next additional revenue will be much harder to come by, because they must come from other companies that's not the megacap stocks, and those other companies have a lot less funds allocated for capex.

Where exactly do you think the next 200-400 billions of ANNUAL revenues are coming from? Megacap companies make up about half of NVDA revenues.

If you consider all the actions and thoughts that any human has ever had, most everyone has had the same basic human experience. Anger, fear, envy, sexual desire, passion, stress, anxiety etc. even the way these emotions are physically expressed are standard human behaviour. Fighting, fleeing, having sex, making a purchase, chasing a hobby, manipulating others. How often are these expressed? Probably can be charted as a percentage. Homicides rank 15/100000 in the Americas, so 0.00015% of the population express murder in response to some emotional agonist. I only use this metric because it's readily available, but you can see where I'm going. Nobody is a trail blazer in terms of human behaviour. We are a function of our hormones and habits. Realistically, AI will optimise the extraction of resources through the population through sales/ads tactics. But to think that this will be meaningfully used in ways other than for monetary benefit, and instead be used to 'out' someone's habits misunderstands the premise of the technology. You can see what happens companies try to extract maximum value from their users by increasing ad volume, Facebook is a perfect example. Ads increase to the point where the original point of connecting to others is forgotten and people tend to just 'wake up' and remove themselves from that eco system. My point is that, these systems are only as lucrative as the people that use them, and if the cost is prohibitive, people stop using them.
