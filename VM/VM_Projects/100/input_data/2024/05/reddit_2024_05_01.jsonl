But remember that the people posting in this subreddit are in the top 10% or 20% most knowledgable and informed retail investors - if you read this paragraph and want to argue with it, then remember I'm not talking about you.)\n\nIt's ok for a fund to lose money, as long as the retail investor's advisor can point to the S&P 500 and say \"look, it's gone down too; everything's lost money this year - what else are you gonna invest your money in?\" But if a fund loses money when the stockmarket is going up then it's going to see outflows - investors are going to sell the fund and invest their money somewhere else. Their friends will laugh at them and say \"this should be a lesson to you, no-one can beat the index\" - their friends will tell them all the kinds of things you hear from the index investors here on Reddit. Maybe it's ok to underperform the index for a year or so, but the managers of active funds are not allowed to significantly underperform the index for much longer than that - this is called \"career risk\".\n\nActive managers are not allowed to invest with \"conviction\" because their bosses won't tolerate this risk. \n\nConsequently, the vast majority of actively managed funds become closet trackers (a.k.a. *stealth trackers* or *index huggers*). They invest in a large enough number of stocks to diversify the risk down to systemic levels, but they basically get the same performance as an index tracker - a little bit more one month, a little less the next. BUT the actively managed fund has higher fees and costs, so it averages 1% a year less than the index. \n\nThis kind of mediocrity is acceptable - everyone in the industry knows and understands that they can't beat the index, and the fees and costs are unavoidable. As long as the underperformance isn't greater than the fund's OCF (TER) then everybody is happy - the sales team can go out and market the fund, there's a blurb about \"exploring opportunities for excellence and growth\" and the fund is pushed to suckers in the brochures of company 401k schemes. The fund's management make their money.\n\nWhen the advocates of passive investing say \"no-one is beating the market\" the part that they're not saying is that almost no-one in the industry is actually *trying* to beat the market.

Over shorter periods external supply shocks can impact rates if they cause inflation, but when the shock abates rates should drop.\n\nToday we have historically slow growth, but some questions over fiscal discipline and the persistency of supply shocks.

Unless you genuinely believe there are immediate concerns over debt and fiscal spending in the US it's hard to see how 5-6% rates could be sustainable in an economy growing at barely ~2% a year.

For example, people have suggest that because a large percentage of the population in the US are wealthy pensioners there is a lot of economic demand without much labour supply which could be inflationary. But again, Japan suggests if anything the opposite should be true and perhaps more pensioners an economy has the slower the growth and the lower rates should fall.\n\nBut who knows man.

I know he wants to shake shit up, but he's forgetting some very fundamental business processes.\n\n1. His constant dropping of prices has caused people (waiting on cars) to have their agreements cancelled, or sign - up to 11 final notices of payment.... and then have the automatic systems complain they don't have the money hey cause all the fucking lease documents get resigned and re-approved every time he does it.\n2. The people and financiers are now in a riskier asset position with loans and insurance payouts (in he event of an accident), as the net value of the fleet decreases.   Floating prices works well with low value items, but items that need to be financed and insured, it doesn't work so well with.\n3. Quality and advancement value proposition.   Tesla is about 10 engineering years ahead of everyone else.  It should be in quality too.   This is the main problem out of the US at the moment.  The chinese made Tesla have, by all accounts, nailed quality.\n4. He should offset that by giving everyone with a car purchased in the last 6 month free FSD.  That will cover the value gap, and the only cost to him is forgoing revenue on that 6 months of cars.\n5. Elon needs to stop fucking around with \"testing the AI in a different company\".   I know he wants to wrest control back from the private capital firms, but fuck me dude, they are along for the ride and have backed your arse.  There are real investors behind those funds, 401k funds, mum and pops and some other big players.   Just because you're libertarian and fucking rich, you don't get to make the rules.\n6. He needs to watch his staff.   I 100% percent guarantee you Kia, Hyundai, Audi, BMW, VW, Fisker, BYD just hoovered up a whole shittonne of your intellectual property - just like he hoovered by Bang and Olufsen's.  IP walks out the door, whether you have it written down and secured in your wiki or not.\n7. Honestly, I feel the company would be better off if those 14,000 employees were retained.   In order for break even for firing them, he would need have been paying those employees 3.2 million each.   I suspect they were paid under 1/10th of that (when allowing for all expenses).  So you could have ramped up the workforce by, say, 100,000 employees, to deliver better service.  Make better cars.  Do more R&D.  Do outreach.   Maybe even battle the bullshit campaign online by the AII.\n8. He had to hit certain sales targets, that's what was missed.  Point 7 is your the answer to that.    Get a bunch of southern people to target the hell out of cybertruck quality, and go around destroying 150's off the line at every set of lights.  Go target that market of truck lovin people.   Go build a second smaller truck.  He'll not hit those sales targets by trying to sell Teslas to the same people.  Open it up to more people.   Look at the Australian market - the government got onside to set aside luxury car taxes and make incentives - and now Australia is hoovering up model Y's faster than you can ship them down here.  Don't worry about pissing off the people who love to hug trees... they will see what you are up to.   They will see what is happening for that market is doing the right thing and making the change.\n9. The shareholders of Tesla should not fund the shitshow of X.   X is literally the product of his inability to stop and navel gaze for a second.    Take a smaller paycheck, pay down some of the debt, keep working at it like he did with Tesla.    Cutting back doesn't make it better, and promoting it doesn't make it better.  Want, a chat platform that is everything, you need to make a WeChat - and the chinese government poured a mountain of money into that, and got the opposite of free speech. Putting no money into it doesn't magically make it free speech - it just makes it a 4chan app.  You need to figure out how to pour a mountain of money into it and make free speech pay - but without the arseholes, which devaule your platform (and, to be frank, the authoritarian leaders are going to make it fail for you because its in their interests).     Tesla worked because he bought agile to the auto industry.   Twitter had that already.  He needs another party trick.\n\nIts a hard gig you have there, Elcon.

At a reasonable rate of return like 8% you would need over 200k of capital to get your 20k. Problem is that you have to scrape the 20k off the top so it doesn‚Äôt compound into the future. You also owe capital gains taxes on it. \n\nAt your level, which looks to have been about 4500 dollars, you would have had to 6x that to withdraw 20k and have your original 4500 to continue investing with.\n\nThat‚Äôs 600% gains annually. It is not realistic. Some of the best investors in the world have only managed like 20% annually. Even really good years for a lot of investors like banner once in a lifetime are only like 30% if even.\n\nRay dalio for instance was hailed by some for his trading around the 2008 crash, many saying he predicted a crash and avoided large losses. His best year in the past 15 years? 27% return. \n\nYou can play this fun game with day traders too, ask a day trader what their goal is either daily weekly or monthly then annualize it out. They will often tell you oh if I could make 1% a day I‚Äôd be happy. Well there‚Äôs 252 trading days a year so that‚Äôs fucking 252% gain annually.\n\nNot realistic. And to show how not realistic it is you can play another fun game. If you started with only 1000 dollars at that rate of return you‚Äôd have 252,000 dollars in a year. Off 1k. In 2-3 years you‚Äôd be the richest person in the history of the world. \n\nThe only people who can consistently do the thing you‚Äôre talking about doing are people with enough capital that they already don‚Äôt have to work. If you have 10 million dollars to invest you can make a livable return consistently on a yearly basis.\n\nSo to anyone who thinks like OP - stop. It‚Äôs not gonna happen for you. You will not trade away your job. You‚Äôll much more likely lose the capital and end up having to work harder or longer to get it back.\n\nYou should think in reverse to this.

It doesn't compare, the game is not the same, the money is not the same , the strategies are not the same. Liquidity becomes an issue once you get big enough. Law of diminishing returns does kick in, it applies to retail traders as well but especially those big account traders he mentioned...27% on 30 million is different than 27% on a 30k account, usually as a trader gets bigger, as long as they remain consistent, the PERCENTAGE gain will get smaller over time, but the account grows, so they make more money... talking percentages is cool, nothing wrong with it, but for a retail trader at the end of the day it's about how much money you're withdrawing and able to pay your tax and spend... percentages are not as important for retail as people act like they are, we aren't fucking hedge funds. If you're dealing with a small account it's incredibly easy to beat 30%. The whole thing he mentioned dealing with living off of trading, I don't disagree with him on though, it's incredibly hard. It's the hardest way to make easy money. But it's not impossible... And far more retail are able to accomplish it these days than it used to be, mainly because of technology and access of electronic trading, you used to have to pretty much be on the floor to make any kind of real money, these days anybody can trade like they are on the floor, without having to buy a seat, you just deposit the money to a broker. 200k account, depending on what you are trade, a good trader can flip that in a year, there are traders out there that do it. Ross Cameron from warrior trading does sht like that consistently, and he has broker statements to prove it, he is not a prop firm trader, he's not a hedge fund trader, he's a retail trader... And tbh his strategy isn't super complicated he doesn't even short that often...he scalps small caps off bullish momentum, but it's complicated enough plenty of people will fuck it up which is why he got sued. Regardless, thinking like this guy, yeah you'll never do it, anybody who gets into trading and just focuses on the climb, will most likely not make it to the top of the hill, and if they do, they'll probably self sabotage like we see on wsb loss posts so often. It's clear to me when I look at all these equity curves, a lot of people pull self sabotage moves eventually and give it back, then go back to climbing the hill again or quit. Climbing the hill to many retail traders is more exciting than being at the top anyways.

SMCI = Actually came in flat and reguided upwards on full year outlook. People need to understand that SMCI is a fraction of Nvidia's business. VRT is a great company and also a great partner in this exact same space so diversify that holding. Next, ASML guided upward the exact same way. More to come towards the back half of the year. Buy the dip. The reason for this is that their business model is completely different and cyclical to Nvidia's. 1 is pre-sale nvidia and 2 the other is post sale installation to nvidia. To put it in perspective, Jensen just delivered the 1st H200 to OpenAI. That took me by surprise. The 1st? I thought they had a million of those things out by now.\n2. Supply chain constraints are the lifeblood of Nvidia's business. This is simply supply and demand microeconomics. While it may hurt an SMCI it does nothing but drive Nvidia's prices up. Also, this has a smoothing effect that I think will play out with Nvidia just posting strong earnings because it's not even fathomable how many chips are needed and what is even actually out there.\n3. Everyone that is directly relating to Nvidia is actually posting good news that nobody is paying attention to. Samsung just had record earnings from selling phones and HBM memory. TSM reported strong demand for AI chips over their other chips that have nothing to do with Nvidia. Qualcomm just posted AH good earnings. Meta, AWS, Tesla, and Microsoft all reported increased CapEx spend to just purchase and do more and more AI. Meta got hammered for spending too much on AI lol. It's crazy.\n4. Bonus. Nobody caught this zinger on the Microsoft call and this directly relates to Nvidia. The throughput you can obtain from Microsoft is being crushed downwards because they don't have \"enough\" capacity. They posted a +7% AI spend for their Azure revenues. An analyst asked Microsoft why wasn't it higher (effectively) and the response was because they just don't have the capacity to meet the demand. I can verify 1st hand this is true. They even went further to say that for Copilot they have dedicated capacity so that the demand doesn't affect Copilot usage.\n5. I think Apple is a sleeper here. What better time, unless they drop after earnings, to buy Apple. If there is a time to get in it's now. The Rabbit and Pin are stupid and people will do all of those things on the IPhone and Galaxy phones. No need for another device. It's coming.

You really going to believe that china has played a 60 year long conspiracy to sell a plane rather than believe that boeing execs are just greedy and incompetant? Also this benefits airbus more than comac. I think you might just be suffering from red scare era propoganda where you see china conspiracies and threats everywhere even when the answer is clearly just that the profit driven MBAs and accountants at boeing are cutting quality and safety measures for more profit.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Did you read my whole comment?
