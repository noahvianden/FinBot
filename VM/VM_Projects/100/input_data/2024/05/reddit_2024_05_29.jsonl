I just think your reasons are based on a very limited view centered around LLM, but AI is so much more than LLM.\n\nWe don’t often see “monetization” of AI in the form of revenues because the benefits are mostly captured as efficiency gains. What you see is massive investments in data centers by companies, not necessarily for the purpose of developing LLMs, but a broader set of AI applications meant to replace human tasks or enhance human capabilities. The result is reductions in personnel everywhere. This trend has been underway for quite some time now and has displaced a lot of technical jobs — it’s an old tale we’ve all heard about. While the trend is not new anymore, I believe there is still room for growth as many traditional industries are still lagging behind on AI adoption. \n\nLLM, along with generative AI, is the newer AI trend that is again driving further investments in data centers. The difference is that it’s now displacing creative jobs. Copywriter has literally become an obsolete profession overnight. I personally believe that there is a huge potential for growth there. The demand will likely continue as adoption of AI tools spread in creative fields, and the efficiency gains can be even more significant than in technical applications — imagine your favorite writer can now publish 10 books a year; blockbuster movies now cost less than a million to produce. Especially with image rendering and voice AI technologies… you don’t even need to have the actual actors on set (this is already a common practice in China btw). Here you do see many startups capitalizing on generative AI tools, and guess what? NVDA has already invested in quite a few of them. \n\nAnd the point about competition — there is a lot of proprietary technology and knowledge involved in chipmaking. If it were so easy to develop your own, TSMC would not [still] be making more than 50% of the world’s chips — everybody’s been trying to catch up to TSMC for as long as China wants to invade Taiwan lol. It’s literally the only thing that the Chinese has not been able to copy! I can only imagine the NVDA chips are even more sophisticated — not to mention there is already a whole ecosystem around their chips that’s widely adopted by developers. \n\nHowever, as far as the stock price goes, since US investors are largely driven by stuff that they hear on the news like the GPT releases, maybe just as you predicted, the stock will likely fall if the next version is underwhelming, for a little while. \n\nI would still hold my 300 shares, though.

Nvidia is making so much money because AI training hardware is in high demand, but right now that money comes directly from investors in AI startups. Other forms of AI work done these days from LLMs are still based on transformers, the training effort is still high. If AI does not turn *revenue* then that demand will dry up. Current revenue streams aren’t good enough yet, in large part because it’s not good enough yet. \n\n AI is not *currently* at a state for mass-adoption with a high revenue stream. The efficiency/productivity gains just aren’t high enough yet for companies to pay for it. Everyone knows AI *could* be transformative, but it *isn’t yet.* the point is that if we see qualitative performance leaps plateau from increased compute effort, then the writing is on the wall for demand to drop.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "I think both you and the previous commenter have a very narrow and limited understanding of what AI is and the various AI applications, as well as how companies are leveraging AI and NVDA’s technology.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "That’s silly. We’re not talking about applications, we’re talking about markets and training. All of the current AI hype is fundamentally based on transformers, which need training. That training is expensive. Sure you can build smaller models for targeted applications, but there are limits to how accurate any model can get without extensive training data, and there are limits to the training data sizes for smaller applications.. Smaller models will ultimately just split the training hardware market across more, smaller, customers. That doesn’t necessarily change the market size.\n\nWe don’t know the *cost* scaling laws for AI training well. The previous commenter’s point was that if the scaling law is poor, then training hardware demand will increase slower. That’s not really a controversial statement. Even if model size and application breadth changes, that doesn’t change the general conclusion that if the scaling law is power, then Nvidia’s price will start being more and more priced in.\n\nPoor growth of hardware demand = poor growth for Nvidia revenue. This is really really straightforward. There are second order effects, sure, (AI might enhance AI training hardware productivity for instance) but there’s a reason we call them second order. This isn’t a claim that Nvidia will stop selling products or die, or even that sales will drop.

You get no money for this job. But in 7 years, if you Teslas stock is worth more we will dilute you some shares.

That was a good %&$#ing deal and we voted yes on it. To then have some %&$# file a lawsuit and take that from him AFTER we hit that goal?

Which means the price/market cap of the stock is the same as it’s yearly revenue. The higher price grows over revenue the more of a premium you’re paying for every dollar your company is grossing. Your valuation model isn’t a valuation model. A pretty normal premium is 1-3x revenue. P/s 1to3. Highs 3to9, anything in the teens is absurd unless the cost is nonexistent and the margins are astronomical. Below 1 is very low and either signals severely undervalued companies or deeply fundamentally troubled companies. Off market when you buy a whole company however you usually try to pay below P/S 1. Nobody buys a little company at a premium unless maybe the odd anomaly. \n\nIn theory you can have a P/E and P/S value being the same but that would mean you have 0 cost and 100% earnings on every dollar of revenue! But the higher the net margin the higher a p/s value can be without being obscene. \n\nSo for instance take a mature and normal company having a P/E value of 15. Meaning it takes 15 years for the company to net profit earn their market cap / price back after all yearly costs without even growing revenue or earnings. (Which should be payed to owners in dividends but rarely isn’t in public companies). If said company has a p/s value of 1 it directly means they have a low margin compared to p/e 15 and must sell a lot of product / service to earn big bucks. Net profits is 1/15 of revenue. \n\nIf instead they have a P/E of 15 and a P/S of 7.5 it means they have a 1/2 ratio or 50% net margin after all costs which automatically means they don’t have to gross as much to earn back their price (of buying the whole company). All P/S = 30 vs P/S = 80 proves is that P(rice) has grown from 30x to 80x over SALES/REVENUE. If the overlaying value grows more than the underlying value in this case stock PRICE you have a stock PRICE bubble!\n\nBut the fickle thing about valuing a company by earnings is earnings can evaporate in just a quarter. Which is why you always value based on at least P/B, P/S and P/E. Actually even more things if you want to deep dive but these are the 3 most common ratios to make it easy to overlook a company’s fundamentals. And the real value is in the former two not the latter since like I said earnings come and go!\n\nEssentially your whole post is utter nonsense! Is really +-/x, middle school math that hard to understand. You know - is the opposite of + and division is multiplication backwards right? \n\nFor you to learn P/S instead of posting nonsense on Reddit you could have read 5 minutes of investopedia! \n\nGood luck with that model, plenty of other regards out there that thinks exactly like you. Which is even why we end up in these shitfests in the first place! We live in a fact resistant world spreading copious amounts of nonsense information online.

The existence of Majorana modes would be the first major discovery since the Higgs. It's impactful for neutrinos which might be Majorana going by physics outside the Standard Model, and Chern-Simons theory can manipulate them to store information in knots.\n\nWhat Nvidia has is powerful AI and years of experience telling them where to position logic gates and transistors on a die to achieve minimum time-of-flight of data going from one mathematical operation to the next based on what's typical.  Of course, this can get very complicated very quickly when you allow transistors to be used as switches controlling the flow of data as well as altering the mathematical operation to another.\n\nNvidia might have physicists in their employ as well, but they would need a team of postdocs caught up to the 1970's physics literature at the least to push the science, you'd probably see a bunch of purchases of noble gases and nitrogen... They'd probably sooner start trying to make their own silicon wafers — something I or anyone who's been taught the Czochralski process could do.  And without their own fab, I don't see how they could switch out all the wires (and traces and vias and so on) for superconductors, assuming it even is possible at a decent scale.  Of course, the buyer's going to need their own specialized facility with liquid nitrogen probably exceeding the cost of any cooling system for their regular data centers.  The only reason Nvidia might start incorporating superconductors is if they need a Josephson junction for something specifically, say as a SQUID magnetometer for a humanoid robotics program.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That’s all cool, but I’m still curious about what you said above about how I could either buy other chips to obtain the FLOPs I’m looking for and spend massive amount of money on cooling or I could just go buy Nvidia chips.  Could you please expand on that?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, sure.  There was a conference a month ago with Nvidia, MSFT, AMZN, etc. and 90% of it they were all talking about the pros & cons of copper cabling v. ethernet cables v. Nvidia's infiniband and a bunch of others.  I wasn't paying too much attention but it's very much an unsolved problem with a lot of engineering manpower being thrown at it currently.\n\nWith infiniband in the running that means you could buy other chips to get your FLOPs but use Nvidia's infiniband to lower your cooling costs.  Indeed, that's exactly what Microsoft is doing I believe.  So Nvidia wins even if it loses.\n\nAt a certain point though, you're going to hit a heat limit even with infiniband and then you're forced to go with Nvidia chips.  Semiconductors don't like heat, there is something called the temperature coefficient which controls how much reverse biased current flows and at what voltage.  \n\nWe typically think of a transistor as two ideal diodes back-to-back (a pnp or npn junction of semiconductors).  If a diode is ideal, then current can only flow one way through it.  No diode is ideal however, at a high enough voltage the diode will temporarily break down and allow current to pass through it.\n\nSome diodes like Zener diodes are designed to exploit the reverse-bias breakdown effect without suffering any damage, but most diodes (in particular the MOSFET diodes found in IC chips) will suffer catastrophic irreparable damage known as an avalanche breakdown if the breakdown voltage is sustained for any decent length of time, destroying not only the chip but also potentially surrounding chips or even starting a fire.  Essentially this is due to the breakdown current producing heat which lowers the breakdown voltage (thanks to the temperature coefficient) which lowers the resistance which increases the current which increases heat, and so on...\n\nSo you see, the concern over energy efficiency is not purely because of a desire to minimize operating costs.  It's also about: how much you're paying for fire insurance; what else is in the building that might be destroyed; what data might be lost if the servers have an avalanche breakdown; what damage to your reputation might you suffer; how sure are you that your cooling systems are not only sufficient but won't suffer an interruption; what climate is your server located in; is your server located next to any chemical plants or proximal to a fire station that has experience with electrical fires; how much empty space are you willing to allocate to the server room taking into account a property tax that is typically ~1/4 of the property value nowadays; how much protection do you already have in place anyways for things like dealing with the consequences of a voltage spike or solar flare; how many employees would need to be evacuated; how much will your liability/life insurance premiums go up; how much property deprecation have you rolled off or claimed; how expensive will it be to install and maintain monitoring sensors and CO2 dispersal systems and emergency ventilation or containment; how sure are you something like an earthquake won't disrupt the cooling and CO2 lines at the same time; are there any transformers or other things with inductors or capacitors in them that could allow power to continue to be supplied even after the circuit is broken?  \n\nThat's everything I can think of but there's probably more.  Since an avalanche breakdown is similar in principle to a nuclear chain reaction just far less dangerous, just imagine all the same engineering that goes into the safety considerations of a nuclear power plant and now imagine the consequences of overlooking anything will become worse the more heat you expect to generate.  In fact, the steady operating temperature in the core of the data center will rise proportional to the square root of its width in meters, and that's assuming you're scaling your cooling system to match in size.\n\nNow all this is typically fine because companies chunk their servers into different geographic clusters anyway, distributed cloud computing reduces latency and eases privacy concerns.  This only becomes a problem with hosting the hundred/thousand billion parameter LLMs.  Suddenly 1 XL model is still significantly better than 2 half-sized models even at ridiculous sizes whereas most simulation problems people need supercomputers for can typically be chunked or have more extreme diminishing returns with processing power (most are non-polynomial time algorithms).", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "!RemindMe 1 year", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2025-05-29 04:38:34 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2025-05-29%2004:38:34%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d309y1/nvidias_market_cap_has_officially_surpassed_that/l64r1e6/?context=3)\n\n[**7 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2F1d309y1%2Fnvidias_market_cap_has_officially_surpassed_that%2Fl64r1e6%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202025-05-29%2004%3A38%3A34%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%201d309y1)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Where do yall think people would stop buying? $125?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not in the business of predicting just how stupid and irrational people are collectively.

The problem with Intel is they make computer chips. Nothing is really wrong with that, but it's a very competitive space. For a long time Intel dominated because in \\~2004 they figured out how to link to CPUs together to share a workload - called them \"cores\" - and so they had a nice run. They made a machine so big and complex that no one person understands it. Present tense is appropriate, because no one is allowed to understand it all completely. You see, if someone understood the machine, they could build a better one. \n\nNow the current problem with Intel: they are unable to innovate. Innovation is the opposite of optimization. Intel is really good at optimizing, and if they had a better product, that would be the way to success. \n\nHowever, AMD exists. AMD figured out how to link a bunch of incomplete-CPUs together - called them \"chiplets\" - and so now they make better CPUs than Intel. When only two companies make a product, the product quality and performance matters a lot more than the price difference or the business relationships or even the brand loyalty that exists in the marketplace. \n\nYour bet implies that INTC will be able to make a 'better' CPU than AMD in the next year, which they can't. I read an article that said Intel just bought a new fancy machine to make their newest chips, and that they are the only ones who can buy the machine for 2 years or something. Well, that means they are going to spend a year plugging the machine into the wall. The second year they will make chips that aren't as good as the ones they can make today, and in the 3rd year they will make something worth selling, but AMD will have spent 0 days figuring out how to use a new machine. AMD will have been innovating for 3 years. AMD is the play. INTC to $0 by 2035.", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "How should I repost this lmao.
