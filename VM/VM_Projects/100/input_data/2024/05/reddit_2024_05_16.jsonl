For the first time, its delivery business surpassed its store pickup in terms of volume, Rainey said.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got customers that are coming to us more frequently than they have before and newer customers that we haven‚Äôt traditionally had, and they‚Äôre coming into a Walmart whether it‚Äôs a virtual store online, or whether it‚Äôs one of our physical stores,‚Äù he said.\n\nHere‚Äôs what the discounter reported for the three-month period that ended April 30 compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 60 cents adjusted vs. 52 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $161.51 billion vs. $159.50 billion\n\nWalmart‚Äôs net income jumped to $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared with $1.67 billion, or 21 cents per share, in the year-ago period.\n\nRevenue climbed 6% from $152.30 billion in the year-ago quarter. That increase includes a benefit of roughly 1% from an additional selling day in the period. \n\nAs the nation‚Äôs largest retailer and private employer, Walmart is often viewed as a bellwether for the U.S. economy. Yet it has generally fared better during an inflationary period than other retailers because it sells staples like groceries and has a value-oriented reputation. That trend continued in the quarter, as the company \n\nSame-store sales for Walmart U.S. climbed by 3.8%, excluding fuel. The industry metric includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year. At Sam‚Äôs Club, same-store sales rose 4.4% year over year, excluding fuel.\n\nE-commerce sales shot up by 22% year over year for Walmart U.S., fueled by store pickup and delivery of online orders, as well as the company‚Äôs growing third-party marketplace. \n\nThe company also grew high-margin businesses like advertising as it pushes to increase its earnings faster than its sales.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/16/walmart-wmt-q1-2025-earnings-.html", "id": "1ctaa8b", "created_utc": 1715857458.0, "score": 331, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "Isn‚Äôt Walmart winning high income customers a bad sign for the economy at a whole?", "score": 381, "replies": [{"body": "Not if the customers came from Amazon.", "score": 103, "replies": [{"body": "I used to blindly get everything from Amazon because 9 out of 10 times it was cheaper than elsewhere.

I'm just gonna pull what I've already said about INTC recently.\n\n  \nIntel is a play on the growth in demand for CPUs in the near future. Even without their fabs, they still sell one of the highest margin, most profitable product on the planet. The problem is, less people are currently upgrading and less servers/data centers are interested RIGHT NOW. Most companies upgrade on a time table, and with high interest rates and a slowdown in VC funding, a lot of tech companies are choosing to hold on with their current tech lineup. That combined with the fact Intel hasn't released any major CPU upgrades since the end of 2022(13th gen) means less people are overly eager to upgrade. Now, this is likely to change. People will begin to upgrade again, especially once 15th gen comes out, and eventually servers are gonna need new chips. This will be the primary revenue driver for the next few years, and should bring the company up to peak revenue and profit during 2021. As for the fab side of the business, I really don't get what people are all up in arms about. The fab business has always operated at a loss, because it's there to support the chipmaking side of the business. Now that they're choosing to report fab losses independently of total chipmaking revenue, everyone's all up in arms about the losses. I don't see anyone talking about how Micron loses billions every year on their fabs. Long term, the fab business could be strong, but this again depends on your confidence in current leadership. I personally think Pat Gelsinger is a great CEO that can capably turn this company into a great one, much like he did with VMWare. No one had any hope that Lisa Su would be able to turnaround AMD, but here we are. In my opinion, this is a good play. It's a Monish Pabrai \"High uncertainty, low risk\" type play.

In terms of legal matters, as of May 2024, Tesla is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for potential securities and wire fraud related to statements about the company‚Äôs Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. The investigation is focused on whether Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, made misleading statements about the company‚Äôs Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) features.\n\nTesla is facing legal scrutiny due to accusations of deceiving consumers about its Autopilot and FSD features. Investigators are exploring whether Tesla committed wire fraud, which involves deception in interstate communications, by misleading consumers about its driver-assistance systems. They are also examining whether Tesla committed securities fraud by deceiving investors.\n\nTesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving (FSD) tech is currently the subject of legal allegations. Here are some key points:\n\n* Arbitration Agreement: Tesla has argued that customers have agreed to take any issue to arbitration in their contracts. This means that disputes between Tesla and its customers are decided by an arbitrator, not a judge or jury.\n* Mischaracterization Lawsuits: There have been lawsuits alleging that Tesla made misleading and deceptive statements about its Autopilot and FSD capabilities. However, a U.S. District Judge ruled that the proposed class action lawsuit could not proceed because the plaintiffs were bound by an arbitration agreement.\n* Injury Suits: There have been lawsuits filed by people who were injured while using Autopilot. The outcomes of these cases can vary depending on the specific circumstances of each accident.\n* **Driver Responsibility:** Despite the name ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving,‚Äù Tesla has stated that this feature does not absolve a Tesla driver from the responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle. If FSD operates improperly and a crash occurs as a result, Tesla does not take responsibility for that incident.\n\n**Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology has been in the news recently for several reasons**\n\n**Purchase Rate** - According to credit card data, only about 2% of Tesla owners who used the FSD in the free month trial ended up buying it.\n\nIf Tesla were held fully liable for accidents caused by its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, the potential costs could be significant. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n* Compensation for Damages: Tesla could be responsible for compensating victims for damages and injuries, which could vary widely depending on the severity of each accident.\n* Vehicle Replacement: If a Tesla vehicle is totaled in an accident, the company could potentially be responsible for replacing it.\n* Fines: If investigations find that Tesla is at fault, the company could face fines. For instance, one source suggests that Tesla could face fines of up to $115 million.\n\nIf Tesla‚Äôs FSD is deemed not to deliver on its promises, Tesla might have to refund customers who paid for the feature. Considering an average cost of $10,000 for FSD, this could amount to around **$4 billion** given the number of customers who have reportedly paid for the package so far.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think 98% do", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is why I don‚Äôt trust FSD.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Advertising + Cult of Personality => bonus profit from customer overconfidence in product quality and capabilities.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think 98% of the people appreciated that.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why would Tesla claim responsibility on a level 2 autonomous car?

My guy, the cybertruck right now is in MUCH better condition than the original model S's original production line. That thing was falling apart, and was still widely popular. Arguably the original Model S is what jumpstarted the EV revolution. The cybertruck, like all of teslas products, will have issues, maybe even really bad ones at the beginning, but in 3 years I'm sure 90% of them will be ironed out. Why? Because 90% of critical issues Tesla has had with its other cars has been fixed in 3-5 years after original launch. Say what you will about the current state of the cybertruck but remember that Tesla will not give up on fixing the issues and that this is the worst the cybertruck *will ever be*. Which is why in 5 years there will be millions of them. Just wait and seeü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nGiving himself a raise? Uh, Elon literally refused being paid above minimum wage at tesla in exchange for this comp package. At the time people said it was impossible to 10x the company in under 10 years (the comp package goals). They laughed and said it would never happen, and that Elon should've just taken a normal pay like every other CEO. Well, Elon 10xed the company in 5 years, and also hit the production targets in the comp plan. Now, the bill comes due. Investors have 10xed their money since 2016, and what do they do? Try to take back the reward. It's literal theft. This isn't a pay \"raise\". This is what he agreed to be paid period, instead of a normal wage as CEO. He was literally on minimum wage at Tesla before this. Yes his wealth went up because his stock valuation went up. No, that's not the same thing as being paid because he needs the stock to maintain control of the company. He only sold some to buy Twitter because the comp package was coming up, and I don't think any comp packages like this have been canceled in the history of the US. Also, no, he's not getting a flat $56 billion out of tesla's pocket. That is a lie. He is getting $56 billion in Tesla shares which are unsellable for 5 years. It is unsellable because the point of the comp package is to pay him in percent ownership of the company, as a reward for achieving generally-thought-to-be impossible milestones for Tesla. Without him working his ass off thinking he'd get 25% ownership of Tesla at the end, there would not be 6 million Teslas on the road today. There probably wouldn't even be Tesla, given how close they were to bankruptcy. People need to stop falling for the anti-Elon hate propaganda and keep in mind what actually happened and what he actually did for us. Actions speak louder than words, but people sure love to throw tantrums over what he saysü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nUh, no? Tesla has never been valued as just a car company. If it were, it would be worth around $30-$60/share. Tesla has always been valued as a tech/AI company, and the only reason why the stock has been going down is because of institutional investors growing less confident in Tesla actually being able to pull off what it promised. Aka, FSD/robotaxis. FSD and robotaxis have been talked about since 2016, maybe earlier. That is what the company is valued on.\n\nNot to mention, Tesla is nowhere near fucked. They have $30 billion in cash and practically no debt. And this quarter, Q1 2024 the super terrible quarter, was still profitable by $1.1 billion. Remember how just a few years ago people were saying Tesla would never be profitable? Yeah well now the goal post has moved to \"Oh Tesla won't make 10% margins! Oh my god they're screwed!\" Yeah, no. They're profitable even in bad quarters, have $30 billion in the bank just in case, AND almost no debt. Compare that to Ford, GM, Stellantis, and VW who each have about $5 billion in cash, and between $50 billion and over $200 billion in debt. If a recession happens, Tesla could take out debt to survive. Literally all the major players in Tesla's non-China competition would most likely go bankrupt save for a (another) several billion dollar bail-out by the federal government.\n\nTesla is quite fine financially, so no, they're not even in danger of bankruptcy for the foreseeable future. They have probably 10 years of being able to work on FSD with no return even with terrible market conditions before they're in danger of bankruptcy.
