Much better risk adjusted bets out there. And that’s all investing is… what is the cash flow I’m expecting to get, what’s the risk that cash flow gets delivered and what am I paying for that cash flow. Apple is a company that has a high degree of certainty of cash flows (high valuation) and low growth. That means a low discount rate of future cash flows. The worst combo of investing is low discount rate and low expected growth of cash flows. Apple is in this sweet spot of low upside. Another negative is that it is a large % of indexes so it gets bought indiscriminately by vanguard/etc. This pushes the price up in the short term but leaves it vulnerable to any disappointment in cash flows delivered (earnings). My point is given the high valuation and low growth prospects given the size it is counterintuitevly a high risk play. Could it go higher? Yes. Could they innovate and create another revenue stream? Yes. Have they done this under Tim Cook’s reign? No. They are sitting on mountains of cash and have nothing better to do than buy back shares. Or it’s trapped off shores and they can’t use it. Based on all my background Apple looks to be at the end of its life cycle. Companies at the end of their life cycles (especially those with an installed base like apply) always have great recent returns that give investors comfort. It’s this very comfort that drives their valuations beyond what a reasonable DCF would suggest is fair valuation. This high valuation eventually leads to low prospective returns because investors become impatient with the low cash flows and no longer accept the low discount rate (mentioned earlier) that was applied to those cash flows. So even if they deliver cash flows as expected it’s not enough.\n\nApologies this was bit of a rant but at the end of the day any investment is the present value of future cash flows. You have to decide as an investor what discount rate you’re comfortable accepting for a set of cash flows and if you find an alternative then you will as a rational investor shift your funds. This is where a stock with low growth and a low discount rate has a LOT of downside (AAPL).\n\nEdit: and to anyone that has read this this is from someone that has dedicate 2 decades of his life to investments (CFA charterholder)… ALL that matters is expected cash flows and the discount rate being applied… if either of those change then the stock value will change (typically during earnings releases). What was just reported only slighter matters in that it says whether the company lived up to guidance and what does it say about what they can do in the future. Everything else are inputs to these 2 variables. Once you understand that it becomes a lot easier to evaluate companies. Apply a higher discount rate to less reliable cash flows.

Valuation matters for future returns. They are trading at 27x forward P/E. That is a high multiple usually reserved for high growth. In this case it is for “safety”.

Before reading, I ask you is Apple a buy at ANY price? If not? Then what is a fair price? If you can’t answer that then it should not be a meaningful part of your portfolio…\n\nI would sell a lot a bit. Much better risk adjusted bets out there. And that’s all investing is… what is the cash flow I’m expecting to get, what’s the risk that cash flow gets delivered and what am I paying for that cash flow. Apple is a company that has a high degree of certainty of cash flows (high valuation) and low growth. That means a low discount rate of future cash flows. The worst combo of investing is low discount rate and low expected growth of cash flows. Apple is in this sweet spot of low upside. Another negative is that it is a large % of indexes so it gets bought indiscriminately by vanguard/etc. This pushes the price up in the short term but leaves it vulnerable to any disappointment in cash flows delivered (earnings). My point is given the high valuation and low growth prospects given the size it is counterintuitevly a high risk play. Could it go higher? Yes. Could they innovate and create another revenue stream? Yes. Have they done this under Tim Cook’s reign? No. They are sitting on mountains of cash and have nothing better to do than buy back shares. Or it’s trapped off shores and they can’t use it. Based on all my background Apple looks to be at the end of its life cycle. Companies at the end of their life cycles (especially those with an installed base like apply) always have great recent returns that give investors comfort. It’s this very comfort that drives their valuations beyond what a reasonable DCF would suggest is fair valuation. This high valuation eventually leads to low prospective returns because investors become impatient with the low cash flows and no longer accept the low discount rate (mentioned earlier) that was applied to those cash flows. So even if they deliver cash flows as expected it’s not enough.\n\nApologies this was bit of a rant but at the end of the day any investment is the present value of future cash flows. You have to decide as an investor what discount rate you’re comfortable accepting for a set of cash flows and if you find an alternative then you will as a rational investor shift your funds. This is where a stock with low growth and a low discount rate has a LOT of downside (AAPL).\n\nEdit: and to anyone that has read this this is from someone that has dedicate 2 decades of his life to investments (CFA charterholder)… ALL that matters is expected cash flows and the discount rate being applied… if either of those change then the stock value will change (typically during earnings releases). What was just reported only slighter matters in that it says whether the company lived up to guidance and what does it say about what they can do in the future. Everything else are inputs to these 2 variables. Once you understand that it becomes a lot easier to evaluate companies. Apply a higher discount rate to less reliable cash flows.

They already have 40+ agreements with MNOs for this, with their biggest supporters being AT&T and Vodafone. Recently they also landed investments from Google and Rakuten.\n\nFor one commercial use case in a modern world: once you wander into a dead zone, your MNO can shoot you a text asking if you want to activate satellite internet to give you coverage during your time in the dead zone. For example, $8 for a day pass for satellite data. Half of that goes to AST, half of that goes to your MNO.\n\nAST won't have to pay for marketing/advertisement either because they will be integrated directly with existing data providers.\n\nFor some locations in the world such as for the 2.5 billion people with no cell service at all, AST SpaceMobile becomes an option for permanent connectivity.\n\nNot only commercial cases, this also has significant implications for government uses (and therefore, potential for non-dilutive low cost funding). For example, emergency responders to remote forest fires can rely on AST's network to immediately get access rather than having to wait for ground deployment. Or you can rely on satellite internet during an earthquake or other natural disaster. AST has already been working extensively with FirstNet. Extending beyond emergency situations, this also has military use cases.\n\nThere is a huge untapped market with this technology, and AST SpaceMobile is at the forefront of the technology. They are the only ones so far that have proven that their tech works.\n\nOther existing options such as Lynk and Globalstar offer satellite connectivity but for emergency texts only, and I believe they're working on emergency voice calls. This is far far different compared to 5G/broadband. Think streaming YouTube in HD, not just sending an emergency text.\n\nAll that being said, the biggest risk to this company right now is funding, and meeting execution timelines. So far, they've excelled with getting the tech going. Not so much with the execution.\n\nI would say that the biggest competitor is Starlink who is working on direct-to-cell technology as well. Starlink has the money and resources to catch up. Their tech is still behind, with texting planned for this year and voice calls for next year.

If the plan executes, ASTS's margins will be in the 90%+ range due to their wholesale business model and low number of employees.

They did 11.6B in 2023, and around 22B in each of 2022 and 2021. So they have a Net Income of 10B to 22B and a marketcap of 170B.\n\nIf ASTS executes, and yes they are already delayed massively so this \"if\" is getting bigger and bigger, then eventually they hit their projected $16.4B in revenue which translates to $14.7B in Net Income. The marketcap of ASTS at this point would reasonably be 100X larger than it is right now to 60B+.\n\nI had been watching ASTS since its deSPAC as well, and never bought in until earlier this year at $3.13 after they announced dilution immediately after their January funding round with Google, AT&T, and Vodafone. I bought in thinking they would meet their timeline of Q2 launch of BlueBird Block 1, but in the Q4 2023 earnings call they confirmed another delay, tanking the stock once more.
