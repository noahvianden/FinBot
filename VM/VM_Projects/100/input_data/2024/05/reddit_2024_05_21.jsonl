ARE WE FUCKING BECOMING THE BOEING OF AUTOS HERE???\n\n>FUCKING SHORT $RACE FUCK YEAH\n\nReality is that ALL fast food companies have been hiking prices since the pandemic to test their pricing power. The truly smart never ate to begin with, those who were a bit brighter ate more when it was cheap and cut back as prices went up, and the dumbasses keep paying like regards and then make an OP.\n\nBut the truth is that Chipotle, LVMH, or Apple don't give a shit if poor fucks can't afford their products so long as their core customer base can and will continue paying. To that point, Chipotle is still able to charge a premium because it's near restaurant quality but cheaper without the tipping. Also quality is way better than say McDonalds at close to if not lower price. Other fast foods have not really started cutting prices and even if they did most folks who aren't poor college kids will choose Chipotle over the outright industrial slop their stuff like Taco Bell or Jack. \n\nThe time to push back against CMG as a consumer was a while back. The time to short CMG is not now (now isn't a good time to short anything, but üåàüêªs gonna üåàüêª). I wouldn't buy CMG now but I wouldn't buy it even when it was cheaper. Not my area of expertise even if I do eat there sometimes. Where I do feel I have expertise is in luxury because of where I work and what I've invested in before. And I can tell you this: rich people keep winning and they'll keep spending. You don't compromise on quality or exclusivity to reach more folks. Watering down your brand is risky if not a death nail. You stick to your core customer base like LVMH does instead of watering down like CPRI did. Disregard the poor or those you can't afford because it's often not worth the time and effort to cater to them when you have highly profitable and easy to cater to customer base. Same with Ferrari vs Maserati. In CMG's sense they never were for the broke fuck who couldn't afford anything over $5. Even during their early years they were a premium that was double of taco bell or half the calories of a dominos pizza. CMG ain't going for those customers so they can revolt all they want. CMG =/= MCD. If anything their whole business model is that they are NOT bottom quality tier fast food.\n\nOP's just poor and/or cheap but doesn't have the awareness or wherewithal to realize he's kind of a bum ass who can't afford CMG and that CMG doesn't give a fuck about losing him. It's kind of as silly as screaming online that we should all short women because he's not getting pussy. Reality is most women don't give a fuck about OP, me, or the average guy \"shorting\" them or not \"wooing\" them because they've got tons of better dudes lined up jumping at them already.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't own RACE nor CMG.

These changes included a shift towards more centralized food preparation to comply with stricter food safety regulations implemented after the incidents.\n\nThe series of outbreaks were linked to multiple failures in food safety practices at the restaurant level, including incidents of employees working while sick and not adhering to food safety protocols. This led to widespread illnesses and a federal investigation, resulting in Chipotle agreeing to a $25 million fine and the implementation of a comprehensive food safety compliance program to avoid future incidents„Äê6‚Ä†source„Äë„Äê7‚Ä†source„Äë.\n\nRegarding your theory about corporate sabotage, there have been rumors and conspiracy theories suggesting that Chipotle was targeted by sabotage due to its stance on non-GMO ingredients. However, these theories have not been substantiated with credible evidence. The more widely accepted explanation attributes the outbreaks to systemic failures within Chipotle's food safety management at the time„Äê6‚Ä†source„Äë.\n\nThe impact on food quality and taste was likely due to the necessary shift to centralized food preparation, which can sometimes result in less freshness and variability in the final product.

Their moat is much larger than Apple‚Äôs and the questions you‚Äôre asking are really the wrong ones.\n\nNVDA is focused on chip design and building out a whole GPU based platform.  NVDA outsources the manufacturing which is why you see TSM and ASML move in sync mostly.  Competitors using their platform would be amazing as it would solidify their moat as THE platform which would help them collect additional IP royalties potentially and would ensure their platform is the one companies go for (and need enterprise support for).\n\nThe big data centers will need to churn these cards between 18-36 months depending on how heavy loads are maintained and how well they want to maintain the cards.  Right now the big data centers are wiping out direct to enterprise by volume creating a vicious cycle.  A company can‚Äôt quickly direct order GPUs and build their own racks so they go to the big public CSPs for on demand capacity, which then leads to the CSPs buying more and keeping it further way from direct enterprise.  There are still times when you‚Äôll run into on demand capacity issues in CSPs given all the compute is in use - it‚Äôs kind of wild a cloud provider can actually not have demand.\n\nThe real questions are:\n\nDoes TSM and ASML have any real capacity to support a competitor?

A lot, it takes a ton of compute power to run these models and scale. But the big catch is almost all of them are unprofitable, even just from a gross profit basis, not even counting the cost of R&D. The money it costs a lot of these services to pay for their compute costs is more than their revenue.\n\nSo the million dollar question is when will investors expect a profit, and stop pouring billions of dollars into these unprofitable companies ? Right now it's basically a huge win for consumers. We can mess around with free versions of AI tools that cause the underlying companies to bleed money. I suspect eventually many of them will be forced to end or severely limit their free plans.\n\nNvidia is keeping the party going by investing in AI startups, receiving equity in exchange for providing their hardware. Other large cloud platforms are doing this too, giving cloud computing credits in exchange for equity.\n\nIt's sort of a circular economy. Nvidia provides tons of capital to buy their GPUs at 90% profit margins(inflated price), and then receives goodwill on their balance sheet(inflated valuations), allowing them to show growing EPS every quarter by selling GPUs not for cash, but for equity in unprofitable startups.\n\nThe big question is when will this hype train end?

They run shadow mode in the car and any deviation of the FSD decisions from the ones the driver makes is recorded and used to fine tune the errors. The bigger the neural net, the more data is required to get it to a reasonable error level. That's an artifact of the mathematics. Waymo and everyone else are using neural nets as well, so they also can't escape the data requirements. Tesla has millions of drivers collecting data for them over the last 10 years in various conditions. It's fairly recent that they have the compute power to train a large network and shrink it to fit on a vehicle's hardware. Also there is a legal liability issue of accepting a better safety rating for fsd. Tesla has lost very few autopilot lawsuits because of this. Legally it's a level 2 at best, but their customers believe it's better than a level 4 and use it as such.
