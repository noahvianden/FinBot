Instead, Mr. Musk’s only opportunity to be compensated for his effort, dedication and achievements on behalf of Tesla was a 100% at-risk performance award, consisting exclusively of stock options with tranches that would vest only if certain specified milestones were met, each of which required Tesla to achieve both a market capitalization milestone and an operational milestone, as described below. Additionally, Mr. Musk was required to hold shares that he acquired upon exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for a period of five years after he exercised the underlying options — not just for a five year period after such options vested.\n\n>• \n\n>For the first tranche, Tesla’s market capitalization was required to increase to $100 billion and the Company needed to meet an additional operational milestone. Each subsequent tranche required not only that Tesla’s market capitalization increase by additional $50 billion increments — up to a total of $650 billion — (each, a “Market Capitalization Milestone”) but also that Tesla was required to achieve a series of previously unmet operational milestones (each, an “Operational Milestone”).\n\n>• \n\n>The 2018 CEO Performance Award consisted of a 10-year grant of stock options with 12 potential vesting tranches, and was designed to help drive Tesla towards exceptional execution on both a top-line and bottom-line basis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzhni989iz1d1.jpeg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c319755c4ba6ad85cbf19ca299b40bf4824eb44\n\n  \nI'm not a huge fan of Musk's recent politics or his lack of filter, and certainly wish he'd never gone near Twitter.

ARE WE FUCKING BECOMING THE BOEING OF AUTOS HERE???\n\n>FUCKING SHORT $RACE FUCK YEAH\n\nReality is that ALL fast food companies have been hiking prices since the pandemic to test their pricing power. The truly smart never ate to begin with, those who were a bit brighter ate more when it was cheap and cut back as prices went up, and the dumbasses keep paying like regards and then make an OP.\n\nBut the truth is that Chipotle, LVMH, or Apple don't give a shit if poor fucks can't afford their products so long as their core customer base can and will continue paying. To that point, Chipotle is still able to charge a premium because it's near restaurant quality but cheaper without the tipping. Also quality is way better than say McDonalds at close to if not lower price. Other fast foods have not really started cutting prices and even if they did most folks who aren't poor college kids will choose Chipotle over the outright industrial slop their stuff like Taco Bell or Jack. \n\nThe time to push back against CMG as a consumer was a while back. The time to short CMG is not now (now isn't a good time to short anything, but 🌈🐻s gonna 🌈🐻). I wouldn't buy CMG now but I wouldn't buy it even when it was cheaper. Not my area of expertise even if I do eat there sometimes. Where I do feel I have expertise is in luxury because of where I work and what I've invested in before. And I can tell you this: rich people keep winning and they'll keep spending. You don't compromise on quality or exclusivity to reach more folks. Watering down your brand is risky if not a death nail. You stick to your core customer base like LVMH does instead of watering down like CPRI did. Disregard the poor or those you can't afford because it's often not worth the time and effort to cater to them when you have highly profitable and easy to cater to customer base. Same with Ferrari vs Maserati. In CMG's sense they never were for the broke fuck who couldn't afford anything over $5. Even during their early years they were a premium that was double of taco bell or half the calories of a dominos pizza. CMG ain't going for those customers so they can revolt all they want. CMG =/= MCD. If anything their whole business model is that they are NOT bottom quality tier fast food.\n\nOP's just poor and/or cheap but doesn't have the awareness or wherewithal to realize he's kind of a bum ass who can't afford CMG and that CMG doesn't give a fuck about losing him. It's kind of as silly as screaming online that we should all short women because he's not getting pussy. Reality is most women don't give a fuck about OP, me, or the average guy \"shorting\" them or not \"wooing\" them because they've got tons of better dudes lined up jumping at them already.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't own RACE nor CMG.

These changes included a shift towards more centralized food preparation to comply with stricter food safety regulations implemented after the incidents.\n\nThe series of outbreaks were linked to multiple failures in food safety practices at the restaurant level, including incidents of employees working while sick and not adhering to food safety protocols. This led to widespread illnesses and a federal investigation, resulting in Chipotle agreeing to a $25 million fine and the implementation of a comprehensive food safety compliance program to avoid future incidents【6†source】【7†source】.\n\nRegarding your theory about corporate sabotage, there have been rumors and conspiracy theories suggesting that Chipotle was targeted by sabotage due to its stance on non-GMO ingredients. However, these theories have not been substantiated with credible evidence. The more widely accepted explanation attributes the outbreaks to systemic failures within Chipotle's food safety management at the time【6†source】.\n\nThe impact on food quality and taste was likely due to the necessary shift to centralized food preparation, which can sometimes result in less freshness and variability in the final product.

Their moat is much larger than Apple’s and the questions you’re asking are really the wrong ones.\n\nNVDA is focused on chip design and building out a whole GPU based platform.  NVDA outsources the manufacturing which is why you see TSM and ASML move in sync mostly.  Competitors using their platform would be amazing as it would solidify their moat as THE platform which would help them collect additional IP royalties potentially and would ensure their platform is the one companies go for (and need enterprise support for).\n\nThe big data centers will need to churn these cards between 18-36 months depending on how heavy loads are maintained and how well they want to maintain the cards.  Right now the big data centers are wiping out direct to enterprise by volume creating a vicious cycle.  A company can’t quickly direct order GPUs and build their own racks so they go to the big public CSPs for on demand capacity, which then leads to the CSPs buying more and keeping it further way from direct enterprise.  There are still times when you’ll run into on demand capacity issues in CSPs given all the compute is in use - it’s kind of wild a cloud provider can actually not have demand.\n\nThe real questions are:\n\nDoes TSM and ASML have any real capacity to support a competitor?
