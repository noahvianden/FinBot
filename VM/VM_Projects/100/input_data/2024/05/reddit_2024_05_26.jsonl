Who knows‚Ä¶.\n\n I feel like in reality it cant make everyone wealthy thats decently invested or we see some serious hyper inflation collapsing the currency for good because 80% of the currency in circulation being printed since covid or it creates a new wealth class that only Nvidia investors were in with enough shares to put them in it. \n\nApproximately 20 countries ditched the dollar last year along with the International Monetary fund. BRICS is expanding while trying to create a gold backed currency. They control 47% of the world oil to our 2%. More natural resources, minerals, farmland & crops. More world GDP, higher population. 3x as much wealth growth while ours has stalled, gained 0.5% or gone negative in the recent past. Average lifespan of a FIAT currency is 27 years, we‚Äôre at 53 since the Bretton Woods Gold back standard was ended in 1971. \n\nEach year our currency devalues approximately 3% and or loses that purchasing power. The dollar has devalued 91% since 1971 and 100+% since 1929‚Ä¶.House in the 1970s was on average $9,000. Today it‚Äôs $416,000 with 7% interest rates due to inflation. Each year the debt goes up causing us to request more IOU bonds from the fed for a loan to print more $$$ to pay for the interest on the debt thats constantly rising. If all the debt was paid off the system would collapse because the Federal Reserve is a Ponzy scheme. Why pay taxes when they print endless money. Your taxes don‚Äôt fund the government and never have. They go towards the national debt interest which is fucked up and illegal because the Federal Reserve isn‚Äôt federally related at all. Privateky owned centralized bank. The interest on the debt cant even be paid back at this point no matter how much they tax us‚Ä¶.\n\nSo soon we‚Äôre fucked and we collapse or it happens when the masses lose enough population confidence in the currencies value or enough countries ditch the dollar. All 227 FIAT currencies in world history have eventually collapsed or failed. Statistically we‚Äôre 100% next. Theres no way to stop that from coming, the only thing thats prolonged our lifespan twice as long as a FIAT is the PetroDollar, the World Reserve currency for all international trades and oil purchases. \n\nWere the worlds money creator since other countries buy the leftover U.S. treasury bonds that the Federal reserve didn‚Äôt buy back. Those countries buy the bonds to make things like their currency value slightly less or a lot less depending on the country and their current situation. They buy the treasury bonds so they can make their labor cheaper while exporting their goods at cheaper prices because their currency is valued off ours. The military industrial complex has also helped us survive twice as long as the average lifespan of FIAT currencies‚Ä¶.  \n\n\nWere basically funding 2 wars right now, Israel-Hamas and Ukraine/Russia. Defending Taiwan from China and possibly having to fund WWIII in the near future.  We honestly cant fund a world war at this point‚Ä¶ It would collapse the currency adding to the current insane debt, inflation & high taxes that we currently have which isn‚Äôt sustainable much longer. \n\nLook into ‚ÄúThe silent depression‚Äù‚Ä¶ Average car price & interest rates. Average house prices & interest. Food, cost of living, average cost for renters. Average National price of gas per gallon. Average american credit card debt as a whole for the country/its at a record high. Average retirement account value for individuals by age and by household/pretty low. Countries debt at an all time high which took like 30+ years to reach 1 Trillion. Then WAY less to reach approximately $35Trillion. Now adding 1Trillion every 30 days to the national debt. Then compare everything to the average National wage or salary vs the Great Depression. It‚Äôs worse‚Ä¶\n\nCentralized digital banking currency on blockchain technology is coming soon. Prevents $60Billion in Fraud annually which benefits the banks and they like that. Also tracks every penny for tax filing purposes and social credit scores to keep the masses more well behaved and in line. Control what you buy, when you buy, how much you can buy and if your allowed to travel. Your credit score now to finance a car, house or anything you want didn‚Äôt exist until 1989‚Ä¶.Only 35 years ago, Digital Currency has also been on the Official Govt. WhiteHouse Website for about 3 years now. \n\nAdd the National parks and other major tourist areas in the U.S. no longer accepting currency, card payment only. You know the Governments aware and 2 steps ahead with a plan in place or it wouldn‚Äôt be on the WhiteHouse website‚Ä¶. Noone really knows it‚Äôs posted because they didn‚Äôt say much and people don‚Äôt go randomly looking‚Ä¶. Could be in a completely different currency here soon in the near future and I don‚Äôt really know how that effects the stock market or every company that might possibly collapse and go under when this one finally does fall like Rome‚Ä¶.\n\nThe U.S. Dollar is technically a financial trading tool. The constitution states in two different sections & clauses the only real official currency is gold and silver along with the coinage Act from sometime way back in the late 1700‚Äôs‚Ä¶.Yes, Nvidia has the most potential with the AI boom taking off and it‚Äôs probably 1 of the safest stocks you can pick.

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step approach to consider this hypothetical valuation:\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Human Value Assessment**:\n   - According to Warren Buffett, the value of a single human's lifetime productivity can be approximated at $1 million.\n   - With a global population of approximately 8 billion people, the total value would be:\n     \\[\n     8 \\text{ billion people} \\times \\$1 \\text{ million per person} = \\$8 \\text{ quadrillion}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Hypothetical Value Transfer**:\n   - If NVIDIA's technology were capable of replacing all human labor, one might argue that the value of this capability could be equated to the total value of human productivity.\n   - Thus, the hypothetical valuation of NVIDIA in this scenario would be $8 quadrillion.\n\n### Considerations and Limitations\n\n- **Economic Realities**: \n  - This simplistic model does not account for many factors, such as economic structures, market dynamics, and the complexities of human contributions beyond just labor (e.g., creativity, emotional intelligence).\n  \n- **Market Capitalization**:\n  - Even if NVIDIA were to replace all human labor, the actual market capitalization would depend on investor perception, technological adoption, regulatory environments, and competitive pressures.\n\n- **Ethical and Social Impacts**:\n  - The ethical implications of replacing all human labor with technology would be immense, likely leading to significant social and economic changes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile this thought experiment gives an upper-bound hypothetical valuation of $8 quadrillion for NVIDIA, it‚Äôs essential to recognize that real-world valuations are influenced by a myriad of complex factors beyond the scope of such a straightforward calculation. In practice, technology adoption, market reactions, and socio-economic impacts would all play crucial roles in determining the actual value of a company like NVIDIA in such a scenario.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "No one knows.

This will first show up as slowing demand for cloud devices and on prem servers, and then slow down for NVDA. As of now, the demand exceeds supply. Another aspect to consider is the emergence of small models that require less compute, at least for specific applications. This will also result in smaller demand for NVDA. Finally, competition is inevitable. Cloud service providers will deploy their own systems to implement AI services just to be independent of any single vendor.

Early on in a new product it will ALWAYS be more expensive than planned. Always.\n\nHowever, credit where credit is due so I feel I need to point out that the dual motor AWD Cybertruck actually has better specs than promised. 340+ mile range instead of 300+ mile range. I feel bad for the cyberbeast people but according to purchasing 90% are getting the dual motor version and are quite happy with it. Most cybertruck owners seem extremely happy with their trucks, and of course online when something happens (like a QA problem or defect) we only see the times the cybertruck fell apart NOT the times where the cybertruck was fine. I could compile tons of videos about practically any car model showing only the worst examples of QA and make it look like they're all bad. It's super easy.

Tesla is doing the best out of all EV manufacturers weathering this storm. That does count for something, but yes irrelevant to compare to BYD.

Based on my experience most likely the only thing I'd need to do is, when entering a parking lot with a supercharger, pick out a spot to park myself and then plug in. Once they make parking lot navigation and auto park as good as FSDv12 and integrate them, they're done. I think that's significantly easier than everything else they've done.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n> It better have, given they're selling it for 2x the promised price!\n\nDid you read when I said the original model 3 was $70k or something ridiculous like that when it first came out? This is that again. They eventually reached their target price after a few years (there was no tax credit when the model 3 price was originally announced to be $35k minimum). In July 2023 I picked up a 2023 Model 3 RWD for $36.5k BEFORE tax credit. Including tax credit, it was $29k. Tesla achieved and surpassed their original model 3 pricing, this isn't even accounting for inflation either. If you account for the tax credit and inflation since 2016 ish, I got my model 3 for around $23k. That's insanely good.\n\nSo I fully expect the cybertruck to be more of the same. Tesla has shown they don't give up on products and keep working at it until they not only get it right but surpass their original targets.I'm not worried.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n> Tesla consideration has dropped from 70% to 31%.\n\nUh, the link you sent doesn't work.

Here:\nhttps://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/elon-musk-tesla-poll-ev-buyers\n\nBetween 2/2023 and 11/2023 people responded to the question \"has Elon musk made you more or less likely to buy a tesla?\" Turns out, the number increased between February and November. Despite musk being extremely politically polarizing (I really don't think he's gotten more or less polarizing since then either, just the same). If you'll recall, Tesla sold 486k cars in Q4 2023, beating analyst expectations. This was despite musk's \"controversies\".\n\nI assume that you tried to send me a bunch of polls showing how interest in buying a tesla is down. Yes, that's correct, but not because of Musk. Because of external market conditions.\n\n> No other CEO is getting 25% of the company for thier performance. Especially for such a shitty performance as Musk is delivering\n\nHA! WTF \"shitty performance\"??? The man 10xed my money between 2019 and 2021, what are you talking about? Tesla stock paid for an entire year of my college. He absolutely, 100% deserves it for doing that. Even though the stock is down now, it's still an 8x or so from where it was. People thought it was impossible for it to reach even that level by 2024. I'm quite confident that he knows what he's doing. It's crazy how the same people who go \"trust the experts\" one minute turn around and go \"ha all those incredibly talented engineers at Tesla? They don't know what they're doing!\" Tesla is 99% not Elon Musk, he'd be the first to tell you that. \"I get far too much credit\" - Elon Musk\n\n> The idea that Elon Musk magically 10x'd the company through amazing CEO'ing is such blind adoration and so far removed from reality it's scary. Tesla is a large company made up of tens of thousands of people. Tesla has missed many of thier promised goals, and has declining performance year on year by many key metrics\n\nNope, it's not. It's really what happened, though certainly not by magic. Why do you think Musk is the common denominator between SpaceX, Tesla, and PayPal? What Musk did to 10x the company, specifically, was spend funds well hiring the right people to create the right technologies that are required for EVs to be profitable. No more, no less. He was also not afraid of cutting back and firing people when the company was in danger of bankruptcy (he cut I think more than 10% of the company back in 2018, aka why I'm saying recent job cuts at Tesla are normal Tesla behavior). He also dumped his personal fortune into the company to keep it from going bankrupt.\n\nPeople get it wrong when they call Musk a genius or doubt that he is one. Specifically what he is a genius at is infrastructure. He knows really well exactly how to figure out how much materials, tech, money, etc. a product needs to succeed. He's not a genius business man, and he's not a genius engineer (probably just a competent one, as his name is on a few patents). It's infrastructure/allocation of resources that he's good at, that's why tesla has succeeded where so many others have failed (and SpaceX too).\n\n> But sure, because he tweeted about sleeping on the factory floor, or bullied his way into getting his name on some patents, you think he deserves order of magnitude more than other, far more competant and successful CEO's.\n\n\"Bullied his way\" ??? Engineering is a team sport. I am a systems engineer. Most patents do not have just 1 name on them (unless they're extremely simple and/or non-technical). This is normal. Also, he has a bachelors degree in physics, which qualifies him for many engineering positions.\n\n> Please vote yes, you deserve the CEO you vote for. One that is going to grift you for every penny he can - because you are begging for him to.\n\nAlready did! Got my dad to as well lol. But man, non-investors really have a warped sense of Musk. Again, how has he \"grifted me for every penny\" when I'm still up 8x where I was when I invested? I also really really don't get why anyone would think it's a good idea to bet against the richest man in the world, no matter what you think of him personally.\n\nBut yeah, Musk is great. It's amazing to live in the same time as someone like that. As an environmentalist I am extremely pleased. Musk is the greatest environmentalist of our time, and unrelated but I like to point out this:\nIf he hadn't personally donated starlink to ukraine, there probably wouldn't be a ukraine (separate from russia) anymore. Also, no, he didn't \"turn off\" starlink on them during that attack on the Russian fleet. Crimea is a sanction area, it is literally illegal for starlink to be active there. The Ukrainians were told this, but forgot or there was a miscommunication.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nMusk's donation of starlink to ukraine should make him a hero in the eyes of anyone who supports Ukraine.

Once all the CHIPS money is actually spent on new fabs in the US over the next 3-5 years, the US will be a bit less dependent on Taiwan which will likely make the timing for a Chinese invasion seem better because they may expect a weaker response from us. \n\nWhether that's actually the case and whether China actually decides to push the issue at some point remains up in the air. \n\nChina has to cross a strait, and by most accounts Taiwan is busy mass producing tens of thousands of smaller drones and strapping explosives to them to swarm whatever China sends at them. Add that to their extensive existing legit AA to thwart to Chinese air force to some degree, and I don't think it's a slam dunk that a single Chinese soldier would ever land on Taiwan. It would be a bloody mess for both sides with a stalemate as the likely ending though, and I think China knows this. \n\nAlso if the US is still willing to engage, they will immediately blockade the South China Sea at its 4-5 major choke points and completely cut off shipping traffic in and out of China, paralyzing their economy.

The rich in Taiwan will move out and once all that u.s. money stops rolling in for presidential campaigns they might elect a slightly more neutral president. China doesn't want war no one does. Look at india and china they are in a chest pounding competition no missiles flying left and right. They know war doesn't ever benefit anyone. The u.s. has military in almost every territory surrounding china. Now imagine if we reverse the role and let's just say Russia.

I'm not the Chinese government.¬†\n\n\nIMO though The equipment that gets updated/replaced every 3-6 years and the staff are key. Let's say they take over Taiwan and the fabs stay intact. You need people that know how to operate their equipment. The people who come up with these new breakthrough manufacturing processes. If they invade the talent will just flee leaving just the fabs begins. This would just be a temporary win. So invading is not worth the lives and cost to do som I think Taiwan might be more about territory and defense of the coast. Taiwan is so close to chinas shores If I recall correctly it's roughly the same distance as Cuba is to key west. In¬† chinas case though it's off the shire of many major cities.

{"title": "Moderna $MRNA is overvalued and the current valuation presents a generational short opportunity. Sell and sell short", "selftext": "\nHELLO I HAVE A $136K margin call due to a credit call spread on MRNA I opened last week. I'm not worried about it. \n\nHere is why:\n\n\n\nThe stock has rallied from about $100 to $170 on a couple non-sensical things.\n\n1) Moderna \"lost\" a markman hearing against ABUS. Markman hearings are not super important, it's basically the judge defining what's actually going on in a patent litigation, the definitions, the claims, etc, so that the actual hearing doesn't get too tangential. But the way the claims were defined make it almost certain ABUS will win in court. If they win, MRNA will owe ABUS somewhere in the range of $1 to $7 BILLION.  just depends what % Royalty the hearing ultimately decides what's fair. BUT THE STOCK SHRUGGED THIS OFF. Likely a crowded short that didn't go down because it's a markman... not down? Then up! Shorts covered.\n\n2) RSV vaccine approval not assured. The efficacy of mrna rsv vaccine is not the best, GSK and pfizer have RSV vaccines, and depending on what time point you look at, mrna is either the middle or the worst. https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Announces-Update-on-Investigational-RSV-Vaccine/default.aspx\n\nThe fda delayed their PDUFA approval to the end of the month. I assume it'll get approved, but that approval is already priced in, it was priced in at $80... (were at $160).\n\n3) h5n1 bird flu. This is an obvious covid play book. Mrna went crazy during covid. Bird flu is scary. But mrna, right? Wrong.\n\nHUGE different here, most importantly, WE HAVE BIRD FLU VACCINES APPROVED FOR H5N1. There's 3. \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/H5N1_vaccine\n\n[Here is the NBC article discussing the same](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna149961)\n\nSo people are buying MRNA as a covid-like play, but there is no reason any government will give mrna a stock piling money now - they'll give it to the APPROVED VACCINES (HINT: THEY ARENT MRNA)\n\n4) ASCO conference for their \"cancer vaccine\". This is a whole rabbit hole that would take a long time to explain, but in early June Moderna and merck will present updated data to their mrna vaccine in melanoma. It's a relatively small follow up where we already know the outcome. It \"worked\" but it's unlikely to work in a very large trial.\nPeople think that the results are so good that Merck (and moderna) will file for accelerated approval to the FDA. That's not going to happen. It's too small a trial in too early of a disease setting. As such they will have to run a very large Phase 3 trial. Moderna has been telling investors they can file on accelerated approval, but if you ask Merck, they say no lol, that would be preposterous. \nThe ASCO event is a non-event, but people apparently think it's a big deal. But we already know it \"worked\" in this early trial. This update isn't going to change anyone's opinion and isn't meaningful for approval.\n\nAs you can see, every reason MRNA is up is actually at best priced in when it was $80. But some of these catalysts are actually quite negative (ABUS markman hearing).\n\n*MRNA burns $1b a quarter.*\n\n\nEven if approved, the RSV vaccine will be mediocre at best, likely quite sluggish and not meaningful to topline.\nASCO cancer vaccine update is a non event and if no accelerated approval, that's very negative for the stock here.\nABUS will win in 2025 and mrna will owe them probably 4-5 billion dollars (they won't have that much cash then!) \n\nThe long term puts (2025 and 2026) are quite cheap, given this stocks fair value in my opinion is probably $60.\n\n**GLTA except mrna bulls.

He served as the Propulsion CTO from 2002 to 2019. He's regarded as one of the foremost spacecraft propulsion experts in the world and owns many patents for propulsion technologies.\n\n>Space.com: During your time working with Elon Musk at SpaceX, what were some important lessons you learned from each other?  \n>  \n>**Mueller:** Elon was the best mentor I've ever had. Just how to have drive and be an entrepreneur and influence my team and really make things happen. He's a super smart guy and he learns from talking to people. He's so sharp, he just picks it up. When we first started he didn't know a lot about propulsion. He knew quite a bit about structures and helped the structures guys a lot. Over the twenty years that we worked together, *now he's practically running propulsion there because he's come up to speed* and he understands how to do rocket engines, which are really one of the most complex parts of the vehicle. *He's always been excellent at architecting the whole mission, but now he's a lot better at the very small details of the combustion process.* Stuff I learned over a decade-and-a-half at TRW he's picked up too.\n\n[Source](https://www.space.com/tom-mueller-impulse-space-mira-spacecraft)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Not true, I am an advisor now. Elon and the Propulsion department are leading development of the SpaceX engines, particularly Raptor. I offer my 2 cents to help from time to time\"\n\n[Source](https://twitter.com/lrocket/status/1099411086711746560?s=20)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We‚Äôll have, you know, a group of people sitting in a room, making a key decision. And everybody in that room will say, you know, basically, ‚ÄúWe need to turn left,‚Äù and Elon will say ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre gonna turn right.‚Äù You know, to put it in a metaphor. And that‚Äôs how he thinks. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYou guys are taking the easy way out; we need to take the hard way.‚Äù  \n>  \n>And, uh, I‚Äôve seen that hurt us before, I‚Äôve seen that fail, but I‚Äôve also seen‚Äî where nobody thought it would work‚Äî it was the right decision.

He previously managed the Advanced Computer Systems and Technologies Group within the Autonomous Systems Division at NASA's Jet Propulsion laboratory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Elon is brilliant. He‚Äôs involved in just about everything. He understands everything. If he asks you a question, you learn very quickly not to go give him a gut reaction.  \n>  \n>He wants answers that get down to the fundamental laws of physics. One thing he understands really well is the physics of the rockets. He understands that like nobody else. The stuff I have seen him do in his head is crazy.  \n>  \n>He can get in discussions about flying a satellite and whether we can make the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve all these equations in real time.

You‚Äôve already got an astronaut, so are you sure you need two around here?‚Äô ‚Äù Reisman asked. ‚ÄúHe looked at me and said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not hiring you because you‚Äôre an astronaut. I‚Äôm hiring you because you‚Äôre a good engineer.‚Äô ‚Äù  \n>  \n>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs obviously skilled at all those different functions, but certainly what really drives him and where his passion really is, is his role as CTO,‚Äù or chief technology officer, Reisman said. ‚ÄúBasically his role as chief designer and chief engineer.

I mean I've met a lot of super super smart people but they're usually super super smart on one thing and he's able to have conversations with our top engineers about the software, and the most arcane aspects of that and then he'll turn to our manufacturing engineers and have discussions about some really esoteric welding process for some crazy alloy and he'll just go back and forth and his ability to do that across the different technologies that go into rockets cars and everything else he does.\n\n([Source](https://youtu.be/GNG6ZzDh9C8?t=390))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Josh Boehm**\n\nJosh Boehm is the former Head of Software Quality Assurance at SpaceX.\n\n>Elon is both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer of SpaceX, so of course he does more than just ‚Äòsome very technical work‚Äô.

Nothing. That was in 2001. By 2007 he knew everything about rockets - he really knew everything, in detail. You have to put some serious study in to know as much about rockets as he knows now.

Musk was intense, preternaturally focused, and extremely determined. ‚ÄúThis was not the kind of guy who was going to accept failure,‚Äù Sarsfield remembered thinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Statements by Elon Himself\n\n>Yes. The design of Starship and the Super Heavy rocket booster I changed to a special alloy of stainless steel. I was contemplating this for a while. And this is somewhat counterintuitive.

A very long time ago, many, many, years, you took me on a tour of SpaceX. And the most impressive thing was that you knew every detail of the rocket and every piece of engineering that went into it. And I don't think many people get that about you.  \n>  \n>Elon: Yeah. I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it's working on the Model 3 and, yeah, so I'm in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory.
