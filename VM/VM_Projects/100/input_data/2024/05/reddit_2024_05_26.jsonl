But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point.\n\nMy gut feels like there is far too much hype surrounding Nvidia's prospects and price should drop a fair bit.

They go towards the national debt interest which is fucked up and illegal because the Federal Reserve isn’t federally related at all. Privateky owned centralized bank. The interest on the debt cant even be paid back at this point no matter how much they tax us….\n\nSo soon we’re fucked and we collapse or it happens when the masses lose enough population confidence in the currencies value or enough countries ditch the dollar. All 227 FIAT currencies in world history have eventually collapsed or failed. Statistically we’re 100% next. Theres no way to stop that from coming, the only thing thats prolonged our lifespan twice as long as a FIAT is the PetroDollar, the World Reserve currency for all international trades and oil purchases. \n\nWere the worlds money creator since other countries buy the leftover U.S. treasury bonds that the Federal reserve didn’t buy back. Those countries buy the bonds to make things like their currency value slightly less or a lot less depending on the country and their current situation. They buy the treasury bonds so they can make their labor cheaper while exporting their goods at cheaper prices because their currency is valued off ours. The military industrial complex has also helped us survive twice as long as the average lifespan of FIAT currencies….  \n\n\nWere basically funding 2 wars right now, Israel-Hamas and Ukraine/Russia. Defending Taiwan from China and possibly having to fund WWIII in the near future.  We honestly cant fund a world war at this point… It would collapse the currency adding to the current insane debt, inflation & high taxes that we currently have which isn’t sustainable much longer. \n\nLook into “The silent depression”… Average car price & interest rates. Average house prices & interest. Food, cost of living, average cost for renters. Average National price of gas per gallon. Average american credit card debt as a whole for the country/its at a record high. Average retirement account value for individuals by age and by household/pretty low. Countries debt at an all time high which took like 30+ years to reach 1 Trillion. Then WAY less to reach approximately $35Trillion. Now adding 1Trillion every 30 days to the national debt. Then compare everything to the average National wage or salary vs the Great Depression. It’s worse…\n\nCentralized digital banking currency on blockchain technology is coming soon. Prevents $60Billion in Fraud annually which benefits the banks and they like that. Also tracks every penny for tax filing purposes and social credit scores to keep the masses more well behaved and in line. Control what you buy, when you buy, how much you can buy and if your allowed to travel. Your credit score now to finance a car, house or anything you want didn’t exist until 1989….Only 35 years ago, Digital Currency has also been on the Official Govt. WhiteHouse Website for about 3 years now. \n\nAdd the National parks and other major tourist areas in the U.S. no longer accepting currency, card payment only. You know the Governments aware and 2 steps ahead with a plan in place or it wouldn’t be on the WhiteHouse website…. Noone really knows it’s posted because they didn’t say much and people don’t go randomly looking…. Could be in a completely different currency here soon in the near future and I don’t really know how that effects the stock market or every company that might possibly collapse and go under when this one finally does fall like Rome….\n\nThe U.S. Dollar is technically a financial trading tool. The constitution states in two different sections & clauses the only real official currency is gold and silver along with the coinage Act from sometime way back in the late 1700’s….Yes, Nvidia has the most potential with the AI boom taking off and it’s probably 1 of the safest stocks you can pick.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to consider this hypothetical valuation:\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Human Value Assessment**:\n   - According to Warren Buffett, the value of a single human's lifetime productivity can be approximated at $1 million.\n   - With a global population of approximately 8 billion people, the total value would be:\n     \\[\n     8 \\text{ billion people} \\times \\$1 \\text{ million per person} = \\$8 \\text{ quadrillion}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Hypothetical Value Transfer**:\n   - If NVIDIA's technology were capable of replacing all human labor, one might argue that the value of this capability could be equated to the total value of human productivity.\n   - Thus, the hypothetical valuation of NVIDIA in this scenario would be $8 quadrillion.\n\n### Considerations and Limitations\n\n- **Economic Realities**: \n  - This simplistic model does not account for many factors, such as economic structures, market dynamics, and the complexities of human contributions beyond just labor (e.g., creativity, emotional intelligence).\n  \n- **Market Capitalization**:\n  - Even if NVIDIA were to replace all human labor, the actual market capitalization would depend on investor perception, technological adoption, regulatory environments, and competitive pressures.\n\n- **Ethical and Social Impacts**:\n  - The ethical implications of replacing all human labor with technology would be immense, likely leading to significant social and economic changes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile this thought experiment gives an upper-bound hypothetical valuation of $8 quadrillion for NVIDIA, it’s essential to recognize that real-world valuations are influenced by a myriad of complex factors beyond the scope of such a straightforward calculation. In practice, technology adoption, market reactions, and socio-economic impacts would all play crucial roles in determining the actual value of a company like NVIDIA in such a scenario.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "No one knows.

This will first show up as slowing demand for cloud devices and on prem servers, and then slow down for NVDA. As of now, the demand exceeds supply. Another aspect to consider is the emergence of small models that require less compute, at least for specific applications. This will also result in smaller demand for NVDA. Finally, competition is inevitable. Cloud service providers will deploy their own systems to implement AI services just to be independent of any single vendor. But this will take some time and the NVDA ecosystem is advanced. Right now, the stock is going up disproportionately compared to revenue and earnings beat numbers.

Only the board can do that (that’s kind of the issue), and shareholders can approve or disapprove. If a shareholder wants a different pay package the appropriate choice is to vote no and hope the board suggests something more acceptable. \n\nSecond, legally this is a new pay package.

Stuff similar to this happens a lot, minority shareholders suing over mergers, bond payments, and even attempting to claw back executive compensation due to breach of fiduciary duty. In many ways the only way this is remarkable is that normal people are hearing about this. \n\nThe initial contract being voided was the court’s doing, and corporations *like* Delaware corporate law. It’s a well known thing. “Delaware court strikes down large executive pay package given by a non-independent board” is a complete non story with any other executive.

Early on in a new product it will ALWAYS be more expensive than planned. Always.\n\nHowever, credit where credit is due so I feel I need to point out that the dual motor AWD Cybertruck actually has better specs than promised. 340+ mile range instead of 300+ mile range. I feel bad for the cyberbeast people but according to purchasing 90% are getting the dual motor version and are quite happy with it. Most cybertruck owners seem extremely happy with their trucks, and of course online when something happens (like a QA problem or defect) we only see the times the cybertruck fell apart NOT the times where the cybertruck was fine. I could compile tons of videos about practically any car model showing only the worst examples of QA and make it look like they're all bad. It's super easy.

Instead of getting a CEO salary, Musk has been working for Tesla for years literally for free. He chose to get a performance based comp package IF AND ONLY IF he 10xed the company. He did it in 5 years, what people said was impossible. Failed to do even basic corporate governance? Maybe, but people saying he didn't do any work for Tesla are laughably wrong. He literally slept on the factory floor making sure the company would make it through production hell. His name is literally on patents for Tesla, meaning he did actual engineering work for them.\n\nI also strongly disagree that he lied to investors. But whatever.

This is that again. They eventually reached their target price after a few years (there was no tax credit when the model 3 price was originally announced to be $35k minimum). In July 2023 I picked up a 2023 Model 3 RWD for $36.5k BEFORE tax credit. Including tax credit, it was $29k. Tesla achieved and surpassed their original model 3 pricing, this isn't even accounting for inflation either. If you account for the tax credit and inflation since 2016 ish, I got my model 3 for around $23k. That's insanely good.\n\nSo I fully expect the cybertruck to be more of the same.

If you'll recall, Tesla sold 486k cars in Q4 2023, beating analyst expectations. This was despite musk's \"controversies\".\n\nI assume that you tried to send me a bunch of polls showing how interest in buying a tesla is down. Yes, that's correct, but not because of Musk. Because of external market conditions.\n\n> No other CEO is getting 25% of the company for thier performance. Especially for such a shitty performance as Musk is delivering\n\nHA! WTF \"shitty performance\"??? The man 10xed my money between 2019 and 2021, what are you talking about? Tesla stock paid for an entire year of my college. He absolutely, 100% deserves it for doing that. Even though the stock is down now, it's still an 8x or so from where it was. People thought it was impossible for it to reach even that level by 2024. I'm quite confident that he knows what he's doing. It's crazy how the same people who go \"trust the experts\" one minute turn around and go \"ha all those incredibly talented engineers at Tesla? They don't know what they're doing!\" Tesla is 99% not Elon Musk, he'd be the first to tell you that. \"I get far too much credit\" - Elon Musk\n\n> The idea that Elon Musk magically 10x'd the company through amazing CEO'ing is such blind adoration and so far removed from reality it's scary. Tesla is a large company made up of tens of thousands of people. Tesla has missed many of thier promised goals, and has declining performance year on year by many key metrics\n\nNope, it's not. It's really what happened, though certainly not by magic. Why do you think Musk is the common denominator between SpaceX, Tesla, and PayPal? What Musk did to 10x the company, specifically, was spend funds well hiring the right people to create the right technologies that are required for EVs to be profitable. No more, no less. He was also not afraid of cutting back and firing people when the company was in danger of bankruptcy (he cut I think more than 10% of the company back in 2018, aka why I'm saying recent job cuts at Tesla are normal Tesla behavior). He also dumped his personal fortune into the company to keep it from going bankrupt.\n\nPeople get it wrong when they call Musk a genius or doubt that he is one. Specifically what he is a genius at is infrastructure. He knows really well exactly how to figure out how much materials, tech, money, etc. a product needs to succeed. He's not a genius business man, and he's not a genius engineer (probably just a competent one, as his name is on a few patents). It's infrastructure/allocation of resources that he's good at, that's why tesla has succeeded where so many others have failed (and SpaceX too).\n\n> But sure, because he tweeted about sleeping on the factory floor, or bullied his way into getting his name on some patents, you think he deserves order of magnitude more than other, far more competant and successful CEO's.\n\n\"Bullied his way\" ??? Engineering is a team sport. I am a systems engineer. Most patents do not have just 1 name on them (unless they're extremely simple and/or non-technical). This is normal. Also, he has a bachelors degree in physics, which qualifies him for many engineering positions.\n\n> Please vote yes, you deserve the CEO you vote for. One that is going to grift you for every penny he can - because you are begging for him to.\n\nAlready did! Got my dad to as well lol. But man, non-investors really have a warped sense of Musk. Again, how has he \"grifted me for every penny\" when I'm still up 8x where I was when I invested? I also really really don't get why anyone would think it's a good idea to bet against the richest man in the world, no matter what you think of him personally.\n\nBut yeah, Musk is great. It's amazing to live in the same time as someone like that. As an environmentalist I am extremely pleased. Musk is the greatest environmentalist of our time, and unrelated but I like to point out this:\nIf he hadn't personally donated starlink to ukraine, there probably wouldn't be a ukraine (separate from russia) anymore. Also, no, he didn't \"turn off\" starlink on them during that attack on the Russian fleet. Crimea is a sanction area, it is literally illegal for starlink to be active there. The Ukrainians were told this, but forgot or there was a miscommunication.🤷‍♂️\n\nMusk's donation of starlink to ukraine should make him a hero in the eyes of anyone who supports Ukraine. But no. It's crazy how the mainstream media can twist even the best, most altruistic things into being bad. No wonder he bought Twitter lmao, they shouldn't have a monopoly on the news", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Not deflecting, just pointing out that these past few years are very normal Tesla behavior and that behavior is what got us our first 10x of the company value.🤷‍♂️\n\nSo YoY reductions in delivery are 'normal tesla behaviour'?\n\n>No, but almost. Based on my experience most likely the only thing I'd need to do is, when entering a parking lot with a supercharger, pick out a spot to park myself and then plug in. \n\nSo FSD can't park itself? Think about that for a second.\n\n> Uh, the link you sent doesn't work. It gives me a page not found error. \n\nWorks for me, here's the quote:\n\nCaliber’s “consideration score” for Tesla, provided exclusively to Reuters, fell to 31% in February, less than half its high of 70% in November 2021 when it started tracking consumer interest in the brand.\n\n> Yes, that's correct, but not because of Musk. Because of external market conditions.\n\nSo Tesla's success is largely based on external market conditions?\n\n> HA! WTF \"shitty performance\"??? The man 10xed my money between 2019 and 2021, what are you talking about? \n\nSo Tesla's success is not largely based on external market conditions?\n\n>  People thought it was impossible for it to reach even that level by 2024. \n\nTelsa didn't. The board didn't.\n\n> It's crazy how the same people who go \"trust the experts\" one minute turn around and go \"ha all those incredibly talented engineers at Tesla? They don't know what they're doing!\"\n\nYou referring to all the engineers that Elon is laying off?\n\n> Tesla is 99% not Elon Musk, he'd be the first to tell you that\n\nSo how is Tesla compensating these workers? After all, if Musk is only responsible for 1% of the success, and is getting 50B... surely there is a 5,000B compensation package in the works for everyone else?\n\n> What Musk did to 10x the company, specifically, was spend funds well hiring the right people to create the right technologies that are required for EVs to be profitable.\n\nWhat makes him $50B worth of hiring? Why not hire another CEO for $1B and have them do the hiring?\n\n> Specifically what he is a genius at is infrastructure. He knows really well exactly how to figure out how much materials, tech, money, etc. a product needs to succeed. \n\nWhat evidence do you have of this? Have you seen him budget a product? Or is he it his employees who are doing this like any other company?\n\nHow much has he helped Tesla reduce material waste for example? \n\n> This is normal. Also, he has a bachelors degree in physics, which qualifies him for many engineering positions.\n\nWhich qualifies him as a intern at some engineering positions. Seriously, bachelors do not make one an expert at anything.\n\n>  Again, how has he \"grifted me for every penny\" when I'm still up 8x where I was when I invested? \n\nAhh, just because you don't understand the grift means he's not a grifter?\n\nHint, if the board had decided to pay elon say $1B instead of $50B... do you think your stock would have performed worse? If so... why?\n\n> As an environmentalist I am extremely pleased. Musk is the greatest environmentalist of our time\n\nElon Musk, the wealthy owner of Twitter, has falsely claimed that farming has no major effect on the climate — prompting corrections from scientists and raising fears about misinformation on the influential social media platform.\n\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/elon-musk-climate-tweet-misinformation/a-66082443\n\n> If he hadn't personally donated starlink to ukraine, there probably wouldn't be a ukraine (separate from russia) anymore. \n\nTesla definately should pay him 50B for the 'donation' SpaceX (not Musk) made to Ukraine.\n\nA donation of 3667 terminals which has turned into over 20k terminals the vast majority of which were paid for by others.\n\nSo you're calling him a hero... for what was essentially a free trial.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Some investors are salty now that it’s time to pay the piper.", "score": -9, "replies": [{"body": "This lawsuit was filed in 2018, the same year the compensation package was announced. \n\nSo your argument is no basis in reality.

You are basically betting that NVDA's business will account for a few percent the entire World economy in about 10 years from now. \n\nSuch a huge expansion must require massive investments with huge costs associated with it.

I'm not worried about it. \n\nHere is why:\n\n\n\nThe stock has rallied from about $100 to $170 on a couple non-sensical things.\n\n1) Moderna \"lost\" a markman hearing against ABUS. Markman hearings are not super important, it's basically the judge defining what's actually going on in a patent litigation, the definitions, the claims, etc, so that the actual hearing doesn't get too tangential. But the way the claims were defined make it almost certain ABUS will win in court. If they win, MRNA will owe ABUS somewhere in the range of $1 to $7 BILLION.  just depends what % Royalty the hearing ultimately decides what's fair. BUT THE STOCK SHRUGGED THIS OFF. Likely a crowded short that didn't go down because it's a markman... not down? Then up! Shorts covered.\n\n2) RSV vaccine approval not assured. The efficacy of mrna rsv vaccine is not the best, GSK and pfizer have RSV vaccines, and depending on what time point you look at, mrna is either the middle or the worst. https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Announces-Update-on-Investigational-RSV-Vaccine/default.aspx\n\nThe fda delayed their PDUFA approval to the end of the month. I assume it'll get approved, but that approval is already priced in, it was priced in at $80... (were at $160).\n\n3) h5n1 bird flu. This is an obvious covid play book. Mrna went crazy during covid. Bird flu is scary. But mrna, right? Wrong.\n\nHUGE different here, most importantly, WE HAVE BIRD FLU VACCINES APPROVED FOR H5N1. There's 3. \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/H5N1_vaccine\n\n[Here is the NBC article discussing the same](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna149961)\n\nSo people are buying MRNA as a covid-like play, but there is no reason any government will give mrna a stock piling money now - they'll give it to the APPROVED VACCINES (HINT: THEY ARENT MRNA)\n\n4) ASCO conference for their \"cancer vaccine\". This is a whole rabbit hole that would take a long time to explain, but in early June Moderna and merck will present updated data to their mrna vaccine in melanoma. It's a relatively small follow up where we already know the outcome. It \"worked\" but it's unlikely to work in a very large trial.\nPeople think that the results are so good that Merck (and moderna) will file for accelerated approval to the FDA. That's not going to happen. It's too small a trial in too early of a disease setting. As such they will have to run a very large Phase 3 trial. Moderna has been telling investors they can file on accelerated approval, but if you ask Merck, they say no lol, that would be preposterous. \nThe ASCO event is a non-event, but people apparently think it's a big deal. But we already know it \"worked\" in this early trial. This update isn't going to change anyone's opinion and isn't meaningful for approval.\n\nAs you can see, every reason MRNA is up is actually at best priced in when it was $80. But some of these catalysts are actually quite negative (ABUS markman hearing).\n\n*MRNA burns $1b a quarter.*\n\n\nEven if approved, the RSV vaccine will be mediocre at best, likely quite sluggish and not meaningful to topline.\nASCO cancer vaccine update is a non event and if no accelerated approval, that's very negative for the stock here.\nABUS will win in 2025 and mrna will owe them probably 4-5 billion dollars (they won't have that much cash then!) \n\nThe long term puts (2025 and 2026) are quite cheap, given this stocks fair value in my opinion is probably $60.\n\n**GLTA except mrna bulls.

This is a reduction in time between halvings and the beginning of a genuine bull run of 43.3%.

Make of this what you will.\n\nNote: we didn't have ETFs, MSTR, and some of the other shit that we do now, when the previous halvings occurred. I don't know what that means, precisely.
