In 2023, Vistra’s natural gas, nuclear and coal plants generated\nover 20% of electricity consumed in Texas.\nPage 3\n\nUnlike regulated utilities, where profits are determined by capital invested, Vistra operates\nin deregulated markets (primarily ERCOT and PJM), where they generate and sell electricity\nat market prices. Historically, Vistra has been valued at a steep discount to both the\nregulated utility sector and the broader market in part due to the challenging fundamentals\nof merchant power. Stagnant domestic electricity demand combined with an oversupply of\nnatural gas has made US electricity prices among the lowest in the world. Meanwhile,\nsignificant growth in subsidized renewable generation has created major intraday price\nvolatility in Vistra’s core markets, with power prices sometimes going negative during\nperiods of abundant sunshine or wind. Bankruptcies, including Vistra’s former parent\ncompany TXU in 2014, have become commonplace in the sector over the last decade.\nIn response to this challenging environment, we believe Vistra’s capital allocation strategy\nhas been brilliant. The company shut down unprofitable coal plants to improve its carbon\nfootprint and mitigate oversupply. Given the market was valuing its remaining gas assets at\npennies on the dollar relative to the cost of new builds, management patiently invested in\nmaintaining the existing fleet and deployed excess cash flow into share purchases, reducing\nits share count by ~33% from 2018 to 2023 at an average purchase price of about 1/3 of\ncurrent trading levels.\n\nIn March of 2023, Vistra made its latest smart capital allocation move, acquiring the nuclear\ngeneration assets of Energy Harbor (yet another bankrupt IPP), which served as the catalyst\nfor Third Point acquiring shares. The timing of this deal was prescient, as nuclear is finally\nbeing recognized for its merits as the only carbon-free source of 24/7 power generation.\nUnfortunately, onerous regulatory requirements make it very difficult to build nuclear plants\neconomically outside of China. Vistra seems to have channeled Mark Twain and thought:\n“buy nuclear generation, they’re not making it anymore”.\nAfter our investment, the market started to focus on two trends that we think will have\nprofoundly positive impacts on Vistra’s future value: increased penetration of intermittent\ngeneration (renewables), and an inflection in power demand from AI/data centers and\nelectric vehicles.\n\nPage 4\nWhile increased renewable generation is clearly a positive for reducing CO2 emissions, many\nsupporters of green energy are naïve to the impacts of solar and wind on the reliability of\ngrids (lower) and volatility of electricity prices (higher). Price signals have become so\ndistorted that rather than building new dispatchable (gas) power generation, we are\nshuttering capacity. However, when the wind stops blowing or the sun stops shining, we are\nincreasingly reliant on huge amounts of dispatchable generation to turn on quickly, even\nthough it may have been losing money an hour prior. Counterintuitively, electricity\ngenerated by gas in Texas has grown 30% since 2016 despite a twenty-fold increase in solar\nand a three-fold increase in wind. Texas recently created a $10 billion fund to incentivize\nnew gas generation to strengthen the grid. We believe the only way to incentivize new\ncapacity is to improve the long-term profit outlook for dispatchable gas assets via market\nreforms or other legislation and expect this to benefit those like Vistra who already own\nexisting dispatchable generation.\n\nWe also believe US electricity demand is poised for significant growth for the first time in\ndecades, and Vistra’s fleet of baseload power (both nuclear and natural gas) is uniquely\npositioned to benefit. As the AI arms race commences, McKinsey estimates new data center\nbuild could drive an incremental 800 TWh of global electricity demand by 2030, with 40%\nof this driven by Generative AI1. The US is expected to capture roughly half of this demand,\nas bargain-basement power prices make it the world’s leading destination for new data\ncenters despite higher labor and real estate costs. We expect data centers to drive domestic\ndemand growth to accelerate 1-2% per annum over the next five years against a baseload\nsupply backdrop that continues to decline as coal is phased out. Rising electric vehicle\npenetration is subsequently expected to add an additional 1% to annual growth (Pacific Gas\n& Electric, who serves a region with over 20% EV penetration, highlights that every two new\nEVs is equivalent to a new household in terms of demand).\n\n1McKinsey, March 2024, “Impact of data centers on US energy consumption”\nPage 5\nBecause many data centers require 24/7 power (which cannot easily be provided by\nrenewables) and connection timelines for utility grids exceed three years in some cases,\nhyperscalers have shown growing interest in contracting directly with nuclear plants behind\nthe meter to ensure speedy, consistent access to electricity. **For example, Amazon recently\nsigned a 20-year agreement with nuclear operator Talen to buy power at a ~60% premium\nto market prices. Despite this premium, nuclear remains by far the cheapest direct source\nof clean energy for a hyperscaler; the estimated levelized cost of electricity for a renewables\nsystem fit to provide 24/7 power is an eyewatering $200 per MWh, roughly triple what\nAmazon will pay Talen2.**\n\nVistra is in the pole position to capitalize on these trends, and we expect the discount applied\nto their assets to continue to narrow as their business becomes increasingly essential to\nserving domestic power demand.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for this!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I've been doubting to make a move into Oklo as well.\nBut the fact that they don't have anything yet, leaves me in doubt.\n\nCompetition is growing, and a lot is dependent on politics as well. \n\nFrom their own statement \"Oklo is pursuing an emerging market, with no commercial project operating, regulatory uncertainties; the potential need for financing .\"\n\nSo I dno, I expect volatility.

That’s in addition to the gains moving from 20A to the more advanced 18A node. These efficiencies are obviously incredibly important when it comes to the advancement of chip technology. Samsung and TSMC won’t have the ability utilize backside power until 2026.\n\nEUV lithography Machines- Intel bought all 5 of ASML’s 2024 machines, leaving its competitors with nothing until late 2025 at the earliest. These machines are the key to producing the most advanced chips in the world in the most efficient way possible with Intel planning on utilizing them for their 14A nodes. They will have, at minimum, a year head start on their rivals with how to best use this technology at a mass scale. \n\nChips act/subsidies: currently the largest beneficiary. Us government is heavily subsidizing their commercial fabs as well as one specific for national defense. Germany, Ireland and Israel are all giving massive subsidies to build their fabs.\n\nIFS: Intel's initiative to provide manufacturing services to other semiconductor companies. It leverages Intel's advanced manufacturing processes and technologies to produce custom chips for clients. This move marks Intel's expansion beyond designing and producing its own chips to offering its manufacturing capabilities to external customers, competing with other foundries like TSMC and Samsung Foundry. Intel aims to capitalize on its cutting-edge fabrication facilities and expertise to serve a broad range of customers in various industries. They have billions in pre orders already for 18A technology with MSFT already.\n\nTSMC Geopolitics: TSMC's operations in Taiwan make it vulnerable to geopolitical tensions with China. Any disruption in the region could impact TSMC's supply chain and operations.\n\nMobileye- is an Israeli technology company specializing in the development of vision-based advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving technology. Mobileye's technology includes features like lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems. Intel sold of 1.5 billion worth and still own 88% of the company. The stock is up big this year.\n\nHealthcare: Intel has been involved in the healthcare sector for quite some time. Intel's technology is used in various healthcare applications, including medical devices, data analytics, and telehealth solutions\n\nFinancials: Intel's financials remain strong, with a solid balance sheet, consistent revenue growth, and healthy cash flow generation when not spending tens of billions on the most important fabrication plants in the world. Long history of returning value to shareholders. \n\nThe obvious benefits of being an American Semi Conductor company when national security in the industry is being looked at as paramount.\n\n\nI feel like I’m taking crazy pills that this stock is only 30$ while AMD hovers around 200$.

Musk basically came up with a plan that would massively dilute existing shareholders, and Tesla's board let Musk drive the process and didn't propose alternatives.\n\nAt its very simplest, Rob's argument is \"no harm no foul\", since Tesla under Musk from 2018-2021 did succeed in reaching mass production.

Initially I was in your camp but after some time thinking about it and listening to Rob yesterday, what he says makes sense.

None of this was kept from us, any reasonable shareholder would have seen the same. On the other hand, the arguments for striking it down (both share dilution and board relationships) are telling us (shareholders who voted for) that even if we knew of these issues and accepted the risk, we can't vote \"yes\" for it under any circumstance, aka \"no fun allowed\". In a vacuum those arguments are certainly valid, but I fail to see how they can be made in this situation, where the circumstances were plainly obvious to shareholders at the time. Any share dilution would have easily been made up for by the market cap increase by Musk and Tesla hitting the tranches. Shareholders like myself would certainly pay a 15-20% dilution for a 10x return, who were those who owned shares and voted before the package was presented when the market cap was 30-40B.

Since we cannot reliably speculate the mental state of shareholders at the time beyond anecdotal evidence like myself and via hindsight by your claim, we only have the result of the initial vote, which no one argues. \n\n> Tesla had an obligation to disclose everything, and they didn't.\n\nI am really curious what wasn't disclosed that would have affected the trajectory of the company's execution in any meaningful way. \n\n> And what if you could have gotten that 10x return for just 10% dilution? Or 5% dilution?\n\nOn the basis of level of dilution, of course I would say I would want lower dilution, any sane shareholder would say the same, but that is only made with the benefit of hindsight. There was no guarantee that Tesla/Musk would have met the tranches presented in the original comp plan. Lower dilution would probably come with lower payouts and more achievable goals. Obviously I would have voted for a more achievable goal with lower dilution, but that was not what was presented. \n\nWhat this debate essentially boils down to is:\n\n\"If you are a shareholder currently, do you care if the deal could have been better made all those years ago?\"\n\nThis objectively is impossible to make without the bias of hindsight. Are we going to call into question the terms of every comp plan and deal every time in the future based on the outcome? \n\nAll Tesla can do is conduct the vote again. And since it was achieved the first time, under the conditions set the first time, I will reaffirm that vote. Should it fail and the board is required to present a new one, then I will vote for that one too.

So, our bills, w/ a lot of juggling use, times, and prices, are about negative 269 to negative 420/month, w/ our last bill -490.  Buy low, sell high (smart powerwalls help this a lot).

You're as good as your last product and in hardware, very often companies that have the best products make several mistakes thinking it's gonna last forever so keep milking customers rather than investing. Intel's done that and paid a high price, first in mobile, then on desktops and servers too.\n2. In tech, there's always space for new paradigms, innovations, etc. AMD has pushed a shit ton of them both on CPUs and GPUs why would you exclude they will in the future? Do you think they are stupid with such a giant market outside and say \"nah, let competitors make all the money\"? Of course not.\n3. Having the best product is not what big customers necessarily care about. There's many factors like price efficiency, energy efficiency, etc. Which is why you will find AMD GPUs in most supercomputers in the world. Radeon professional solutions tick a lot of these boxes like price and energy efficiency.\n4. While Nvidia has good hardware, the reason it enjoys this huge headstart isn't just hardware but software. AMD historically did poorly there, Nvidia invested for years in the ML ecosystem making sure CUDA, drivers and user libraries (from Pandas to whatever) worked together so naturally they have a huge advantage. Again, doesn't mean it's gonna hold forever.\n5. The biggest competition for Nvidia isn't just other hardware vendors like Intel or AMD that are more than capable of producing decent hardware that may hit multiple boxes on number #3 but especially it's big clients. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc, etc, those are not companies that have intentions of spending tens of billions forever in hardware just so Nvidia has 78% margins. Their margins are crazy, they are selling GPUs multiple times what they could with more competition. It's only natural that those huge clients, with deep resources which have lots of experience building both software and hardware will look into opportunities to cut their hardware expenses which are insane. It's a very bad idea to be cornered with only one vendor. All those companies are 100% looking into building their own hardware and they have the resource to build their own drivers and software for their use cases. Right now it's an arm race for these companies to release products, but the time will come quickly where they will look at cutting costs. Now costs aren't the issue, products are.\n6. At the end of the day, what AI is, is just matrix multiplication, done very fast. Huge arrays of float numbers that need to be multiplied very fast in large quantities at scale. All GPUs excel at that already. But it's not just horsepower you need but the entire package, and obviously the sector with such margins will attract more and more competition and investments.\n7. If you have red all I've said till now you may realize now, that Nvidia could potentially be another Cisco/Intel like in 1999.

If a baby is in the 5th percentile (again, as an individual), then they are heavier than only 5 out of 100 babies. The same can be applied to IQ.

At current potential, Nvidia is worth 5-6x its peers on P/S and 2x on P/E.\n\nGiven its monopoly position, margins are indeed prohibitive, but first, AI datacenter expansion is being done by only a few dozen companies globally and there are no plans to expand the list due to the high entry threshold, and second, large capital expenditures are highly cyclical and such a frenzy will not happen in 2-3 years.\n\nNvidia no longer has the \"key to success\" as all other business segments (Gaming and AI PC, Professional Visualization, Automotive and Robotics) are literally insignificant on the scale of current results, generating about $12-14 billion in revenue per year with a declining trend. These segments will generate $15.1 billion in 2020, $15.5 billion in 2021, $11.5 billion in 2022, $13.1 billion in 2023, and the potential for up to $13 billion in 2024. Prospects - None, all the potential is in data centers only.\n\nIt is impossible to extrapolate the current growth rates of Nvidia's financial indicators - the results are already close to the limit, given the hype, and in 2-3 years the results will begin to decline, and the margin will shrink, because competitors - primarily AMD - can come to the profitable place. Google, Amazon and Intel are also trying to enter the market.\n\nAll of Nvidia's dominance is due solely to data centers, i.e. almost 90% of revenue is now generated in this segment. In 8 years, revenue has grown by two orders of magnitude (100x) in supplying data centers under AI.\n\nEven if Nvidia achieves potential results, the current capitalization is already 2.5x the market.
