Conversely, if \\( k \\) is small, the increase in Squirrel Value is gradual.\n\n- **Linear Relationship**:\n  - The equation \\( S = kD \\) indicates a linear relationship between \\( S \\) and \\( D \\), where the slope of the line is \\( k \\).\n  - This implies that for every additional Muskrat, the Squirrel Value increases by \\( k \\) units.\n\n# Statistical Considerations\n\n- **Assumptions**:\n  - The relationship between \\( S \\) and \\( D \\) is linear.\n  - The Nut Factor \\( k \\) is constant over the range of \\( D \\).\n\n- **Estimation of \\( k \\)**:\n  - In practice, \\( k \\) can be estimated using statistical methods such as linear regression if we have empirical data on Muskrats and Squirrel Value.\n  - Suppose we have \\( n \\) pairs of observed values \\((D_i, S_i)\\). We can estimate \\( k \\) by minimizing the sum of squared residuals:\n    \\[\n    \\text{minimize} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\color{red}{S_i} - \\color{green}{k} \\color{blue}{D_i})^2\n    \\]\n  - The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of \\( k \\) is given by:\n    \\[\n    \\hat{k} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\color{blue}{D_i} \\color{red}{S_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\color{blue}{D_i}^2}\n    \\]\n\n# Example Calculation\n\n- Suppose \\( k = 2 \\). If there are \\( D = 10 \\) Muskrats, then the Squirrel Value \\( S \\) would be:\n  \\[\n  \\color{red}{S} = \\color{green}{2} \\times \\color{blue}{10} = \\color{red}{20}\n  \\]\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe model \\( S = kD \\) provides a quantitative framework for understanding how the number of Muskrats (downvotes) influences the Squirrel Value (value of shorts) in the stock market. This relationship, characterized by the Nut Factor \\( k \\), allows us to predict changes in the Squirrel Value based on observed Muskrats, assuming the linear proportionality holds.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Hey that sounds totally illegal!", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "I say call his bluff.

Fine, you add bats to the dataset and retrain.

The first model got the platypus right, but mainly by chance. Once we added the bat and retrained, the new data along with the stochastic nature of SGD means the decision boundaries may have shifted, and now the platypus ends up on the other side of the decision boundary.\n\n\nNow, self driving is not a simple classification, but every situation encountered in the wild will lay somewhere between or outside of the training examples, and will be some combination of factors from different nearby points, and will have the same kinds of \"regressions\".\n\n\nThis is relevant for intervention data too, interventions will fix very specific holes, like the platypus, but after retaining there might be other holes revealed.

This isn't my concern or the point I'm trying to make.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Im not referring to the tax liability the action itself imposes on Tesla(and its investors) but his base line fiduciary responsibility he holds as the chief executive of  Tesla. He has a legal financial obligation to  Tesla that he is not bound to with X(twitter). You as the chief executive of a publicly traded company cannot take resources from the publicly traded company and divert them into your privately held enterprise. That is just theft, it is literally stealing Tesla resources and a market play(from a publicly traded company he is chief executive officer of) and diverting them into his own privately held company. Yes tax laws may have been violated, because a capital purchase was executed(but I have no deeper knowledge than anyone else of the the details of the transaction between Tesla and X that allowed the hand over of this delivery so thats not the point Im making)we can start at taking employees time from Tesla and diverting it to X, and a more recent example might be diverting chip delivery from the publicly traded company(Tesla) to the company he privately holds(x/twitter with several other investors). I have seen some argue that Tesla didn‚Äôt need the chips, so did he fail his fiduciary responsibility when they were ordered or when he used his position as the executive of Tesla to secure the chips for X‚Ä¶.. You really think it‚Äôs ok for a CEO of a publicly traded company to leverage Tesla buying power for propping up and using for his separate and private enterprise. If he wants to use his own resources, go for it, I see no problem. It‚Äôs using the leverage and resources of Tesla for the financial benefit of his private enterprise that violates his fiduciary responsibility and should make all investors ask WTF is he even doing as the CEO of Tesla and whose interests is he protecting.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It would be less of a problem if the Tesla employees didn‚Äôt get paid for work they did for xAI. The issue is using resources from a publicly traded company to benefit a privately held company you have a stake in. The resources of Tesla are not Elon‚Äôs, they are the resources of a publicly traded company and he doesn‚Äôt own anywhere near a majority stake even. If he uses the company‚Äôs assets to benefit a separate company he owns a share in then he is essentially profiting off of the resources of the public shareholders of Tesla which is illegal. This is why everyone is making a big deal out of this, because it is a big deal. Have you ever heard the term embezzling? Using company resources to unjustly enrich yourself is pretty much what it comes down to, which is similar to what he is accused of doing here. Whether or not you see it, or whether or not you think it‚Äôs a big deal is irrelevant because you are one shareholder, decisions are made by a board and CEO and strict governance rules at a publicly traded company and that‚Äôs what was bypassed here when Elon decided to just say it‚Äôs cool to give a bunch of highly desired resources to another company he has an interest in, when it‚Äôs very likely that those resources could have been more valuable to Tesla if used in a different manner. Likewise companies make other companies pay to access data and this is standard practice, just letting another company access a public company‚Äôs data is not acceptable business practice for a CEO, even less so when the CEO owns part of the company getting access for free. Again, your thoughts on this are really not relevant and neither are mine, there are rules and regulations around this exact kind of scenario for good reason. This would be like saying a bank manager can just give his friend some cash out of the vault because ‚Äúit‚Äôs chill, who cares?‚Äù And when some shareholders get upset that an employee of the bank is giving away free money you decide to tell them it‚Äôs cool because you don‚Äôt see a problem with it. Elon is an employee of Tesla when it really comes down to it, he is the most powerful employee and shareholders have given him a great deal of trust but that doesn‚Äôt mean he can do whatever he wants with that trust, the board of directors is supposed to keep him in check as an independent party that scrutinizes the actions he takes. Now they aren‚Äôt supposed to just question everything all the time and oppose him on everything either, but with a potential conflict of interest like having a CEO make a deal between two companies he owns sizeable interests in, then yes the board is supposed to absolutely scrutinize any decision or deal like that to a great degree.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I didn't read all of this, but I read some.\nI'm not gonna keep going around this topic because I don't think you can even point to an article that proves your case.

{"title": "FUNDAMENTALS DD: Why Grindr is different from all other dating apps and deserves a 10b+ valuation", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I own a shitload of $GRND (shares mostly)\n\nInvesting in a gay hookup app that's up during a year when dating apps like Bumble ($BMBL) and Tinder ($MTCH) are getting crushed? What are you, fucking stupid? No, hear me out.\n\nI argue that Grindr should be valued like a food delivery app because of the unique characteristics of its user demographic. Unlike Bumble and Tinder which cater to opposite sex couples, Grindr's users are primarily gay men. It's a biological fact that men are (on average) hornier than women, and that explains why interactions between Grindr users are more explicitly sexual in nature with a focus on hookups. Although other dating apps can be used for hookups, they were designed for dating and the mismatch in sex drive between men and women guarantees that won't ever change. Grindr, on the other hand, is specifically designed around sex, with users able to filter potential matches based on their sexual preferences and interests. The app is built for hookups.\n\nReturning to the food delivery analogy, the key insight here is that with Grindr, you are not ordering food to your doorstep, but rather a human being. Just as with apps like Uber Eats and Doordash, you select the menu item (in this case, the person), specify any additional options or requirements (such as bear, twink), and then place your order. Once the order is complete, it is delivered to you (in this case, the man arrives at your location). Easy, convenient, and efficient.\n\nToo much so in fact. Similar to how food delivery services exploit people's dopamine button to serve them overpriced fast food, Grindr short circuits the brain's reward system to serve them sex. From an addiction perspective, its actually even worse because nobody spends multiple hours a day seeking instant gratification by constantly refreshing Uber eats. If you don't believe me, search \"addiction\" on r/grindr. This is why Grindr users spend on average 61 minutes per on the app, FOUR TIMES are long the average Bumble and Tinder user (source: page 24 of the [Investor Presentation](https://s201.q4cdn.com/840224656/files/doc_presentation/2022/05/Grindr-Investor-Presentation-2022.05.10.pdf)). Furthermore, same-sex households have an 18% higher income compoared to opposite and gay men have an 10% higher median income than do their straight counterparts. In case the penny hasn't dropped for you regards yet, that means gays can afford to spend hundreds of dollars per year on Grindr.\n\nOk fine, I kind of see your point, u/AnusChapstick. Grindr should not be valued like a traditional dating app because its userbase is infinitely more horny and monetizable than regular dating apps. But how did you arrive at that $10b number?\n\nRemember, Grindr is a delivery app but with men instead of food. Let's compare it to Doordash, the food delivery market leader. $DASH trades at a market cap of $53 Billion. With 37 million monthly active users (MAU), that ronds to $1430 per user. Is that high? Could be, but when you factor in its topline growth and expansion potential, that number starts looking a little more reasonable. But wait, what about Grindr's revenue growth? Isn't Doordash growing a lot faster? Well no, with 242M in TTM revenue (up 34% since last year), GRND is growing at the same rate (actually slightly faster when comparing Q4 YoY growth) than DASH is. Furthermore, DASH is still operating at a loss whereas Grindr is profitable, making Grindr a better stock than Doordash by both profitability and revenue growth metrics. Applying DASH's user multiple to GRND's 13.3mm MAU yields a market cap of $19 billion. Hence the 10b+ valuation I alluded to earlier.\n\nJust like how Tesla's stock price experienced an unprecedented rapid rise compared to other major automakers such as Ford and GM, Grindr is exploding in valuation compared to Tinder and Bumble. The market is quickly pricing that man ass is more monetizable than puss.\n\nGRND PT: $69\n\nTl;dr $GRND has 15%+ short interest but the shorts are dead wrong because they underestimated the horniness of gay men.", "id": "1d9nuwp", "created_utc": 1717695014.0, "score": 574, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 299, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 27 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So you are saying we should all invest in gay sex?", "score": 646, "replies": [{"body": "Never has a DD made me so erect", "score": 170, "replies": [{"body": "WSB truly next level. \n\nMost would settle being a üåàüêª, but WSB finds a way to üåàüêÆ too.", "score": 60, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/qy0q6z06uc5d1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=994c6b3d37a29d1d3835e6f76c2047a6f5d86876", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/u14r829dz05d1.jpeg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfa0570aa52a55f45b406ceda0e382bfb06bfddb\n\nnice", "score": 78, "replies": [{"body": "Dark mode bro, once you go black you never go back.", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "He‚Äôs about to double that.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Double 69?\n\nNice, nice", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "A gay 69 is more like a rectangle if you really think about it", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So you are saying we all gay?\n\nYes", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "It‚Äôs not gay if it‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs penis", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "I didn‚Äôt think that WSB would be trying to do DD on üåàüêª as a consumer market but here we are", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "gay sex can be MONETIZED", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "OP is on to something nobody spends more money on useless things than the gays. \n\n\nAll in.", "score": 710, "replies": [{"body": "Does the app cost anything to be on it?", "score": 85, "replies": [{"body": "Shouldn‚Äôt you know that already?", "score": 361, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)", "score": 142, "replies": [{"body": "Busted!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Of course, that‚Äôs how he met his wife‚Äôs boyfriend.", "score": 20, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "No thats why i dont think they can convert users to money.

So people aren't buying into it now. \n\nBMBL and MTCH don't provide a good dating experience. It's human nature, men and women are looking for different things and so have a disappointing time, especially men, we're just horny mofos that want to fuck.
