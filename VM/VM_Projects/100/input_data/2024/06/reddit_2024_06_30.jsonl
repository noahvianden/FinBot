What you need to know is that price appreciation and dividends are not mutually exclusive, if a company doesn't pay dividends all the value created is distributed through price appreciation, with that in mind once they distribute dividends price is adjusted leaving you were you started. Divends do not directly create value, they are great signals though when evaluating a company. That's why when a company that has never paid dividends announces a quarterly dividend payout the stock might really which is counter intuitive but the rationale behind that rally could be that because of asymmetric information the agents at those companies have a more positive/stable outlook for the company which leads to a reduction in risk/cost of capital and then price appreciation, on the other hand when high growth companies suddenly announce quarterly dividend payout their stock might decline because the market believes the company no longer as growth prospects and with narrower future growth comes lower prices. ", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, and there is no guarantee that the company will use those proceeds to create more value to the company or the shareholder.

This again goes to my point of signaling, if a company as a significant cash balance and doesn't pay out dividends, the executives are likely to chase value destroying activities and this leads to a discount in price and if the company doesn't end up doing something stupid and rather pays a dividend, price appreciates it's not because they paid the dividend rather it's because they did not destroy value by pursuing stupid projects.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> if they didn't make that acquisition then you are indifferent between them holding that excess cash on their balance sheet or paying it out as dividends.\n\nCorrect.

They started scratched on Metroid because it wasn't to their quality. If they wanted to make a quick billion, they could release Fortnite skins. Nintendo will not, probably ever. Not even on their own console as exclusive.\n\nEvery 6 years they release a new console. While the Switch was fantastic and amazing, they eliminated 2 consoles for one. Back in the early 2010's, Nintendo was flying high with a handheld and console. With that, they are very hit or miss with consoles. For every Switch, DS, and Wii they have had Virtual Boys and Wii U's. The Wii U almost removed Nintendo from the console space... and in the next decade, I am convinced apps will take over consoles.\n\nThird-Party, all I am saying is that no new big entry Grand Theft Auto (or similar big ip) has released on a Nintendo console. That would be a big opportunity for them, but they never seem to build those bridges.\n\nIn many ways, the brainchild of Nintendo is aging. A lot of the creative minds that established these IPs Mario, Donkey Kong, Kirby, Metroid, Zelda, Pikmin, and others are aging.

They're raising prices, cracking down on password sharing, implementing ads, and instead of dropping a season up binge, going back to weekly shows. \nI don't know if it will be Netflix, but I see a clear winner coming out in the streaming service and combining services. Disney is kind of doing it with hulu and espn.  Imagine if HBO Max never became profitable so they sold the rights to Disney. Then they pick up \"cult\" channel like AMC+ when Walking Dead was popular. Instead of paying for 5 different services, It will all be on one platform, likely Disney. Disney just got the NBA deal.

And Lilly has at least two drugs in the pipeline that promise to be *better* than Mounjaro.\n\nLet me give you an example.  For more than 50 years I and docs like me have been prescribing aspirin 81 mg a day for a 13% reduction in overall stroke risk.  We think that's great - to cut strokes by 13% - and despite looking hard, we've not found a drug with a better risk/benefit profile.  We have drugs that are incrementally a bit more effective - Brilinta may cut stroke risks as much as 17-18% - but bring much greater risks; in Brilinta's case, mostly life-threatening bleeding.\n\nMounjaro slams on the scene and we *accidentally* happen to find, while looking for some other effects, that it cuts stroke risk 34%.  And it doesn't cause bleeding like all the other effective anti-stroke therapies do.  \n\nI'll take the \"go fuck yourself\" to the last 50 years of research I and others have been doing in exchange for the magic shot, thank you.\n\nThe next step, which is already happening, is how these GLP-1 drugs are going to start being named in specialty medical association official peer-reviewed guidelines.  Once that happens, health insurers will literally have no choice but to pay for them - but by then they'll have crunched the numbers and realized every patient they have on Mounjaro saves them an average of $50-100K a year spent on costly health things they don't have to pay for *because they never happened.*\n\nLilly won't reap all the benefits - most of them will be reaped by individuals - but they'll make their revenue projections and then some.\n\nLLY Jun 25 1000c.
