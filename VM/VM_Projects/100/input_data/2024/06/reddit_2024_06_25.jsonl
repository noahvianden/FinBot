So if it is OTM it will drop hard.\n\nI think it is more impactful to nearer-term OTM options. I looked at option contract trade for NVDA pre-split and post-split and adjusted the contracts so the pre and post-split were on equal footing. so for example the day before the split, NVDA 08/16 1500 had a VWAP price of  $2308.80 so that would turn into 10 contacts at $230.88 each. Post-split those same adjusted contracts could be bought for $ 200.89 so they declined about 13% due to the split. Ultimately it is the laws of supply and demand. By splitting that contract into 10 individual contracts, it allows more contracts to enter the market and there is no longer scarcity due to the higher premium pre-split.\n\nI was holding a 6/21 1400 C that was trading pre-split at  $583 after the split I was not holding 10 6/21 140 C and they were trading at $23.5 each so a total of $235. Without a major movement in the stock post-split, I lost about 60% of the value of my contracts. \n\n  \n Look at Chipotle OTM options today and check their prices tomorrow morning. Right now a CMG 9/20 4000 Call is at $ 31.10 on the bid.

They're keeping it up there because that's the only way they can get information about the issue to fix it since once you reenter and land, the heat shield is gone and you can't run any more tests. Same with checking the thrusters since they're on the service module that gets ejected before reentry. If there's not enough fuel, they'll use another spacecraft to get them back home. Should they have tested the thrusters more before sending it up? Probably. Let's hope it doesn't come back to bite anyone more.\n\nCompanies and agencies work their butts off to catch problems (though I agree that Boeing isn't even trying it seems), but things still happen during tests. After all, the space shuttle constantly had problems with tiles falling off even after the first launch. And don't forget about the failures and tragedies with the Soyuz and Apollo spacecraft.
