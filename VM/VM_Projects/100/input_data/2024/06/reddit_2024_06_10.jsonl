I love the challenge of growing one of the most successful practices in my area. \n\nJust some quick background. I was an athlete, a Wrestler. That paid for College(or most of the money I got would have been gone). But I was wild. I drank in the off-season, partied, got in trouble. ONE time though, got into a fight with a bouncer. Had no idea what was happening, in a group of \\~20, a bouncer knocked my friend out COLD(head bounced off the pavement and for a little more context, he died of a slow brain bleed 9 months later...were they connected? I don't know). \n\nBut if not for the lawyer I had, a younger guy who fought like hell for me, I'd have quit school(or never started law school) as I'd have been a violent offender. He went above and beyond.\n\nThat's MY little anecdote. \n\n  \nThere are people who have had VERY poor representation and they're sitting in jail because they took the plea bargain I was offered(2 YEARS and 5 years of probation) because they couldn't afford bail.\n\nI'm not looking to defend child abusers, but kids who made a stupid mistake, or people who I think were the target of a lazy investigation. I love what I do and I think there's value to it.\n\nAnd right now I have 2 full-time employees, and I'm just early on in starting my own practice. I love making an argument...and...that's my hobby.\n\nAlso, I think when you don't have something driving you, when you just have hobbies, you start to lose motivation. It's not good to be 40(well, not quite, 39) and to stop working. \n\nBut again, I also don't think my money would last. I have dreams of making a LOT more money and...well, other goals that are pretty far out there, so I'm not going to put them out there yet. \n\n  \nThat's NOT a slave mentality, that's my life.

{"title": "Riding the AMD Wave", "selftext": "Let me give you the lowdown on what‚Äôs going on with AMD and how I'm playing it.\n\n# Current Play:\n\nSo, AMD's been moving‚Äîup 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here‚Äôs the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That‚Äôs a 78% drop in volume! Something‚Äôs brewing.\n\n# Analyst Chatter:\n\nThe street‚Äôs buzzing. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:\n\n* **Citigroup:** Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says ‚Äúbuy.‚Äù\n* **Morgan Stanley:** Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù rating.\n* **KeyCorp:** Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with ‚Äúoverweight.‚Äù\n* **DZ Bank:** Upped to a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù with a $190 target.\n* **Wedbush:** Stays ‚Äúoutperform‚Äù with a $200 target.\n\nOverall, it‚Äôs a solid ‚ÄúModerate Buy‚Äù from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They‚Äôre mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix.\n\n# Financial Pulse:\n\nEarnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue‚Äôs at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady.\n\nKey ratios to watch:\n\n* **Debt-to-equity:** 0.03.\n* **Quick ratio:** 1.92.\n* **Current ratio:** 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it‚Äôs got a beta of 1.69, so it‚Äôs got some juice in a volatile market.\n\n# Insider Moves:\n\nNow, insiders are moving. **CEO Lisa Su** unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and **EVP Mark Papermaster** sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting.\n\n# Institutional Maneuvers:\n\nBig players are piling in:\n\n* **Norges Bank:** Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD.\n* **DZ BANK AG:** Boosted their stake by over 800%.\n* **International Assets Investment Management LLC** and **Capital World Investors:** Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion.\n* **Price T Rowe Associates Inc.:** Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth.\n\n# My Strategy:\n\n**Technical Setup:**\n\n* **50-Day Moving Average:** $161.33.\n* **200-Day Moving Average:** $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages.\n\n**Entry Points:**\n\n* **Short-Term:** I‚Äôm eyeing a dip around $165. That‚Äôs close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce.\n* **Long-Term:** If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it‚Äôs time to load up.\n\n**Exit Strategy:**\n\n* **Short-Term Gains:** I‚Äôm looking to cash out around $176 to $177, right in line with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley‚Äôs targets. Quick win.\n* **Long-Term Hold:** Eyeing around $200, where Wedbush‚Äôs target lies. That‚Äôs a juicy exit if it runs up there.\n\n# Market Conditions:\n\nKeep an ear to the ground for earnings and industry news. The semiconductor space can flip on a dime with supply chain issues or new tech breakthroughs.\n\n# The Bottom Line:\n\nAMD‚Äôs got some strong fundamentals and analyst support, despite some recent target cuts. It‚Äôs a play worth considering, with a potential sweet spot for entry at $165 and a target exit anywhere between $176 and $200.

AMD is going the Open Source route.\n\nIn the consumer dGPU, AMD has actually closed the gap with RDNA2, but gaming PC is very Nvidia centric. This market is very price and margin sensitive, and Nvidia has a big economies of scale advantage. Also AMD supplies chips for Consoles. And so this is where their attention is.\n\nDatacenter has much more margins to work with, to where AMD is not constrained by the differences in economies of scale.\n\nWhen it comes to consumer mobile GPUs. I think AMD has a huge opening there as well. This is due to AI PC. AI PC is increasing the need for memory bandwith, which was what always held iGPU back.

ARM chips are only more efficient at light workloads. At heavy workloads x86 has an edge, due to SMT. This is why AMD has a strong presence in high performance consoles.

{"title": "American consumer credit is tapped out and growth is off the table", "selftext": "# Sources:\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/g19/current/](https://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/g19/current/)\n\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC\\_2024Q1.pdf?sc\\_lang=en](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2024Q1.pdf?sc_lang=en)\n\n# What is consumer credit and why should I care?\n\nDifferent people use different metrics to determine whether the economy and/or the market is doing well. People use jobs numbers, inflation, the misery index, GDP growth, gas prices, shipping volume, etc. I use consumer credit, specifically the G.19 Consumer Credit Outstanding survey done monthly by the Federal Reserve. The reason is that the entire American economy sans public spending (which is laid out by congressional budgets ahead of time and already factored into total market valuations) eventually trickles down to what the average Joe goes out and buys. Yes, even AI and all the hype around that eventually comes down to \"how can we use this to sell people stuff\".\n\nConsumer spending drives market growth. Consumers spend beyond their means on a regular basis through the use of credit. This credit can be revolving, like credit cards, or nonrevolving, like home equity lines of credit (HELOC) or auto loans. The pulse of the consumer's financial health is the rate of growth of their revolving credit balance. A typical yearly cycle will see rising and falling credit balances with an average annual growth rate of about 5%. However, since 2020 this cycle has been anything but typical.\n\nIn 2020, credit card balances dropped through the floor as Americans made the prudent decision to pay off their credit cards with the money from the government stimulus checks. This was followed by 2021 seeing a rapid increase in credit card spending, which economists were not concerned about as this was a \"correction\" back to previous debt and spending levels. The issue was that inflation was now beginning to outpace the rising wages people experienced during the pandemic, and in 2022 we saw an eye-watering 15% increase in revolving credit balances year over year. Keep in mind, the average yearly increase is 3-6%. This was primarily driven by inflation, as people were being forced to use credit cards to pay bills or for necessities. In 2023 we saw another 8.8% growth in revolving debt year over year, meaning this was on top of the previous 15% growth in debt from the previous year. This is likely due to the sticky inflation around core expenses like food, cars, housing, etc.\n\nThis trend did not appear to be slowing down in Q1 2024 either. In January we saw a 7.5% YoY increase, and February another double-digit 10.7% increase. However, in March, growth of revolving debt is only 1.5%, and for April, the most recent number, revolving debt has actually gone down by -0.4%. What's going on? Did people suddenly stop charging on their credit cards? At first I thought this could be due to people using their tax returns to pay off their debts, but this data is seasonally adjusted, meaning the only way that could be the case is if people did not pay their credit card balances off with last year's tax return but this year they are. That would also imply that people are more financially sound this year than they were in 2023. Personally, I do not believe that is true, and I believe the motor vehicle loans prove this.\n\n# What do cars have to do with credit cards?\n\nMotor vehicle loans reflect an American's largest consumer good. Growth in these loans for the past 3 years has been enormous as supply shocks, high interest rates, and lots of consumer demand drove prices of new and used cars up. But if we look at outstanding motor vehicle loans for Q1 2024 we see they've actually gone down compared to Q4 of 2023. What happened? Why would people stop buying cars in Q1, the time of year when people get a big down payment in the form of a tax return? Could people just be paying off their auto loans too?\n\nOne thing you have to understand about the mentality of the American consumer is they do not know how to not spend money. The Becky Index illustrates this better than probably anything else. To quote a bible, \"No amount of economic or political turmoil will keep women from their fake eyelashes.\" In 2020, people paid off debt with a windfall from the government because they had nothing to spend it on, they were locked inside their homes. Now, we have vacations to go on, cars to buy, expensive toys to flex, we as a consumer demographic will spend money compulsively, because at the bottom of our terrified souls the thing we fear most is for others to think we are struggling, or worse, poor.\n\n# If consumers always spend money, why did they stop spending money?\n\nThey didn't.\n\nWhen a delinquent loan becomes uncollectable, it is passed to a collections agency. The bank that held the loan then considers it a \"charge-off\" which is no longer a collectable debt, and thus it is removed from the numbers visible in the G.19 statistic. It is my hypothesis that consumers are still spending money on their credit cards and are still buying cars, but we have reached an inflection point where any increase in consumer debt through spending is countered by unpaid debts going to collections somewhere else. Consumers will spend money until they can't and what's happening is they literally can't. They have run out of credit and we are beginning to see the collections outpace new spending on the credit card and motor vehicle loans. Loan forgiveness and/or write-offs are inherently deflationary as they remove money from circulation via a contraction of the money multiplier.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yi0toxne9p5d1.png?width=1789&format=png&auto=webp&s=be55701812a208c9e3905c0d0ba9b7e737b86c7e\n\nWith the exception of Gen Z, credit card delinquency hasn't been this high since the great recession. You may also notice that this balance percentage lines up pretty well with the numbers for January and February revolving debt growth. Other interesting graphs are Transition into Serious Delinquency (90+) for Auto Loans by Age, and Auto Loan Originations by Age. All these signs, in my opinion, point to a tapped out American consumer, and without more consumer spending, growth is off the table.\n\n# What's going to happen?\n\nNo idea. People love to say that nothing will happen before the election, but we went from 9.8% revolving consumer credit growth to nothing in 1 month. Bear markets tend to happen fast and they tend to happen after a particularly bullish run, especially a bullish run that isn't based on any fundamentals and is highly speculative. I have no solid idea how bad a recession or market crash this is gonna be, or even if it will happen, I mean hell we've kicked the can this long. However, if I gaze into my crystal ball, this is what I see:  \nQ2 earnings from consumer driven companies will likely be a little tepid. Not catastrophic, remember, people are still spending money, but down-ish. However, earnings reports are mostly about the outlook for the next quarter and remainder of the year. I would expect these companies to begin moving their expected earnings down for Q3 and end of year. Assuming the election theory holds true, the market will probably continue its bull run into November, after which I would expect all hell to break loose in Q1. However, I'm about 60/40 on before or after the election, and my 60% is on the September Bear coming out of its cave particularly hungry. There might be a slight pop around election time as the speculation cools down, but it will be a dead cat bounce. Unfortunately, I'm an amateur economist and not a financial expert, so I don't know the best instruments to capitalize on this information, however I am leaning towards volatility plays moreso than puts, since the market tends to go apeshit before it crashes.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nConsumers are defaulting on debt as fast as they're spending and it's stalling out growth. No growth = no higher profits = boom goes the speculation bubble.\n\n# Edit:\n\nPosition disclosure: This morning I put on a $480 strike QQQ put for June 20th, 2025.", "id": "1dcghne", "created_utc": 1718007473.0, "score": 769, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 275, "comments": []}
{"title": "I‚Äôm long on Intel and here‚Äôs why.", "selftext": "Hey fam,\n\nLet's talk Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and how it stands in the face of the escalating geopolitical drama around Taiwan. TSMC, the heart of global chipmaking, is smack in the middle of this tension. If things go south, what‚Äôs the play with Intel?\n\n**Why Taiwan Matters:**\nTaiwan is HUGE in the semiconductor game because of TSMC. It‚Äôs the backbone of the supply chain that feeds giants like Apple and Nvidia. But with China‚Äôs eyes firmly set on Taiwan, there‚Äôs a real risk to stability here.\n\n**TSMC‚Äôs Tight Spot:**\nLong story short ‚Äì TSMC is in a geopolitical hotspot. Any military or political upheaval could lead to serious disruptions. We‚Äôre talking damaged facilities, production halts, and potentially losing market share if clients start looking for stability elsewhere. It‚Äôs impossible to overstate how much would be lost if a hot conflict erupts. I would expect TSMC, &  to go to ZERO - 5 minuites after a shooting starts. TSMC has built in failsafes to destroy some aspects of their fab if China tried to take them by force. \n\n**Intel‚Äôs Edge:**\nHere‚Äôs where Intel could swoop in. Unlike TSMC, Intel‚Äôs got a hefty chunk of its manufacturing stateside and in the EU. They‚Äôve been pouring cash into expanding their U.S. fabs, which could be a massive advantage if TSMC gets hit.\n\n**Bottom Line:**\nBetting on Intel could be a smart move. They‚Äôre set up to handle the fallout if Taiwan's situation goes sideways, likely going back to 90‚Äôs level  market share and emerging even stronger with contracts from what‚Äôs left of NVIDIA.\n\nWhat‚Äôs your take? Bullish on Intel given these factors, or is there too much uncertainty in the chip sector right now?\n\n---\n\nWould love to hear your strategies and thoughts on this!\n\nTLDR - I‚Äôm not an optimist. In the longterm, I think that war or political conflict over Taiwan is inevitable. That being the case, if Taiwan goes down, TSMC goes down. If TSMC goes down, NVIDIA go down too.

Had Zen 1 been another \"piledriver\" that could not be improved with incremental improvements. Then another attempt would have been 3-4 years out, time and money AMD did not have.

It means their tech lead that would give them parity and beyond with AMD isn't there. In this industry, architecture can only do so much. Being ahead on node tech however, is a generational leap. And can make a inferior product on the same node turn into a superior product if it launches before the competition can.\n\n> the 10nm debacle was intel not using euv and instead keeping on duv.\n\nMore ignorance, EUV was not available when 10nm initial release projections had it launching back in 2015. Yes, that was the initial early release target before 14nm was delayed. These nodes are worked on for half a decade before they make it to market. You design and engineer them around what tech is available. Not even TSMC used EUV initially for their 7nm node. \n\nIntel's 10nm issues were not tied to not having EUV. They were related to other design choices. As was proven, TSMC brought out a working equivalent node with their initial 7nm DUV node. Only later they started transitioning to using EUV for key layers on a updated variant.\n\n>at their current valuation, i don't see a problem with that.\n\nYou should, because the fabs are a key part to what makes Intel you know, Intel. If they don't have the fabs and regain the node lead over AMD. Then they are unlikely to gain a meaningful lead over AMD.\n\nBeing one of 2 players fighting over the dwindling X86 scraps, is not a growth story.

Wolf warrior diplomacy is their game and Taiwan is an easy nationalist rallying point that they will absolutely milk for all its worth. They like having Taiwan exist as it does because it creates a target, an object of desire to call upon and rally the masses, \"we will take Taiwan back!\" and all that. It cannot serve this purpose if they actually do it. \"B-but they did it with Honk Kong\". Much different circumstances, different geographical proximity, different setup, different stakes. They absorbed Honk Kong through subversion which means that ultimately business carries on as usual. Sucks for Honkongers but the rest of the world at large is unaffected. For China to benefit from such annexations, aside from their 15 minutes of fame which politically don't mean much since the same party has absolute authority anyways, they need to annex them intact. Honk Kong is a major economic hub and getting to stick their hands in those coffers is the whole point. Taiwan too, as a major industrial hub, is only worthwhile if it remains intact. Taking the island by force is next to impossible for various reasons, and even if they succeed it will be destroyed and be worthless. Taking it by subversion may be possible, but it will take time and not really affect the world at large, again business will continue as usual. China has no real friends but they've shown they prioritise trade relations above all else. Taking Taiwan won't mean much when they get sanctioned to hell and don't have where to sell their goods. US and Europe are trying to cut their China dependency, slowly but surely, so there's only so much they can push before they lose their customer base which is more important than any piece of land and whatever symbolic value it has. They also risk outing themselves as the paper tiger that they are if they do attempt to forcefully take it and not immediately succeed. Taiwan won't go down without a fight. \n\nBut this is wsb so let's go back to the stock. INTC is undeniably and fundamentally a great company, world leading on processors. But their stock is just shit. Don't ask me why because I really don't know but it's been pretty much trading sideways for 20+ years. It's maybe a decent long term dividends hold if you're ok with the massive range it has, so you're holding 60$ stocks for 2 years and then 30$ stocks for 2 years and then 60$ again so let's say average of 45$. Options plays on it are useless unless you're buying 1-2 year LEAPS because it's otherwise going sideways most of the time. Price ***could*** go up if they make some amazing AI announcement that changes the game but I doubt they can truly break out from their average of the past 5 years. And it  ***could*** go up if Taiwan is sacked but I honestly don't see that happening no matter what the papers say. \n\n**TL;DR:** Don't bank on Taiwan being attacked to make money. No matter how you look at it from opportunity costs alone INTC is not a good stock and your time and money are better utilised elsewhere.

He has always pushed us to achieve great things, even when such ideas were seemingly impossible at the time. Some examples:\nBack in 2014, Autopilot started on a ridiculously tiny computer that only had ~384 KB of memory and puny compute (didn't even have native floating point arithmetic). He asked the engineering team to implement lane keeping, lane changing, longitudinal control for vehicles, curvature, etc. Many, even in the team, thought that the request was crazy. Nonetheless, he never gave up and pushed the team to achieve this very difficult goal. In 2015, beyond all odds, Tesla shipped the world's first Autopilot system. The second closest such product only came to market many years later.\n\n\n>In 2016, Tesla started doing all of the computer vision required for Autopilot in-house instead of depending on external vendors. Many people thought it was insane to bet the product on developing the vision system from scratch within a few months, which had taken other companies a decade or more. Yet, we achieved this target within eleven months. This was a strategically important move that started the development of a strong AI team at Tesla.\nNot only did he push for strong AI software, but also for powerful AI hardware. Tesla, which others thought was just a car company, was making custom silicon to run neural networks efficiently. This hardware that was originally designed in 2017, came to production in February 2019 and remains extremely competitive with hardware coming out to date. For reference, this five year old AI computer has roughly 8x the AI inference compute as the state-of-the-art Apple M3 chip. It is still able to run the latest end-to-end neural networks built on top of the latest AI technology.\n\n\n>He was the one who bet on vision and AI to solve autonomy instead of relying on sensor crutches and high-definition maps. For anyone who has experienced the latest versions of FSD, it might be obvious that it can see all the important things and drive the car based on pure vision. However, back in 2020 and earlier it wasn't obvious to most. In fact, many \"experts\" in the field ridiculed Tesla and Elon for these choices. We have proved them wrong by shipping supervised FSD to millions of cars and shown that with good AI software, the car is able to handle the complexities of city driving such as making turns, handling intersection, yielding to pedestrians etc., just by seeing outside. In fact, we even removed the radars and ultrasonics to just really focus on the heart of the problem, which is AI. Today, it's almost paradoxical that, Teslas have the least amount of raw sensors, yet have the most autonomous capability compared to any production car. Pulling off such a contrary bet was only possible because of his extreme conviction and deep understanding of this problem.\n\n\n>He kickstarted the work on humanoid robots at Tesla in 2021, again before any ChatGPT or other obvious examples of the rise of AI. Just like the vehicle autonomy, Optimus is also being developed to be competent, scalable, and cost-effective in order to widely serve the world.\n\n\n>I could go on, but plainly, Elon is critical for Tesla's success in AI. It is his combination of deep technical understanding, insane perseverance and relentless hard work that have positioned Tesla to be a leader in real-world AI. Elon's technical intuition to make these important decisions way before others see it is unmatched. If not for Elon's ambition, Tesla might have dwindled to become just another car company. In the future, fully autonomous cars and useful household robots will be common place and the world will think that this was how it was always supposed to be. Until then, we need Elon Musk to push the frontier, because he sees it already.\n\nI am torn.

{"title": "After watching WWDC - Puts on Apple", "selftext": "Ok regards, this is a summary of my notes as I watched the WWDC.\n\n**TLDR:** Puts. Apple isn't ready. They are talking about a bunch of capabilities that will EVENTUALLY be ready, who knows when, and with what cost. They are no better than anyone else on the market. And if we are just getting calculator apps, I think it's going to take a while - like their self-driving cars.\n\n**What they brought:**\n\n**Holy crap, Apple has been showing \"BRAND NEW SHIT\" at WWDC - which has been on other fucking phones for the past 3-5 years.**\n\n* You can now hide apps on your phone? WTF. In their demo, the moron puts it in a 'secret folder' and it's still visible. LOL.\n* They advertised SCHEDULING OUTGOING TEXTS - bro I had this for 10 years. Ooooohhhhh, it gives me suggestions on custom words - you ducking morons, done.\n* It encrypts message to message - RCS that Google has been pushing. Done.\n* You get categorization for emails..... LATER THIS YEAR!?! Ok moron, even Yahoo Mail has been doing it for the past 6-12 months.\n* Tap to cash? That demo was making them hover their phones for some lame ass animation for 10 seconds.... bro, I want 3 seconds and done. PoS Wallet app.\n\n**Home & Audio**\n\n* Lol at their 'game mode' - ain't no one playing on your devices. But sure bro, keep dreaming.\n* The headphones work ONLY if developers of ALL MAJOR TITLES put in an effort to make it specifically to Apple, and I don't see that happening.\n* They are bringing a BRAND NEW Snoopy screen saver - that does mean they get a 1 trillion upgrade though. That's fair.\n\n**WatchOS**\n\n* Training modes are not bad, they have this market down pretty well. Upgrades were based on using your overall metrics to let you know where your training is at, and you can get better insight into your vitals so you know your high/low capacity when training.\n* They got some pregnancy metrics as well, meh, helps the preggos, but they didn't go into any extra details. It's just.... ok. Nice.\n* There are a whole bunch of attempted 'predictive' things - like when you travel it'll pop up to offer translations. Or if you have a ride coming from Uber/Lyft, it'll try to notify you. A few predictive things, where they are using the buzz word 'machine learning'. This can be good, or it can be annoying if it's constantly late or missing the mark, which I guess it will at the beginning.\n\n**iPad**\n\n* They are bringing in...... a calculator. WTF. LOL. WTF.\n* They are trying to push the \"Apple Pencil\". I guess they didn't have it before. Still. WTF.\n* Math notes was a cool feature - you write out math problems and it solves it live for you.\n* They had some pretty cool features, I am not sure if anyone will know how to use - I'm your average idiot, and it looks advanced to me. Lots of actions to work out that I'm losing money.\n* They had a big focus on Smart Scripts, which makes your handwriting better, but man, do I feel sorry for anyone that is still having to do notes by hand.\n\n**macOS**\n\n* Lol, their starting feature is that I can plan a hike on Apple Maps. Naw bro, no thanks, there are much better apps to do this in, that won't end up with me walking over a lake.\n\n**Safari**\n\n* They again mention 'machine learning', which isn't AI. This is predictive elements, standard quo of shitty AI precursor. Machine learning does not equal AI. It can if you have a big GPT model behind it, but you have to give your data to them if you aren't developing it yourself.\n\n**Gaming**\n\n* They are desperately trying to get into the gaming space. Baldur's Gate was mentioned as the highlight. This is something they are losing out on to other options. Not sure where they are, but they seem to be mentioning it a few times, so I am guessing they are trying to pull in anyone to develop on their platform. The Ubisoft collab shows this.\n* ASS-ASS-INS Creed looked choppy on the lake. Same while looking over the shoulder of the samurai. No thanks bro.\n\n**AI**\n\n* The main thing. They want it Powerful, Intuitive, Integrated, Personal and Private. They are trying to pose it as 'personal intelligence'. Apple Intelligence.\n* If you sold when they mentioned this, good job. If you held on to see the shit show. I feel sorry for you.\n* They showed a bunch of SHIT. Predictive emails? WTF. Exists by 20 providers.\n* Lol, it can make my mom a superhero through 3 styles?? YOU FUCKING SUCK!!!\n* They had 'we're building Apple apps to blah blah blah'..... \"BUILDING\", as in it's NOT READY NOW???\n* GTFO. These are all concepts apparently.\n* Sooooo, let's get this right, after talking a FUCKTON about privacy, I am going to believe APPLE that they will use my information responsibly to cater to customization. And none of this will ever leak, or be abused by any other apps you give access to this. Good luck guys!\n* \"Most of this runs on the phone, but there are times you will need more powerful servers\", yeah, here we go.....\n* This is where GPT comes in. All the info you have, and their assumptions about you, are supposed to be fed into a cloud (Private Cloud Compute) as they call it, which means they are just on ChatGPT Enterprise.\n* Apple will most likely be paying them A FUCKTON of money. They are going from charging Google billions to be their default search engine, now they will be paying GPT billions for their Enterprise computing.\n* The winner here is OpenAI. Not Apple. Apple becomes OpenAI's bitch. Siri makes 1.5 billion requests every day, do you know the ChaChing sound that is going to be coming towards OpenAI? Not all of them will go through, but man, Apple will have costs. Enterprise level costs.\n* The security breaches that will be happening. They are talking about it getting a context about you from emails, photos, messages, everything. It will be all over, trying to guess who you are, what you are about, and it's all going to a mystery cloud. Same thing that Windows just received blowback over - they are trying to convince us that it will be fine with them. Good. Luck.\n\n**Point of the story here** - they are all forward-looking things - \"things we will get\". Until then, there will be a lot of missteps, costs, and blowies behind Wendy's dumpsters.\n\n**Side notes from what I saw:**\n\n* Craig had a big center stage here. I think he is the next in line for Apple, or if he blows it, he'll end up in a Wendy's.\n* The voice editing was annoying - they minimized accents and just came out sounding like they were trying to whisper to my ear, but in a creepy way, like the hobos giving handies behind Wendy's dumpsters.", "id": "1dct4e4", "created_utc": 1718045172.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.41, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 24 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 11 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "\"Sent from my iPhone\"", "score": 168, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, but a lot of these iPhone upgrades were available on blackberries 15 years ago (encryption, scheduling messages‚Ä¶) not a good look when you have to steal ideas from  the dawn of the tech you‚Äôre pretending to be at the leading edge of.", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I have an Android and iPhone, one for the wife, one for the gf, but this post was sent from mah fridge.¬†", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Calls on Samsung Family Hub ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "you dog", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\"via Satellite\"", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "TLDR - Apple will finally offer features that Android had 5 years ago lol.

{"title": "Musk Pay Package is a lose/lose for TSLA", "selftext": "I believe the upcoming TSLA shareholder's meeting could be a lose/lose for the company.  At issue: whether shareholders believe Musk should receive his $56B pay package (originally agreed in 2018 and struck down by a Delaware judge earlier this year).  Proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against approving the package, and many institutional investors have followed their lead.  Still, a majority (56%) of those [surveyed](https://www.teslarati.com/morgan-stanley-survey-tesla-investors-will-ratify-elon-musk-2018-comp-plan/) said they expect the proposal to be approved.\n\nHowever, whichever way this vote goes, I expect a negative outcome for TSLA.  There's one of two outcomes:\n\n**A) Musk Pay Approved**\n\n* If the pay package is approved, it would bring Musk's ownership of the company close to 25% and dillute all other shareholders by 10%.\n* For many shareholders I expect this to be the last straw for them.  Those who vote against the package will see this as musk trying to extract as much value as he can from a dying company.  Especially after this year's sales slowdown (Hertz is [selling](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/06/ev-sales-slump-hertz-dump-take-used-tesla-to-no-haggle-25000-price.html) off its Tesla fleet, admitting the move was a mistake) and axing of the entire supercharger team.  Not to mention Musk's continued shitposting [alienating](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-turned-democrats-off-tesla-when-he-needed-them-most-176023af) desperately needed democrat buyers.\n\n**B) Musk Pay Denied**\n\n* If the pay package is denied, I think it would indicate the beginning of the end for Tesla.  Musk has already said that he would shift his focus to his other companies if he doesn't get his $56B.\n* He has threatened to develop AI at one of his other companies instead, and has already admitted to diverting Nvidia GPUs from Tesla to xAI and Twitter.\n* Musk has been the primary driving force behind Tesla, and without his presence and constant hype I think his diehard supporters will begin to reevaluate their ownership of Tesla stock, leading to a major selloff.\n\nMy position: I own 6 contracts of the TSLA 175p expiring 6/21.
