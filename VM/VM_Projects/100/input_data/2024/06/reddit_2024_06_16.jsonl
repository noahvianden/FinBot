Your grandma sounds like an absolute legend in the trading world. It must be fascinating to see someone of her age navigating the complexities of the options market with such confidence and knowledge. Here's a breakdown of what she's doing and some context to help you catch up:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Strangle Strategy\n\nA strangle is an options trading strategy that involves buying both a call option and a put option with different strike prices but the same expiration date. Here's what your grandma did:\n\n- \\*\\*Bought a Call at 160\\*\\*: This gives her the right to buy NVIDIA stock at $160 before the option expires.\n\n- \\*\\*Bought a Put at 140\\*\\*: This gives her the right to sell NVIDIA stock at $140 before the option expires.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy a Strangle?\n\nThe strangle strategy is typically used when a trader expects a big move in the stock price but isn't sure in which direction. By owning both a call and a put, she can profit from significant price movement either way. The \"juicy\" implied volatility she mentioned suggests she expects large price swings, which would increase the value of the options.\n\n\n\n\n\n Implied Volatility (IV)\n\nImplied volatility is a measure of the market's forecast of a likely movement in a security's price. High IV means the market expects significant price changes, which can be lucrative for options traders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's All About the Greeks\"\n\nIn options trading, \"the Greeks\" are measures of the risk involved in an options position in relation to various factors. Here are the key Greeks:\n\n- \\*\\*Delta\\*\\*: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the price of the underlying asset.\n\n- \\*\\*Gamma\\*\\*: Measures the rate of change of Delta.\n\n- \\*\\*Theta\\*\\*: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to the passage of time (time decay).\n\n- \\*\\*Vega\\*\\*: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in implied volatility.\n\n- \\*\\*Rho\\*\\*: Measures the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou mentioned holding:\n\n- \\*\\*NVIDIA 6/21 125c\\*\\*: This is a call option for NVIDIA expiring on June 21, with a strike price of $125.\n\n- \\*\\*NVIDIA 6/20/25 92c\\*\\*: This is another call option for NVIDIA expiring on June 20, 2025, with a strike price of $92.\n\n- \\*\\*Shares\\*\\*: You also own shares of NVIDIA.\n\n  \n\n\nStrategy Comparison\n\nYour positions seem more straightforward and perhaps more long-term focused. Holding a call with a lower strike price and a longer expiration date suggests a bullish outlook on NVIDIA, expecting the stock to rise significantly over the next year and a half.\n\n  \n\n\nFamily Trading Competition\n\nGiven her sophisticated approach, it's clear your grandma has a deep understanding of market dynamics. It might be beneficial to learn more about options strategies and the Greeks to better compete and possibly collaborate with her in the future.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Her voice is a constant whisper, a taunt. “You should’ve sold that straddle, dear.” My colleagues prattle on about profit margins, and I’m lost in a haze of Greeks and volatility.\n\n4:15 PM. Conference room. Another merger proposal, another distraction. My colleagues are oblivious to the turmoil within. I imagine their shock if they knew the truth – that I’m being bested by my own grandmother. She’s living rent-free in my head, her trading acumen a relentless ghost haunting my thoughts. Each time I glance at the stock ticker, I see her, sipping tea, calculating her next move.\n\n6:30 PM. Home. I stare at the charts, trying to reclaim my dignity. NVIDIA’s fluctuations are a cruel reminder of her prowess. I analyze, I strategize, but the sting remains. She’s outplayed me, and there’s no escaping it. I hear her voice, “It’s all about the Greeks,” and it gnaws at my sanity.\n\n9:00 PM. The apartment is quiet. I sit in the dark, the glow of the screen the only light. I review my positions, but it’s futile. Grandma’s victory looms over me, a testament to her unexpected dominance. I pour a glass of scotch, the burn a fleeting comfort. In the grand game of life and finance, she’s proven herself the true master.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Growth has slowed to stall speed over the last four months. It looks like a hardish landing after all.\n\nCitigroup has become the first big American bank to warn that the US has already tipped into a recession. Once this process begins, it can snowball very fast into mass business layoffs unless the Federal Reserve moves fast.\n\nThere is no sign of that. Some Fed officials are still breathing fire about inflation, judging that their survival as an independent institution depends on out-Volckering even the great inflation-slayer Paul Volcker.\n\n“The US economy is clearly slowing down, and in our base case it is headed for an outright contraction,” said Andrew Hollenhorst, Citigroup’s US chief economist.\n\nIf so, US Treasuries, German Bunds, and UK Gilts are massively mispriced. So are BBB junk bonds trading at an average wafer-thin spread of 1.09pc, matching the extreme complacency seen before the global financial crisis.\n\nMr Hollenhorst has pencilled in a contraction of 0.3pc and 2.1pc (annualised) over this quarter and next, with double-digit falls in business equipment investment. That in turn will push unemployment to 5.5pc by the end of the year in a classic recessionary dynamic.\n\n Jerome Powell\nThe Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, has been holding off on rate cuts CREDIT: REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nCitigroup says the Fed will be forced to cut interest rates in July and then at every meeting until mid-2025.\n\nAn outcome of this severity would spread to Britain almost instantly through the world’s dollarised credit system and via contagion effects, leaving the new government facing an immediate economic crisis.\n\nA Chancellor Reeves would be compelled to cut spending and tighten budget policy, in a destructive pro-cyclical fashion, unless she could summon the courage to ditch our toxic, anti-investment fiscal rules and reestablish macroeconomic sovereignty.\n\nIt would probably snuff out the fledgling recovery in the eurozone, already anaemic as fiscal austerity returns. Private credit is barely alive under the current monetary overkill of the European Central Bank, again under German control after the Mario Draghi escapade, and clearly geared at this juncture for German political needs.\n\nInvestors must navigate these treacherous waters with great care. Well-timed calibrated Fed rate cuts and a soft landing can be a tonic for stock markets. It is a different matter if the Fed is behind the curve, cutting rates only after recessionary forces have metastasised.\n\nIn normal times, the worst adage in the investment universe is ‘sell in May and don’t come back until Labour Day’.\n\nYou end up chasing equities higher after months of frustration, bleeding money with two sets of transaction costs along the way. This year it may be worth paying the insurance premium.\n\n \nAndrew Harnett from Bank of America says equity breadth on the S&P 500 is the worst since the depths of the global financial crisis in March 2009. Nvidia alone is holding up the universe.\n\nHis advice: “Buy bonds in the second half”; sell equities and credit as soon as the Fed starts to cut rates. Yes, the world is choking on the scale of bond issuance, but cyclical flight to safe havens trumps structural worries about solvency in a recession.\n\nAmerica’s economic slowdown has crept up on the world. Labour economists have been warning for months that the US jobs market is breaking down. The trouble always starts with millions of ‘marginally attached’ workers, mostly off the radar screen.\n\nRevised data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis now suggests that the labour specialists were right.\n\nThe rise in salaries and wages in the first quarter was less than half earlier estimates. The annual rate of economic growth has fallen from 4.8pc, to 3.4pc, to 1.3pc, over the last three quarters.\n\nApril was undoubtedly even weaker. The ISM manufacturing index fell further into contraction in May. Spending in restaurants has begun to buckle too.\n\nMr Hollenhorst said the hiring rate is now the weakest for a decade. Firms are still hoarding labour – on lower hours – but once confidence snaps and the lay-offs start in earnest, the process takes on a life of its own. “The history of economic cycles suggests that this will not be smooth,” he said.\n\nSimon Ward, from Janus Henderson, says there are two extra monetary effects to worry about. The US Treasury has cut reliance on short-term bills to fund the deficit, and this slows money growth.\n\nThe Treasury has also been draining liquidity by rebuilding its cash balance at the Fed. Both effects are likely to turn “significantly contractionary” with the usual lag.\n\nThe great American boom ended some time ago despite a turbo-blast from the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThe record does not look so good when you adjust for immigration. Real disposable income per capita is down 0.5pc over the last year. That may explain why so many voters are in such a bad mood.\n\n \nAmericans have depleted their excess savings from the pandemic and are now depleting their credit lines as well. The St Louis Fed says the percentage with delinquent credit card debt has hit double digits and is approaching the peak seen at the end of the dotcom bubble.\n\nDelinquency rates have risen to 17.4pc in poorer zip codes, but have also soared to 7.4pc among the richest decile.\n\nIt is sobering to think that the US economy is running out of steam even though the personal savings rate has fallen to historical lows of 3.8pc of GDP, four percentage points lower than the pre-Covid average.\n\nThis is a coiled spring in waiting. Consumers will retrench suddenly and en masse as soon as they start to worry about their jobs.\n\nIt is even more sobering that a cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit of 6.7pc of GDP at the top of the cycle is no longer gaining traction. The fiscal multiplier has collapsed. Torsten Slok from Apollo Global Management said the nominal deficit could blow through 10pc of when recession hits.\n\nAmerica’s debt accumulation over the last seven years is akin to the costs of a world war.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund says the US gross debt ratio has ballooned from 105pc to 123pc of GDP under the Trump-Biden spending blitz. It is heading for 134pc by 2029, and that assumes clear blue skies and no recession. We could be talking about 140pc plus before long.\n\nPessimists say there is little to show for it. Strategic optimists say the money has been well spent launching America’s industrial rearmament and preventing China running away with clean-tech supremacy.\n\nIt is a war-time cost.

Human psychology is fascinating because people truly never learn. \"This time it's different,\" \"the market will never go down again\", \"those old fundamentals don't matter anymore\", \"printer go brrrr.\" Every \"investor\" of the last 15 years (basically anyone under 40) has never seen a true bear market in stocks or real estate. \n\nWe just saw quantitative easing and 15 years of ZIRP, something never done before. Alan Greenspan, who was largely blamed for too much of an \"easy monetary policy\" that created both the dot com bubble of 2000 AND GFC of 2008, didn't even come near the absolutely INSANE and irresponsible levels of easy monetary conditions of the last 15 years. The economy was flooded with money and loans flowed like milk and honey. And people really thought there would be no consequences? Both asset and consumer price inflation went through the fucking roof. There's no other way to put it. We will look back on this time and wonder how the fuck this was allowed to happen. Currently things are slowly but surely reversing. \n\nWe have a legit campaign of QT that has never been seen before. They tried it in 2018 and bitched out because of how poorly the market reacted. This no longer becomes an option due to the high and stubborn inflation we have now (by the way, I don't think inflation is truly going anywhere, i.e. below 2%, until the Fed absolutely curb stomps the economy with volcker-esque rate moves. Either that or the economy and banking system completely shit the bed dealing with the higher for longer rates).\n\nAlmost every fundamental valuation metric is at all time highs (or just below the all time highs of the dot com bubble). P/E, price/sales, market cap/GDP are all at eye watering levels. Point is, fundamentals ALWAYS matter in the end. Always. It has always been the case and the market has always come back to reality, whether it was the dutch tulip bulb crisis, the crash of 29, or the dot com bubble. The recession/crash usually happens when most people become bullish again (this is currently happening in nearly every sentiment survey today). \n\nI think the big one is right around the corner. One last fun consideration: the QQQ hit a GFC low of 25.74 on March 9th 2009, just over 15 years ago. On Friday, it reached a new all time high of 479.19. Please let this sink in for the people in the back....A major index is up over 1700% in just over 15 years and averaged an annual return of greater than 21%/year during that period. Be aware, this return doesn't even include dividends. \n\nIf it instead generated a very solid 10%/year over that time, it'd be sitting at 107.52 representing a drop of 78% from today's price. Mind you, during crashes indexes tend to become overly cheap (not fair priced) as emotions and momentum tend to dictate movement on either end of extremes (too bullish or too bearish). \n\nI reiterate my stance that major indices could lose 60-70%+ before the next secular bull market. Possibly more. Jokers like NVDA that sit at over 40X price/sales will become absolutely steam rolled and lose 80-90% or more. You think the FOMO buying was crazy investor behavior, just wait until people making mad dashes for the exit. The fact that a bunch of brainless, misguided retail investors can sell in an instant with the push of a button should be very very frightening. We will learn just how crazy investor psychology is when the circuit breakers start rolling back in 🚨 🚨 🚨 \n\nThe time of the bear is nearly upon us 🐻🐻🐻 I have no doubt SPY will be back under 200 before all is said and done and i can't wait to buy in the firesale that is coming 📉📉📉", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Nvidia comes up with more powerful chips  every year (used to be every 2 years) so yea good luck catching up to that pace.\n\n I'm not saying it can't be done but I think people are severely underestimating the effort it would take to bring about such an alternative . You're not just fighting against one component but the whole ecosystem where every part has been refined over the years\n\nThe more substantial risk to Nvda is that LLMs/AI fail to bring about the supposed productivity gains or revenue growth. Companies start to get disillusioned with AI and stop buying GPUs. Now despite being an AI engineer I'm not a big fan of LLMs because I don't think they're actually the path to AGI but outside of LLMs I am still bullish that someone will come up with better architectures and with so much research activity into AI there will be more use cases outside of LLMs which then continues to sustain demand for GPUs\n\nSo yes I've said a lot of words but bottomline at least for the next year I'm hard pressed to see how NVDA's lead in this space could be threatened except if something really bad happens like Jensen gets assassinated or China bombs Taiwan and kills the TSM experts and breaks down the whole supply chain lol", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Oh yeah for sure one person can’t do it.\n\nMy point is that you can get very close even without those internal details and without crazy knowledge.

The load of porting from cuda is on Intel and amd for their chips right now.  Many major frameworks support an alternative to cuda at this point.  That will only grow over time.

There are thousands of different AI models and each have nuances, not to mention new models are coming out everyday.

Beyond that, you still need to optimise the inference speed to match what CUDA already offers. And this optimization needs to happen for each unique transformation. \n\nBuilding an AI framework that practitioners choose to adopt takes a long long time.
