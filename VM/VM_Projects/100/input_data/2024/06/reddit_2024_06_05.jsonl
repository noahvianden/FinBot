I do this on the side. I don’t care how big a company is or how great their financials are or how fast they are growing with no end in sight or how far ahead they are of competition or how diversified they are in their endeavors, it’s still an individual company at the end of the day in an ever changing world and universe. And putt a large chunk of everything you have into a single egg is just not wise. Yes there could be a large chance for great success, and I’m not saying there won’t be. But literally anything could happen. If you are accepting of this and are able to stick it out long term with the chance that you could take a big hit that may never recover, then more power to you. It’s all about risk vs reward. I’m not saying something like the S&P 500 is risk free, but the risk drops drastically long term even if you consider the overweighting of specific individual companies. Let’s say somehow a single company like Microsoft that was the top spot in the fund was blown out of the sky and ceased to exist for whatever reason. People with all their money in Microsoft are screwed and that’s never coming back. People in the S&P 500 are somewhat screwed for the moment and possibly a little while longer. But the fund holders will automatically over some time have other companies come in and take the place and rebuild the value in the fund overall that was lost with Microsoft.

Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.\n\nApple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.\n\nIn May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the company’s pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.\n\nNvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industry’s need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nCompanies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidia’s graphics processing units.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html", "id": "1d8y4gs", "created_utc": 1717614687.0, "score": 1232, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 345, "comments": [{"body": "Pretty hard to believe… what a run", "score": 403, "replies": [{"body": "Who would believe it was \\~$15B in 2016", "score": 278, "replies": [{"body": "Crazy to think theres someone out there that put in $10K and turned that into $2m", "score": 228, "replies": [{"body": "think of all the middle managers who got 50k of Nvidia stock every year for the past few years…", "score": 292, "replies": [{"body": "Makes me wonder, is there a point where all the employees are so rich they just quit lol. ", "score": 143, "replies": [{"body": "Msft had the same issue when even the secretaries were millionaires in the 80’s", "score": 176, "replies": [{"body": "[FYIFV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FYIFV)", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "wow that phrase was literally created on behalf of microsoft; little did they know what was coming with the mega tech companies", "score": 29, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Recently watched a video that went into detail about this.

If they leave, they're likely quitting to start something new or join another start up.\n* Most of these tech companies are in expensive ass areas. NVIDIA for example is in the bay area which can fetch a few million dollars for a basic house. Maybe their stock options turned into $5 mil and then they buy a nice house for $4 mil, bought a new car, etc. Seems crazy for the average person in Ohio but I can see them running through it quickly after high taxes in California,\n* Lifestyle inflation along with their personal networks. Sure you made $10 million, but that's a small fish in the big pond of silicon valley. Your coworker has $15 million. Your ex coworker at Google has $20 million. Your new neighbor in your multi million dollar neighborhood has $50 million and is your boss. Maybe you could move to Ohio and retire at 35 but if you're in that kind of situation to begin with I'm sure you're just even more motivated to keep working.\n* These people also just like their jobs. You're not working at an insurance company making phone calls all day. You're working for THEE fastest growing company and making history.

Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail.\n- **U.S. regulatory approval** - U.S. Department of Defence has [already paid ASTS $500k](https://irp.cdn-website.com/1fadf91c/files/uploaded/Q1_2024_Earnings_Press_Release_vFinal.pdf) to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time.\n- **Finilasing it's commercial agreements** - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with [AT&T](https://about.att.com/story/2024/ast-spacemobile-commercial-agreement.html) and [Verizon](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/29/ast-spacemobile-verizon-satellite-internet.html) \n\nThe AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE.

Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars??\n\nSomething these \"competitors\" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. \n\nThe Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol...\n\n-----\n>ASTS will be able to deliver data at attractive rates that disrupt current \nsatellite data services and become a viable substitute for terrestrial data services. At low enough prices, ASTS should be \nable to address a large market (unlike existing satellite services that are high-cost niche products) and spur new use cases \nthat were previously cost-prohibitive\n-[The KOOK Report](https://www.kookreport.com/post/ast-spacemobile-asts-the-mobile-satellite-cellular-network-monopoly-please-find-my-final-comp)\n\n-----\n\n#####Why aren't AST Spacemobile known?\nYou're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen [here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYm3BaIonv0&ab_channel=AT%26T). \n\nTheir initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions.\n\nYou don't need the latest iphone for this. This isn't just SoS text messaging. This is full broadband connectivity from space, no extra chips, antennas, or satellite dishes needed. Out in the woods? middle of the desert? camping in the mountains? drifting in the ocean? You're connected. Gone are the days where movies rely on their characters having no phone signal for their plot to work. This isn't just so you can browse Insta while on a cruise and avoid paying $30/day for their on-board internet. This will bring affordable access to everyone globally. Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world.\n\nThere are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario.\n\n\n-----\n\nTypical wsb responses\n\n#####\"But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS\"\n\n-_____- ...\n\n#####\"But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time\"\n\nASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. [Around 1:12:00 for the cream.](https://www.fcc.gov/march-2024-open-commission-meeting)\n\n#####\"So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up\"\n\nEven if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over.\n\n#####\"SpaceX can just buy them out\"\n\nAbel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share.\n\n#####\"But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run\"\n\nThe initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue.\n\n#####\"But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX\"\n\nThe Starlink offering was touted as [17mbps, with a 15% packet loss](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1764032892663906313?lang=en), and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet [here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago](https://x.com/spacex/status/1792981845296160791?s=46&t=vg6hLz-68IK28GznXUCu2g) - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed \"17mbps\" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area. To his credit, Elon does somewhat set expectations, but the praise expressed in the X responses makes it clear that his followers only consume the headline. [18:00 in.](https://youtu.be/Qzli-Ww26Qs?t=1080)\n\n\nNow compare it to ASTS' demo [streaming the AT&T commercial while their test satellite, Bluewalker 3, flew over a remote region of Hawaii on a rainy night.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5HBu3-I-A4&ab_channel=ASTSpaceMobile)\n\nand also compare it to ASTS and their 4 way video call using a 14mbps 4G connection over 8 months ago. 2:00 in to their video titled \"First-Ever 5G Connectivity from Space to Everyday Smartphones Achieved by AST SpaceMobile\" on the same youtube channel as the above post.I can't link it because the link contains 3 consecutive characters of a stock you're not allowed to post about...)\n\n#####\"I never see these posts till the run has happened\"\n\nCurrently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% \"long term\". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion)\n\n-----\n\n**Latest speculation:**\n\nEarlier this month, [AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/att-ast-spacemobile-tie-up-provide-space-based-broadband-network-2024-05-15/). Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, [Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240604977331/en/AST-SpaceMobile-Welcomes-Telecom-Industry-Veteran-Johan-Wibergh-to-Board-of-Directors). Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the [Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website](https://ast-science.com/company/strategic-partners/) where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? [More discussion around this speculation can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/1d742ey/strategic_partners_webpage_updated_theory/).\n\nBut you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s [recent post on WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d3m8ew/posted_this_here_5_days_ago_got_6_likes_up_116/), each of which will give the SP a nice bump \n\nI've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays...

FPGAs are configurable integrated circuits that can be programmed to perform specific computations or processing tasks. The 100mhz clock speed determines how many operations the FPGA can potentially handle each second (100mhz = 100 million cycles per second) and gives an idea of the throughput capacity.\n\nIn that same image you can see that the Block 2 Bluebird satellites will be fitted with custom ASIC chips (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) [designed by ASTS in collaboration with TSMC](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ast-spacemobile-asic-chip-enters-214600179.html). This will be a major leap in processing power and efficiency (100x that of Bluewalker 3). This upgrade would significantly enhance the satellite's ability to process and manage data in real-time, and supporting more advanced applications. \n\nAlso, Unlike FPGAs, ASICs are designed for a specific application, which allows them to be highly optimised for their intended tasks, bringing more efficiency and speed, so we could be looking at over 100x processing power of BW3.

Here are a few key points:\n\n1. **Unique Business Model**:\n   - **AST SpaceMobile**: Focuses on creating the first space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by standard mobile phones without any need for ground-based infrastructure. This approach can provide coverage in remote and underserved areas where traditional cellular networks are not feasible.\n   - **Starlink**: Concentrates on providing high-speed internet through a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites, primarily serving areas with poor internet connectivity but requiring a specialized receiver.\n\n2. **Market Potential**:\n   - **AST SpaceMobile**: Targets the global mobile market, which includes billions of mobile users. Its service could be especially crucial in developing regions with limited telecommunications infrastructure.\n   - **Starlink**: Aims at providing broadband internet services, competing with traditional internet service providers, which might limit its market to areas with poor connectivity.\n\n3. **Partnerships and Alliances**:\n   - **AST SpaceMobile**: Has established partnerships with major mobile network operators like Vodafone, Rakuten, and AT&T. These alliances could facilitate faster market penetration and adoption.\n   - **Starlink**: Operates largely independently, relying on its parent company SpaceX's capabilities.\n\n4. **Regulatory and Operational Challenges**:\n   - **AST SpaceMobile**: Faces challenges in regulatory approval for its satellite-to-phone technology and ensuring seamless integration with existing mobile networks.\n   - **Starlink**: Deals with regulatory approvals for satellite launches and ground station installations, but its model is more straightforward in terms of technology integration.\n\n5. **Investment Considerations**:\n   - **AST SpaceMobile**: May appeal to investors looking for exposure to innovative telecommunications solutions with potentially high rewards but also higher risks associated with new technology development and regulatory hurdles.\n   - **Starlink**: Backed by SpaceX, offers a more diversified risk profile due to its established space launch business, but investors might not have direct access to invest in Starlink as it is a part of SpaceX, which is privately held.\n\nBoth companies offer unique value propositions, and the choice to invest in one over the other depends on individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and belief in the long-term viability and impact of their respective technologies.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Add to that that ASTS are literally inventing all of the solutions to solve problems thought to be impossible to beat, and then encountering new problems as they go which hadn't even been thought of yet, only to invent solutions for those too - hence their insanely large portfolio of patents.\n\n> ASTS also faces risk from competition, most notably SpaceX.\n\nWhile on the subject of patents: SpaceX is the only competitor offering anything near to a comparable service. I personally wouldn't even call it competition when you look at them side by side - SpaceX is a horse and ASTS is a car - but for arguments sake let's say they both offer the same service. If you search \"SpaceX + Omnispace\" you'll see that SpaceX are having serious issues with their beamforming. They are broadcasting in to the spectrum assigned to Omnispace and interfering with their satellites. To help remedy this they then asked the FCC to allow them to lower the altitude of their satellites below that of the ISS - FCC said there's no chance of that happening. SpaceX asked Omnispace to share their spectrum. Omnispace said no and things between them have become heated. [SpaceX have now gone crying \\(yesterday\\) to the FCC](https://x.com/catse___apex___/status/1799124570802364540?s=46) asking them to change their original application to allow thousands of their signal-leaking satellites. They're doing everything *except* come up with a technical solution... because they simply can't work out a solution. A solution, by the way, that ASTS have researched, solved, and yes... patented.\n\n> Only low bandwidth, will they be able to monetize this enough?\n\nA huge chunk of market resides in lowband. So much so that there's no way ASTS would even be able to fully address it - whatever they have to sell, will be bought. Also, I can't find the source for you right now but I remember it was calculated that the satellites (Bluewalker 3) have something like 2800 beams for lowband and 20,000 beams for midband, and the ability to tune in to C-band, but I have no further details on that.\n\n> ASTS has yet to prove the specific of its business model and has a large unfunded CAPEX liability\n\n> Lack of cash / possible future dilution\n\n> The most pressing near-term risk is the Company providing visibility on its financing strategy to fund “Block 2” of its constellation.\n\nLack of cash is a real concern, and the possibility of dilution is also real, but they also have a lot of promising avenues for revenue, be it non-dilutive funds and revenues (such as the Fairwinds US Department Of Defense contract), more signed definitive agreements, or grants. The [Rural 5G $9billion grant](https://www.fcc.gov/5g-fund) has long been discussed as the golden goose for ASTS, as they are the only ones with a solid viable and cost efficient solution... if they can pull it off.\n\n> While ASTS has proven that it can connect everyday handheld cell phones to a satellite, it has yet to prove it can scale its technology across a large constellation\n\nThis is the real one for me. You asked what my bear case is, and this is it.\n\nThat and the rocket exploding on launch. Though all launches are insured and they would get their losses back, it would delay them significantly - further losing their first-to-market lead.\n\nOne thing you didn't mention, and other bear cases arguments do, is regulatory constraints. SpaceX are having an awful time with their D2D offering and the FCC, but ASTS have been coasting through so far. I mention in my post that since the Department of Defense badly wants this tech, I don't see the FCC blocking it. \n\nI think the FCC hearing directly related to ASTS that everyone has been waiting for is on the 13th of this month? you might need to fact check me on that, but I'll certainly be tuning in. It's something institutional investors have had reservations about, so when we get over that hurdle I'm sure we'll see some good price action as a result. \n\n\nTo add a point addressing the \"lack of cash\" issue, while writing this I just saw [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dan-askew-a44ba6bb_astspacemobile-activity-7204856382943023104-RrCX/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on LinkedIn by Dan Askew (UK military) talking about an upcoming event to discuss \"NATO's future SATCOM program\" alongside ASTS... more military revenue? $$$", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "ill wait till its $3 again", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "threatening cake familiar fine toy friendly deserve square sand exultant", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is the way.

The company recently announced the third version of its AI accelerator, Gaudi 3. This time Intel compared it directly to the competition, describing it as a more cost-effective alternative and better than Nvidia's H100 in terms of running inference, while faster at training models.\n\n> AMD and Intel are both participating in a big industry group called the UXL foundation, which includes Google, that's working to create free alternatives to Nvidia's CUDA for controlling hardware for AI applications.\n\n> Cloud providers including Google, Microsoft and Amazon are all building processors for internal use. The Big Tech three, plus Oracle, make up over 40% of Nvidia's revenue.\n\n> Amazon introduced its own AI-oriented chips in 2018, under the Inferentia brand name. Inferentia is now on its second version. In 2021, Amazon Web Services debuted Tranium targeted to training.\n\n> Google is perhaps the cloud provider most committed to its own silicon. The company has been using what it calls Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) since 2015 to train and deploy AI models. In May, Google announced the sixth version of its chip, Trillium, which the company said was used to develop its models, including Gemini and Imagen.\n\n> Microsoft isn't as far behind. The company said last year that it was building its own AI accelerator and processor, called Maia and Cobalt.\n\n> Meta isn't a cloud provider, but the company needs massive amounts of computing power to run its software and website and to serve ads.

This person in Mexico did not have known exposure to poultry or livestock.  This is suggestive of human-to-human transmission which would be a big deal, but not a huge deal.  The \"huge deal\" would be if there were SUSTAINED human-to-human transmission.  Nevertheless, a big deal.  This could indicate that the virus has mutated sufficiently (in an animal reservoir) to make jumps to human and from human-to-human more likely, which would mean the definitive jump into people is a matter of time.\n\n2. This guy died.  There have been plenty of human cases so far, but a lot of them have been detected incidentally or because they were sought out.  E.g. dairy workers with conjunctivitis who were picked up because the facility was undergoing screening/there were sick cattle there.  Obviously there's a lot of daylight between conjunctivitis and death.  That said, I don't know anything else about this person who died.  Pre-existing conditions, etc.\n\nAll that said, prior to covid, in the early days of coronavirus (i.e. several weeks before the shutdown) I sold all my stocks and made a couple of other defensive financial moves.  Then I watched the markets continue to reach all-time highs for weeks before the crash actually hit.  It takes a LONG time for the general public (that includes traders) to pick up on how bad things are.\n\nAs said, there is probably little appetite for a shutdown.  I would say without any hesitation that the shutdown saved millions of lives by: preventing ERs from being overwhelmed; allowing materiel to be distributed; giving time to healthcare workers to figure out what worked (e.g. steroids=good); and allowing a significant proportion of the population to avoid infection until they were vaccinated.\n\nThe other thing that the governments did was provide massive amounts of free money to prevent the economy from tanking.  We are paying for that now in inflation.\n\nSo, what's the play this time:\n\n1. I would (and I will) throw some money at moderna and pfizer.  They're solid plays even if there's no new pandemic.  If there is a pandemic both have shown they can respond with a vaccine in short order.  Another good play is grocers and gold.  Again, the Walmarts of this world are a solid play anyway, and gold has been on a tear.\n\n2.  When to sell everything?  Trigger = sustained transmission.\n\n3.  When to buy back in: This is a tough one.  I really don't think there will be a shutdown and I don't think there will be free cash from the government.  A mass vaccination campaign likely won't come in time unless this virus really sucks at spreading in humans, but that's not usually the case for flu.  So IF this really starts to take off, (which it hasn't yet), it could well be a worst-case scenario.  So your stocks are going to be the least of your worries.  But hey, if you survive the lines at Wendy's will be short.\n\nedit: (although no one is reading this fucking novel anyway because you are who you are) they say the dude was 59 and had underlying conditions and had already been bedridden for several weeks.
