The discontinuation is a sign that not every new fintech feature or product that Apple launches becomes a success or fits in with the iPhone maker’s overall strategy.\n\n“Starting later this year, users across the globe will be able to access installment loans offered through credit and debit cards, as well as lenders, when checking out with Apple Pay,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S.”\n\nApple said users who wanted installment plans at checkout would gain access to them through other financial intermediaries in more countries around the world than they would with Apple Pay Later, which was only available in the U.S.\n\nApple said its priority with Apple Pay, the brand name for its contactless and online payment software, was to enable secure and private payments. Users with open loans will continue to have access to Apple Pay Later features to manage and pay their loans, Apple said.\n\nBefore it was discontinued, Apple Pay Later enabled users to apply for loans within the iPhone Wallet app, and approved users would see a “Pay Later” option when checking out online.\n\nThe process notably involved Apple taking over more of the financial backend than some of its other products, like Apple Card. For the program, Apple made some of its own credit credit checks and loan decisions, instead of having those handled entirely through financial partners. Apple’s loans were issued by a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/apple-stops-offering-buy-now-pay-later-loans-in-us-.html", "id": "1dih5sa", "created_utc": 1718681738.0, "score": 630, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "They weren’t about to become the bad guy and start collecting debt.

{"title": "Nvidia passes Microsoft in market cap to become most valuable public company ", "selftext": "Nvidia, long known in the niche gaming community for its graphics chips, is now the most valuable public company in the world.\n\nShares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% in mid-day trading on Tuesday, lifting the company’s market cap to $3.33 trillion, surpassing Microsoft. Earlier this month, Nvidia hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, and passed Apple.\n\nNvidia shares are up more than 170% so far this year, and took a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. The stock has multiplied by more than nine-fold since the end of 2022, a rise that’s coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business that’s ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidia’s data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the company’s total sales.\n\nFounded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It’s also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.\n\nBut over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the company’s technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth to more than $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startup’s AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.\n\nNvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.\n\nNvidia’s ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark of 30 stocks that’s historically included the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on Jan. 7.\n\nThe split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices — rather than market caps — have outsized influence on the benchmark.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/nvidia-passes-microsoft-in-market-cap-is-most-valuable-public-company.html", "id": "1divtu5", "created_utc": 1718730478.0, "score": 2034, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 512, "comments": [{"body": "The first trillion is always the hardest.

Besides that, it works similar to a traditional broker account where you can invest in stocks/ETFS/Funds/etc. \n\nNow the big question, what the heck do you buy?\n\nThe \"safe\" (nothing is 100% safe), route is to put most of your money into ETFs such as VOO or similar.\n\n\"Geeky, that's too many words\"\n\nIf anything is confusing there, then I highly recommend searching for a local Financial or Investment Planner.

There are over a million active physicians in the US. The fact that you are seeking out the 1% of doctors who disagree with the consensus suggests that you had already made up your mind and were seeking confirmation, rather than information.\n\n**Dr. Tenpenny:**  She claimed that the Covid vaccine makes people **magnetic** and that vaccinated people's bodies would \"react\" when in proximity to 5G cell towers.\n\n**Dr. Zelenko:**  pushed hydroxychloroquine as a Covid treatment, hydroxychloroquine was shown to damage vision at higher doses\n\n**Dr. Charles Hoffe:** pushed veterinary ivermectin, and claimed that the vaccine was more dangerous than Covid. When it was pointed out that vaccinated seniors had a far lower death rate than unvaccinated, he claimed (without evidence) that vaccine deaths weren't being reported.\n\n**Dr Cole:** prescribed ivermectin without actually seeing most patients and recommended patients take ivermectin as a preventative measure.

Direct quote. After a while the damage was piling up and became impossible to deny. The budgets were falling short by hundreds of millions of dollars, job growth was worse than every neighboring state. Shocking, lowering taxes did not in fact raise taxes. *Again*. Because this isn't the first time they've \"tested\" the theory.\n\nThey know it won't work. It's not about it working, it's about their donors who want to pay less tax.\n\nSo to keep the grift going as long as possible Brownback starts lying about the lies he told originally, claiming that he \"always\" said it was going to take a long time for this to pay off. They just had to stay the course and not fix the massive, *massive* fuckup that was his tax cut, and keep delivering that value for his donors.\n\nSo they do that for a good long while, and shit just gets worse. And worse. And worse. It gets to the point where the state GOP is begging him to back down from his ruinously stupid policies. And he just won't do it. So the state GOP passes a billion dollar tax increase. The Gee Oh Pee increased taxes. In Kansas. That's how much of a problem this was. And Brownback fucking vetoes it because he has actual shit for brains and/or is fully in the pocket of the billionaires who made so, so, *sooooooo* much money from this. Luckily the legislature isn't nearly as committed to the grift as Brownback was and overrode the veto, but it wasn't enough. Public education funding dropped so low that the state supreme court ruled that it violated the state constitution. Here, I'll quote from the ruling.\n\n>We conclude the state’s public financing system, through its structure and implementation, is not reasonably calculated to have all Kansas public education students meet or exceed the minimum constitutional standards of adequacy.\n\n\"That doesn't count, it was a political ruling!\" I can hear some right wing culture warrior screeching, as they always do when the courts rule against them.\n\nYeah, no. It was a unanimous ruling. By the *Kansas* supreme court. It's not a liberal state, you don't get to use that escape hatch this time. I mean, it's dumb as fuck every other time you do it too, but this time it's even dumber than that.\n\nAnd the people of Kansas agree, Brownback was the biggest dipshit of all time.
