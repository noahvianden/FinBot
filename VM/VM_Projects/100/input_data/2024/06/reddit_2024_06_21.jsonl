Generally I tell people never put money into market or stocks that you may need any time in the next 5 years.  Markets dip all the time.  And typical drawdown lasts 2-5 years.

It's not so simple as \"buy this and market go up.\"\n\nYou could buy Inflation Bonds and there would be no way, literally no way whatsoever for you to touch that money for 1 year, and it would guaranteed get you something, according to CPI inflation, and protected against deflation.

If Apple (AAPL) finishes ahead of NVIDIA (NVDA) in terms of market performance, several outcomes could occur during the rebalancing process:\n\n1. **Weight Adjustment**: If Apple's market capitalization increases significantly compared to NVIDIA, the ETF that includes both stocks might increase the weight of Apple and decrease the weight of NVIDIA to maintain a balanced representation of the market or sector.\n\n2. **Portfolio Alignment**: ETFs that aim to mirror the performance of a specific index will adjust their holdings to match the changes in the index composition and weights. If Apple's performance leads to a higher index weight, the ETF will buy more shares of Apple.\n\n3. **Risk Management**: The rebalancing process also involves managing risk. If Apple's stock becomes a larger portion of the ETF due to its outperformance, the fund manager might rebalance to avoid overexposure to a single stock, thereby maintaining diversification.\n\n4. **Cost Implications**: Rebalancing can involve transaction costs. If significant changes are made to the ETF‚Äôs composition due to shifts in stock performance, it could lead to higher transaction costs, which might impact the ETF‚Äôs overall performance.\n\n5. **Impact on Other Holdings**: Changes in the weights of major companies like Apple and NVIDIA can also affect the weights and possibly the inclusion of smaller companies within the ETF.\n\nThe specific impact of Apple finishing ahead of NVIDIA would depend on the rules set by the ETF regarding rebalancing frequency, methodology, and the specific index or strategy it", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Was this comment powered by ChatGPT?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "What‚Äôs ChatGPT?

{"title": "Netflix Launches Its Own Line of Popcorn for $4.50 a Bag", "selftext": "Netflix will now sell you a ready-to-eat bag of popcorn to go with your ready-to-binge TV show.\n\nThe streamer is teaming with popcorn company Popcorn Indiana for the new line of Netflix‚Äôs Now Popping snacks. The two flavors are ‚ÄúCult Classic Cheddar Kettle‚Äù and ‚ÄúSwoonworthy Cinnamon Kettle.‚Äù The Netflix-branded popcorn will be available at Walmart stores nationwide and at other retailers; Popcorn Indiana has a locator search for where to buy it at this link.\n\nAn 8-ounce bag of Netflix Now Popping costs $4.49, according to grocery chain Shoprite. That means if you buy one bag of each flavor, you‚Äôll already have paid more than the monthly cost of the Netflix Basic plan with ads ($6.99/month in the U.S.).\n\nNetflix likely doesn‚Äôt expect to suddenly start making a bucketful of money by selling snacks ‚Äî rather, the more important part of this is getting its brand in front of shoppers at thousands of retail outlets. Note that AMC Theatres also has its own line of popcorn, launched in 2021 as a bid to extend its branding and perhaps make some extra revenue after movie theaters suffered a dramatic drop-off during the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix‚Äôs Now Popping isn‚Äôt the first food-related brand extension for the company. In 2020, it inked a deal with Ben & Jerry‚Äôs, which introduced Netflix & Chilll‚Äôd flavor (peanut butter ice cream with sweet-and-salty pretzel swirls and fudge brownies). That‚Äôs still available on store shelves.\n\nA ‚Äúmovie night and popcorn go together like a hot dog and a bun, ice cream and sprinkles, or a beach day and a lounge chair,‚Äù the streamer said in announcing the popcorn line. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why Netflix and Popcorn Indiana have teamed up to debut Now Popping, a new ready-to-eat popcorn line available to snack on now.‚Äù\n\nAmong other moves it has made to instantiate the Netflix brand IRL, the company ‚Äî famously averse to long theatrical release windows ‚Äî now runs three movie theaters: New York‚Äôs Paris Theater, the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood and the Bay Theater in Pacific Palisades, Calif. And in 2025, it plans to launch entertainment, restaurant and retail complexes (dubbed ‚ÄúNetflix House‚Äù) in Dallas and King of Prussia, Pa., occupying more than than 100,000 square feet each at abandoned department store locations.\n\nPopcorn Indiana was started by ‚Äúa team of folks out of the Northeast‚Äù and named after the small town of Popcorn, Ind., according to its website. In 2017, Cleveland-based Eagle Foods acquired Popcorn Indiana and the product is now produced at a single facility located in Waukegan, Ill.\n\nNetflix announced the new popcorn line as part of touting its summer lineup of TV shows, movies and games. Those include the third and final season of ‚ÄúVikings: Valhalla‚Äù and new seasons of ‚ÄúToo Hot to Handle‚Äù and ‚ÄúBarbecue Showdown‚Äù; rom-com ‚ÄúA Family Affair‚Äù starring Nicole Kidman, Joey King and Zac Efron; and ‚ÄúBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F‚Äù starring Eddie Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\n\nSource: https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/netflix-popcorn-walmart-1236043686/", "id": "1dkri9l", "created_utc": 1718931418.0, "score": 477, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "They should have included a weekend trial of Netflix.", "score": 265, "replies": [{"body": "\"Credit card required to activate free trial\"", "score": 88, "replies": []}, {"body": "This would be a great idea.", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "Didn‚Äôt the video rental stores used to have some snack package or something?

{"title": "Why is there no sober analysis on NVIDIA and AI?", "selftext": "I've been following the AI craze for months now, and the discourse generally falls into two extremes. On one side, there's the unbridled optimism predicting that the AI market will reach an $8 trillion valuation within the next two to three years. There is a whole sub where some enthusiasts are even urging everyone to go all in on NVIDIA, extrapolating its past performance to predict future gains. On the other side, there's the intense pessimism, with warnings of a bubble that could burst at any moment, driven more by paranoia than by solid data.\n\nI've been hearing these warnings since NVIDIA was at $640 (or $64 post-split), yet the stock has only continued to grow. I invested $200,000 and saw a 90% gain. Currently, I don't have significant stakes in NVIDIA directly, except through ETFs. While I believe NVIDIA might be overvalued based on current numbers, I think its future potential is appropriately priced in.\n\nNVIDIA and other AI stocks are likely to experience accelerated growth over the next few years, though perhaps not at the same rapid pace we've seen recently. The most extreme optimistic and pessimistic predictions about AI may not materialize, but AI is undoubtedly the current big thing. Right now, AI's growth is highly concentrated in big tech, but it will gradually decentralize and spread to small businesses and everyday applications.\n\nOf course, there will be corrections along the way, and some of these may be significant. The potential for growth remains substantial, but like any market, AI is subject to risks such as major world events, pandemics, or wars. However, these risks are inherent in the stock market, whether AI is involved or not.\n\n", "id": "1dkxm1k", "created_utc": 1718952318.0, "score": 207, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 227, "comments": [{"body": "We're not sober yet, please wait", "score": 298, "replies": [{"body": "This is the right answer.

Some of them are pure gamblers. They don't invest really on a rational take of the company value but more on the idea that they think the value will continue to grow.\n\nNow the problem is that when a market get much bigger you have competition. Most of the network gear didn't end up being Cisco. Competitor took the main share. And also there always a big rush when you need to build up the infrastructure. Once it is there, you only need to replace stuff and the investments are much lower.\n\nFinally there the question of who made the most money out of it ? Who made money from the internet ? Was it really Cisco or AOL ? Or was it Google, Facebook, Apple ?\n\nYou could not invest on Google until 2004. Facebook didn't exist. Apple was a niche company at the time that could had been almost bankrupt.\n\nIf we go back to Nvidia, Nvidia chips are a cost center. Like the networking gear of Cisco. There no interest to buy any except if you hope to make money using them.\n\nThe big players, Meta, Google, Apple, Microsoft are fighting to make AI free for the general public and include in their offering. The bet is not that most people of the general public will pay an extra 10-20$ a month for their chatbot. Companies like Meta, Microsoft with Bind and Google with Google search and Android. They will offer it for free and finance with advertisement.\n\nStill an AI query cost about 15X more than a google search query. A big part of it is the cost of Nvidia chips + the datacenter electricity consumption, A/C. That's a cost center.\n\nFor sure at least MS and OpenAI invest to get this kind of monthly plan, but from corporation. But people will not select their AI plan for the company with the most Nvidia chips, but for the company with the best AI or the one that is the most useful. \n\nAnd chances are the general public AI will be as good and free. Big corporations will pay the big money to protect their Intellectual property. Not to have necessarily a much better product.\n\nThe biggest cost still will be the general public that will have it for free. And to be sustainable, all the big players will want the cost to be as small as possible. That's why Meta has its own model that is being open source (so anybody can use it) and that's why for the same performance it tend to consume far less than openAI models.\n\nThat's why Apple invest to put more advanced AI chips in all its computers and smartphones so that the consumer pay the AI chips... And they are not made by Nvidia. That's also why Apple again also invest in its own data center with Apple home made chips and not using Nvidia because now they can only pay the cost to build the chip and not pay 10X more to finance Nvidia. And because they had been doing such chips in their iphones for the past 15 years, they should be decent at it.\n\nAnd Microsoft is doing the same pushing that new computers will have their own AI chips. Intel will provide CPU with AI chips. Samsung is doing it and all other smartphones players. None of that use Nvidia chips.\n\nEven OpenAI funder created a startup for optimized AI chips. And everybody with a stake in the chip business want a share of the business. They will all try it.\n\nIn computer science, one of the most active research topic is to make AI model smaller, lighter and if possible run on commodity hardware like a laptop. I tried it, I could run some more models on my PC... One of the current optimization being that each parameter would be stored in 4 bits instead of FP16 or FP32. Nvidia chips are great at FP16 and FP32 but are not designed for 4 bits.\n\nThe whole world of the tech is betting against Nvidia.\n\nAnd now we see that basically Europe want to prevent full AI integration in Apple phones. This kind of legal issue will reduce the demand and slow down the adoption. \n\nChina is yet another beast. Legally the USA has forbidden China to buy Nvidia chips. So China government invest massively in making their own chips. They consider it a priority for their homeland security and the sovereignty of their country. They wont even care if it is profitable.\n\nMaybe Nvidia will have the same problem Cisco had.

I think what really sunk that one was just the lack of real earnings which oddly enough might correlate with this one because right now the real earnings are coming from building up which were also the thing driving the '90s early on. Laying all that fiber, building fabs, all that stuff was fine. By 1999 or 2000 you had all these startups and all these ideas and the profitability was, well there wasn't much. So the whole question with AI is going to be how profitable is it when everything is up to scale because in the beginning, it might not be. A lot of new inventions take a while to really figure out how to maximize the profit models \n\nSo what's all that mean from an investing standpoint? Not a lot really, it's just something to keep in the back of your head and remind you to manage your risk appropriately. If you have an account that is full of nothing but arm and Nvidia and ASML.

There is not a new thing here that is going to change everything.\n\nLet's say, optimistically, that AI can tackle and solve hard problems, like designing a better chip for AI to run on.    Is Nvidia using that AI? They are chip designers, not AI designers.    Is their AI better then their competitors?     Nvidia doesn't have much for physical capital.   It's all in it's intellectual property, the design of it's chips.      \n\nThe whole hubbub about AI is it is going to increase the amount of intellectual property, which could potentially make Nvidia's little sliver of it, their chip design, worth that much less.

End of story, forever.   You bought it for 200k and it's now worth 400k, later 1.2M -- doesn't matter -- you pay tax on the original 200k.  That never changes.\n\nBut in Colorado, that tax increases w/ your current valuation with no cap.  So  let's say you buy a house in 2004 for 400k and it's now work 1.5M.  Guess what?  You pay tax on the current valuation -- 1.5M --  or **11k/yr.**\n\nWHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?  People complain about taxes in California?  Now I get why some of you wealthy fuckers are so stingy.

The original 2 games were made by now defunct studio Cing, and their bankruptcy prevented the 2009 Wii game from ever being released in North America. This remake heavily reworks the original games, which were largely played from a 2D perspective using the DS stylus or Wii motion controls. It also adds fully voiced cutscenes and dialogue in addition to altering the original story to make it flow better as a single combined game.\n\nI'm old enough that for me this game was a nostalgic trip back to the 1990's era of point and click adventure games. IYKYK. Despite being a remake which gives the game fully 3D explorable environments, the gameplay is very much old school adventure where you look for objects to pick up and combine to solve puzzles. The puzzles are very light and not meant to be difficult, this isn't Anime Myst. The adventure focuses around a cohesive story told in 2 parts, because it was combined from what was previously 2 games. The main story arc feels a lot like Assassin's Creed without assassins or Templars but the shift to 3D environments with a third person perspective makes me think I'm playing Resident Evil without zombies. If you play it, you'll see what I mean.\n\nIn total, it will take about 15-20 hours to clear the remade game. Both parts of Recollection are necessary to see the entire story, 2 pretty fucking wild days in the life of Ashley Mizuki Robins. Like I said before, I don't think this one will appeal to a lot of people. The original 2 games didn't sell very well, which is why the original developer no longer exists. I don't even know why Nintendo would greenlight this and even fund a full remake. But I'm very grateful to Nintendo all the same, because gaming should be more than just Western AAA Woke Cinematic Experience 9 Remastered. Unusual, experimental, offbeat games like this should still exist, and while it's sad the originals didn't find much of an audience back in 2005 and 2009, I hope someone else also experiences and enjoys this sort of thing in 2024.\n\nCing was also responsible for the equally obscure but also celebrated DS cult classics Hotel Dusk: Room 215 and Last Window: The Secret of Cape West, the latter of which was also never released in North America.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN\n ‚Äî \nBoeing‚Äôs Starliner spacecraft was set to mark its crowning achievement this month: Ferrying two NASA astronauts on a round trip to the International Space Station, proving the long-delayed and over-budget capsule is up for the task.\n\nStarliner is halfway to that goal.\n\nBut the two veteran astronauts piloting this test flight are now in a tentative position ‚Äî extending their stay aboard the space station for a second time while engineers on the ground scramble to learn more about issues that plagued the first leg of their journey.\n\nSpaceflight veterans Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore arrived at the space station aboard the Starliner on June 6. NASA initially projected their stay would last about a week.\n\nBut troubles the vehicle experienced en route, including helium leaks and thrusters that abruptly stopped working, have raised questions about how the back half of the mission will play out.\n\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will now return no earlier than June 26, NASA announced Tuesday, stretching their mission to at least 20 days as engineers race to gain a better understanding of the spacecraft‚Äôs problems while it‚Äôs safely attached to the space station.\n\n\nOfficials have said there is no reason to believe Starliner won‚Äôt be able to bring the astronauts back home, though ‚Äúwe really want to work through the remainder of the data,‚Äù said Steve Stich, NASA‚Äôs Commercial Crew Program manager, at a Tuesday news conference.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner spacecraft docks to the International Space Station on June 6, 2024. \nRELATED ARTICLE\nAstronauts‚Äô return delayed again as Boeing and NASA try to learn more about spacecraft issues\nMeanwhile, Boeing has sought to frame the mission as a success and learning opportunity, albeit one that has left the Starliner team grappling with the ‚Äúunplanned‚Äù side of the mission, as Mark Nappi, Boeing‚Äôs vice president and program manager of the Starliner program, put it Tuesday.\n\nIt‚Äôs not uncommon for astronauts to unexpectedly extend their stay aboard the space station ‚Äî for days, weeks or even months. (NASA has also said the Starliner can spend up to 45 days at the orbiting laboratory if needed, according to Stich.)\n\nBut the situation makes for a moment of uncertainty and embarrassment that joins a long list of similar blunders by the Boeing Starliner program, which is already years behind schedule. It also adds to a chorus of unfavorable news that has followed Boeing as a company for some time.\n\nA nail-biting finale\nBoeing and NASA engineers said they are opting to leave Starliner ‚Äî and with it, Williams and Wilmore ‚Äî aboard the station longer than expected primarily to carry out additional analysis. The helium leaks and thruster issues occurred on a part of the vehicle that is not intended to survive the trip home from space, so mission teams are delaying the spacecraft‚Äôs return as part of a last-ditch effort to learn everything they can about what went wrong.\n\nDanger looms any time a spacecraft returns home from orbit. It is perhaps the most perilous stretch of any mission to space.\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft on NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test is pictured docked to the Harmony module's forward port on June 13 as the International Space Station orbited 262 miles above Egypt's Mediterranean coast.\nThe Starliner spacecraft on NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test is pictured docked to the Harmony module's forward port on June 13 as the International Space Station orbited 262 miles above Egypt's Mediterranean coast. NASA\nThe trip will require the Starliner to hit Earth‚Äôs thick atmosphere while traveling more than 22 times the speed of sound. The process will bake the spacecraft‚Äôs exterior at roughly 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\nWhat do you think?\nJoin 121 others in the comments\nView Comments\nThen, a set of parachutes ‚Äî which Boeing redesigned and tested as recently as January ‚Äî must safely slow the capsule down before it reaches terra firma. (Starliner will be the first US-made capsule to parachute to a landing on the ground rather than splash down in the ocean. Boeing hopes that approach will make it easier to recover and refurbish the Starliner after flight.)\n\nA series of setbacks\nStarliner‚Äôs journey to this historic crewed test mission began in 2014 when NASA tapped both Boeing and SpaceX to develop a spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nAt the time, Boeing was seen as the stalwart aerospace giant that would likely get the job done first while SpaceX was the unpredictable newcomer.\n\nOver the past decade, however, tides have shifted.\n\n\nSpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon spacecraft safely completed its first crewed mission ‚Äî which appeared to go off without a hitch ‚Äî in 2020. And the vehicle has been regularly flying astronauts and paying customers since.\n\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft launched NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley to the International Space Station, marking the spacecraft's inaugural crewed flight, on May 30, 2020.\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft launched NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley to the International Space Station, marking the spacecraft's inaugural crewed flight, on May 30, 2020. Joel Kowsky/NASA\nThe two astronauts that piloted Crew Dragon‚Äôs inaugural flight ‚Äî Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley ‚Äî also stayed aboard the space station longer than expected, notching more than 60 days rather than the brief stint expected on such test flights.\n\nBut Hurley and Behnken‚Äôs stay was extended so that the astronauts could lend a hand with daily activities aboard the space station, which at the time was understaffed. The extension did not directly relate to specific software or hardware problems with SpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon.\n\nSpacecraft issues, on the other hand, have marred Boeing‚Äôs Starliner program practically every step of the way. The vehicle has faced years of delays, setbacks and added expenses that have cost the company more than $1 billion, according to public financial records.\n\nThe first Starliner test mission, flown without crew in late 2019, was riddled with missteps. The vehicle misfired in orbit, a symptom of software problems that included a coding error that set an internal clock off by 11 hours.\n\nVanguard¬Æ\nIs an IRA right for you?\nBy Vanguard¬Æ\nLearn More\n\nA second uncrewed flight test in 2022 uncovered additional software issues and trouble with some of the vehicle‚Äôs thrusters.\n\nStich, the NASA program manager, indicated during a June 6 news conference that it‚Äôs possible engineers may not have completely resolved those issues from 2022.\n\n‚ÄúWe thought we had fixed that problem,‚Äù Stich said, adding, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre missing something fundamental that‚Äôs going on inside the thruster.‚Äù\n\nMichael Lembeck, an aerospace engineering associate professor of practice at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who was a consultant for Boeing‚Äôs spaceflight division from 2009 to 2014, told CNN that it would be difficult to determine whether additional ground tests may have caught the thruster issues at hand.\n\nBut Lembeck emphasized that evaluating the success of this test mission is not as simple as comparing it directly with the inaugural crewed test flight of SpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon.\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule, atop an Atlas V rocket, lifts off from launch pad at Space Launch Complex 41 Wednesday, June 5, 2024, in Cape Canaveral, Fla.

Boeing‚Äôs kind of having to build a crew vehicle all up from scratch.‚Äù\n\nShould this Starliner test mission encounter additional setbacks, however, it could put Boeing in a situation where it must rely on its rival to get Williams and Wilmore home.\n\n‚ÄúThe embarrassing backup is that a Crew Dragon would have to go and retrieve the astronauts,‚Äù Lembeck said. The spacecraft ‚Äúcould be sent up with two crew members and sent back with four ‚Äî and that would probably be the way home.‚Äù\n\nBoeing‚Äôs broader problems\nBoeing executives have repeatedly sought to make clear that the Starliner program operates independently from the company‚Äôs other units ‚Äî including the commercial aircraft division that has been at the center of scandals for years.\n\n‚ÄúWe have humans flying on this vehicle. We always take that so seriously,‚Äù Nappi said during a news briefing in April before Starliner took flight.\n\nNappi at the time also declared that the Starliner team was operating at ‚Äúpeak performance‚Äù and ‚Äúreally looking forward to executing‚Äù a safe mission.\n\nFamily members of the crash victims of the Boeing 737 MAX8 in Ethiopia, hold photographs during a news conference on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, June 18, 2024, in Washington.\nRELATED ARTICLE\nBoeing committed ‚Äòthe deadliest corporate crime in US history‚Äô and should be fined $24 billion, victims‚Äô families say\nWhen asked about that assertion on Tuesday, Stich, the NASA executive, said that officials at Boeing and NASA had always expected to find additional issues that needed to be hashed out during this test flight.\n\n\nWilliams had alluded to that expectation during a pre-flight news conference, saying, ‚ÄúWe always find stuff, and we are going to continually find stuff.\n\n‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs not going to be absolutely perfect as we fly the spacecraft. ‚Ä¶We feel very safe and comfortable with how this spacecraft flies, and we have backup procedures in case we need those,‚Äù Williams said.\n\nStich, however, acknowledged on Tuesday that Boeing and NASA might have been able to prevent some of the hangups the Starliner has encountered: ‚ÄúPerhaps we could have done different testing on the ground to characterize some of (the thruster issues) ahead of time,‚Äù he s", "id": "1dkucl6", "created_utc": 1718940438.0, "score": 657, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 6 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 34 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 8 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Those astronauts were potential whistle blowers.", "score": 665, "replies": [{"body": "*In space, nobody can hear you whistle*", "score": 282, "replies": [{"body": "It's very easy to fall out of a window in space... it can happen to *anyone*, comrade.", "score": 22, "replies": []}, {"body": "Such an amazing comment", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Holy fuck I just sharted myself‚Ä¶‚Ä¶", "score": 52, "replies": []}, {"body": "Puts on astronauts", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "In space nobody can hear you scream", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Or shart", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "And scream, and shart, and let it out\n\nWe say ohhhhh ehhh ohhhh\n\nYou are now now rockin with Will.i.am an britney bitch", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "If BA wasn't a US company it would be bankrupt by now.", "score": 471, "replies": [{"body": "If BA wasn‚Äôt morally bankrupt, it would be a legitimate company by now.", "score": 188, "replies": []}, {"body": "USA Military Industrial  Complex company.

{"title": "NVDA's Big Drop in Prices: The True Reason Behind the AI Chip Revolution", "selftext": "Recently, Anthropic, a small startup with funding 5-6 times smaller than OpenAI, launched their latest model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with performance surpassing OpenAI's flagship GPT-4. Google also quickly released Gemini-1.5-Pro, which swiftly outperformed GPT-4-Turbo. Sounds interesting, but how is this related to NVIDIA? Simply put, both Google and Anthropic use Google's TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) chips to train both of these models. Shortly after OpenAI announced the \"divine\" GPT-4, Anthropic only began to release their first model, Claude-1, which was like a joke compared to the modern GPT-4. Google was even slower in launching Google Bard, later renamed Gemini 1.0, which became a meme, and everyone thought OpenAI would be unbeatable. OpenAI relied on expensive and power-hungry NVIDIA chips, spending $100 million and several years of training to launch an expensive GPT-4 model that most regular free users couldn't access. In less than a year, Anthropic and Google easily surpassed them, launching models superior to GPT-4 at a cost 10 times cheaper, with training costs also 10 times lower and only taking a few months.\n\nThe situation with general-purpose GPU chips for AI training is similar to using them for Bitcoin mining in 2014 - expensive, energy-consuming, and wastefully space-occupying, until Bitcoin difficulty increased to the point where NVIDIA GPUs became useless and ASIC Bitcoin miners emerged to replace them. Therefore, thinking that NVIDIA will monopolize the AI chip market is just the thinking of Wall Street traders who only know companies through Bloomberg articles and have no expertise in the field.\n\nThanks to NVIDIA's expensive and inefficient GPUs, a basic user paying $20/month can still only access GPT-4 in a limited and expensive way, while Google is providing FREE API access to their FLAGSHIP MODEL, Gemini-1.5-Pro. Remember that Claude 3.5 Sonnet isn't even the flagship model, but just an inexpensive mid-tier model. Claude 3.5 Opus will be released and it will surpass GPT-4.5 or even GPT-5 thanks to NOT USING NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pj8ia6qd5v7d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcd49cc4ebd859cada3333eb678956372cc8484e\n\n", "id": "1dkwqna", "created_utc": 1718948890.0, "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 167, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, Nvidia is gonna go down the shitter.

In most cases, the magic of pricing may bail us out.\n\nAffordable oil is expected to run out in around 50 years, but that assumes that consumption stays at current levels. We may see peak oil consumption within 5-10 years.\n\nWater is probably the biggest concern, but water shortages tend to be impacting poorer economies much more than the rich world. Part of the reason wealthy countries are in their current position is because they had access to adequate supplies of fresh water. Long term, desalination will become much cheaper due to better technology and cheaper energy (renewables, fusion, etc.).\n\nThere is still a lot of low-hanging fruit when it comes to water conservation. If we charged farmers a significant fraction of the cost of water paid by homeowners in cities, it would instantly end wasteful practices like growing almonds in California or any crops at all in Arizona. You would see an explosion in vertical farming, drip irrigation, shade-grown crops, drought tolerant GMOs, etc. Prices can work wonders if they are not artificially suppressed (or inflated) due to lobbying and corruption by special interests.\n\nHelium will probably become extremely expensive in future years, but if we stop wasting it, we may have enough to tide us over until we figure out how to produce more (fusion?), but it will likely never be as cheap and plentiful as it is currently.\n\nMost other scarce resources can be swapped with alternative materials or conserved as higher prices and better efficiency cause them to be used only where absolutely necessary.\n\nKeep in mind that today's refrigerators use around 35% of the electricity required by models produced in 2000.

Your technical analysis should be exactly the same as if your buying the shares.  For Nvidia it's actually easier than most because of how predictable the price action is.  This has been going on for a while.  The support level is pretty obvious and taking profits is pretty predictable as well.  Once you find those levels for the day,  you buy your calls at support amd take profits at resistance.  Options will give you better returns then stocks.  The reason you want a reachable strike price is because if the price goes belly up for the day, kinda like what we saw Friday from 141, you want your price to be reachable by the expiration or your options become worthless real quick, hence that 150 call is extremely low probability now.
