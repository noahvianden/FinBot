Hyman Minsky, a monetary theorist, offers a plausible explanation for this phenomenon, suggesting two necessary preconditions: a \"displacement\" often brought about by revolutionary technology or significant shifts in financial methods, and the availability of easy credit for speculative borrowing. Bernstein adds two more ingredients: the necessity for investors to have forgotten the last speculative bubble, which is why such bubbles tend to occur roughly once per generation, and the replacement of rational investors, who calculate expected payoffs and risk premiums, with those driven solely by a compelling narrative (Bernstein, 2002).\n\nBernstein, W. J. (2002). \\*The Four Pillars of Investing: Lessons for Building a Winning Portfolio\\*. McGraw-Hill.\n\nI am not sure if NVDA is in a bubble, but it is clear that the ingredients mentioned above are indeed present, potentially leading to similar consequences.\n\nAlso, consider this:\n\nIn \"The Most Important Thing,\" Howard Marks discusses the dangers of buying or holding assets on the belief that their prices, although already high, will rise further. He argues that this mindset is risky and a key driver of market bubbles. In such scenarios, infatuation with market momentum overrides considerations of value and fair pricing. Greed and the discomfort of watching others make seemingly easy money diminish any prudence that might otherwise prevail. Marks concludes that a solid value-based investment approach is the most reliable, whereas depending on others to drive profit through a bubble is the least dependable (Marks, 2011).\n\nMarks, H.

Here is an LLM response to help me outline that for you:\n\n>**Impact of Training Data on Large Language Models (LLMs):**\n\n>**Quality of Data:** The performance of LLMs heavily depends on the quality of the training data. Data that is noisy, irrelevant, or biased can detrimentally affect model performance. High-quality, diverse data is essential for robust model training (Bender et al., 2021).\n\n>**Diminishing Returns:** Although increasing the amount of training data typically improves model performance, the rate of improvement tends to decrease as the data volume grows. This phenomenon of diminishing returns is well-documented in machine learning literature (Halevy et al., 2009).\n\n>**Model Capacity:** The capacity of the model, such as the number of parameters, influences its ability to leverage large datasets. However, there is a threshold beyond which even large models do not significantly benefit from additional data without modifications to the architecture or training methodology (Kaplan et al., 2020).\n\n>**Computational Costs:** The computational cost of training LLMs on larger datasets increases, often requiring substantial resources. The cost-effectiveness decreases as the incremental performance gains from additional data diminish (Strubell et al., 2019).\n\n>**Generalization vs. Specialization:** While more data can enhance the generalization capability of LLMs across diverse tasks and domains, excessive generalization may reduce performance on specialized tasks unless the model is fine-tuned specifically for those tasks (Raffel et al., 2020).\n\n>**References:**\n\n>Bender, E.

In the 90s governments, private corps, public corps, home users, everyone was buying CPUs to light the internet up. But that could only go so far, it's not like there is a bottomless pit of demand.\n\nThe question here is how much AI/LLM does the world need?

During the late 1990s, there was excessive speculation in the stock prices of technology companies, driven by the rise of the internet and related technologies. When the bubble burst, it led to a broad reevaluation of technology stocks, causing significant declines in stock prices.\n* **Oversupply of Semiconductors**: As anticipation of continued growth drove overinvestment, there was an oversupply of semiconductors by the time the market demand cooled off. This oversupply led to falling prices for chips, which directly impacted Intel‚Äôs revenue.\n* **Economic Recession**: The early 2000s also saw a general economic slowdown, exacerbated by the September 11 attacks in 2001, which further reduced demand for computers and, by extension, for Intel's microprocessors.\n* **Increased Competition**: During this period, Intel faced increasing competition from other chip manufacturers, notably AMD (Advanced Micro Devices). AMD introduced competitive products that challenged Intel‚Äôs dominance in certain segments of the market.\n* **Technological Shifts**: The early 2000s were marked by significant technological shifts, including the increasing importance of mobile computing. Intel was initially slow to adapt to this trend, focusing heavily on desktop processors. This delayed response to market shifts affected its growth opportunities compared to more agile competitors.\n\nNow, how much of this sounds like it's impossible today with Nvidia?

Perhaps the best way to think about it is in terms of power consumption. When the Tesla fleet reaches 100M vehicles, peak power consumption of AI hardware in cars will be \\~100GW. Training power consumption is probably <5GW. These are very rough guesses. Obviously, 5GW of AI training compute is enormous by current standards, but is only about 5% of total Tesla AI compute.\"\n\nHe's shipped about 5M cars through 2023, or about 5GW through his math.  Then he describes that in present tense as only representing about 5% of tesla's total compute.  No, it's actually 100% today.  The 5% is many years from now, just like the 100GW number.  He's also confusing inferencing and training, which I don't follow.  I conclude it's just some numbers+pixy dust to rationalize a 5GW training system in a world of climate crisis, a thing he says he prioritizes.\n\nTo your point about edge inference, Nvidia once was a supplier to tesla automotive with a tegra SoC Kepler generation iirc.  Elon made sure to throw that 4 year old design under the bus it when Jim Keller did their first chip, while Jensen graciously said, we'll be here for you when/if you need or want to come back.\n\nKeller is gone and what ever team is left certainly isn't keeping pace with Orin/Thor and the Drive software stack.   The question is does Elon have enough business sense to know there is more value in Nvidia's solution than in his part, or does his ego prevail and he DIY's it? Does he want to compete with Mercedes, JLR and BYD or differentiate and highlight his own brilliance?\n\nTraining, it's pretty clear Elon's using Nvidia GPUs for both XAI and Tesla automotive.\n\nQuestion is how is he going to inference those two basic models?   If XAI is going for an LLM, then I think that means default to Nvidia infra, but it could be an alternative, small chance.   Tesla I don't know.  His FSD spec has changed from Lidar+radar+vision to vision+radar to vision only and now back to vision+radar if I have that right (don't really follow it).   I think he is going to find, like CSPs, rolling your own is expensive and may not be as good as everyone else's.  And how do his hardware guys adjust?  Did they throw that legacy stuff out at some point?\n\nIn the bottom line I see Tesla as a disruptor to automotive.  The question is do they become the 800lb gorilla or more of a gibbon or chimpanzee among the herd of others?   I think the data is pointing to the later, and if that's the case, doing his own thing isn't the end of the world.   100M cars on the road feels like a decade or more out and in the face of rising competition.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I agree it's not the end of the world if Tesla is just a player and doesn't get much bigger from here.

If you really think Drive is ahead I would highly advise doing more research.\n\nSo there's a danger of Tesla doing very well. But regardless even if that doesn't happen my point was to show that Nvidia is not really the established leader in edge inference and in fact will find it hard to translate their DC position to inference.

But anyway, it's estimated to have 300x fewer interventions than 12.3, which is the power of end to end AI, which only Tesla has.

Inference at home and on-prem will be a big market once the usecases are proven. It's just very important that the software for that is based on Nvidia solutions and not let companies like Microsoft create totally hardware agnostic packages.

That's probably true, but the timeframe might be off.\n\nThe bottlenecks with chip manufacturing is obvious: fabs take years to build and the whole supply chain is vast with so many moving parts. On top of that, Moore's law is almost dead now.\n\nData centers take years to build and new one's are also going to require new power plants to be built alongside them, else they take out the local power grid. Power plants will take forever to build, especially in the US. Once both are built though, they should be modular, something like a massive PC case. And when these come online, AI should accelerate like mad: I believe the next opportunity would be in AI applications.

The Superdividend ETF (SDIV) pays a huge dividend but is basically yield chasing odd little companies across the world. $10K in that in 2011 is now $7800; the weird bag of companies it owns solely because of the yield and (not a consideration towards quality) aren't outgrowing the dividend. How many people have invested in that ETF because \"look at the yield!\" and gotten obliterated?\n\nAlso,  I don't agree with an income emphasis and things like O when someone is in their 20's but I think the real thing that I dislike most is \"dividend above all else\" (\"I don't care what it is, just that it yields a lot and if it pays every month even better\") - then it becomes yield chasing. \n\nThere's also an emphasis at times on dividends as if they are some sort of magic safety, when they're not. Look at something like VFC, which was a dividend aristorcrat for many years and then the rug is pulled. Look at GE post-Immelt and pre-Larry Culp. Plenty of other examples where dividends have become suspended over time. If there's  a downturn, is the company who has better capital allocation/management and a more reasonable dividend likely to cut/suspend the dividend or is the riskier company that yields 5-6%+?\n\nSo, imo the dividend focus is not something that I agree with because on here 1) it often seems like what it pays is so much more important than what the business actually is/does and 2) \"dividends for the sake of dividends\" often leads to buying low/er quality businesses that in some cases aren't paying dividends that can be sustained 3) there's too much focus by younger people on here on income names that would be in some cases more appropriate for their parents and 4) I joked the other day the investable REIT universe on here seems to be largely made up of Realty Income/O - it's a weird little mini cult stock on here because everyone looks for a REIT because they have elevated the idea of dividends in their mind and they all copy each other. People buy STAG instead of much larger/better peer PLD because it pays a bigger/monthly dividend and PLD has a smaller, quarterly dividend.\n\nSo, TLDR: Dividends aren't \"bad\" but I primarily don't like what often seems like the prioritization of what something yields over what it is/does. Company fundamentals should be the focus - not what the yield is - but any time dividend names/yield come up on here it often seems like the latter.", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "Because sometimes it doesn‚Äôt go back‚Ä¶ is this is a serious question?

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive checklist to help you make an informed decision:\n\n### 1. **Research and Preparation**\n- **Vehicle History Report**: Obtain a report from services like Carfax or AutoCheck. This will provide information on previous accidents, title status, mileage, and maintenance records.\n- **Know the Model**: Familiarize yourself with the specific Tesla model and its common issues or recalls.\n\n### 2. **Initial Contact and Verification**\n- **Owner Verification**: Confirm that the seller is the actual owner and has the legal right to sell the vehicle. Check their ID against the name on the title.\n- **VIN Check**: Verify the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) matches across the title, the car, and the history report.\n\n### 3. **Exterior Inspection**\n- **Body Condition**: Look for dents, scratches, rust, or mismatched paint which could indicate past accidents or repairs.\n- **Glass**: Check for cracks or chips in windows, mirrors, and lights.\n- **Tires and Wheels**: Inspect tread wear and look for any signs of damage or uneven wear, which could indicate alignment issues.\n\n### 4. **Interior Inspection**\n- **Seats and Upholstery**: Look for wear, stains, or damage.\n- **Electronics**: Test all electronic features, including the touchscreen, audio system, climate control, and lights.\n- **Trunk and Frunk**: Ensure they open and close properly and check for signs of water damage or leaks.\n\n### 5. **Mechanical and Performance Check**\n- **Battery Health**: Check the battery health percentage. Tesla‚Äôs app or service center can provide a detailed report.\n- **Charging**: Verify the charging port works and check for the presence of charging cables.\n- **Test Drive**: Pay attention to acceleration, braking, steering, and any unusual noises or vibrations.\n- **Autopilot and FSD**: If the car has Autopilot or Full Self-Driving (FSD) features, test them to ensure they function correctly.\n\n### 6. **Software and Connectivity**\n- **Software Version**: Check the current software version and see if it‚Äôs up-to-date.\n- **Mobile App Connectivity**: Ensure you can connect the car to the Tesla app, which will be crucial for remote features and updates.\n\n### 7. **Service and Warranty**\n- **Service Records**: Review maintenance and repair records. Regular service at Tesla-approved centers is a good sign.\n- **Warranty**: Determine if any original manufacturer‚Äôs warranty is still valid or if there‚Äôs an extended warranty in place.\n\n### 8. **Final Checks**\n- **Title and Registration**: Ensure the title is clean (no liens) and that registration is current.\n- **Bill of Sale**: Prepare a bill of sale with all relevant details, including the VIN, sale price, and terms of the sale.\n- **Tesla Account Transfer**: After purchase, work with the seller to transfer the car to your Tesla account for seamless access to features and support.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Third-Party Inspection**: Consider hiring a professional mechanic or Tesla service technician to perform a thorough inspection.\n- **Price Comparison**: Compare the price to similar models in the market to ensure you‚Äôre getting a fair deal.\n\nBy following this checklist, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with purchasing a used Tesla from a private party and ensure that you're making a sound investment.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "See how hard Tesla is advertising the shareholder vote?\n\nMy highest probability scenario is still that Elon is nurfing the company until he gets his comp/new comp package.

After you buy that stock Joe Biden and his close friends decide that Joe Biden has done a super job for all these years and he should get a stock bonus worth 25 percent of the company shares. \n\nNow Joe Biden and his friends understand no court would ever approve doing this by director vote alone,  They know this because the directors - most of them being Joe Biden and his friends - already tried  this and when  this issue was finally brought to the courts - the court acted quickly and threw out the whole deal as unreasonable compensation - the directors violated their duty to the shareholders when they approved the unreasonable package.\n\nSo Joe Biden and his friends decide - let‚Äôs hold a shareholder votes,  that way no director is actually making the decision.\n\nSo the shareholder vote comes - and the stock bonus is approved by say 80 percent of the shareholders.

Should it be the case that shareholders can simply vote to give away 25% of the Company - reduce your value by 25 percent the company for work that has already been done and paid for - and just give it away to Joe Biden?\n\nThere are already laws in every state - including Texas - that keep shareholders from approving any stock giveaway for work already done unless ALL shareholders approve it.

{"title": "The Canary in the Coal Mine: Money Market Funds and Why Equities are Poised to Drop", "selftext": "Hola fellow regards,\n\nToday I am going to dive into Money Market Funds, a topic that recently grasped my attention after a back and forth with one of our own, u/InterPeritura , compelled me to produce a write up of the current assumptions and overall misunderstandings involving this type of investment instrument as well as interest rates in general. Ultimately, this post is meant to elucidate why Money Market Fund Assets increasing during ATHs for equities is a harbinger of coming economic (both monetary and financial) distress.\n\nIf you already know what these are, please feel free to skip to \"**Times when money market fund assets increased while equities increased**\" section of this post.\n\n**What is A Money Market Fund?**\n\nTo begin, I want to talk about what a Money Market Fund is not. It is NOT a Money Market Account. The difference between the two is that a Money Market Account is insured by the FDIC up to $250K, offers rates that are typically higher than typical savings accounts, and is more accessible than funds kept in the MMF.¬†\n\nMoney Market Funds in contrast buy short term debt-based securities, cash or cash equivalents such as CDs and BAs (bank acceptances), and commercial paper. They can also participate in the repo market which adds another level of complexity to their composition structure and overall risk profile. They are NOT FDIC insured so there is no guarantee of principal.\n\nA MMF is also NOT a Mutual Fund. A Mutual Fund is NOT restricted to regulatory determinations to hold a large amount of low-risk fixed instruments like government or municipal bonds. Mutual Funds can buy equities and corporate bonds, making them higher risk with higher reward.¬†\n\nCitation: https://www.investopedia.com/money-market-account-vs-money-market-fund-whats-the-difference-7557816#:\\~:text=Money%20market%20accounts%20and%20money%20market%20funds%20are,in%20an%20MMF%20is%20insured%20by%20the%20SIPC.\n\n**Who invests in Money Market Funds?**\n\nAnyone can invest in the Money Market by directly buying the fund or indirectly through the securities that these funds buy which are primarily short term ‚Äúliquid‚Äù assets with low risk of default. The typical MMF investor is likely buying into the fund in order to decrease risk in their portfolio during times of market uncertainty. However, many people overlook the glaring regulatory issues surrounding commercial paper being used as acceptable means of money market fund composition but that's a topic for another day.\n\nMMFs can buy commercial paper and other securities and use those as collateral for other borrowings in overseas and onshore monetary facilities. Individual investors cannot participate in buying Non asset backed commercial paper. (You shouldn't want to anyway). Meaning banks and high credit financial companies can use unsecured commercial paper in repo operations with MMF managers who themselves are typically part of a financial institution. (Not with the FED but in the private repo market between intermediary financial entities like offshore banks and financial corporations).¬†\n\nCitation:[ Sec3(a)(3) of the Securities Act](https://www.mayerbrown.com/-/media/files/perspectives-events/events/2021/02/commercial-paper-programs.pdf);[ FED1](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/cp/about.htm)\n\n**Times when money market fund assets increased with equities (Hint: it's the opposite of ‚Äúoutgoing procession‚Äù)**¬†\n\nNow that the background information on what MMFs are and how they operate have been clarified somewhat, I will now present data showing why increases in money market participation alongside increasing equities is actually a sign of trouble to come.¬†\n\n**Current contemporary retail misconceptions:**¬†\n\n1. Interest rates falling make money market funds less attractive.\n2. Dropping interest rates makes money market fund participants switch to investing in equities.¬†\n\nThe above two assumptions are the reasons why I made this post. This is because the above assumptions are wrong. They exist as a direct result of misinformation regarding why investors use these funds. The reason investors use money market funds, especially government and treasury type MMFs, is due to a desire for having cash in a liquid market where it will earn returns relatively risk free **in lieu of better investment opportunities elsewhere.**¬†¬†\n\nNow ask yourself: ‚Äúwhy would decreases in interest rates be linked to less participation in MMF and more money in equities?‚Äù The answer is....it doesn't. Interest rates in the short term (not long term), as we all already know, are influenced by FED policy. And by now we should know that the FED is primarily concerned with price stability and keeping unemployment low (how well they perform these duties is debatable). So, if central bankers are considering cutting rates, this means that current macroeconomic conditions are unfavorable for either one or both of the above-mentioned FED mandates. Poor economic future outlook is **NOT** a boon to equities, which should be obvious.\n\n¬†Basically, MMFs exist as a facility for investors to use to park cash while they wait for better opportunities in the market. Their main pros are high liquidity and low risk. **Liquidity and risk management** are the reasons money market funds of this type are used.¬† We only need to look at 3 graphs to show us that money market funds increase in their attractiveness as economic conditions become more volatile and uncertain and only begin to decrease after the equities market bottoms out which will be used as our proxy for sentiment changes.¬†\n\n**Exhibit A**: Dot Com Bust\n\nLeading up to the dot com bust, the fed funds rate started at 6.5 % in Q3 of 2000 and ended at 1.7% by Q3 of 2002 after the end of the recession. Picture 1 (blue line is 6.5% while red is 1.7%)¬†\n\n[Picture 1 \\(blue circle is 6.5&#37; while red is 1.7&#37;\\)¬†](https://preview.redd.it/fd1ph6rxd75d1.jpg?width=1103&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be6419ef9cb5885c20f31b4fa69b408ce71b3091)\n\nDespite interest rates lowering, Money Market Fund Assets continued to increase and did not begin to decrease.... until the recession was over. At the same time the S&P 500 went from $2592 in Sept of 2000 all the way to $1412 by Sept 2002\n\n[Arrows are color coded to correspond with fed funds rate during the period discussed.](https://preview.redd.it/ivchfo22e75d1.jpg?width=1337&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a07ef62a650b68855ccde845e2ca09fd9f7ae50)\n\n[Arrows are color coded to correspond with fed funds rate during the period discussed.](https://preview.redd.it/sws1rfp7e75d1.jpg?width=975&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b16635b27febf6f9534572a49d2af71570fbde20)\n\n**Exhibit B**: Global ~~Financial~~ Monetary Crisis\n\nThe date is September 6th, 2004. The federal funds rate is sitting at 1.48% (green circle). Three years later, on September 10th, 2007, the fed funds rate was 5.25% (orange circle)\n\n  \n\n\n[pic#4](https://preview.redd.it/8y6w0bgfe75d1.jpg?width=918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca2b3825b8da0c50996b315fea314b680c920392)\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this time, money market funds did, in fact, increase in net assets (See pic #5). However, in 2008 when the GFC was well underway, Bernanke slashed rates all the way to 0.15% by Sep 7th, 2009 (purple circle). Yet, despite the lower yield on money market funds during this time, net assets increased until they peaked in Q4 of 2008 and remained relatively level until Q2 of 2009 (See purple line in pic #5).¬†\n\n[#5: MMF assets INCREASED while rates were lowering in the recession \\(shaded region\\)](https://preview.redd.it/26sc49rke75d1.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d611f3850c5e0074b635e3423e8fb5f9b0aa324b)\n\nThis decrease in Money market fund net assets coincided with the bottom in equities that same year. Money remained ‚Äúsidelined‚Äù until macroeconomic confidence was restored. (See pic #6).¬†\n\n[#6 Purple line in pic 5 and this pic show that sentiment change in the equities market corresponded with decreasing MMF utilization](https://preview.redd.it/sixt0kyne75d1.jpg?width=899&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=180e81645801d2846c1d2d006062ec023e2cd42f)\n\nAre we seeing the pattern here? Money Market Fund utilization is not tied to interest rates. They are **tied to macroeconomic conditions and sentiment.** MMFs are increasingly used when macroeconomic sentiment and outlook begins to increase in uncertainty and typically reach highest net asset values when sentiment around equities change. They are NOT tied to interest rates.\n\n**Exhibit C**: Covid Lockdown Recession\n\nMany people forget that, prior to COVID, macroeconomic sentiment was leaning toward a weakening economy and a looming, but slightly obfuscated, recession. Again, same pattern with economic uncertainty increasing and Money Market Fund net asset values increasing while equities rise.¬†\n\nIn response to anticipated macro weaknesses, Powell began to cut rates halfway through the Q3 of 2019 starting from 2.41% in July of 2019 all the way to 1.55% by November of 2019(See picture #7).¬†\n\n  \n\n\n[Pic #7. Red dot is 0&#37; interest rates in March](https://preview.redd.it/bipydjlnf75d1.jpg?width=895&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d705a939570ba5c1419823a147b228e4ef3e4f4)\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, during the last half of 2019, MMF increased in net assets despite the decreasing interest rates(See picture # 8).¬†\n\n[Pic #8 :Increasing MMF utilization alongside decreasing interest rates](https://preview.redd.it/hmeyhhdvf75d1.jpg?width=1355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=346b8c15a40e6a48a09e3c421c5fedeb99442a2a)\n\nAll of this occurring while equities reached ATHs in December and would tread water until Covid in late february/early march caused mass selloffs (See picture #9).\n\n[pic #9: Between black and green lines, S&p increased while MMF asset increased \\(See pic#8\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gv1obvm1g75d1.jpg?width=931&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a5eaaa7978461ddbc8a01d8b4ca20b7caab9b53)\n\nThe unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus policies and packages make this data series harder to interpret. However, we can infer that the V-shaped recovery in equities following the intervention from the FED that wiped out many veterans in this sub was indicative of a sentiment shift. Again, MMF net assets corroborate this relationship with sentiment being the deciding factor as net assets began to decrease and level off until late 2022 and early 2023 when they began rising again...the same year everyone was expecting a recession to occur.¬†\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, if there was a causal and directly proportional relationship between interest rate levels and MMF net assets, there would not be so many instances of money market funds being over utilized during periods of interest rate cuts. MMFs are primarily utilized by private investors, institutions, and companies to manage risk while keeping capital in highly liquid assets in uncertain market climates. NOT for the enticing interest rate.¬†\n\n**TLDR?**: There is no observable correlation with money market fund asset increases corresponding with rises in equities later. This means cash in those instruments are not used later on in equity markets but primarily to keep current cash liquid and earning interest to a relatively safe degree. Powell cutting interest rates is a sign that a recession is already underway and will be a time when market sentiment will be at their lowest and most uncertain, MMFs will actually be increasing in net assets while equities fall.\n\n**Positions?** I am currently building a QQQ short position in LEAPs with strike prices in the mid 300s.

Same thing with the ECB. Its because Europe as well as the rest of the world has been in a recession since basically the beginning of 2023. We are feeling it here too. That latest jobs report? Go look at full time increases vs part time increases and youll see why the jobs market is not actually as strong as it has been advertised. \n\n The only difference is that it has been blunted by perception of the equities market as a picture of the overall ecnonomy (news flash: its not) and the AI boom has lead most indicies higher due to the mega cap tech corporations in the space. But they ALL cant capture that future value and some of their valuations have to give.  And they will, all at once. \n\nAmazon was poised to take over retailers through ecommerce that would later take off, but their share price tanked during the dot com bust. Same thing with microsoft despite their industry leading software at the time.  I can see the same happening with NVDA and the tech stocks in the AI space.\n\nEdited for spelling", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/j0jf1dvix75d1.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b7e2a9ef9bbe9bd4024a45f6c592b08542e1b06\n\nFor those interested, thanks for post it's very interesting", "score": 85, "replies": [{"body": "This actually look like a great indicator to keep an eye on and it makes sense", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fuck", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Shit", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Balls", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "So 2025, we go short?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "pretty tough to time this one I think, high risk high reward.

Their power is 98% Market Psychology and 2% Policy. \n\nCurrent contemporary economic theory states that Interest rates being lower are monetary attempts at stimulating the economy by incentivising banks to lend. The erroneous assumption is banks lend when interst rates are low. \n\nThe truth is lowering interst rates simply makes borrowing more enticing (increases demand) which makes lending more profitable (due to lower supply). The balancing act between banks competing for new demand for debt products like business loans should increase lending and afford companies in need of funding to stay afloat or even invest during times of economic turbulence. Hence, the idea that lower interest rates aid in stimulating the economy during downturns\n\nBut banks also evaluate aspects like credit worthiness AND economic conditions in the macro sense and in the more specific industry sense. This means that banks also consider economic conditions and if they are bad they wont lend.\n\nLowering interest rates is a response to worsening economic outlook. A worsening economic outlook makes banks less likely to lend in the first place. This is why economic policy is two fold: Fiscal(US Treasury, Congress, stimulus checks, Presidential Acts like the Inflation Reduction Act) and Monetary (FED). \n\nBut fiscal stimulus during election years and governmental power shifts take longer to implement.\n\nBanks lend most when sentiment is high and lend lest when sentiment is low. Thats why the FED strategy is 98% Market Pyschology. By the time the Fed starts lowering, the damge to the economy is already done.

And that is true because in 00-01 we didn't have a Federal Reserve willing to prop up the entire market and keep every company alive once the bottom fell out.
