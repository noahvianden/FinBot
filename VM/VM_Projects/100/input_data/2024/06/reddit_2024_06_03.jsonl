{"title": "After 4 years of investing into single stocks: it’s not about financial education but all about psychology and luck ", "selftext": "In early 2020, at age 21,  I started to invest in the stock market by picking single stocks that I analysed through  thorough due diligence (mostly fundamental). During that time I just finished my bachelors degree in International Business and now I am on the verge of finishing my masters degree in Finance & Banking. Since I was 15-16 years old I always had an interest in the stock market and finance topics in general. Also I always considered myself to be really good with mathematical and statistical concepts, so all in all I thought that I must have an edge on the „regular“ investor in terms of not necessarily being better of just putting my money into index funds. \n\nNow after 4 years of investing I realised that I was wrong and the typical advice to just invest into an s&p500 or world etf applies to me as well. Over the 4 years I can account for returns around 22% on my portfolio (not per year but over the whole time span), massively underperforming S&P return during the same timespan. So, on the first of January I started to reallocate my funds by investment a fixed amount into an vanguard s&p500 and all world etf bi-monthly and I couldn’t be happier with my decision. \n\nHalf a year into implementing the strategy shift, I already accumulated a 4-5% return on those etfs and didn’t stress a bit along the way. No reading financial statements and listening to earnings calls for hours. No spreadsheet nightmares, no waking up and checking the market every hour till I go to sleep. \n\nSo yeah I know, what I realised is what everybody keeps preaching since the early days of investing but I had to experience it myself and get humbled to know for myself. Even though I have the knowledge when it comes to finance, mathematics, statistics etc. it seems like this is just the barrier to entry. From that point onwards buying and selling single stocks is 90% and mental game as well as some necessary luck. So a lot of the times I picked the right stocks but failed to stick to simple investment rules, and human biases got the better of me. I kept stocks that underperformed in hopes of getting back in the green And sold of stocks I believed in just to realise gains (e.g. selling Nvidia at 160 bc I already doubled the initial investment) \n\nI hope someone reading this may benefit from hearing my investment history and reflects on if picking single stocks is really worth it 🙏🏼\n\nEDIT: \n\nIt’s crazy how one single post which is just summarising my personal experience got the people of this sub visibly divided into 2 camps:\nThe first consisting of people who agree and/or congratulate me to my personal realisation. The second being people who feel the need to flame me for my experience, decisions, educational background etc.\n\nSo just to make it clear:\n\n\nNO, I’m not thinking that I know a lot about stock market mechanisms! In fact, over the past 4\nYears I gradually became more and more aware of the fact that, for me, learning all about it is not worth it. \n\nNO, I wasn’t trying to generalise or say that picking stocks is a bad choice no matter the person. \n\nYES, I was just talking about myself, and the fact the I, as a person, am prone to human biases and that psychological errors led me to screw up good investments\n\nYES, I believe there are tons of people who are capable of beating the market, it’s just not for everyone \n\n\n\n", "id": "1d72mwg", "created_utc": 1717415893.0, "score": 448, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 234, "comments": [{"body": "I have half ETF and half stock.

Mr. Simons has been hailed as the greatest money maker in modern financial history. No other investor - Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen, or George Soros - has even come close to touching Jim Simons’ stellar investment return record. Since 1988, Renaissance’s signature Medallion fund has generated average annual returns of 66 percent.

Geopolitics accounts for a lot of the unexpected gains/losses in the past few years. \n\nThere are many market-transforming geopolitical events, such as the oil price wars. In 1-2 years, Biden and the ESG left went from concerted efforts to shut down oil production by divesting from oil companies and starving oil majors of capital, to pushing the US to being at the top of the oil & gas producers globally. They did this because the divestiture from oil majors and starving them of capital was leading to spiraling energy costs, which is the natural result of starving supply. But once inflation got out of hand, the US started pumping oil & gas like crazy to bring prices down. \n\nThe US was even dramatically dumping oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022-2023, which broke the oil market and depressed energy prices. Then it spent the next couple of years ramping up to be a top oil producer. [Now, the Biden Administration is trying to prosecute oil executives for not producing enough oil, blaming them, instead of the ESG movement, for low capital investment in energy production](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/ftc-says-ex-pioneer-ceo-tried-to-collude-with-opec-on-oil-prices-27edf5bd). It's as if the ESG movement to divest from energy producers never happened at all and it was all just an acid trip. \n\nThis is a 180 degree turnaround in politically-backed ESG investing agendas that the industrials couldn't have anticipated, without paying attention to politics. \n\nThe semiconductor trade war, for example, has transformed the S&P 500, as we have all seen this year. And before then, starting in 2019, there was the tech trade war vs China where the US went to take down Huawei, which greatly benefitted Apple and US communications tech companies for a few years.\n\nThe truth is, most of the unexpected gains and losses in investing now are due to geopolitics.

Our future as 1000 pound blobs glued into 24/7 virtual reality machines is all but secured!\n\n----\n\n**Game Title:** *Life Itself*\n\n**Developer:** Unknown\n\n**Publisher:** Reality Inc.\n\n**Platform:** All\n\n**Genre:** Survival / Simulation\n\n**Release Date:** Unknown\n\n**Review:**\n\n**Graphics:** ★★★☆☆  \nAh, the visuals of *Life Itself*. At first glance, you'd think they were revolutionary—hyper-realistic landscapes, intricately detailed environments, and dynamic weather systems. But then, you realize that all the textures are inconsistent. One moment, you're in a stunning sunset, and the next, you're staring at a grey cubicle wall for eight hours. Seriously, Reality Inc., ever heard of coherent art direction?\n\n**Gameplay:** ★★☆☆☆  \nThe gameplay of *Life Itself* is an overcomplicated mess. The tutorial is non-existent, leaving players to stumble through basic mechanics like \"walking\" and \"talking.\" There are way too many fetch quests disguised as \"jobs\" and \"errands,\" and the resource management is a nightmare—money, time, energy... and don’t get me started on the grind for XP (Experience Points), which they misleadingly call \"growing up.\"\n\n**Story:** ★☆☆☆☆  \nThe storyline is painfully predictable. Birth, school, work, death. Yawn. The plot twists are either nonexistent or depressingly predictable—surprise, you have bills to pay! Oh look, taxes! And just when you think you might be getting somewhere, the RNG (Random Number Generator) hits you with a mid-life crisis. Talk about lazy writing.\n\n**Characters:** ★★☆☆☆  \nThe NPCs (Non-Playable Characters) are hit or miss. Some are well-developed and interesting, but most are either bland or annoyingly difficult to interact with. The dialogue trees are often repetitive, and the relationship mechanics are infuriatingly complex. Want to build rapport with someone? Be prepared for endless, monotonous small talk and the occasional inexplicable hostility.\n\n**Sound:** ★★★☆☆  \nThe sound design is... okay, I guess? There’s a lot of ambient noise, and while it adds to the realism, it gets irritating. Who thought incessant traffic noises and random people yelling was a good idea? The background music is decent but heavily overused in certain levels (like the \"Retail Job\" and \"Stuck in Traffic\" stages).\n\n**Controls:** ★☆☆☆☆  \nThe controls are the worst part. They’re inconsistent and seem to change depending on the day. Sometimes, moving from point A to point B is a breeze; other times, it feels like you’re wading through molasses. The lag between input and action is infuriating, especially when it comes to basic functions like \"getting out of bed\" and \"making decisions.\"\n\n**Replayability:** ★★★☆☆  \nFor some reason, despite all its flaws, people keep coming back to *Life Itself*. Maybe it’s the allure of the occasional high points—those rare moments of genuine joy or the thrill of achieving something after hours of grinding. But honestly, it’s a glutton for punishment scenario. Each playthrough is frustratingly similar, and the promise of \"endless possibilities\" is a lie.\n\n**Overall:** ★★☆☆☆  \n*Life Itself* is an ambitious title that falls short of its potential. While it has moments of brilliance and an impressive level of detail, the lack of coherent structure, frustrating controls, and repetitive gameplay make it a hard sell. It’s worth checking out if you’re curious, but don’t expect a cohesive or satisfying experience. In the grand scheme of gaming, *Life Itself* is more of a cautionary tale than a must-play epic.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Ai is kaput bro, Oxford said so. Ox.
