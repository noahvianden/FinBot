I just limited out on AAPU near its current levels (34) this morning when I was sleeping, sticking with my self-imposed restriction of only rarely holding levered funds for a very short period of time when I have a very good reason. I'm holding my normal apple shares that I bought pre-earnings over a month ago, after being uncharacteristically out of apple for more than a year. The content of WWDC was completely [in line with my expectations](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1d9wdst/aapl_and_wwdc_on_monday_expectations_for_ai_and/l7kxcsz/?context=3) with the exception that I forgot that apple doesn't do hardware announcements at WWDC and they are pretty secretive in general. I do still think that Apple AI will run TSMC LLM ASIC inference chips on Apple Silicon in the cloud but I could be wrong. I was watching WWDC on my vision pro (brought to me by, in part, by historical gains in Apple stock) and watching a separate window tracking AAPU's ~4% declines and feeling like other traders were watching a different stream.\n\nOver the last months I've also read a lot of comments made by people dragging Apple as a buy, and a lot of comments by people who are either angry or mystified over this week's apple gains, so I thought I would write an essay breaking all the reasons for the rally.\n\n* First off, Apple hasn't had revenue growth for well over a year, and its growth has been tepid for two years. Obviously, you want to own companies that are growing when they are growing, so Apple's stock price was stagnant or down over the last 18 months, while it was entirely discounted as an AI player while the AI chip stocks and AI-branded Mag 7 players ran away (with the exception of Tesla). At the very least, the street is now expecting positive iPhone growth this year, which is the dominant source of Apple's revenue, as its 2 billion+ users begin to upgrade. I personally don't expect Apple to blow us out of the park next earnings, but I do expect consistent and steady growth in iPhone purchases. I'm pissed that I have to upgrade to test the new Siri on a phone, but AAPU more than paid for that this week. After WWDC, I held AAPU until this morning, expecting that dedicated analysts would make their case to fund managers as to while WWDC was actually a big deal, despite the initial sell-off.\n\n* I think Nvida is best positioned to monetize B2B AI on both the hardware and software front (with NIMs and other software/LLM bundle and omniverse digital twin offerings, while I'm ST bearish on the overvalued software sector as a whole). But, I think that Apple is best positioned to capitalize on consumer-facing AI (again, with 2 billion+ users). Most people don't need AI that can one-shot hundreds of lines of code (which AI can't do now, but will be able to do in the future). Most of those 2 billion people need AI give short, confidential, and accurate answers to quick questions (which Apple AI will do this year) and act as an assistant (make three different cost-effective itineraries for a trip and execute on all the purchases for one with an okay, pull up all the news or websites that I will find interesting this morning based on my past behavior), which will happen soon-ish. \n\n* At WWDC, Apple subtly laid out their case of how they are moving forward with AI, which aligns with what a lot of experts have been calling for over the last year. This is that you have your own private on-device AI and own private Apple cloud AI, which interacts with other apps and websites, which will increasingly run using AI agents and novel LLMs, on your behalf. For most people, especially younger generations that are very locked into the Apple ecosystem, the amount of time they use their meat sticks on phones and keyboards will dramatically decrease. Yeah, Microsoft can do this too. But, Microsoft has a very long and problematic relationship with on-device privacy, starting with Windows 10, and progressively getting worse since then. If your AI knows you and is doing stuff for you, you want to be able to trust it. You don't want it to tell Microsoft, Meta, or Google all your pressure points that will result in you making a purchase. These three companies are all in the personal data-broker business, where all your data is supposed to be anonymized, but a programmer with a budget who knows anything about you can know almost everything about you. You also don't want personal AI to cause problems for you while acting as you on your behalf. Also, the difference between great AI software and pretty good software can be huge if you know that the software will inevitably make mistakes and do things that you don't want it to do. At WWDC, apple laid out their business model for the next decade, and it is clear that they are serious and have put a lot of work into it.\n\n* With regard to stocks, future performance will depend entirely on the monetization of AI. Apple can and will monetize AI through their new effort in many different ways. We don't know what Apple's current deal with Open AI is, but it is important to remember that Google pays Apple to use their search. Google turns this finders fee into ad revenue. As AI becomes more accurate and its critical thinking ability improves with retrieval augmented generation, which is critical for accuracy and reducing hallucinations that make AI a b*llshit machine if you ask it a truly complex multi-part question and is critical for an AI managing an OS. Apple will own 2 billion+ eyeballs and they can decide how they monetize those eyeballs and how much they want to make per eyeball at their leisure. \n\n* Whether or not they are currently using ASICs, Apple's official entrance into the AI cloud is a really big deal. Particularly, Apple can capitalize on its decades-long role as one of TSMC's most important customers. Through 2026, four companies have reserved the bulk of TSMC's entire 3 nm production line those companies are NVDA, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple.](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/06/11/news-major-clients-reportedly-fully-allocate-tsmcs-production-capacity-until-2026-3nm-process-in-high-demand/) Right now, if you are a different company or startup that wants to use the best technology to run your AI, you have to go through one of those four players, be satisfied with lower-scale or older-tech production, or wait until 2027 to start production and 2028 to launch. In AI years, 3-4 years is an eternity. We already know the players that will compete at the highest level between now and then, and Apple is one of them, thanks to their historically close relationship with TSM. Apple has been an AI player the entire time the stock was sleeping, and this week, the catch-up trade went into high gear. Apple doesn't hype all the great things that it plans to do to juice share prices, Tim Cook only reports on what Apple has already done in secret (though Apple is a leaky ship, so you can know a lot about what they are trying to do in secret of you read all the macrumors sites and cross-reference different rumors posted at different times for consistency). \n\nThese are the reasons why apple stock went up. People like me waited a year from the last WWDC to make a big bet before this WWDC. The lion's share of my portfolio, in order, is NVDA, TSMC, and AAPL. \n\nWith regard to how long to hold aggressive positions and when to get taxed on profits, I am super sensitive to major Mag-7 level companies notably cutting back on spending, or accelerating their layoffs. I am hoping these indicators will give me a month or so to load up on dry powder/go conservative. I will also keep an eye out for signs of absolutely imminent trouble with China, which would also crash almost all stocks everywhere. With NVDA, I am also on the alert for any reports of Blackwell water cooling failures. Water cooling is really hard to implement, especially when water pressure can't shut off for years, and leaks can't happen for years, or there will be disastrous financial consequences. I've been through many crashes, and it is critical that you watch the biggest customers of your biggest positions to see verifiable trouble ahead. But, I think I stick to evidence based investment with regards to taking profits, and I don't see evidence yet. \n\nThere is a lot of talk on CNBC about Cisco's crash after the dot-com bubble. I used to own Cisco. There were plenty of warning signs. Cisco's biggest customers were WorldCom, Sprint, and AT&T when it had massive year-over-year revenue growth. Two of those companies are no more. WorldCom was an Enron-scale case of outright fraud and they were buying Cisco routers to keep up appearances. Sprint over-extended its Cisco purchases. These stocks hit their highs months before Cisco hit its high. Cisco had tepid 15% YoY growth, down from massive revenue growth, the month it crashed. If NVDA's YoY growth goes from very positive to mildly positive, then that is really bad at these valuations, because trends in revenue growth have significant correlations, and going from great growth to okay growth can signal an inflection into a decline. So, I'm not going to try to get out at or before the top, I am going to wait until earnings numbers come in before running for the hills and rotating into bond proxies with good dividend yield.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Too much text, Apple went up because they’re an excellent company and probably the best positioned for the long haul.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Great write up, thanks for comments on Cisco!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Inverse Reddit for the win", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Inverse what some random redditor says?

Does that mean it's output is going to suck and it's going to drain your battery like crazy? Also no.\n\nIt will have limitations, but the key is in what they sacrifice in order to perform on-device. What you need to recognize is that they likely aren't just running your queries through an llm. There is likely an application layer sitting on top of the model, orchestrating your request, using more traditional logic to determine the category of request as well as necessary OS interactions in order to trim down the query into a variety of smaller, specialized models, including, but not limited to, an llm designed to respond in specific formats that can then be interpreted by the application layer to present more complex answers and queue up actions. \n\nTo top it off, they have all of this running on specialized, dedicated hardware designed specifically to do these operations efficiently. \n\nI don't take issue with your assertion these models will be more limited than something like ChatGPT because, well, no shit. That's why they have optional offloading to cloud compute, or even to OpenAI, for more complex queries. \n\nThe part I take issue with is your assertion that the results will be \"ass\" and the implication that they won't be useful. \n\nThey've designed this workflow specifically to target a wide range (but still much narrower than the scope of something like ChatGPT) of content and activities on your device.

Go back and look at my comment. \"Wage growth has been outpacing inflation for the past **year.**\"\n\nI never said anything about wage growth since the *pandemic*. You can choose whatever arbitrary point in time you'd like to make whatever point you'd like, but you won't get around the fact that both the recent and current trend has been for wages to outpace inflation, which is the only thing that matters at this point and time. \n\nIn case you hadn't realized, the once in a century pandemic is over.\n\n>If their buying power is lower they buy less goods and services by definition if they buy less goods and services there is less growth.\n\nAnd yet that hasn't been occurring, which you'd realize if you had been paying attention. Consumer spending has remained high, which is what has been driving inflation.\n\nYou can't help but seem to get everything wrong. \n\n>Also this trend predates the pandemic. Every penny of median wage growth for decades has been Women growing closer to boomer men wages. If you are an uneducated male your wages have absolutely plummeted compared to boomer era.\n\nNo, it doesn't. As you can see [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1351276/wage-growth-vs-inflation-us/) prior to March 2021 wage growth was outpacing inflation. \n\nAs for uneducated men, I'm not giving that much credence without a source, but your take is still bizarre even if that part is true since it doesn't include educated men, and ignores the reality that growth isn't linear or even among all segments of society, something everyone ought to know. \n\n>S&P valuation is absurd even with their historical earnings. There is too much dry powder and no one has anywhere to park their money.\n\nWhich you just base on big numbers being scary. Based on earnings growth and forward forecast it's really not. \n\n>There is lots of deflationary pressures coming. Social security is going to be insolvent in less than a decade.\n\nThere's an easy fix as long as there's the political will. Remove the cap and SS will be solvent indefinitely. \n\n>Average age is increasing rapidly. Young people have less discretionary spending.\n\nThe first one is true, the second is more nuanced, since young people have had no problem spending recently. \n\n> There are other speculative/politically charged things I wont bring up to distract from the general idea but the growth projections needed to justify current valuations are frankly absurd.\n\nPretty much everything you've said is politically charged/speculative, and mostly wrong, lacking context, or irrelevant.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "> I gave a broad view of pre pandemic compared to now and even brought up multiple decades. Looking at a small snapshot is the arbitrary point. I don't know how you said that with a strait face when your point was a single year.\n\nNo, bringing up recent trends is *the* point. I don't know how you overlooked that with a *straight* face. You did not bring up \"multiple decades\" at all, you merely alluded to the notion that pre-pandemic wage growth was lower than inflation which I proved you wrong about.\n\n>It definitionally is occurring. Wages pre pandemic compared to now didn't outpace inflation no matter how you look at it. \n\nNo, it isn't actually *occurring*. Definitionally, *occurring* means *present tense*. Definitionally, it *occurred* past tense. You need to get with the rest of the world as to what a definition actually is.\n\n>If wages didn't outpace inflation then consumer spending power has went down.\n\nThis is incoherent, but I think I understand whatever point you're trying to choke out. And it's wrong. Not only has wage growth outpaced inflation, consumer spending has remained robust for the past few years.\n\n>Look at absolute values and don't look at YOY graphs. In general, they make it harder to see that overall wages are lower than pre pandemic levels.\n\nWhy don't you look at absolute values, or anything for that matter instead of making things up. YOY graphs are informative, since they literally depict wage growth vs inflation. There are absolute values between different years. What a silly thing to say.\n\nBut, while we're on the subject, you can see that median real weekly wages have been on an [upward trajectory overall since 1979.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q)\n\n>If you take a snapshot of it today no one will argue it's historically higher valued then the amount of earnings they are currently making. The assumption is not only companies will continue to make record profits but they will be even significantly more than they are now. That is hard sell without a huge increase in wages which isn't common in America.\n\nDuh, that's what I said, earnings growth potential is what is driving share price growth, which is totally sensible given the fact wages are outpacing inflation. Your allusions to past stagnation are neither prescient nor even founded since you just seem to be making it up as you go along.\n\n>Sure, not going to happen.\n\nOr it will, since you can't know that one way or another.\n\n> It's a deflationary pressure either way.\n\nNo, if the cap is removed and the benefits continue to flow it most certainly is not a deflationary pressure.\n\n>This is just one aspect of average age increasing. I encourage you to look at projections to Medicare spending. All of it is dead weight spending that has deflationary pressure.\n\nNo, it isn't, as long as the benefits remain, which they likely will given the fact seniors are the most reliable voting bloc and as you pointed out, are only growing in number. \n\n>It's not nuanced, a higher % of their income goes to necessities. It's definitionally lower discretionary spending. Lower discretionary spending is really bad for a consumer driven economy.\n\nExcept that also isn't true.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's only yourself you screw with this permabear shit.

All of this inflation stuff is pretty irrelevant now. While everyone was watching the Fed, Saudi Arabia just gutted the US Dollar...\n\n**US-Saudi petrodollar deal ends after 50 years**\n\nThe US-Saudi Arabia petrodollar deal, a pivotal arrangement in global finance, has ended after 50 years. This landmark deal, initiated on June 8, 1974, required the exchange of only US dollars for crude oil exports, bolstering the dollar's dominance.\n\nThe 50-year-old petrodollar agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia just expired, after Saudi Arabia made no attempt to renew the deal. The term “petrodollar” refers to the U.S. dollar’s role as the currency used for crude oil transactions on the world market. This arrangement has its roots in the 1970s when the United States and Saudi Arabia struck a deal shortly after the U.S. went off the gold standard that would go on to have far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the history of global finance, few agreements have wielded as many benefits as the petrodollar pact did for the U.S. economy.\n\nThe petrodollar agreement, formalized after the U.S. left the gold standard, stipulated that Saudi Arabia would price its oil exports exclusively in U.S. dollars and invest its surplus oil revenues in U.S. Treasury bonds. In return, the U.S. provided military support and protection to the kingdom. This arrangement was a win-win situation for both; the U.S. gained a stable source of oil and a captive market for its debt, while Saudi Arabia secured its economic and overall security.\n\n**Dollar's Status as the Reserve Currency**\n\nOil being denominated in U.S. dollars alone has significance beyond the categories of oil and finance. By mandating that all international oil sales must be settled in U.S. dollars (DXY), the agreement elevated the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. This, in turn, has profoundly impacted the U.S. economy. The global demand for dollars to purchase oil has helped to keep the currency strong, making imports relatively cheap for American consumers. Additionally, the influx of foreign capital into U.S. Treasury bonds has supported low interest rates and a robust bond market.\n\nIn his recent book, Bonfire of the Sanities (December 2023), bestselling author and investment manager David Wright argues the strength of the dollar is a key factor behind America’s high standard of living. Wright declares that the reason why people in the U.S. enjoy “as high of a standard of living as we do is because the dollar is strong.” Wright then explains this strength is partly because of faith in our economy “and because crude oil can’t be bought or sold internationally without U.S. dollars.”\n\nConversely, the petrodollar’s demise may significantly impact the global economic order. **The agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia expired on June 9, 2024.** This expiration has far-reaching implications, as it has the potential to disrupt the global financial order.\n\n**Saudi Arabia’s decision to end its 50-year petrodollar agreement with the United States. Here are the key points:**\n\n**Petrodollar System Shift:**\n\nThe petrodollar system, established in 1974, requiring all oil sales to done only with the US dollar. Saudi Arabia played a central role by pricing its oil exclusively in dollars. However, the recent decision allows Saudi Arabia to sell oil and other goods in multiple currencies, including the Chinese RMB, Euros, Yen, and Yuan, rather than exclusively in US dollars. This shift signifies a major departure from the petrodollar system and is expected to accelerate the global move away from the US dollar.\n\n**Impact on US Debt:**\n\n* The petrodollar system allowed the US to maintain demand for its currency, supporting its financial markets and enabling deficit spending.\n* With Saudi Arabia diversifying its oil sales away from the dollar, there could be a decline in global demand for the greenback.\n* As the dollar’s status weakens, the US may face challenges in monetizing debt and accumulating large deficits without inflation concerns.\n\n**U.S. Dollar’s Future**\n\nThe petrodollar’s expiration dramatically weakens the U.S. dollar and, by extension, the U.S. financial markets. If oil were to be priced in a currency other than the dollar, it could lead to a decline in global demand for the greenback. This, in turn, could result in higher inflation, higher interest rates, and a weaker bond market in the United States.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Still too hot \n\nJust making up for the hot prints in Jan-Mar 2024.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly!

Is No Guarantee for Profits**\n\nWhen Microsoft first invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019, the deal received no more attention than your average corporate venture round. Artificial intelligence was just one of many areas attracting venture investors, alongside electric vehicles, advanced logistics and aerospace.\n\nThree years later, the market looks very different. Startup funding for money-losing tech companies has collapse. The exception is artificial intelligence, specifically generative AI, which refers to technologies focused on producing automated text, visual and audio responses.\n\nIn November, the San Francisco-based startup introduced ChatGPT, a chatbot that went viral thanks to its ability to craft human-like replies to users’ queries about nearly any topic.\n\nMicrosoft’s once under-the-radar investment is now a major topic of discussion, both in venture circles and among public shareholders, who are trying to figure out what it means to the potential value of their stock.\n\nMore than any other big tech company, Microsoft (MSFT) has been unabashedly aggressive in artificial intelligence (AI). It forged a partnership with OpenAI in 2019, investing $1 billion in the AI start-up when it needed a funding source, and it invested another $10 billion in OpenAI in early 2023, shortly after that company launched ChatGPT, bringing its grand total to an estimated $13 billion that it has invested in OpenAI. The deal is significant for any company, but the partnership won't move the needle for a company the size of Microsoft, which is valued at more than $3.18 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft is rushing to integrate their products with OpenAI, which means massive workloads running on Microsoft’s cloud servers. However, the financial implications are anything but straightforward. Microsoft’s stock has rocketed up, outpacing the S&P 500. It’s currently trading at around 38x earnings, according to Yahoo Finance data, compared to 28x for Google. \"They've been seen as an innovator in the hottest area in tech, and the stock price has shown that this year,\" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Yahoo Finance. \"But long term, we're still far from knowing who the winner is.\" Holding on to that lofty valuation would require continuous advancements in Microsoft's AI offerings and cloud earnings. But the competition for AI products is fierce.\n\nElon Musk, who was one of OpenAI’s founders and early backers, has tweeted his concerns about OpenAI’s unconventional structure and its implications for AI, particularly given Microsoft’s level of ownership. ″OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it ‘Open’ AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft,” Musk tweeted in February.\n\nUnlike areas such as advertising or security, Microsoft hasn’t disclosed the scale of its AI business, though CEO Satya Nadella said in October that revenue from its Azure Machine Learning service had doubled.\n\nOpenAI has plenty of skeptics. Late last month the nonprofit Center for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Policy called on the Federal Trade Commission to stop OpenAI from releasing new commercial releases of GPT-4, describing the technology as “biased, deceptive, and a risk to privacy and public safety.” Quinn Slack, CEO of code-search startup Sourcegraph, said he hasn’t seen proof that the OpenAI partnership has given Microsoft a notable advantage.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Electric utility in Phoenix ( PNW) I think will benefit from AI and the chips that will be built their.\n\nDLR as a data center as well.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Apple is the new king of AI", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Not really.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Uhhh, in our lifetime?

If a country runs a current account surplus, then logically and mathematically someone must be funding it via them running a current account deficit. So if China wants to grow its GDP and produce more goods and services, whilst maintaining/growing its current account surplus, then Europe and the US will have to increase their current account deficits and import more goods and services from China. The alternative, like you say, is that the domestic sector in China replaces foreign demand for those goods and services. But that would require massive uplifting in the domestic sector which can only come via government spending - because they can't rely on external trade for the reasons you've said (i.e. Europe and the US doesn't want to).\n\nBut for Europe to reduce its current account deficit with China, it will have to onshore that manufacturing. We can stick as many tariffs as we want on China, but until we onshore real, physical manufacturing we will be forced to fund the Chinese current account surplus. \n\nIt's mental, with all that said, that the UK has just shut down it's last remaining steel furnace because steel is so much cheaper from China!", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "The lack of strategic vision in the UK starting with the neoliberalization under Thatcher is baffling, it was stupendously naïve as well.

In the UK, it’s fairly common for graduates to look for jobs outside of their university specialism, so naturally, he began to look for jobs in finance, banking and HF along with stuff that was actually within his technical remit. \n\nLo and behold, at every Finance and banking interview he went to, it would last less than 20 minutes, first round. At the end of everything, he was clearly upset that none of these institutions wanted to take him on and so he decided to talk to an alumni that had done quite well in finance. \n\nDuring the chat, the friend of his looked at my brother and said, ‘You know, my friend, I wouldn’t hire you for any banking or finance role, and you know why? *I don’t see greed in your eyes’.* \n\nSo take a moment to think through what was said back there; dude’s an engineer, and what corporate asks him to do is to act like the wolf of Wall Street in what he does.

The backlog is 5600 airplanes! New orders means fuck all. You have cherry picked the past 6 months bad news and disregarded all the good news much like news outlets in general are doing to Boeing these days. Obviously you’re short / put options wishing for a 120 price when fair value today sits at 200-220!\n\nFirst of all, the FAA production cap of 38 Max planes per month has no meaning at all, it is political. Boeing themselves has produced and delivered less than that since January because they have self imposed strict quality assurance guidelines and wants to send the message that they’re taking the matter even more seriously (of a blown out door due to one mechanic missing 4 bolts, on an a plane with an American operator - Alaska Airlines, which is why the outrage even started in the first place. “Can’t happen to Americans attitude”).\n\nIf you have ever listened to any statements by the company they say they will deliver and produce less than the FAA cap willingly the first six months of this year then scale to 38 per month by new years or q1 next year, so the whole FAA cap until then is moot! What it literally means is cash burn these 2 first quarters and on full year a small net cash burn. \n\nThereafter the FAA cap will be revised and possibly become more planes per month or remain the same. This is why they’re doing less to show an even greater compliance than asked for at the expense of a hit in short term patience from investors that can’t see past 6 months or even listen to the company at all. \n\nSecondly it is correct that most orders come at airplane fairs / air shows except for the irregular orders coming in irregularly all through the year. But before next months air show no new orders means fuck all. But the backlog of 10 years + makes new orders moot unless it is for a full year calendar which will NEVER happen!\n\nThirdly cancellations thus far has basically not come and the few that has come has NOTHING to do with the door plug incident. It has been either airlines defaulting or not affording their order. All in all this first half year net backlog has grown substantially! \n\nWith all this in mind. What it means is Boeings recovery has been postponed for a full year! What was meant to happen this year will happen next year and all their plans are postponed. What was looking great in free cash flow last new years is now on hold and looking great again new years between 2025-26. And the company is aiming for financial stability on the same time frame 26/27.\n\nFourth if you even looked at the quarterly earnings report it showed that defense (that was last years drag on earnings was finally profitable again) which means when commercial, defense and space (which mostly all three have had costs for apparent reasons the past +5 years) are all spinning again it will be back to a money making machine. \n\nSo your DD is entirely false, not forward looking at all like a DD should be and overlooks all key points as to why EVERY single analyst out there has a price target of 220-300 in the coming year. But I will admit that is too high! Fair value today is about 200-220 like I said and 1 year forward barring huge complications it’s 250-260 at best and the same 200-220 at worst!\n\nShit like this post is ridiculous and brain dead bull with no insight into the industry at all, just hopeium you will influence people to hit your 120 target short", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Market dynamics are influenced by a complex interplay of factors such as technological advancements, investor sentiment, regulatory changes, macroeconomic conditions, and geopolitical events. However, some indicators that might signal the approaching burst of an AI-related bubble include: 1. **Overvaluation**: When the valuations of AI companies become excessively high compared to their earnings and growth potential, it could be a warning sign. 2. **Hype vs. Reality Gap**: A significant gap between the promised capabilities of AI technologies and their actual performance or commercial viability can lead to disillusionment. 3. **Market Corrections**: Broader market corrections or downturns often affect high-growth sectors like AI more severely. 4. **Regulatory Interventions**: Increased regulation or government interventions in the tech sector could negatively impact AI companies. 5. **Technological Setbacks**: Major technological hurdles or failures could undermine confidence in the sector. It's important to stay informed through credible financial news, analyze market trends, and consider the broader economic context when evaluating investment risks. Diversifying investments and consulting with financial advisors can also help mitigate potential losses from speculative bubbles.\n\n\"Ok, but with apple announcing their foray into AI, what kind of timeline can I expect?\"\n\nApple's entry into the AI space can certainly add momentum to the sector, potentially driving further investment and innovation. However, this also means that the market dynamics could become even more complex. Predicting an exact timeline for a potential bubble burst remains speculative, but we can consider a few key phases and indicators to watch:\n\n1. **Initial Surge (6-12 months)**:\n   - **Market Excitement**: Apple's announcement and initial developments could lead to heightened excitement and investment in AI-related stocks.\n   - **Stock Price Increase**: Stocks of Apple and other AI companies may see significant price increases due to investor enthusiasm.\n\n2. **Mid-term Growth (1-3 years)**:\n   - **Product Launches**: As Apple starts launching AI-driven products and services, this could sustain the growth and keep investor interest high.\n   - **Revenue Impact**: The impact of AI on Apple's revenue and profitability will start becoming clearer, influencing broader market sentiment.\n\n3. **Maturity Phase (3-5 years)**:\n   - **Market Realities**: The market will begin to assess the real-world performance and adoption of AI technologies. \n   - **Correction Risks**: If there’s a gap between the hype and the actual market impact, or if broader economic conditions deteriorate, there could be a correction.\n\n4. **Long-term Stabilization (5+ years)**:\n   - **Saturation and Consolidation**: The AI market may reach a saturation point where the high growth rates normalize. Consolidation among AI companies could occur.\n   - **Sustained Value vs. Burst**: Depending on how well companies like Apple and others integrate and monetize AI, the market could either stabilize at a new high or face a significant downturn.\n\nKey indicators to watch during this period include:\n\n- **Earnings Reports**: Look at Apple's and other AI companies' earnings reports to gauge how AI investments are translating into revenue and profit.\n- **Product Performance**: Assess consumer and enterprise adoption of AI-driven products and services.\n- **Competitive Landscape**: Monitor how competitors are responding and the pace of innovation in the AI sector.\n- **Regulatory Developments**: Stay informed about any new regulations affecting AI and technology sectors.\n\nWhile these phases provide a rough timeline, the actual timing of any market correction will depend on a multitude of unpredictable factors.
