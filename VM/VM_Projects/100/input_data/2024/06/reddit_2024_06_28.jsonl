The basis of this discussion is whether Disney is worth a $200+ billion market cap. No, I don't see it. I see them losing a lot of leverage that they once had in films and studio. The parks are great, no question. But it's not a huge growth driver. It's not AI or tech. It's just.... a park with rides for kids. Hence, why would I buy Disney when I can buy a company that actually has a chance to return 10x my ROI?\n\nWe are talking about a company that is worth less than it was worth one decade ago. That's not by chance. Investors clearly do not have faith in Disney as a company. Regardless of whether you call it an opportunity or not, do you really think folks can't read basic charts? There's a reason people are not buying Disney stock which therefore, reduces the price of shares. It's just not an attractive investment. People can shout \"It's a buying opportunity\"! all they want. This isn't the early 2000's. It's easy to see which company is undervalued/overvalued with the source of information at our disposal whether it's easy access to financial reports or updated news on a company through our smartphone.\n\nSlow subscriber growth =/= profitability. Netflix took longer because they had zero IP and had to license content from companies such as Disney. At it's beginning, Netflix was just a platform where they paid film studios money to have their shows/movies on their platform. Disney is inhouse so how long they took to be profitable is a very poor comparison considering they can just publish their content onto Disney+ with minimal cost.\n\nESPN being the king of sports is much like news. People still watch it because they've been the leading source of that industry but you have Spotify, YouTube, TikTok, etc., all taking market share because sports journalists do NOT need ESPN to report on sports. It's quite obvious Netflix is moving into sports. The recent WWE deal was huge for both of them. UFC is reportedly considering moving onto Netflix as well. Considering both brands fall under TKO and have the same sponsorships and network deals since being sister brands, it's very likely UFC takes their content to Netflix as well.\n\nI'll just be honest here, I get Disney+ and Netflix for free. The last time I watched Disney+ was when Andor came out. That's the only time I ever tune into Disney+. The content is just lacking. It's mostly kids shows whereas Netflix is geared towards the entire demographic. I don't see it as competition. Disney+ just seems like a supplement to Netflix at this point. Brushing all of this aside, Disney shares being worth less today than it was one decade ago isn't an accident. Again, the company is clearly one of the most distinguished brands out there.

The scenario mentioned in this post sounds very familiar.\n[A question about \"Ban Evasion Protection\"...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/16ji8zq/a_question_about_ban_evasion_protection/)\n\n\nAlso noteworthy on that, a comment says:\n>\"Once you approve their posts a few times, it will stop showing it.\"\n\n[Comment link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/16ji8zq/comment/k0ql5hj/)\n\nThey also say:\n>\"If you go back to the original message it says if you approve 3 of their comments, the ban evasion notices go away\"\n\n[Comment link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/16ji8zq/comment/k0q28z8/)\n\nSo it sounds like it's up to you guys to use the feature as a guide and **choose** to approve a post from someone it picked up, rather than banning them because the information it tells you looks misleading to the point it makes you think the person is a bad actor.\n\nI see this ban as a violation of Reddit's [Code of Conduct](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct) Rule 5, except the compensation in this case is a self-fulfilling benefit due to the recent effort I've learned about to keep the community clean and respectful by pre-emptively banning users who are guilty by association only because others \"commonly come from other \"toxic\" subs\" (as has been described to me).\n\nTL;DR - My actions over the last number of weeks have not warranted any of these bans.

But doesn't that mean I'd have to buy a robot vacuum, a robot laundromat, a robot for the kitchen, etc. etc. etc.? It seems, from an outside perspective, it must be cheaper to buy 1 robot that can do many things rather than many robots that each do 1 thing really well?

Robots took over most of auto manufacturing and many people around detroit and flint found themselves without a job. Same thing in mining.

That requires a longer-term view than capitalism is capable of having. I don't know quite how it will work out either. Marx said that capitalists would ultimately be their own grave-diggers in this exact way. The marxist view was that when enough of the working class are beaten down and impoverished, they would rise up to seize the means of production and the profit that had gone to the owners of capital would ultimately flow back to the revolutionaries.

Batteries are cheaper and better in every way compared to even 5 years ago, to say nothing of comparing a battery from today to an old lead-acid from the 1990s. \n\nI'm telling you, within 5 years you will personally see a humanoid robot doing actual work. First in controlled settings like warehouses and factories, second in construction trades as a material handler. Then it will explode like smartphones did. Think back to the first time you saw a touch-screen phone. How fast was it from that day until you had one yourself? How long until almost everybody had one? Robots will erupt onto the scene in exactly the same way. Remember, it doesn't need to be human-level intelligence to provide human-level services. You can teach it to be only a warehouse robot at first. We do not need real AGI to tell it \"Boxes come down this chute, sort them and put them on the shelves\"\n\nIt sounds sci-fi today the way an iPhone would have sounded like sci-fi in 2000-2005. \n\n  \nThe most important things to understand about the coming robot storm:\n\n1. You don't need AGI. You just need enough intelligence to complete a task.\n\n2. The robot's total cost of ownership, including the device and electricity, will START at $10-$15 per hour of robot labor, and that robot labor will be superior to human labor because it will be precise.\n\n3. As the total cost of ownership comes down, the robot gains a positive expected value. Basically, you can buy it for $50k but it will labor along for several years and net profit you $200k. \n\n4. Once a robot is available cheaply for a task, that task won't be done by humans, just like you don't use an old-timey scrub-board for cleaning your clothes once you have a washing machine.\n\n5. This will disrupt society more than any previous technology, as it redefines the relationship between captial and labor. What will the world's human labor force do when they have to compete with robots at $1 an hour in 2040?", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "If there was ever a sign that read \"this is the top for a while\"...
