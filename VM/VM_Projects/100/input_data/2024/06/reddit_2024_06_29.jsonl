Leveraged ETF's are much more complex and risky than they appear on the surface.  \n\nFrom Schwab:\n\n# Risks of Leveraged & Inverse Products \n\nLeveraged ETPs (Exchanged Traded Products, such a ETFs and ETNs), seek to provide a multiple of the investment returns of a given index or benchmark on a daily basis. Inverse products seek to provide the opposite of the investment returns, also daily, of a given index or benchmark, either in whole or by multiples. Due to the effects of compounding and possible correlation errors, leveraged and inverse products may experience greater losses than one would ordinarily expect. Compounding can also cause a widening differential between the performances of an ETP and its underlying index or benchmark, so that returns over periods longer than one day can differ in amount and direction from the target return of the same period. Consequently, these ETPs may experience losses even in situations where the underlying index or benchmark has performed as hoped. Aggressive investment techniques such as futures, forward contracts, swap agreements, derivatives, options, can increase ETP volatility and decrease performance. Investors holding these ETPs should therefore monitor their positions as frequently as daily.

The next day, it dropped to $14.50 and traded in this range all day. I got assigned after the market closed on Thursday. Friday morning I woke up to a message saying I was assigned and my cash value had changed. So what happened? I was forced to buy 1,000 shares of RVN at $19 instead of market value $14.50. In doing so, my cost was the difference after my premium for entering the trade was completely eaten away. Then I was left with the choice of holding the shares or exercising the long leg of the spread which was selling those same shares for $16.50 now. I did this, and pretty much zeroed the trade out. But obviously lost all the shares. I’m glad I did because RVN finished at $13.50 on Friday.

Investment across a decade limits one’s perspective and possible investment theses.\n\nSo, electrification across sectors will continue to be a thing - from grid upgrades, solar and wind power, heat pumps, electric cars, batteries and induction stoves that drive consumer and commercial electric component upgrades and so forth. So TSLA has significant exposure to that, but not the only one, and only some parts of that. So GRID ETF, BATT, QCLN and many others capture parts is that. Also into utilities, as they will likely make more and sell more power and pay a good dividend for years to come. I like RIVN, take risks in Chinese EV providers, XLU and maybe other specific utilities, maybe a well oversold charging network, trying to find a way into Eaton and some of the other grid and electric component providers like them.\n\nOngoing AI …. but that may play out to a bubble this year, with NVDA being a clear recipient of capex spend from a slew of other companies. Maybe more spend in PLTR by various gov and others, but unclear how many folks will truly monetize AI. Could be self driving with Mobileye and Tesla or one of the chinese like XPEV or NIO, maybe Google. Could be one of the humanoid robot efforts or existing industrial robotics, like Funac, Kuka, or TSLA, but NVDA is a major parts supplier for the efforts that are not publicly traded. Could be AAPL with their pragmatic consumer focused strategy with stuff that announced at WWDC, but likely AMZN, MSFT, and Google also respond, and also provide cloud AI infrastructure for both consumers and businesses.\n\nBiotech has often been well oversold, but as usual, a wild west of dreams and charlatans, with investors being bipolar over prospects and hard to tell the diff between stuff that will work or not until stuff works. I do have some ARKG due to exposure to CRSPR stuff, and some RCUS for anti-TIGIT, but very speculative.\n\nInterest rates are likely to pivot coming up which could mean a slew of things. I think the housing market gets better, so mortgage writers and some real estate plays do better, so got into UWMC, Zillow, etc. Fed may have a soft landing, or cause a recession. Lots of various interest rate plays with companies beaten down in valuation due to high borrowing costs. Solar has been affected in a big way due to that due to high borrowing costs for project funding to at affects ROI and the recent surge in FSLR is due to folks recognizing that AI used a crap ton of electricity and so commercial and utility grade solar is huge. But that story has politics and tariffs that buffet it. Also interesting to me are synthetic dividend generating index following like QQQY, QYLD, NUSI, and so forth. Be wary - some are not intended to be held for long periods of time. See how they do in down and up markets to see if they make sense for what you want. For me, indexes doing lots of sideways choppy action is high in my mind so very high dividends that limit upside is fine for a segment of my portfolio, and I use that cash for highly speculative plays.\n\nYou can certainly look at the components of theme based ETFs and construct your own by picking choosing from them. For a decade, likely a slightly broader exposure will be better served, but be wary of over concentration of a theme that doesn’t work out. For example, you might have chosen a basket of EV related stocks in late 2021 and now some are bankrupt, many are 75-95+% down. But some are now so beaten up and the narrative has gotten way overhyped to the downside that their upside is huge. But one of the problems with looking across a decade is that a boom can come and go within 1-3 years.. upside is huge, and then the world moves on, and that could very well be any number of biotech stories, or stuff like 420 and 3D printing stocks. Again, some of the stuff that is most out of favor can come roaring back.. crypto for example.\n\nGood luck!", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Gimmie some of your brain pleasw", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Probably $META based on very very strong gross profit, revenue growth, EPS, innovation, and management.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Synopsys", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Stocks dont care about when you bought in or how much profit/loss you are at.

People think TSLA sales are down because Elon bought twitter. That's just silly. The reality is the entire EV space is going through a cycle. EV sales are all down. Most of the companies are either out of money (PoleStar), reducing expansion plans (Ford, GM), being bought out/subsidized by larger players (Rivian/VW) or essentially on the verge of bankruptcy (Lucid, Fisker)\n\nThe basic facts: EV sales were pulled forward due to their new/fad adoption, free cost of money (0% interest rates), and EV subsidies which have mostly dried up. Most people that live in dense areas and/or could accept the charging/range limitations of EVs have purchased one.\n\nWill TSLA stock go down - maybe. But in a few years, TSLA will be one of a few dominant EV makers having survived this business cycle and will come out far ahead of the competition due to manufacturing processes, economies of scale, and charging network, software, etc.\n\nThis is typical of all nascent industries. As soon as one player discovers a new pie, other players rush in to gain a piece. In the end, almost all these cycles leave an oligopoly of a few powerful players that control the mainstream market. TSLA will be one of those, along with a few Chinese manufacturers. That, you can bet your life or money on. Most other companies will either go out of business (if they basically haven't already) or become niche players.
