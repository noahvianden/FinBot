The instruction set is barebones and focuses heavily on efficiency... Which admittedly has its place in the world obviously because damn near everyone has a smart phone, but it's missing critical instruction sets that provide functionality and performance for a minimal efficiency gain when it comes to PC's and laptops. Not to mention absolutely every part, from the OS to the programs themselves, have to be rewritten to work on ARM because it's missing those critical instruction sets that Windows has been built on for years. Even when Windows is recoded to work on ARM, its still going to have many downsides compared to X86. All this to gain a few minutes of battery life? It's not worth it outside of mobile devices meant specifically to maximize battery life, at least IMO.\n\nAs I said, once the technological gap is bridged between ARM and available X86 cips and the difference comes down to the ISA, I think people are going to see just how overhyped ARM is. It's never going to replace X86. The only thing that will replace X86 is a more advanced CISC.

{"title": "Tesla internal data shows company has slashed at least 14% of workforce this year ", "selftext": "Tesla’s hefty downsizing since 2023 has reduced its global head count to just over 121,000 people, including temporary workers, internal records suggest, indicating that the automaker has slashed more than 14% of its workforce so far this year.\n\nThe latest figure is not from precise payroll data, but from the number of people who are on Tesla’s “everybody” email distribution list as of June 17, a tally viewed by CNBC.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk sent an email to “everybody” that day. He told employees, “Over the next few weeks, Tesla will be doing a comprehensive review to provide stock options grants for exceptional performance.” He added that options grants will also be awarded to “anyone who does something outstanding for the company.” Tesla’s plan to reinstitute options grants, after previously pausing performance-based equity awards, was reported first by Reuters.\n\nTesla’s layoffs announcement landed in April, when Musk sent out a companywide email telling employees that the automaker would be cutting more than 10% of its staff. Layoffs at that point were already underway.\n\nBloomberg reported that Musk was aiming for a 20% staff cut. Musk indicated that the number could be even bigger. On the company’s first-quarter earnings call later in April, he said Tesla had reached an inefficiency level of 25% to 30% after “a long period of prosperity” that began in 2019.\n\n“We’ve made some corrections along the way,” Musk said on the call. “But it is time to reorganize the company for the next phase of growth.”\n\nIn a filing for the fourth quarter, Tesla said its employee head count worldwide at the end of December was 140,473, a number that represents salaried and hourly staffers. The “everybody” email list includes temporary workers. At around 121,000, that suggests Tesla has reduced overall headcount by at least 14% since the end of 2023.\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn at least one instance, Musk’s head-count reductions went too far. Tesla dismantled its Supercharging team, which consisted of hundreds of employees, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. The company later hired some of those people back, according to posts on LinkedIn.\n\nThe broader cuts coincide with a slippage in sales at Tesla as the company reckons with an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China as well as brand deterioration that a recent survey attributed partly to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” For the first quarter, Tesla reported a 9% drop in annual revenue, the biggest decline since 2012.\n\nAcross the auto industry, EV sales growth slowed this year after two years of rapid expansion. The slide was particularly acute for Tesla, whose Model Y was the top-selling car worldwide in 2023.\n\nA Tesla employee, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive internal issues, told CNBC that some factory workers are fearful more layoffs could follow in July, depending on second-quarter results.\n\nA production and deliveries report for the second quarter is expected from Tesla during the first week of July.\n\nMusk has promised investors the company will soon publish a new “Master Plan,” which would be his fourth, and that Tesla will reveal its design for a “dedicated robotaxi” on Aug. 8.\n\nTesla shares were little changed on Friday at $181.71. The stock is down 27% this year, while the Nasdaq is up 18%.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/21/tesla-has-downsized-by-at-least-14percent-this-year-internal-number-shows.html", "id": "1dm0ejw", "created_utc": 1719076166.0, "score": 245, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "Meanwhile stockholders gave him $56 billion and he rewards his workers with pink slips.", "score": 114, "replies": [{"body": "They are delusional. \n\nDid you see the sales pitch on the voting webpage? \n\n“It’s not fair lawyers get paid like superstars.”\nBitch, you’re the literal highest paid mother fucker on the entire planet.

{"title": "Apple Intelligence won't launch in EU in 2024 due to antitrust rules, company says ", "selftext": "Apple said Friday it won’t release three recently announced features, including its flagship “Apple Intelligence” AI product, in the European Union in 2024 due to “regulatory uncertainties” stemming from the bloc’s Digital Markets Act antitrust regulation.\n\nApple said in a statement that the features — Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, and enhancements to its SharePlay screen-sharing product — won’t be available to EU customers due to Apple’s belief “that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.”\n\nThe EU passed the DMA in 2023, spurred by concerns that a handful of major technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance were acting as “gatekeepers” in preventing smaller firms from competing. Among other things, DMA requires that basic functionalities work across competing devices and ecosystems.\n\nThe interoperability requirements apply to iPhones and iPads. But Macs are affected by the DMA because iPhone Mirroring allows users to replicate the screen of an iPhone on the screen of a Mac.\n\nThe loss of the company’s AI product could be a disappointment to consumers. Apple Intelligence can proofread writing or even rewrite it in a friendly or professional tone. It can create custom emoji called Genmoji, search through an iPhone for specific messages from someone, summarize and transcribe phone calls and show priority notifications. The company also announced a partnership with OpenAI and a roadmap to other models being added to the platform.\n\nApple shares were largely flat on the news. Apple saw 2023 net sales of $94.3 billion in Europe, just under a quarter of its worldwide net sales. Apple Intelligence also won’t be available in Greater China, which accounted for $72.6 billion of its 2023 sales.\n\nThe company said it will work with the European Union “in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.”\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/21/apple-ai-europe-dma-macos.html", "id": "1dm0h7f", "created_utc": 1719076360.0, "score": 436, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 229, "comments": [{"body": "Is this why apple dumped in the last 10 minutes of trading yesterday?", "score": 129, "replies": [{"body": "maybe alongside the XLK rebalance", "score": 40, "replies": []}, {"body": "> s this why\n\nNah, I added to my aapl position Thursday.

People don’t seem to realize max’s are still flying everyday for years now since the no fly order was rescinded!\n\nDefense and space turned a profit last earnings after being what kept overall earnings red last few years mainly due to being stuck in old pre inflation income contracts with inflation affected costs!!

You don’t ask yourself why? In 2020 Boeing got long term loans for 0.3% interest rates!

Did you know that the carry trade in Japanese banks holding US bonds appears to be unwinding over the next year or so? Those banks hold a bit over a trillion dollars in US bonds. \n\nWhen I say unwind I mean they are losing money on the carry trade so are pulling the plug. That means they will have to sell those bonds at a loss. That means they are not only not buying US bonds right now but are likely going to dump a huge amount of US bonds onto the market in the near future. That means the newly issued US bonds will have to yield even more to get people to buy them. That will be a crisis. The Fed will act because this has the potential to really screw up the global monetary system. \n\nHow will that play out? I dont know, but it will act in many ways like a margin call for a huge portion of the global monetary system. It could easily blow up a lot of precarious positions. That to me sounds like something the Fed would like to avoid. \n\nCan they stop it if it starts blowing up in a big way? Probably but it will come at a cost. Remember all those banks that are required to have reserves? A lot of them are already underwater because the bonds they own are worth less than they paid for them. Its already a problem. This is going to make those bonds worth even less. Oh and this isnt just about the US bonds. These guys were doing this with a bunch of assets so its likely to hit all kinds of things. \n\nEssentially the process of unwinding will mean they sell bonds at a loss and then pay back their borrowing from their central bank. They are having to do this because the Bank of Japan had to raise rates and it looks like they will continue to do so until they fix problems they are having. That rate increase is tiny, but the spread involved is tiny as well. The key thing is that a huge amount  of borrowing globally is tied back to this and its going to ripple out. \n\nHas this happened before? Yes.

Its been a concern for the past year but the next big pile of articles are back in 2008. \n\nIf there was one thing you didnt follow before that you should probably start following its this.

You are at the point t now of making even wilder and more unrealistic bets to try to make back a huge loss.  You need to go to a hard stop and dissect what you did and what happened with every trade so far.  It should be obvious you made some poor assumptions, maybe up to ridiculously awful.  There is a lot of risk in most investments, hopefully you see that.  The top 3 to 5 holdings of the best performing funds is a good place to begin to make better picks.  You and I know nothing and should be leaning on the professional expertise of seasoned investors who have actually made money.  It can be done, but you just have to really stop thinking you know what you are doing and making choices of stocks no one has heard of.  Start with something very simple and get good at it.  You could paper trade for 3 months or so and see how you do while your remaining funds sit in an interest bearing account.  Try learning and trading the TQQQ, the ETF Of the QQQ.  Use a simple system like the Bollinger Bands to enter and exit as your investment GPS.  IT is easy to see some trading strategies like this and grow your skills and become very successful.

With skill you can reproduce your results, with luck not so much.\nOne last thing, really understand what is a reasonable and rational expectation to grow an account 1, 2, 3 percent or more in a week.  I know it can be done some weeks, but many weeks you won't hit that mark or even go down.  How to average 2 percent or more is key.  One way was if you had just put 10K in Nvidia, when you got the money and you would have hit all your goals.  Go back and look.  Now ask yourself, why you didn't find it and instead did something wildly different??  You need to know the answers to these questions.  There have been at least 50 pretty solid stocks that have doubled or up 50 percent so far this year. How come you didn't find a single one of those?   Figure that out before you do anything else.  Or just go to a casino or buy lottery tickets, people win there too.  Do a little but of reading and research to improve your outcomes.
