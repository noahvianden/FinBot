For example I do think BTC market cap will exceed Gold in the next 5-10 years, can NVDA do that? If so that's a 5x from here (or more if Gold goes up in the meantime). I want to hear someone explain why it will be and give me info to do my own research and if it makes sense to me I add an amount to my portfolio commensurate to my level of confidence after reviewing everything, or if I cannot justify it at this price I'll sit out. I really wish I invested when I first saw it, but I don't wanna be the guy who just buys at the top due to FOMO and watches it sink back down or float around for no meaningful result. The other thing I keep thinking about is that I knew about BTC and sat out for many years before finally taking the plunge in 2022, if I bought in when I first heard of it I'd be a multi millionaire now, I've made money on that position anyway, but nowhere near what it could be as I knew about it when it was a few hundred dollars a coin.

A stock market moves on supply and demand, once institutions take profits on NVDA it will be a long way down.\n\n“NVDA has a massive monopoly on the GPU market used at datacenters for AI accelaration. They are so high in demand that they can basically charge whatever they want for the chips. There are a few bottlenecks to the operation.\n\n1. The reason they are able to charge so much is because of the software that connects all the chips together called CUDA, this is the software they use to train AI. This software only works with NVDA products. This is the reason everyone wants to uss NVDA because currently there are no better softwares for AI acceleration. \n\n- Intel is partnered with Google, Qualcomm (massive chip maker),Samsung (another massive chip maker). They are all working on making Intel’s software called One API to try to undercut NVDAs CUDA. This software would enable datacenters to use any brand chips they want, (like intel’s Gaudi 3 which is twice as good as NVDA’s H100 flagship GPU for AI acceleration, and also half the cost)\n\n2.they depend entirely on TSMC (which is in Taiwan and the whole reason China wants to take Taiwan) on making their chips. TSMC makes chips for 92% of the world’s semiconductor market(they make chips for NVDA, AMD, Apple, etc). So when NVDA designs a new GPU, they send the design yo Taiwan and then TSMC makes and packages the chips. These factories are called foundries.\n\n- if China decides to strike taiwan, NVDA stock will dump\n\n- the only reason intel as a stock is down right now is because they are investing all their money into building out 5 foundries around the globe with two of them being in the US.  One in Arizona, the other in Oregon. Once these foundries are all online, NVDA, AMD, etc will all come to intel to make their chips so as to not rely on TSMC exclusively as well as to take advantage of Intel’s more competitive prices.\n\nanyway the point is once NVDA cant charge those prices anymore their stock is going to correct very hard. I dont want to be a bag holder when that happens because their stock price is 230x their earnings per share rn.

These expressions are then offloaded to an external theorem prover, which symbolically performs deductive inference. Leveraging this approach, we observe significant performance gains on FOLIO and a balanced subset of ProofWriter for three different models in nearly all experimental conditions we evaluate. On ProofWriter, augmenting the comparatively small open-source StarCoder+ (15.5B parameters) with LINC even outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by an absolute 38% and 10%, respectively. When used with GPT-4, LINC scores 26% higher than CoT on ProofWriter while performing comparatively on FOLIO. Further analysis reveals that although both methods on average succeed roughly equally often on this dataset, they exhibit distinct and complementary failure modes. We thus provide promising evidence for how logical reasoning over natural language can be tackled through jointly leveraging LLMs alongside symbolic provers.\\[[1](https://openreview.net/forum?id=h00GHjWDEp)\\]\n\nWhat's interesting in these cases is that the parameter size of the model used is vastly smaller (by several orders of magnitude) than the current state of the art models (GPT-4) which struggle with anything beyond propositional logic. Now, if I was to bet, I would bet the future of AI will be small neurosymbolic models which leverage symbolic manipulation and use a lightweight LLM as a frontend.\n\nThat solves most of the hallucination and reliability issues that plague pure transformer models. However - and this is a good thing - it means we need less data and less compute.

A mortgage crisis has direct impact on the broader population, and therefore directly affects society and politics.  \nIt also directly hits the banking and loans industry, which triggers banks collapsing, which triggers more problems for \"voters\". This is not 1929 and the governments of the world know how to intervene to to a crisis outside their eco-system. The problem is that the banking system is part of our macro-economic global eco-system.\n\n2. Nvidia is a solid company for decades, which there is just now more demand for. Their base in GPUs they can fall back on, and their chips are not going to lose value and demand longterm, even if there is a sudden temporary change in the need for extra chips here and now.  \nRussians can probably hit Kharkiv with a missile that might only need a 10-20yo raspberry pie as guidance computer.\n\n3. Nvidia as a chip-maker also represents a national security asset to the US government. Whether people live in houses or on the street, does not have much of an impact on external security for the US, but chip development and/or production does. So likely Nvidia will be bailed out, if there is an issue, and then as part of the bailout be forced to focus more on national security.\n\nI find it a bit funny how Nvidia has become so super overvalued. They are just one company, and the requirement for AI is mainly quantity power, not any specific kind of quality that others cannot make.  \nMaybe I should buy some stock in AMD, since they will eventually rival Nvidia (or at least just fill parts of the quantity in demand for AI chips).  \nAlso ARM, Qualcomm, and others will build different architecture, which might be better, different, or specialised for certain tasks. Maybe even Intel, even if they went in a different direction.\n\nIf there was a problem with Nvidia as a business, then there would be a problem, but Nvidia is a solid business. So they will probably just drop in stock evaluation later, and others will go up, as non-tech normies start to understand there are other companies, who can make chips... Just like people learned decades ago that other besides IBM can build computers. And as with IBM, then Nvidia might well split into several companies, so gaming and AI can go in different directions. Just like IBM split of certain departments and/or sold them to maintain a healthy business.\n\nWhy do you assume Nvidia will crash?  \nNvidia builds things. Mortgages and websites (last two major bubbles I remember) were imaginary products. Physical products with continued relevance for secondary/tertiary use will retain some value. Imaginary products have zero inherent value, and therefore have zero value. Yes yes, houses and servers hold value. But a harddrive in a server does not retain value for alternative use, and a house holds a lot of value for a customers, but mortgages are very marginal investments, and the bank has no use for your house.  \nBut a university can build a supercomputer out of 10000 PS2s...\n\nHas there actually ever been a hardware caused economic crash?  \nNot just computing hardware, but also engineering equipment, or any other high tech physical product like that?  \nAll I can remember is crashes over imaginary products (currency, stocks, loans, mortgages, websites, intellectual property etc.).  \nThe Spanish economy did not collapse from the gold they \"found\" in South America, but from flooding it into the market, instead of keeping it in a macro-economic strategic reserve to maintain micro-economic demand...
