{"title": "Bear Case: Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose", "selftext": "Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.\n\nWith the \"Attention is all you need\" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.\n\nBut even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.\n\nMuch of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.\n\nUltimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA.", "id": "1dbvyv3", "created_utc": 1717945881.0, "score": 289, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 245, "comments": [{"body": "I might have believed your bearish prediction if I didn’t know Google’s infrastructure and ecosystem.", "score": 274, "replies": [{"body": "OP’s comment brought to you by ChatGPT^TM", "score": 154, "replies": [{"body": "I assume these are people with heavy Microsoft or Apple positions when I read them.

There are still other services and products that Apple is able to innovate and earn well with. Their headphones alone changed the industry and pushed bluetooth more into the forefront of what people expected. While Vision Pro was an initial flop, it reminds me of when Apple released the iPad a few years ago and the reception was really lukewarm. No one understood the point of an oversized iPod Touch. The most common point raised about it was \"well it can't really do anything\" and yet years later tablets and the iPad are both essential products in modern society. \n\nApple is lucky to have such amazing financials in general, it means that the stock would have no issue shifting from a growth stock to paying a dividend off it's stellar numbers. Especially considering that year over year they will have to replace iPhones even if the cycles become longer per consumer. iPhones are basically generational branding at this point. The blue text icon alone changes the way people perceive each other, it is ingrained in our minds to look for that now and it keeps people in iPhones. \n\nBeyond that, remember that Apple and iPhone are the MINORITY still when it comes to the smartphone market. The rest of the world is predominantly Android, especially in emerging countries. As new countries gain a stronger foothold with consumer dollars, their consumers will want to eventually adopt iPhones and Apple products. Apple still has markets to penetrate with it's products when the timing is right. \n\nSo there is still market for Apple to pick up on, they have strong products in different non-competing areas of technology, and they have a rabid fanbase that passes their own love for Apple products into the next generation of users they raise. The Vision Pro is still a very impressive piece of technology even if it was a failure after launching. \n\nHOWEVER, if Apple wants to maintain it's dominant status, the guys at the top need to really be thinking long term strategy here. Apple has done this in the past with their products. While they took a recent loss with the Vision Pro, expect that they are investing to make it a better product because the idea is still a good one on paper. \n\nWith that said, I sold out of my Apple positions earlier this year. While I like the growth it got me in the past, I don't believe that the guys at the top are thinking correctly for long term growth. It feels like there has been a trend in tech to find one person that innovates and then hop on it to increase short term evaluations. Apple used to be the company that innovated first. They did so with the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad. They attempted to do so with the Vision Pro even though Meta has been quietly humming along in the space. They probably thought they could do with the Vision Pro what they did with AirPods where they could apply \"Apple\" to a good idea and make it even better. I think they still have a shot with it, but I also think that to get there it would take years of planning and calculation and I don't buy into the leadership at Apple today being fully capable of doing that which is why I sold out of them. If you believe that the leadership at the top of Apple does have a plan with their product roadmap and recognizes their ability to execute on the right type of wearable technology for the future then by all means purchase their stock.

I don't think so.  I think there was an equal number of people on the far right (the counter part to those on the far left that now hate him for not sticking to their playbook) that disliked him before.
