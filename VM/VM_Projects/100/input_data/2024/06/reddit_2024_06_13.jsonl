In fact, there is barely any evidence of negotiations at all.

{"title": "Tesla pops 6% in premarket after Elon Musk says he is set for victory in $56 billion pay vote ", "selftext": "Shares of Tesla popped in premarket trading, after Elon Musk said shareholders are set to approve his controversial $56 billion pay package and a resolution to move the electric carmaker‚Äôs incorporation to Texas.\n\nAt 08:12 a.m. ET on Thursday, Tesla shares were 6.39% higher in premarket trading.\n\nTesla shareholders have been voting on two resolutions and can have their say up to the company‚Äôs annual meeting on Thursday. The first measure under consideration is whether to green light a $56 billion pay package that shareholders originally approved in 2018, before being voided by a Delaware judge in January.\n\nThe second resolution is whether Tesla should transfer its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. That proposal was put forward after Musk asked his followers on social media platform X earlier this year whether Tesla should carry out such a move ‚Äî to a resounding yes.\n\nMusk now said that both of these resolutions are currently passing by ‚Äúwide margins,‚Äù without disclosing specifics or his sourcing.\n\nCNBC has reached out to Tesla for comment.\n\nThe initial pay package had aggressive targets for Tesla‚Äôs financial performance and market value ‚Äî and, while the company has turned into one of the world‚Äôs largest electric automakers, a lot has changed since 2018.\n\nTesla is facing slowing growth and increased competition, especially from Chinese players. In that time, Musk also bought Twitter, now called X, and has ramped up focus on other projects, including in his brain computer interface firm Neuralink and artificial intelligence company xAI.\n\nCritics of the pay deal argue that Musk is distracted by his other endeavors, and that the package, the largest in U.S. corporate history, is excessive. More recently, they say that Tesla‚Äôs financial performance has not been up to scratch.\n\nSome notable shareholders have said they planned to vote against the deal, and top proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis also recommended this step. The California State Teachers‚Äô Retirement System, a massive pension fund, likewise objected to the package, claiming the sum was too high. Norway‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund has similarly come out in opposition.\n\nShareholders in favor of the compensation argue that Musk is integral to Tesla‚Äôs future success and that the billionaire will take his efforts elsewhere if he is not reimbursed adequately. They claim that the pay package has incentivized Musk.\n\nBillionaire investor and long-time Tesla shareholder Ron Baron said he is voting in favor of the pay package, suggesting that Musk is key to the EV maker‚Äôs future.\n\n‚ÄúAt Baron Capital, our answer is clear, loud, and unequivocal: Tesla is better with Elon. Tesla is Elon,‚Äù he said this month.\n\nSome major investors, such as Vanguard and Blackrock, have meanwhile not said how they will cast their votes.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/elon-musk-says-tesla-shareholders-likely-approved-his-56-billion-pay-deal.html", "id": "1dexrh2", "created_utc": 1718281635.0, "score": 626, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 438, "comments": [{"body": "Curious how this is a catalyst for Tesla stock", "score": 904, "replies": [{"body": "Elon could announce TSLA is liquidating all operations and using the proceeds to build him a personal glass city and the SP would go up", "score": 760, "replies": [{"body": "But would the glass be bulletproof? üòè", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "I like to hike.", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "r/cyberstuck for laughs", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "So, very.", "score": -11, "replies": [{"body": "I like to hike.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": -9, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": -5, "replies": [{"body": "I like to hike.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "You have google lots of people have shot at the car and bullets go through you got this.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "\"effective immediately, I'm liquidating all Tesla assets and inviting my most arduous believers to the temple of rat...

With old school code computers are superhuman at things like planning paths. For example your mapping software can find the best path from point A to point B taking into account a multitude of variables in milliseconds. This is not something humans or neural networks can come remotely close to doing. The problem is that this only works when you can define the problem really well. It doesn't have the general intelligence required to reason about complicated real world scenarios.\n\nModern neural network based AI on the other hand is a huge black box which nobody understands. It's weaker at some things computers are traditionally very good at, but at the end of the day the bitter lesson is that it inevitably surpasses code written by us humans. At the end of the day you need a certain level of general intelligence to achieve full self driving and current neural networks seem to be very close to meet this requirement while old school coding is basically dead in the water.\n\nWaymo of course still uses a lot of neural networks, but the difference is that they're still subordinate to the control code. This lets them deploy their fully autonomous system now, because there are still lines of code which say something like \"if the lidar seems something in front of the car jam the brakes and wait for human intervention\". Current neural network have nowhere close to having that certainty, they still sometimes just derp out completely.\n\nThe TLDR is that Tesla is actually running way ahead because they swallowed this bitter pill early.

This process is called AI inference, which is when a trained AI model applies what it's learned to new data. The model compares the user's query with information it processed during training and stored in its parameters. The response depends on the task, such as identifying spam, transcribing speech, or summarizing a report. The goal of AI inference is to calculate and output an actionable result.\n\nThe cost of inference, or engaging a trained LLM to produce an output, can vary depending on the type of inference and the provider:\n\nQuery volume\nSome providers charge per inference, which can add up quickly in applications with a lot of users. For example, OpenAI charges $0.00665 per query, based on 2,700 input tokens and 1,300 output tokens.\n\nData transfer fees\nThese costs are especially significant in cloud-based deployments and can include data ingress and egress. For example, a company might charge $0.087 per GB for the first 10 TB of egress per month.\n\nType of inference\nThe cost can also vary depending on the type of inference. For example, generating a text completion from a LLM like GPT-4 might cost around $0.006 per 1,000 output tokens and $0.003 per 1,000 input tokens, while generating an image from a large image generation model like DALL-E 2 might cost around $0.18 per image.

These will likely run into the late 2020s or early 2030s. \n* Most of what Mr. Musk discussed today was a recap of ongoing projects that may take years to show economic viability:\n   * Tesla Bot/Optimus began in late 2021\n   * Tesla broke ground on the Megafactory, also in late 2021, and it began production of Megapacks in late 2022\n   * The modern FSD ANN-based vision system first went out to the public as FSD Beta 8, also around 2021.  \n\n  \nMr. Musk seems energized by TSLA shareholder support shown to him at the annual meeting.

In the short term yeh he gives investors a lot of short boosts, but he is too impulsive for long term company health. He really would be awesome as a hype man. \n\nLet me explain my thoughts. Tesla had pretty close to cornered the charger network ecosystem, like wow, this is a huge achievement and that by itself should have been a major focus of the company for long term success and profitability. But then he goes all in and decides to get rid of their entire department because (and this is just from news reporting) the executive in charge of the supercharger department pushed back on making more cuts. Like why isnt their arguably most successful department trying to expand more across the US with more locations, partnerships, new technology, updates and even other markets. Then there is the half assed roll out of the cybertruck, the diminished battery range that is software locked, or the lack of any new passenger models ( the 3 is 7 or 8 years old and the Y is 4 or 5 years old). And where is the full self driving feature that has been promised next month since 2019. Hes a hype man that has been getting by because Tesla cars are far and above what anyone else has in the electric market in spite of him and not because of him. \n\nIf I were in his shoes:\n\n1. Stop promising stuff that isnt ready like FSD until it is actually ready to roll out. Stop building half assed cars for production with  all that new technology/designs (cybertruck). Dont make any crazy announcements unless they are actually ready. \n2. Employ an in house experimental group that just comes out with Tesla concept models, it doesnt need to be anything else other than a group that generates buzz by putting really cool looking bodies over already existing models.  Tesla employees should show up to a high end cars and coffee with a never before seen convertible and just let people oggle over it.  \n3. Figure out how to compartmentalize batteries so that you can replace smaller groups of cells when they fail instead of the whole battery pack, limit those battery compartment costs to $1k so it is somewhat affordable. \n4. Have a continuous plan to refresh each car model every 5 or 6 years so the lineup doesn't get stale, heck it could just be a new body over the continuously update chassis. Have 4 models in the lineup, a pickup, an SUV, a sedan and a cheap sedan. \n5. Introduce a cheap sedan, sub $30k. Have it come with a limited range that is less than the other cars, give it minimal options as a base model. Maybe make it dependent on the tesla charger network instead of home charging. No autopilot, and you can save a ton of design costs by making it only 2wd and based on current models. His pay package can easily cover the cost to create a solid low end car and refresh the rest of the model line. \n6. Prioritize the charger network. There should be a charger in every parking lot and every gas station. you should be able to go to a southerbys or a dollar store and expect to be able to plug in. Then work with every other car company to make sure that they work with the tesla standard chargers.\n7. Challenge BYD in asia. Make a car that will compete in the east. I think china is a lost market because they put their thumb on the scale too much, but make an asian base car that will compete in other asian markets\n\nbut what do I know?

In that presentation, he also noted that 2 percent became an international standard in the inflation targeting era that began in the 1990s.)‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe article is interesting bc they kind of implicitly say, it‚Äôs a random number:\n\nWhy not zero? Or a negative number? \n\nDavid Wheelock, a St. Louis Fed group vice president and deputy director of research, addressed these questions in a 2017 podcast. He acknowledged that there isn‚Äôt a general agreement among economists, but he laid out three arguments that people make for having a positive inflation target‚Ä¶\n\n\nHe basically goes onto state that having 0% inflation doesn‚Äôt stimulate growth and that having some level of inflation gives the fed room to pivot, cut, whatever.\n\n\nSo, it‚Äôs not as if 2% makes no sense at all, it‚Äôs just that there has to be some inflation, but not too much, and 2% is a decent middle ground\n\nLikewise the article discusses the obvious fact that 2% isn‚Äôt a constant goal, it‚Äôs a longer term goal. Having inflation above 2%, or below 2%, it‚Äôs not a big deal, it‚Äôs on a longer term timeframe that they shoot for 2%.\n\n\n\nNow, as far as the remainder, I personally subscribe to the theory that technology, by its very nature, is disinflationary.\n\nI don‚Äôt really think that‚Äôs a debatable point.\n\nAs we become more technologically advanced, having some baseline level of inflation is probably necessary because we are perpetually disinflationary via technological advancement\n\nOf course, someone will come along and talk about printing money, and other inflationary issues, but I‚Äôm speaking in the general sense.\n\nZIRP policies, and the efficacy of those policies:  \n\nthat conversation inevitably leads into ‚Äúmodern monetary theory‚Äù, a topic which is fairly controversial, and itself engenders political biases and other issues that are non-financial.\n\nIts a heavily debated topic with no clear answer imo", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "*This ‚Äúpivot.‚Äù Is it in the room with us now?*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "AI trade reminds me of the telecom bubble at the turn of the century.", "selftext": "Just wanted to share a few thoughts I have related to the current state of the AI buildout and get your feedback.\n\nThe AI buildout reminds me a lot of the late 90s and early 00s when there was a race to build out large telecommunications networks to provide the bandwidth to support all of the new activity that would take place on the rapidly rising technology. \n\nCompanies like Cisco and Lucent went parabolic as a large number of embedded providers (AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, etc) and new entrants (Qwest, Level 3, Global Crossings, etc) received large amounts of capital to build out new IP networks.\n\nThe problem was that the investment in network infrastructure greatly outpaced people‚Äôs ability to monetize it.  It took nearly two decades to absorb the network capacity glut and there were only a couple winners when it was all said and done, with a ton of companies absorbed and destroyed in its wake.  Cisco still hasn‚Äôt reached its all time high over two decades later and Lucent and other equipment providers lost a ton of value and were absorbed as demand for their products declined sharply.  And the winners of the internet buildout were not the companies being touted during the dotcom bubble.\n\nI feel like we‚Äôre in the early stages of a similar cycle.  NVDA is like the telco equipment providers with the added benefit of not having any real competition and there are so many companies rapidly deploying their chips to make sure they get in on the AI game.  I think NVDA will continue to soar until the buildout is complete.  Large companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple are racing to build capacity just like the telecommunications service providers back in the day and there are a bunch of new entrants fighting for mindshare.  Unfortunately no one has really figured out how to monetize the technology yet.\n\nMy prediction is that the AI trade over the next two years will looks like the culmination of the telecommunications bubble.  Huge ramp over the next two years as companies race to build out capabilities, followed by a rapid decline as companies fail to figure out how to monetize the investment.  NVDA will stick around but after it reaches its ATH it will struggle like Cisco did after the capacity glut is reached and the folks that actually figure out how to monetize AI will be different than a lot of the companies that are being bet on now.\n\nTLDR, u think we‚Äôre in the beginning of a bubble due to rapid capacity buildout, followed by a crash when the industry can‚Äôt monetize the technology fast enough to pay back the investment, and then steady growth as the technology matures and new entrants rise on new and unforeseen AI applications.\n\nWhat do you all think?", "id": "1dezbsu", "created_utc": 1718286200.0, "score": 1127, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 650, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 109 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think comparisons to the Dotcom bubble are fair considering it‚Äôs the same people building and investing in these companies, and similar patterns are already emerging. \n\nIn the 90s, the early success of Microsoft leads to a boom in software startups looking to replicate its success.

If the founder of a company has stacked the BOD with people who perjure themselves by attesting to their ability to do their duty to the shareholders, and they intentionally make decisions to benefit the founder at the expense of shareholders, they do not meet the requirements necessary to represent the company for purposes of signing a contract.\n\nNote that I have no idea what the legally or ethically correct outcome is here.
