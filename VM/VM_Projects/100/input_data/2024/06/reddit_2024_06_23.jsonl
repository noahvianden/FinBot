I am by no means an expert but I have been pretty successful in predicting what the market and what certain stocks are going to do and have seen nice returns. Now I am someone who considers myself to be very tech savvy and keeping up with the trends and it wasn’t until this year that my eyes were opened to the true potential and power of AI and what the potential of NVDA is. I am so amazed at everything that I have seen, I sold a lot of my positions and NVDA went from 12% of my portfolio to now 55%. \n\nWhat I’m getting at is that AI hasn’t totally caught on with the general population, but the reality is that AI will eventually be in everything, whether we know it/like it or not. I’m convinced of this 100%. The beauty of AI is that it can be automatically integrated into everything people already know and use on a daily basis without having to try and sell them on a new product. People won’t have to learn how to use a new technology, AI will simply enhance the features already available to them in their phones, computers, tablets, cars, etc. When Jensen Huang said this is a new “Industrial Revolution” he wasn’t kidding and I think this could be the biggest revolution in history.\n\nI came into this decade telling my dad, I think by 2030 we will have seen the largest stock market gains in history and it will tower over previous decades such as the boom we saw in the 90’s. AI can be the catalyst to make this happen. So I’m very bullish over the next 6 years and I would not be surprised if we are extremely underestimating the growth yet to be seen. Everything seems crazy or impossible until it happens. I mean we didn’t even have a trillion dollar company until when? 2018? Now we have 3 companies hovering around $3T? In a span of 5-6 years?

Fast forward 16.5 years and I can say getting into trading is literally the most pivotal aspect of my professional career. \n\nWhile most of my peers are just starting to hit their earnings stride trying to buy their first house, I’m in an extremely fortunate scenario due to two primary things: saving like an absolute mad man through my late 20s and trading options. \n\nThat being said, it’s important to review things logically. My path is objectively uncommon and the product of extremely hard work (I’ve spent over 30,000 hours trading and analyzing markets) crossed with luck.\n\nThe absolute best piece of advice I can give you is exactly what I’d tell myself:\n1. You’re not going to trade your current account into your future wealth. This point serves two purposes: to slow things down (you’re not losing any time by learning properly) and to orient you on the right focus - the skillset which will ultimately sustain your path to wealth vs the early outcome of a small account. \n2. There is NO substitute for aggressively saving, literally as much as humanely possible, in your early 20s. This up front sacrifice lays the foundation of your initial capital to invest. \n3. Papertrade. See point 1. Taking the time to truly learn the products is absolutely vital. They’re complex and regardless of how smart someone is, or how many hours they try to cram learning into a day, there’s a reality about learning intricate tools like these. Papertrading serves as incredible practical application & since I’m sure you’re smarter than I was you’d immediate start a trading log so you can maintain a live dataset from the very beginning. This also limits unnecessary drawdowns on your principal which early on can massively slow down your longterm growth. \n4. Develop the right trading mindset. To be successful as a trader, you have to wear many hats. There’s no supervisor or boss to make sure you’re doing the right things. A Bayesian approach is essential. And please, don’t be lured around by the one off stories of a person here or there that make it huge on a single trade. Those instances happen, but for each successful case there are hundreds of blown accounts. You can choose to try to hit the lottery, or you can adopt a slower but higher probability outcome. \n\nTrading in general (options happened to be the primary vector for me) can literally be life changing but it’s not fast easy money by any means. I grew up poor with a single mom that worked multiple jobs and now live a very comfortable life in my early 30s. I was just talking with my mom yesterday about renovations she wants to do on her house which she can afford because of me.

Trading is a long journey that will take time to develop your own process to limit risk while maximizing returns. \n\nOptions isn’t dangerous when you understand the risks surrounding the position and Greeks to determine if the trade is worth getting into. It’s essential you learn TA to understand how each security works - as each one moves differently but tells a story.

Liquid assets have the volume and OI to support stop use vs illiquid assets like memes which halt numerous times and skip stops for the ultimate in rug pulls. \n\nIf you’d like to get the increased leverage of options while sticking to stocks - trade leveraged ETFs like SOXL which is a 3X bull chip ETF, or SQQQs which is a 3X short Q stock. \n\nA solid move to learn more is to join a community of fellow traders to learn strategies for options day or swing trading - and I hate to say it’s not gonna be on Reddit. \n\nThere are plenty of really good (and bad) trading discords out there that focus on different styles (squeeze, scalps, day trades, swings) that you can benefit from to learn your particular process, trading style, and risk tolerance to really optimize how options work for you. \n\nPaper trading is great in theory but doesn’t account for the emotional aspect when taking real trades. \n\nNever takes trades because of bias, or news, or what you read based on someone else’s emotional bias. “We’re gonna squeeze.

Those emotional tickers will lead you down a pathway to losses vs taking a trade based on what the chart is telling you. \n\nCharts do not lie and once you apply technical analysis when forming a thesis - options aren’t dangerous at all.

They need to be bound by laws of logic when connecting facts (sometimes they even change the meaning of what you told it when asked to repeat/summarize it, e.g. if there's too much text or it's not written in simple form).\n\n> Video/Image Generation - Will reduce costs of CGI and marketing material, maybe even costs of hiring actors in the future.\n\nAt current stages not at all. It may help in creating 3D models, but you you can't even get it to generate an image of what you want (it's always different and there's no way to tell it exactly what you want); let alone the generated images are distorted if look closely (same with LLM generated text — overall looks good, but individual facts may be made up)\n\n> Support - Will entirely eliminate the need for humans in customer support\n\nAgain — currently? No way, unless you mean something simple like ordering food over the phone. I don't see an LLM being deployed as tech or banking support. There's simply too much at stake while it's impossible to know if a) it says something completely stupid or b) it straight up „lies” while being confident in its answer.\n\n> Surveillance and Security - Will reduce the costs and need of so many police patrols by using AI in CCTV\n\nI could agree with that\n\n> Healthcare - Will reduce the need for so many general practitioners and help in finding new drugs\n\nReplacing doctors? I don't see it (see above arguments). Finding new drugs? Definitely.\n\n> Finance - Since we're on wall street bets, neural networks will replace (or have already replaced) most algo trading with more efficient and more profitable bots\n\nWhat do you think algo trading is? Tons of rules for simple indicators? No, they've been deploying machine learning for a long time. You could call it AI but it's simply specialized ML models; nothing even remotely resembling „intelligence” (in the same way you don't — I assume — call the YouTube algorithm an AI, just because it uses some neural networks — or other deep learning methods — and is good at recommending videos to you)\n\n> Self Driving - pretty self explanatory, will eliminate a bunch of more jobs\n\nWe're yet to see how it turns out. Maybe it'll never be good enough to drive fully autonomously and a driver will have to be present at all times.\n\n> Analytics - AI is very good at pattern recognition and will improve analytics in a bunch of scenarios by prediction of demand and supply and optimisation of distribution in energy, agriculture, manufacturing etc.\n\nSure, machine learning has been used for that for a long time\n\n> \"AI\" is not just a chatbot, it doesn't need to understand human language to achieve great things (see AlphaFold).\n\nMost of what you've described has already been possible before the AI boom (it's just deep learning).\n\nThe AI we're talking about here is the models that people believe could really be generally intelligent; the ones that the speculation is based on (mostly LLMs).\n\nYou don't need thousands of H100s or B100s for even advanced deep learning algorithms; those are needed for huge LLMs.\n\nCompare your AlphaFold (a specialized deep learning model; 90M parameters, 7 days training time; $15k cost) example with e.g. ChatGPT-4 (an LLM; ~1.5T parameters;  several months training time; > $100M cost).\n\nThe AI boom (especially for Nvidia) started with OpenAI. Sure, for what it's worth you can call AlphaFold an AI (I'd say it's more an ML model; however I don't want to get into a logomachy here). But it's not the kind of AI we're discussing here.\n\nOnly speculation on LLMs (and derivatives, or similarly huge models) makes the corporations spend billions on those Nvidia GPUs. And until we can be sure of their answers, they're pretty much useless for anything meaningful.\n\n> it doesn't need to understand human language to achieve great things\n\n> It doesn't even need to fully eliminate a job, just increasing efficiency and reducing the workforce is plenty to make a huge profit.\n\nIf it doesn't understand human language then it's presumably a small model, i.e. it doesn't need thousands of H100s (a simple cloud server with A100s/V100s would be enough).

Why do you think this hardware is being bought, it's to improve what is currently available and take it 10 steps further...\n\nThe point is, those solutions may have an upper boundary.\n\nWe'd like to think that throwing more and more compute into ChatGPT or whatever will make it smarter (and eventually turn it into something like AGI), but if fundamental problems aren't fixed (e.g. hallucinations, lack of fact checking/answer validation, inability to make the model adhere to the laws of logic in its answers), it may turn out to be a complete waste of resources. The model architecture needs to be developed first.\n\nAnd your argument („in the future...”) is as valuable as „in 6 months we'll have reached the limit. Why? Because I predict so”, i.e. both are worthless. It's pure speculation that has little to do with what's currently available.\n\n> Why web dev? Because it's full of repetitive tasks that an LLM can handle and in 99% of web development you're not making anything new and you're not coming up with new solutions to new problems.\n\nI see creating a function or two with the help of an assistant, but it won't create a separate feature that could be seamlessly into the codebase (I mean, it could, but you never know if it's done right or not, unless you go through its solution step by step). It's hard to get it to work with larger projects.\n\nBy the way, again, the question here isn't about whether the models are useful, but whether it's worth to spend billions for the latest hardware. My answer is still *no*, because once a closed source model is trained, many open source alternatives emerge, so people can still reap the benefits without having to pay e.g. for GitHub copilot subscription (let alone dozens of others) — there are fewer subscribers, and the revenue is decreasing.\n\n> Have you seen the progress in video generation, look up Sora and compare it to what we had 1-2 years ago...\n\nYes, I did. Even OpenAI's demo with a woman walking the street had obvious glitches (e.g. at certain point the woman floated instead of walking).\n\n> It’s just a matter of time before it nails CGI.\n\nIt doesn't mean it'll scale at least linearly though. Again, you're purely speculating here.\n\nIt's cool that you can generate a video of dogs playing in the snow, but it doesn't mean you'll be able to make actual quality content that way.\n\nMaybe we'll see tons of AI generated movies, all of which will be completely shitty, yet the average consumer will get used to it. It'll be the beginning of the end as far as cultural taste is concerned (it's kind of beginning already with TikTok — and social media in general — and its algorithm recommending videos to make people scroll into oblivion).\n\n> Chatbots handle a ton of queries that used to need a human.\n\nExample of industry where it's used? Unless it's ready-made questions and answers, companies are skeptical of chatbots.\n\n> As AI improves, it’ll cover more ground.\n\nAgain, the *what if...*\n\n> AI can analyze medical data way faster than a human, freeing up doctors for more critical tasks.\n\nLLMs aren't (for the most part) needed for that (and they're the biggest models out there). Regular ML models are orders of magnitude smaller and can be trained within days using simple GPUs in the cloud.\n\n> ML has been used in analytics, but AI is making it way more accurate. It’s about better predictions and optimizations, saving time and money in energy, ag, and manufacturing.\n\nUh, any example? What do you mean by AI here, because I'm still not sure — as I've told you several times, those ML models are tiny in comparison to e.g. ChatGPT-4, and they don't need as much compute. So what kind of AI are we talking about?\n\n> You’re splitting hairs. Whether it's a huge LLM or a specialized model\n\nNo, the issue here if spending billions on the hardware is worth it. It started after ChatGPT was out and it's for the most part used to train and run LLMs (which aren't that useful; your arguments cover specialized ML models, which don't require the newly bought hardware, so they're irrelevant here).\n\n> AI is driving innovation and the bigger its data gets the more expensive it is to train.\n\nNot sure what you're trying to prove here. The costs to train AlphaFold are *4 orders of magnitude* smaller than to train ChatGPT. So why do we need thousands of H100s if a few A100s in the cloud will do?\n\n> All in all, you seem way too focused on what is currently available right now for you to use and not what is the intention of these companies and how much we can progress these what's essentially tech demos\n\nNo, I just realize that there are certain limitations to LLMs (which are what those companies are investing in; other models don't need so much money to be trained/run).\n\n> If we had your mindset then why would we ever progress beyond the 90s level of internet technology? \n\nWhat mindset? I'm amazed by e.g. AlphaZero or AlphaFold, but they were created *before* the spending spree.\n\nThey don't need nearly as much compute as what the money is being spent on (well, AlphaZero may be an exception, but it uses reinforcement learning, which in itself takes a long time to train the model, and doesn't always lead to the best results. AI for more concrete — and real-world — problems isn't that costly).\n\nYou're still seem to be defending a completely different point, i.e. „AI is relevant” which isn't what we're talking about.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "That's called implied volatility", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "rn there is an equation which looks like this: more compute = better AI.

UPS drivers make $120,000-$200,000 with no college required, excellent pension and full medical benefits….\n\nPoint I’m trying to make is, the teamsters are unionizing the warehouse workers not the drivers. Amazon drivers are third party contractors. For example if you get hit and killed by an Amazon sprinter van or package car your family  won’t sue Amazon itself, you’d sue the third party contractor who was in charge of that driver. \n\nBecause there’s a disconnect between Amazon drivers and the division the teamsters are unionizing, I don’t believe the unionization push will be as damaging as some people think UNTIL this push includes drivers particularly the Class A (big rig) drivers.\n\nBy the time Amazon loses the battle to the IBT and has all its warehouse shops unionized, AI and its AWS services will far outstrip / outpace the damage done from unions.\n\nThere’s also different tiers of union - for example at UPS we get paid $45 an hour but often get overtime roughly 67 an hour. We pay very very little for full medical for our entire family and the medical insurance is insanely good. Copays are $0 or $5 for almost everything. \n\nPension? Work 10 years as a driver and get $3,000 a month. Work 30 years (average for a UPS driver) you’re looking at $9,000 a month until you die. (In addition to 401K / Social Security etc.)\n\nMcKesson is also part of our union right down the street from us. When I used to deliver there as a package car driver they’d tell me how their medical and pension was garbage. \n\nSo furthermore, just because the union and UPS has negotiated good benefits and pay it doesn’t mean doom and gloom for Amazon stockholders - there is a different caliber to which a company will be unionized.\n\nEven as a member of the union that’s attempting to bring Amazon into the fold, I am very bullish on Amazon.", "score": 93, "replies": [{"body": "Just want to clarify something.
