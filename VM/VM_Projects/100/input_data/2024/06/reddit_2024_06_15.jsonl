There was no stimulus behind that, artificial stimulus per se. So this is new. This has never happened,\" Dent said on Tuesday. \"What do you do if you want to cure a hangover? You drink more. And that's what they've been doing.\"\n\n\"Flooding the economy with extra money forever might actually enhance the overall economy long-term. But we'll only see when we see this bubble burst,\" he added.¬† \"And again, this bubble has been going 14 years. Instead of most bubbles \\[going\\] five to six, it's been stretched higher, longer. So you'd have to expect a bigger crash than we got in 2008 to '09.\"\n\n  \nInterested to know what you all think about this. I have also been seeing people go into other financial forums I have been in and saying the same thing. Apparently the signs will start to show themselves in late March 2025. I found it interesting that the CEO of Nvidia is set to cash out 700 million in Nvidia stock right around that time. Maybe it's a coincidence?
