I have posted this before I and think it needs to be said again so here goes:\n\nOne thing that I keep in mind is that Nvidia did a 4-1 split in June 2021 and the stock was trading around 800.00 at that time. The stock split and the stock traded around 195.00 and then rose up to 329.00 in November of that year. All the experts were saying that as a result of the split the returns that had been gained in the past would no longer be possible as a result of the split.¬† Nvidia then started a slow decline over the next 12 months going down as far as 112.00 in October of 2022.¬† It began a steady climb back over the 2023 and reaching close to 500.00 at the end of the year. 2024 saw the stock continue its climb hitting 942.00 in March 2024 before dropping to 762.00 April 2024. From April 2024 to June the stock climbed to over 1200.00 and then we see the 10-1 split. I have said all this time point out that Nvidia is an anomaly and seems to deviate from the common rule of the stock market and her \"experts\". Nvidia is not a normal company and does not have a normal run of the mill CEO. Jensen Huang is a visionary and has directed this company with a surgical precision that is so rare in the corporate world that it borders on the mythical.¬† While there is plenty of pundits shouting that Nvidia will no longer deliver the great returns it provided pre-split, I see the opposite and a company with a proven track record, a business model that is innovated and forward thinking along with a product and technology that will take years for competitors to catch up to. I see Nvidia performing as well if not better for the foreseeable future and I am buckled in for the ride!¬†¬†", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Classic strategy of buying highs", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Stop thinking short term and think long term.

AI was supposed to free us from pointless tasks, and give us freedom to focus on the creative pursuits.  What jobs are going first?!?!?  Literally the last jobs we ever thought it cpuld take.  Art.  In all it's forms.  Writers.  Animation.  Painting.  Should people laying pipe in the ground be worried?  Nope.  AI ain't digging ditches anytime soon.\n\nWe thought the internet would free people from misinformation and propaganda for fucks sake.  We thought the internet could just shit gold.  Turns out that's not how economies work, and we keep making this bet all the time throughout history.  \n\nI mean, look at VISA, or Ford.  For fucks sake, visa is a God damned money printer of a business model.  It's infinite money... why does it's share price(market cap) not reflect this.  And cars... people buy them everywhere all the time.  Should be a God damned money printer.  How many of NVDAs chips did you buy?  \n\nI'm not saying NVDA is a bad investment.  I'm telling you pay attention.  It's hype.  It always is.  Eventually someone isn't willing to pay more for those shares, infinite growth is not possible.  There will come a time when people realize they aren't willing to pay for  a lifetime of priced in growth (that's the upper limit, if there IS one).  Once you start pricing in too much future, that's a lot of uncertainty.  All of this is essentially what makes it a \"bubble.\"\n\nI know you'd like to claim that a conflict or semiconductor metal shortage doesn't apply to its fundamentals, but it does.  \n\nAnd here, for me personally is the ultimate reason it's not different this time:  People are greedy.

That downward pressure would be mitigated - at least in part - by upward pressure in the U.S.\n\nLong term, however, is very interesting. The EU recently signalled an intent to investigate multiple potential breaches of the DMA. The DMA permits fines of up to $1B per day for non-compliance in Apple‚Äôs case, and/or 20% of global revenue for individual breaches. There is no technical reason to prevent third party access to at least some of these new features, which means Apple is attempting to sway public opinion by maliciously denying access to new features. Which is *not* a breach of the DMA.  Both sides have therefore signalled an escalation in the conflict, and both sides have enormous stakes to win and lose. If Apple loses, they must permit third party developers to distribute their apps to customers without notarisation or fees. This could meaningfully dent Apple‚Äôs App Store revenue in the EU. *That* would hurt their stock price and growth. It also wouldn‚Äôt end with the EU.

So AI has a big future, but the conditions on the ground in Summer 2024 is that investors are not taking into account that those who are buying all these AI units are going to run into a wall.  The wall is the ROI in terms of the size of the markets they are actually able to use the units to supplant in the near-time window.  That reaction will make it back to the stock.
