Simple thing to remember is that nobody in this thread has ever made 200 billion dollars ever. The biggest critics are the least accomplished. I first started looking to invest in Tesla in 2018. People were saying the exact same things then and they were obviously wrong. Nothings really changed. Tesla remains an excellent company with excellent growth prospects and proven leadership who's stock is in a tug of war between musks hyperbull simps and delusional musk haters. When you filter through the noise... Energy division is growing quickly and likely to be catapulted by increases in energy demand due to data centers and EV's, FSD improvements are becoming more rapid with end-to-end training, pretty much everyone is investing in humanoid robots and Tesla has an edge with manufacturing, news on cheaper vehicles and robotaxi is coming out shortly, Tesla semi's have been ramping up quietly, charging infrastructure is going to be a great revenue source as EV's are adopted more, Tesla will have other cloud-type opportunities with the insane compute they've been investing in, and tesla solar roofs are still a long term play imo. It is extremely common for companies that are in between major stages of growth to get dragged by the mainstream, but frankly i don't care about quarterly vehicle sales and short term hurdles.\n\nHonestly the negative press on musk is mostly noise. He is a little childish in ways and does say stupid stuff from time to time on twitter, but half of his negative image is just the result of the clickbait economy. The majority of the time if you actually listen to him in long-form interview when he's \"talking shop\" rather than being antagonized he's very well collected, extremely bright and knowledgeable about what he's doing, and it's clear that he is executing major plans as he's always done.\n\nThe real question with Tesla is what is your timeline and what is your risk tolerance. There are surely safer stocks and the timeline for Tesla growth may be a long one. But i think people are frankly delusional if they don't think that Musk is going to make more money. The man probably has the most productive business portfolio of anyone alive.

{"title": "Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund", "selftext": "KEY POINTS\n\n* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.\n\n\n\n[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).\n\nThe index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n\nAll three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.\n\nThat is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.\n\n  \nThe race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.\n\nThe XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.\n\nThe big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.\n\n“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.\n\nThe fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.\n\nThe free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.\n\n“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.\n\nThe rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n\nOn Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html)", "id": "1di3gla", "created_utc": 1718644552.0, "score": 516, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 136, "comments": [{"body": "I guess it makes sense to do this change, but having so much of your fund in a company that is in a really cyclical industry and after a historic run-up is kind of scary.\n\nIf you can wait out any volatility then it could be quite rewarding in the long run.

{"title": "The crash is coming and oh yes it's gonna be a big one", "selftext": "Every stock market bubble has been the same. Human psychology is one of the seven wonders of the world because through centuries and centuries, people truly never learn. \"This time it's different,\" \"the market will never go down again\", \"those old fundamentals don't matter anymore\", \"printer go brrrr.\" Every \"investor\" of the last 15 years (basically anyone under 40) has never even seen a true bear market in stocks or real estate and has absolutely no clue the carnage that is coming. \n\nWe just saw quantitative easing and 15 years of zero interest rate policy, something never done before. The madness of this decision still escapes me. Alan Greenspan, who was largely blamed for too much of an \"easy monetary policy\" that created both the dot com bubble of 2000 AND GFC of 2008, didn't even come near the absolutely INSANE and irresponsible levels of easy monetary conditions of the last 15 years. The economy was flooded with money and loans flowed like milk and honey. And people really thought there would be no consequences? Both asset and consumer price inflation went through the fucking roof. There's no other way to put it. We will look back on this time in 5-10 years after the dust settles and wonder how the fuck this was allowed to happen. \n\nHowever, this easy monetary period is now history and we are staring down the barrel of the very first ever legit campaign of QT, something never seen before. They tried it in 2017 and bitched out because of how poorly the market reacted. This no longer becomes an option due to the high and stubborn inflation we have now (by the way, I don't think inflation is truly going anywhere, i.e. meaningfully and sustainably below 2%, until the Fed absolutely curb stomps the economy and sucks trillions more out of the system. Either that or the economy and banking system completely shit the bed dealing with the higher for longer rates).\n\nAlmost every fundamental valuation metric is at all time highs (or just below the all time highs of the dot com bubble). P/E, price/sales, market cap/GDP are all at eye watering levels. Point is, fundamentals ALWAYS matter in the end. Always. It has always been the case and the market has always come back to reality, whether it was the dutch tulip bulb crisis, the crash of 29, or the dot com bubble. The recession/crash usually happens when most people become bullish again (this is currently happening in nearly every sentiment survey today). \n\nI think the big one is right around the corner. One last fun consideration: the QQQ hit a GFC low of 25.74 on March 9th 2009, just over 15 years ago. On Friday, it reached a new all time high of 479.19. Please let this sink in for the people in the back....A major index is up over 1700% in just over 15 years and averaged an annual return of greater than 21%/year during that period. Be aware, this return doesn't even include dividends. \n\nIf it instead generated a very solid 10%/year over that time, it'd be sitting at 107.52 representing a drop of 78% from today's price. Mind you, during crashes indexes tend to become overly cheap (not fair priced) as emotions and momentum tend to dictate movement on either end of extremes (too bullish or too bearish). \n\nI reiterate my stance that major indices could lose 60-70%+ before the next secular bull market. Possibly more. Jokers like NVDA that sit at over 40X price/sales will become absolutely steam rolled and lose 80-90% or more. You think the FOMO buying was crazy investor behavior, just wait until people start making mad dashes for the exit. The fact that a bunch of brainless, misguided retail investors can sell in an instant with the push of a button should be very very frightening. We aren't just in a new era of investing, we are in a new era of panic selling. We will learn just how crazy investor psychology is when the circuit breakers start rolling back in 🚨 🚨 🚨 \n\nThe time of the bear is nearly upon us 🐻🐻🐻 I have no doubt SPY will be back under 200 before all is said and done and i can't wait to buy in the firesale that is coming 📉📉📉", "id": "1dhn600", "created_utc": 1718589696.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "num_comments": 202, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 442 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/ow00s2vzh17d1.jpeg?width=784&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de778e0c85653c2abce30951b632e7c866e340b8\n\nK, gonna buy more calls", "score": 258, "replies": [{"body": "Made my day.

Because I don't have the whole portfolio in NVDA.\n\nA few things to get out of the way in case people ask\n\nPortfolio now is about  \n\\~3M in different ETF, QQQM, VOO, SCHD, etc  \n\\~1M in SNSXX which is a treasury based money market fund  \n\\~500K in other individual stocks, also heavy on tech (AAPL, MSFT, TSMC mostly)  \n\\~5.5M in NVDA\n\nI think the discord on NVDA here is too extreme, either that it will tank immediately or that it will moon immediately.  I think the answer is more nuanced.  It is actually now at a point that it is very difficult to say which way the stock will go.  \n\nBull's case:  \n- Blackwell will change the game from selling GPU to selling whole solution.  This has potentially the largest immediate bump in financial in the next 2Q.  I think it will be apparent in Aug's guidance to see if there is some real crazy guide coming out or not.  This is probably the most concrete immediate bull case.  \n- AI is real, there is no way the big players will try to save money to lose the race.  This does not only include CSP.  Enterprise and Nation States will need to get in ASAP too.  \n- There are other real long shot also where AI break through actually enable new market.  Medical research vastly boosted by AI.  Actual FSD being massively adapted and NVDA's automotive business take off drastically.\n\nBear's case:  \n- Competition catching up, NVDA's moat (TCO) lose strength  \n- Actual recession to slow down NVDA's customer's spending  \n- Taiwan and War\n\nWith this comparison I would like to think that bull's case has more chance to play out.  However Are we going to see massive upside like what we had in the last 18 months?  Not unless market goes really irrational.  And I am not sure if I would like that.
