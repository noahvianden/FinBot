Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Thursday that his company’s Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that.\n\nMusk, who characterized himself as “pathologically optimistic” at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a “new chapter” in its life, but is about to write an entirely “new book.” Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.\n\nTesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event, trotting out a dancer in a unitard that looked like a sleek, androgynous robot.\n\nIn January, Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous, but were rather being operated with humans at the controls.\n\nAt the shareholder event on Thursday, Musk didn’t divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars. They could cook or clean for you, do factory work, or even teach your children, Musk suggested.\n\nAs for shareholder value, Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla’s market cap to $25 trillion someday.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory, Musk promised Tesla would move into “limited production” of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year.\n\nThe company, he predicted, will have “over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla” in 2025.\n\nThis is all far-out stuff even for Musk, who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don’t pan out — from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self-driving vehicle with an upload, to EV battery swapping stations.\n\nGetting to a $25 trillion market cap would mean that Tesla would be worth about eight times Apple’s value today. The iPhone maker is currently the world’s biggest company by market cap, just ahead of Microsoft.\n\nAt Thursday’s close, Tesla was valued at about $580 billion, making it the 10th most valuable company in the S&P 500.\n\nMusk didn’t provide a timeframe for reaching $25 trillion. He did say that autonomous vehicles could get the company to a market cap of $5 trillion to $7 trillion.\n\nMusk said he agreed with numbers from long-time Tesla bull Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest. This week, ARK put a $2,600 price target on Tesla’s stock by 2029, betting on a commercial robotaxi business that the company has yet to enter.\n\nWood’s price target equals a market cap for Tesla of over $8 trillion.\n\nMusk’s comments at the annual meeting followed the shareholder vote to reinstate the CEO’s $56 billion pay plan, five months after a Delaware court ordered the company to rescind the package. The crowd cheered when the proposal was read aloud, and when preliminary results were announced.\n\nTaking the stage following the readout of the shareholder votes, Musk said, “I just want to start off by saying hot d---! I love you guys.”\n\nTesla shares have dropped 27% this year as the company reckons with a sales decline that’s tied in part to an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China. The company has also implemented steep layoffs. Musk has encouraged investors to look past the current state of the business and more toward a future of autonomous driving, robots and artificial intelligence.\n\nAmong his boldest claims on Thursday was Musk’s declaration that Tesla had advanced so far in developing silicon that it’s surpassed Nvidia when it comes to inference, or the process that trained machine learning models use to draw conclusions from new data.\n\nNvidia shares have soared almost nine-fold since the end of 2022, driven by demand for its AI chips. The company is now worth about $3.2 trillion.\n\nOne concern swirling around Musk is his focus on Tesla given all of his other commitments. He owns and runs social media company X, is CEO of SpaceX, and founded The Boring Co. and Neuralink. He launched another startup, xAI, in March last year and the company recently raised $6 billion in venture funding.\n\nMusk was asked by a shareholder at the meeting how important he is, personally, to the future of Tesla.\n\n“I’m a helpful accelerant to that future,” he said, emphasizing his role in innovation.\n\nHe said that, when it comes to humanoid robots, other companies, including tech startups, are going after the market. Competitors include Boston Dynamics, Agility, Neura and Apptronik.\n\n“What really matters is, can we be much faster than everyone else and our product be done a few years before theirs and be better,” Musk said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/elon-musk-says-optimus-robots-could-make-tesla-25-trillion-company-.html", "id": "1dfg8h3", "created_utc": 1718331774.0, "score": 530, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 455, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1433, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 492, "replies": [{"body": "Rubbing his hands together to dump the $56 billion worth of stock he's about to receive.", "score": 181, "replies": [{"body": "He has to hold for 5 years I believe", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "He can sell his existing shares while holding those newly received stocks.

So yes, now they're multimillionaires but they're not the type of people to just quit and retire in their 30s or 40s. If they leave, they're likely quitting to start something new or join another start up.\n\n•\t⁠Most of these tech companies are in expensive ass areas. NVIDIA for example is in the bay area which can fetch a few million dollars for a basic house. Maybe their stock options turned into $5 mil and then they buy a nice house for $4 mil, bought a new car, etc. Seems crazy for the average person in Ohio but I can see them running through it quickly after high taxes in California. \n\n•\t⁠Lifestyle inflation along with their personal networks. Sure you made $10 million, but that's a small fish in the big pond of silicon valley. Your coworker has $15 million. Your ex coworker at Google has $20 million. Your new neighbor in your multi million dollar neighborhood has $50 million and is your boss. Maybe you could move to Ohio and retire at 35 but if you're in that kind of situation to begin with I'm sure you're just even more motivated to keep working.\n\n•\t⁠These people also just like their jobs. You're not working at an insurance company making phone calls all day. You're working for THEE fastest growing company and making history. You have a great CEO and their company is built very well where you don't deal with 100 levels of management and if you have any seniority you're only a few levels away from talking/working with the CEO.

The original film was a significant technological accomplishment back at the turn of the 21st century, but today it's a 4K upscale of a movie originally rendered at around 900p resolution with asset quality which was characteristic of its day. To put it bluntly as possible, it has not aged well at all technically. I think my PS5 is able to render in realtime with better quality than this film looks. It doesn't look bad or anything, but today it's no better than your average video game cutscene in appearance.\n\nSo the film today has to stand on something other than it's technical merits, and let's just say this movie bombed for a reason. It is basically a deeply boring and nearly incoherent 1 hour and 45 minutes long video game cutscene. Despite its relatively short length, it felt much longer than it actually was because of how boring it is. The script is awful, the dialogue is awful, and the voice acting is wooden and awful. Alec Baldwin actually put his best foot forward as the male lead, but Ming-Na sounded like she was reading the script and bored to tears while internally laughing at the garbage she was reading off the script pages. \n\nThis movie ultimately cost so much and bombed so badly that it not only bankrupted Square Pictures after only 1 film, it financially destroyed the parent company Squaresoft which is what forced the merger to create the modern company Square Enix in Japan. Suffice it to say that it was not worth it. This movie sucked on almost every imaginable level, and honestly the script would be rejected and laughed at if it were proposed for a Final Fantasy video game. To actually have spent the kind of money they did on making it into a movie is astounding levels of hubris.\n\nFinal rating: I don't have a number that can go that low out of 10", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Chuck Cook posted his first impressions of Supervised FSD 12.4.1 earlier today: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzulqSvJxI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzulqSvJxI)\n\nI haven't had a chance to watch the video yet.

Most importantly if you look at the US car industry Tesla has the highest automotive gross margins (even after cutting prices) even compared to ICE vehicles. Most of the legacy auto are currently getting their margins from financing (although it looks like Tesla is moving into this as well so they will have more debt moving forward).\n\nAlso at the moment Tesla isn’t paying a cut to dealers.\n\nThen Tesla has a massive cost advantage with the hardware for charging stations and the reliability. Their charging stations are so good that the other car companies (their competitors) are switching to their charging standard.\n\nThey are also building and designing their own batteries and building their own end to end supply chain for mining the materials for batteries and increasing their ability to recycle. As a reference the market cap of CATL is $100B alone.\n\nFinally Tesla Energy is growing and again if you believe in the Decarbonization push where solar, wind and other intermittent renewables will take up a larger portion of the energy mix their energy business has the potential to be massive.

{"title": "You don't understand AI hype", "selftext": "I have been a lurker on WSB for some time *(ignore the account age)*, despite my lack of activity, and I’ve noticed a recent uptick in posts discussing AI hype and how it’s surely a bubble ready to pop. This is obviously due in large part to the recent NVDA explosion, but there’s more to consider.\n\nWhile you guys spend most of your time focused on the money and investments side of AI, I spend my time focused on the technology itself – and the beliefs that seem to emanate from it.\n\nLet’s look at NVDA. Right now, NVDA is making its mark on the world almost entirely due to its ability to produce and supply cutting edge GPUs for companies looking to fashion larger and larger clusters and have more compute than any reasonable person could possibly fathom. Surely, this ends at some point, right? Surely, the people in charge realize that they’ve built large enough GPU clusters *(never mind the hundreds of billions recently committed to building the largest datacenters on the planet by the likes of Google and Microsoft)* and Jensen stops getting orders. Surely, this ends.\n\nA lot of people have been comparing AI hype to the dot com bubble of the early 2000s, which seems to be a fair comparison on a surface level. However, this misses something so fundamentally different about AI today that it almost entirely invalidates it.\n\nWhether you think AI is real or a scam or a stochastic parrot or whatever, the people in charge *(Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, etc)* believe 100% that this is one of the final pieces of technology mankind will ever create. They believe that the first company that creates AGI *(artificial general intelligence – typically defined as an AI that can do any task as well as the average person)* will be the first company to create ASI *(artificial superintelligence – typically defined as an AI that is smarter than every single living human being put together)* and will end up deciding the future. And they believe this is going to happen in ten to fifteen years.\n\nIf this seems silly to you, I don’t blame you. Technology typically doesn’t move especially fast or change too much over short amounts of time. It’s not like a refrigerator purchased today is a wildly different beast than one purchased fifty years ago. Sure, it might be more efficient and have more room, but fundamentally it’s the same technology.\n\nThis is how life has been ever since the industrial revolution: a new technology is invented, distributed, and then refined over the next 50 years until it basically asymptotes.\n\nThat is not what is happening with AI, and it isn’t what is going to happen in the future. Progress is being made at a blistering rate. People who aren't constantly paying attention to every single development and published paper have no idea what's going on. They just wake up one day and go \"Oh wow look at that, AI can just make videos and music out of nowhere. This must be something that was developed overnight and is a magical thing that can only happen once or twice in my life. Any discussion about further development is silly and just hype!\"\n\nWhether you like it, believe it, or even choose to acknowledge it, AI isn’t in a hype bubble this time. It’s easy enough to look back at the last half-century and see AI’s previous bubble bursts, but those were due in large part to the technology itself being substandard. It’s hard to make ASI when your supercomputer has less computing power than the first iPhone in 2007. This is why today’s companies are pouring what seems like an unreasonable and unjustifiable amount of money into buying GPUs – and why they will continue to. Everyone has realized that compute is all you need.\n\nWhether or not this ends up making “god in a box” isn’t especially important. What is important is that the companies trying to do it aren’t going to stop anytime soon. The risk/reward on trying to build the final thing mankind will ever build is so astronomically skewed that it’s hardly even a consideration. The reward for success is so vast that it makes the cost of failure *(a few hundred billion dollars)* seem insignificant.\n\nI’m not trying to sell you on NVDA or MSFT or anything like that, I’m just trying to let you know what’s actually going on. You can’t sit there and say “I looked on the internet and saw a tech bubble from before I was born, that must mean this is the same thing!” because that makes you wrong. You fundamentally misunderstand what’s happening in tech right now if you think this is going to follow conventional patterns.

Most of the clients are extremely reluctant to adopt Generative AI, citing legislation, liability, client privacy and so on.

Every knowledge worker will not be replaced in the next 5 years.  AGI will not teach us how to finally crack the nuclear fusion code as soon as it poops out of the server farm.  People should not stop studying law, medicine, or computer science.\n\nAI has been more intelligent than humans in specific domains already for like 20 years.  The recent development is we found a bunch of ways to expand the parameters into new areas where AI wasn't previously able to compete with humans but it now is.  The issue, the capitalist market doesn't buy intelligence, it buys products, and products are functions of a whole bunch of different aspects, some of which are extremely human because they innately capture individuality, family, and taste.  An AI will be very unlikely to ever write a better cookbook than a human can.  An AI is unlikely to ever give a better massage than a human can.  An AI will never be a better childcare worker than a human will.  They might become important and valuable assistants in those tasks, but they won't do a good job by themselves.  It's not that intuitive at first glance, but there are so many areas in most professions where this human understanding of the experience of being human is essential to be completely successful when ultimately products are being sold to humans.\n\nThe other issue is that AI is getting more expensive as it gets smarter.  It's very easy to accidentally piss away a million dollars having generative art AI generate billions of entirely useless copies of the same image.  The sheer compute power required to run these things is insane in comparison to what we're used to in computing.  Asking an AI the answer to \"what is 2+2\" is roughly ten trillion times more expensive than doing the same function on a calculator, and this is, to some degree, getting worse, not better.  There are some solutions to this issue, but it takes a lot of work to build a lower cost and higher speed AI that performs some specific function as well as a bigger more expensive AI, and that work will take time to get done.\n\nI won't say there won't eventually be an AGI that doesn't approximate the human element well enough that it obsoletes most thinking jobs, but we're not five years away from something like that.

It's crazy how I was ranting about this stuff 10 years ago, showing people how a (now very obsolete) algorithm *learned* how to play a game and how we'd soon see this thing \"take over,\" and how those people could not give a shit and barely acknowledged that what I was showing them was even remotely interesting. Those same people are now ranting about how fearful they are of the inevitable AI takeover or how dismissive they are of such a reality because they can't fathom AI getting any better than it is right now. And, here I am, just watching this timeline unfold basically as expected.\n\nI digress; my point, here, is to highlight this point made in the OP's post:\n\n>That is not what is happening with AI, and it isn’t what is going to happen in the future. Progress is being made at a blistering rate. People who aren't constantly paying attention to every single development and published paper have no idea what's going on. They just wake up one day and go \"Oh wow look at that, AI can just make videos and music out of nowhere. This must be something that was developed overnight and is a magical thing that can only happen once or twice in my life. Any discussion about further development is silly and just hype!\"\n\nThe people who have actually been paying attention and know something more than what's on the surface are all generally looking in the same direction in terms of where they see this stuff ending up. It's a legitimate technology that offers legitimate value, and the people behind it aren't bullshitting.\n\nThe limits of AI development has, frankly, not been even so much a matter of limited compute/data as much as it's been a matter of interest. When I started my first year of my Masters, there was about 150 students in our university's \"Intro to ML\" class. The next year, it was 300. Our school had to add a number of AI classes and hire faculty to support the explosion in interest. And many of those students are now working on PhDs doing research in AI or working in the industry working on AI. The amount of funding pouring into those projects has been increasing rapidly over the last decade, and this includes *a ton* of support from the government, military, etc. And this is definitely not limited to the US, of course.\n\nBasically, a lot of people see a lot of value in this stuff, and it's not just some shiny toy they can sell to consumers to make a quick buck. Very smart people and very powerful people recognize *this* is it, and they need to be on top of it otherwise they'll be left behind. They know that it's a race to \"something,\" and although I won't try to pretend to know what that \"something\" is, I will say that the first thing I thought when I saw that DQN demonstration video 10 years ago was, \"if this AI can learn to play a game, you can just treat making a better AI as a game, and if it can learn to do that, then the result of that game will be an even better AI, and if you repeat that process, you're going to end up with *something*.\" Singularity or not, that process has already begun: products like ChatGPT or Copilot are already being used to develop better AI. It's more indirect and clunky than just unleashing an AI and watching it become sentient, but it's effectively the same process, and that process is only getting more and more efficient *every day*.\n\nAs for whether or not this is a bubble: that depends entirely on if this thing will burst. To be frank, the progress of AI, from my perspective, has actually been slower than what I thought it would be over the last decade. It's possible that people are expecting stuff to happen much faster than it actually will, and *that* can definitely result in this hype collapsing. But, to be clear, companies like OpenAI are basically sprinting towards what they believe will be a technology that will literally usher in a new era of mankind. I'm not saying they'll actually be able to, but (a) if they do, then that's it and (b) even if they don't, the technology they'll have built along the way will be incredibly valuable (as it already is).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Our AI is comparable to a monkey, learning to type words. Everytime the monkey does something well, he gets food. If he does something wrong, he will receive electric shocks (in reality, those models are discarded). Slowly but surely, the monkey will learn to type words, then sentences and then even how to respond to sentences, without ever having understood what the actual F is going on.\n\nOur monkey tho, is a self learning algorithm, no \"artificial intelligence\", just some algorithm, weighting some inputs. That btw. Is also the reason, why nobody can understand why an Ai did what it do... Because what happens, internally, is that value a, b and c have been 1.0, 0.356 and 0. Tho, with a small network, following up those is easy. With LLMs tho, the network is gigantic, making it humanly impossible.\n\nBut back to topic: why is the \"AI\" not something that will spawn an actual artificial intelligence? Well, because there is no understanding. What we call hallucinating nowadays, is nothing but an LLM eg. Doing what it does: generate text. It knows, a and b are connected, but it cannot know why. Our monkey just learned that a goes with b.\n\nWanna test it? Ask any LLM anything specific. Like, something really specific, not just \"ohh fancy me some cocktail\" but literally anything that is not generic crap, written in the training material a billion times. What you always will get, is text, not an answer. Doing this should reveal to you tho, that the \"AI\" does not know shit, like literally... It is a trained monkey. But you are still not convinced, right? Well, try to teach your LLM math then. It won't be able to do that beyond what is present in training data, because it cannot \"understand\" that 1 + 3 is the same as 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 or 4 or 2 + 2 or even 3 + 1...\n\nIt gets more clear tho, when leaving the realm of people thinking that the word guesser can talk, walking over to the generative image creation. Think of an image in your head, maybe a desk with a cactus, on the screen is some game in the background some black cat walking across the street which is only lit in the moonlight,... The \"AI\" is able to get quite close, because your image is just an estimate of what could be generated.\nNow ask it to create a purely white image with the color #000000\nIf you are lucky, some dev added special ifs to handle that case, otherwise you will get, again, an estimate of that color.\n\nBut what is awaiting us around the corner a few years down the line?\n1.

Right now, AI is producing a small amount of actual money from consumers, and ChatGPT peaked in the summer of 2023 in terms of visitors.\n\nComputers are already smarter than me, faster, better at memory, grammar, information storage, and calculations. People think the future will have one AIG machine for each Forbes 500 company doing customer support, programming, mail delivery, farming, etc. It's ridiculous. There are things AI will never have: consciousness with feelings and genetic instincts. \n\nAI won't replace jobs; they will be an extra addition. Startups will be easier to manage, so you will see a lot more competition. A company with a majority of human employees will vastly outperform any company trying to run a billion-dollar business with 90%+ AI, and I don't care when \"in the future\" that is. \n\nWhat will happen when the big tech companies realize they have no idea what they're actually investing in to, or if it will benefit them longterm (as i think AI will open up the door for more competition, something the big market caps dont like), investments will drop, NVDA earnings will drop and there you are stuck with a stock with about 200 price/earnings ratio.  \n\n\nDuring the dot com bubble, many stocks went bust, some took almost a decade to break the previous high.

Save some for TELL.\n\nIf anyone is interested on the next stock that can 10 to 50 X in 2 to 4 years, take a look at TELL.  Tellurian is a company that has had some delays on construction of infrastructure, but if you look who the TOP shareholders are, you will see that they won’t lose.  It’s only a matter of time for them to finish construction now.  It’s an AMERICAN Liquified Natural Gas company.   Too much to say here, but worth looking into it.  They aren’t profitable at all and that’s why the stock went from 20 dollars to now 70 Cents.   It will go to 50 Dollars.  It’s definitely a company that will trade at a 30 to 50 B market cap.  It’s at 700 M right now.  It’s like buying invídia 7 years ago and holding until now.    I recommend you guys look into it.  Even if they sell the company for infrastructure scraps, it’s worth already 2 to 3Billion at least just in infrastructure , not to mention the permits they were the last ones to get, and ever since Biden took office, no competition has even got close to consider jumping in the market.  They have only 2 others to compete for the LNG in the US .  They are working on a deal to partner up with the Saudis.  If that happens and American realizes it needs to go back to energy independence and export of LNG , TELLURIAN will jump like no other stock.  For real look into it , you won’t regret.   I bought 900 K worth of this stock back in December at 0.65.    I won’t sell it until it hits 20 dollars at least.   Worth your time.  This is the last chance to get in this stock bellow 1 dollar.  Predictions are crazy high  for the next 7 years.    Like always, criminals in Wall Street love to short stock in companies like this as the cap is low and easy to manipulate, specially when they aren’t profitable yet.   However,  they won’t be halting this stock at least for now, since there’s no kitty talking about this stock.  😂. Once the stock starts going towards 2 B the short sellers will jump out of the stock and it will be a long climb up for years guys.    They will close massive co tracts every year, specially starting early next year when the government will allow for the export of American LNG again.  Spread the word.
