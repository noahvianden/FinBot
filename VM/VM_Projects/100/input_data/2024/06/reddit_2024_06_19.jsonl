I didn't even realize the price I paid had to be multiplied by 100, but I was incredibly lucky, and I earned 4000 USD with the first trade. After that, I bought a book and better understood the principles of calls and puts. My broker/bank only allows the purchase of calls or puts (or covered calls) on a selected list of US stocks. My strategy was to choose stocks with a stable growing trend for at least six months and buy ATM calls with an expiration of 90 days. Then, sell the calls when the price has doubled (or lose the money).\n\nWith this strategy, I ended 2021 with a profit of 9000 USD. Wow.\n\nIn 2022, I was super excited and continued with the same strategy, earning money initially. Then, the war arrived, the market was crushed, and I lost something like 15k. In September, the P&L was -9.5k; I had wasted all the profit of 2021; I got scared and stopped completely.\n\nI restarted slowly in 2023 with the same strategy, mostly with calls and some puts, but limiting the max price. I also decided to sell the options when they were up 60-70% of the initial cost. It worked well until I got greedy and began spending more. In September and October, I lost 2.7k USD on META, 2.2k on JPM, and 3k on Spotify. I lost all the money earned in the first half of the year. The balance was still barely positive (+60 USD). So I stopped, happy I didn't lose money. At the end of the third year, my final balance was -300 USD; it could have gone worse.\n\nAnd here we are in 2024. In the meantime, I read a few more books and studied about volatility, greeks, and so on. I opened an IBKR account to try different strategies on all the possible stocks. I tried selling puts, strangles, bear put spreads, and a butterfly. Thank god, I tried only with small amounts because it was a disaster. Maybe it was too complex for me, or I wasn't lucky, or picking the right stock when you can choose from all the stock markets is too difficult. I don't know. I stopped using IBKR and returned to my old broker, where things are simpler.\n\n\n\nNow, I am back to the old strategy but with a few more rules. I am fully aware it's not a perfect one, but it's kind of working:\n\n* I select the best stocks with a growing trend for at least six months (which was easy, considering 2024 has been good so far). I exclude the ones with high prices (so I never traded NVDA, for example)\n* I add these stocks to a virtual portfolio to monitor them every day. If the price keeps going up, I don't do anything. If the price one day goes down, possibly more than -1 %, I check the cost of the ATM or slightly OTM call, and if the price of the option has gone down by -15% or something like that, I buy the call. The idea is that if the stock is in a growing trend, this is just a temporary drop and will restart growing soon. \n* I only buy the option if the price is <10 USD. In a few cases, I risked with a price of 14 or 15, but always less than 20.\n* Immediately after, I enter a sell order for the price x 1.5, expiring 30 days. This way, I don't risk being too greedy: when I earn 50%, the option is sold automatically, and I forget about it.\n* I always have at most 3k invested in options. This way, even if I lose everything, it's not a disaster.\n\nI would never be a millionaire with this strategy, but it works. The P&L is +6k so far. Plus, I made a profit when I exercised GOOGL, then sold it later, and 1k with the split of GE (complex story).\n\nOf course, the year has not ended, so there is still time to lose everything.\n\nThe question is, do you think it makes sense?

Options are a negative sum game when you account for fees, slippage, volatility, etc.\n\nI'll try to keep it simple, but options pricing basically boils down to integration within the Black-Scholes model. If you think of a perfect model it would consist of an infinite amount of points (a line), where the correct price is given at every point in time.\n\nIn reality though, the price doesn't travel in a line - it jumps from cent to cent, dollar to dollar, at unexpected rates. This volatility is troublesome for the BS model (any model really) to bake into it's calculations. For this reason, generally market makers will get their true price estimate for BS model, then quote you a spread based on the liquidity. You can guarantee though that the prices quotes will always leave a negative EV for the customer since they know the BS model has a degree of error, and they will not take on negative EV themselves.\n\nSo, unless you have someone offloading their options directly to you at the mid price, almost all options you buy will have a negative EV just by nature of how pricing algorithms work.

They are a result of a theoretical concept that allows you to price options via non arbitrage arguments and hedging frameworks within a risk neutral world.\n\nBacking out this probability is relatively simple, once you have a vol surface. There are two seminal papers for this. One is Breeden Litzenberger, the other comes from Malz in the Fed Staff Report No. 677 on June 2014 [A Simple and Reliable Way to Compute Option-Based Risk-Neutral Distributions](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr677.pdf).\n\nThe method I linked is a bit simplistic and you should modify it a bit because the strikes derived from delta quotes do not lie on a uniform grid (they do not have constant spacing), in which case a more general formula for weighting is needed. Also, ideally, you should make sure that all computed prices are monotonically decreasing, showing that the results are free from vertical spread arbitrage opportunities.

I like the idea of monitoring the stocks for some time before hopping in, but I don't like your loose method of \"eye-balling\" the options delta and just hopping in on a red day. You should quantify these feelings. One thing I recommend is that you first identify the uptrend, then use a technical indicator like RSI to determine when the stock is oversold. You can also use the greeks - the idea is to do it off a measurement rather than a feeling though.\n\n  \n3. I really don't like this concept you have that the dollar value matters. Options are a dynamic game based on %'s not on values. One contract for $100, or 10 contracts for $10, it doesn't matter the price. Liquidity available and the greeks matter much more than the $ value.\n\n  \n4. Having a sell point is a good idea. I often find it useful to \"ladder out\" which means selling a portion of your contracts as it rises. This can help keep you in for a bit longer when a run is extending and keeping you from feeling like you \"missed out\" if your picks go higher. I usually start selling at 20% profit and will have sold about half my position by 50%. Then the remaining 50% I will let go on a trailing stop loss.\n\n  \n5.

{"title": "Most stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year", "selftext": "Source: https://www.ft.com/content/1e02d0d3-3f0b-4bd1-a79c-9fd45d1b6056\n\nMost of the stocks that were caught up in last year’s hype around artificial intelligence have fallen this year, suggesting that investors are increasingly trying to separate the wheat from the chaff among companies claiming to be beneficiaries of the AI trend.\n\nMassive share price rallies for high-profile groups such as Nvidia, the chip designer that this week became the world’s most valuable listed company, have spurred a growing debate about whether the US stock market is being driven by speculative hype.\n\nBut the recent declines for dozens of stocks that had benefited from the early enthusiasm suggest that investors are starting to look past optimistic commentary if the companies cannot back up their claims.\n\n“AI is still a big theme but if you can’t demonstrate evidence you’re getting hurt,” said Stuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi. “Just saying ‘AI’ 15 times is not going to cut it any more.”\n\nAbout 60 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 have risen this year, but more than half the stocks included in Citi’s “AI Winners Basket” — an index based on the names that were garnering the most excitement among the bank’s clients last year — have declined. More than three-quarters of companies in the AI basket had climbed in 2023.\n\nInvestment funds that tried to pick a wide spread of AI beneficiaries have had a similar experience. More than half of the individual stocks in BlackRock’s Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF, Invesco’s AI and Next Gen Software fund, and First Trust and Nasdaq’s Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF have declined this year.\n\nMona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, said: “Investors are looking a bit more at the earnings story among ‘AI’ names. The differentiator with something like a Nvidia is they have delivered on the bottom line, showing real data.”\n\nNvidia has more than doubled in value this year, after more than tripling in 2023, and its market cap is now well over $3tn. However, the massive demand for its graphics processing units is such that, measured as a multiple of its sales over the previous 12 months, the stock is actually cheaper than this time last year. \n\nIn contrast, tech groups such as Salesforce, Snowflake, Intel and Adobe — now far smaller than Nvidia by market value, but classed as large-cap stocks — have fallen sharply after strong gains in 2023.\n\n“In tech the bar was quite high [in earnings season] and if you missed that bar you got hit hard,” said Citi’s Kaiser. Salesforce suffered its worst one-day drop in 20 years after publishing a disappointing quarterly update last month.\n\nAlthough some have taken the shift as a sign of rationality returning, Rob Arnott, chair of asset manager Research Affiliates, said the AI-linked rally still “has the look to me of a classic bubble”.\n\n“One of the things about a classic bubble is you do see smaller players fade before big ones start to suffer,” he said.\n\nArnott stressed that he was a believer in the long-term impact of AI, but said “a lot of the benefits are going to come gradually, and the market is pricing in immediacy”.", "id": "1djh7bs", "created_utc": 1718797736.0, "score": 407, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "The ones listed are all at the end of the AI line.

We've already seen a lot of cases of chat bots getting companies into legal trouble because they make things up. The only way to get reliable training data is to pay people to build a model yourself, which is very expensive, and even then, performance is not guaranteed. So quite often, human reviewers are needed to verify the quality of AI outputs.\n\n2. Cost of the AI chips themselves. Nvidia is charging $30,000-40,000 for a single H100. You need a tremendous amount of these to build an AI model or to deploy it at scale. Then consider, they intend to come out with new AI chips every year.  So companies are spending Billions buying these chips, and will just need to replace them every 1-2 years to stay competitive.\n\nAs a result, the cost of deploying an AI solution is substantially more expensive than just outsourcing the job overseas, or even just hiring people locally to do the task.\n\nI still think AI will eventually take off and make companies more efficient, but it will because prices of AI chips will come down. Cutting edge technology is always expensive, especially when competition is limited. When Nvidia starts facing more competition from AMD and others, or when demand for AI chips slows down such that Nvidia no longer has a backlog, prices WILL come down.

{"title": "NVIDIA Will Crash", "selftext": "So one thing that most people agree on is that Nvidia is the one benefitting from this Gold Rush ( AI Boom) being the most dominant player selling shovels ( GPU's).\n\nBut my thesis is that this AI Boom isn't sustainable for long since it is not only expensive to afford the infrastructure for machine learning( data centres etc) but also time consuming to train the machines with a googol of information.\n\n Now, the problem is that currently there aren't meaningful profitable applications for these AI, especially generative AI which all the companies seem to be hopping on now just for the sake of it. It would make sense if they used this AI to enhance their products which many are but offerring generative AI as a service directly to the consumers still seems to be somewhat precarious. Most common people don't care about AI. The problem that most people are callous about is the over dependence of NVIDIA on this Generative AI Boom to the point where more than 60% of their revenue comes from the data centre/AI segment. \nOnce the AI Boom fizzles out in the future (which I think is still far away), their revenue will take a hit severely and you'll just get a bunch of analysts at wall street filled with gloom just because the revenue doesn't match their expectations. As a result, the stock would take a hit. \n\nRemember, NVIDIA might still be incredibly profitable after that and bring in significant revenue especially through their leadership in the gaming segment. However it will lose its former glory and it's stock price would come crashing down. It needs to diversify soon and keep it as its top priority. \n\nPlease give me your two cents on this and correct me if I'm wrong .\n\nNOTE: Do your own Research and Analysis before investing. Don't invest just on the basis of a reddit post. This isn't no investment advice. \n\nEdit : The title may be a bit misleading, my apologies. I'm not saying NVIDIA as a company would crash, but its stock price will be severely affected once the AI Boom fizzles out and its revenue reduces , Although I don't think it'll happen in the near future.

This instigated the Florida government to push to regain control over land in the state that had previously been near given over completely to Disney. Ultimately Disney reached a settlement with Florida where they paid a settlement ***and*** lost their pseudo control of the area, although it also lets them expand and seems pretty light handed moving forward. There is also the money it costs to maintain this high level of a lawsuit for 2+ years, whatever losses occurred from pulling out of the initial billion dollar expansion plans, and the massive loss of trust from the shareholders and public who previously thought Disney was invincible. \n \n **- [THE DECREASING MEDAI QUALITY LOSING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS FOR THE COMPANY.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/189s6tn/using_the_25x_multiplier_disneys_films_have_lost/)** \n That isn't an article, just a collection of some of their losses on some of their movies over the last x period. Even beyond the losses of money, they have completely eroded their brands and customer trust in their quality. She-Hulk, Snow White, Captain Marvel gender swap for some reason, really several of the gender/race swap movies because again why, but there are tons of examples that have either or both lost them money and alienated some of the public that were otherwise fans.

Attend to how Nvidia might counter these moves in product or business strategy and how this can counteract and shift or change in market sentiment.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Your skepticism is understandable, but let’s delve deeper into why AMD’s position is more promising than it might initially appear.\n\n1. Xilinx Acquisition and Catching Up to CUDA\n\nThe acquisition of Xilinx is a strategic move that goes beyond simply bolstering AMD’s hardware portfolio. Xilinx specializes in adaptive computing solutions, particularly FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), which are known for their flexibility and efficiency in processing parallel workloads. Integrating Xilinx’s technology allows AMD to enhance its software capabilities, particularly with its ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) platform.\n\nCatching Up to CUDA: CUDA, developed by Nvidia, has been the gold standard for GPU computing in AI and high-performance computing (HPC). CUDA’s strength lies in its robust ecosystem and mature software stack, which includes libraries, compilers, and tools optimized for Nvidia hardware. By leveraging Xilinx’s expertise, AMD aims to refine ROCm to offer similar levels of performance and ease of use, thus providing a compelling alternative to CUDA.\n\n2. Switching from CUDA to ROCm\n\nWhy Companies Might Switch:\n\n\t•\tCost-Effectiveness: AMD’s GPUs typically offer competitive performance at a lower price point compared to Nvidia. For businesses looking to optimize costs without sacrificing performance, this is a significant incentive.\n\t•\tOpen-Source Advantage: ROCm is open-source, which means companies can customize it to their specific needs, fostering innovation and flexibility that is harder to achieve with CUDA’s closed ecosystem.\n\t•\tIntegration with Existing Systems: The inclusion of Xilinx’s adaptable hardware makes it easier for companies to integrate AMD solutions into their existing infrastructure, providing a seamless transition from CUDA to ROCm.\n\nPartial Adoption: It’s likely that companies will initially adopt a hybrid approach, using ROCm for specific projects while continuing to rely on CUDA for established workflows. Over time, as ROCm matures and demonstrates its capabilities, a more substantial shift could occur.\n\n3. Meta and Microsoft Buying AMD\n\nBullish Indicator: When industry giants like Meta and Microsoft invest in AMD’s offerings, it signals confidence in AMD’s technological advancements. These companies are leaders in AI and cloud computing, and their adoption of AMD solutions can drive broader market acceptance. It’s not just about diversifying their hardware portfolio; it’s about recognizing the potential of AMD’s technology to meet future demands.\n\nStrategic Investment: Even if Meta and Microsoft continue to use Nvidia hardware, their significant investments in AMD indicate a strategic move to balance their dependencies and foster competition. This can stimulate further innovation and lower costs, benefiting the entire industry.\n\n4. Nvidia’s Countermoves\n\nProduct Strategy: Nvidia is likely to continue advancing its CUDA platform and hardware offerings, possibly introducing new features or optimizing performance. However, AMD’s combination of competitive pricing, open-source flexibility, and enhanced software capabilities through Xilinx provides a strong counterbalance.\n\nBusiness Strategy: Nvidia might adopt aggressive pricing strategies or exclusive partnerships to retain market share. Yet, the industry’s move towards open standards and cost efficiency plays into AMD’s strengths, potentially mitigating Nvidia’s defensive measures.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe bullish case for AMD hinges on its strategic acquisitions, technological advancements, and growing acceptance by major industry players. While Nvidia remains a formidable competitor, AMD’s unique value propositions position it well for substantial growth and increased market share in the coming years.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "This is totally not a ChatGPT investment memo…", "score": 30, "replies": []}, {"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

NVidia closes a lot of deals to help boost chip production which could be another nail in the coffing if they will have enough of their chips in the market. \n\n\nWhile I do believe AMD knows what they are doing now since they were on a brink of bankruptcy before they released Ryzen CPUs, everything can happen and if odds are against I'd rather go with momentum to take small profit than gamble out and have achance to lose a lot bigger number ", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "fuck I was still thinking about gamer shit my bad\n\ndestined to remain in 30th place then", "score": -11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lmfao tell that to myspace that got second place to facebook", "score": -2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "RemindMe! 2 years", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 2 years on [**2026-06-19 21:31:22 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2026-06-19%2021:31:22%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1djr3t3/amd_bull_case/l9dcj1g/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2F1djr3t3%2Famd_bull_case%2Fl9dcj1g%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202026-06-19%2021%3A31%3A22%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%201djr3t3)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Broadcom is second place, AMD would be over $300 is they were second place (e.g. greater than $12bn in AI revenue for the year).", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I thought the title said AMC i was about to break some eggs ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "How does the acquisition of Xilinx have anything to do with software improvements?
