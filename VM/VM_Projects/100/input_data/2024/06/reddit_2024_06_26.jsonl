I know semiconductors and the industry better than most but I’m no expert so YMMV etc. disclaimers. \n\nIntel is a very long way from using their ASML Deep EUV machine. Yes they got the first one. But now they have to develop the technology to use it. It’s new territory with all these new lithography machines. They don’t come ready to use out of the box. They are probably 2-5 years from having a process ready that uses it. \n\nFurther- you can’t just take your design and stick it in a new process node. You actually have to design the chip specifically for that node. Especially when you move manufacturers. The silicon made by intel and TSMC is actually quite different. So when they moved their manufacturing to TSMC they didn’t just take their design and hand it over. No, it was a massive investment to redesign the chips for the TSMC process. Things stay generally in the same place and the same superficial arrangement is there but at the gate level things look different. \n\nIntel has really faltered on execution lately. With their 10 nm process they really fell apart. In some ways they bit off more than they can chew. They tried to add 3 new really advanced techniques into the process that would have rocketed them ahead of TSMC had they worked. But they couldn’t get them to work for a few years. TSMC is much better at executing and delivering new processes. They go for small incremental improvements each year. \n\nIntel isn’t even manufacturing their newest generation themselves. That’s critical here. Most the semiconductor companies you talk about are either design houses or foundries or equipment makers. Intel did all three for years. So buying intel you are buying into all three industries. They fell apart on equipment and are buying outside equipment with ASMLs new machine. And they fell down on manufacturing with TSMC actually manufacturing the processor tiles for their new SKUs. \n\nAMD is a much smaller company and much more efficient. They design one chip well and then reuse it in all their parts with different packaging processes and their “chiplet” designs. Intel makes dozens of different masks. And each one takes engineering time. \nAlso, AMD spun off their in house foundry as Global Foundries about 10 years ago. So they don’t have to worry about that. They design their silicon for TSMC’s process and rely on them to innovate and deliver. \n\nAll that said, I do think Intel is oversold. They still have massive market share in the consumer and server markets. They’re losing market share but we’re talking from 95% to 85%. They are pulling much lower margins though because the ferocious competition from AMD forces them to lower their prices. And honestly AMD has the better server and consumer CPU parts IMHO. Intel has much stronger relationships with the system integrators from years and years of partnership and shady business practices so that companies like Dell and Lenovo and server manufacturers like Super Micro all tend to use Intel processors. AMD has struggled in this regard. \n\nThe bigger story though is that AMD has a ton of room to grow by stealing market share. And Intel has little place to go but hold the line or lose more share. Those relationships are really strong though and it’s worth looking into the arrangements they have with the integrators. \n\nIntel has new management with a technical background instead of a sales background and that might help get the company back into the lead technologically but like getting a new head coach on a football team, it takes years to rebuild your bench and get the ball rolling on new research. Also the gains are getting harder and harder. The gates are only a few dozen atoms now. They aren’t really at this point getting smaller - they’re getting more dense which creates an “equivalent shrinkage”. So 5 nm wasn’t 5nm feature size anymore it was a density as if the feature size was 5nm. So the power requirements aren’t going down like they should. But with the density increasing and the number of gates increasing and the amount of leakage in tiny gates means that power consumption and heat production are limiting factors. AMDs new cores are actually the same core. The efficiency cores are just smaller than the power cores. So the “efficiency cores” just have to run slower because they are so dense and the heat gets built up. \n\nThere’s a lot to like with Intel but there are also very significant hurdles and many years of hard work to demonstrate that they can deliver - especially when it’s increasingly hard to make process node advancements. Exponential even.  If they deliver on backside power delivery first they might have a chance. Opening up the foundry might help. Especially with the US govt throwing money around for domestic production. But they won’t be making bleeding edge chips. They’ll be making lower margin more mundane chips with their (relatively) less advanced lithography.

I was broke and in Thailand, and because of the time difference and partying I had purchased $2500 on a Wednesday of what I thought was Tesla call options that expired Friday (2 days later). The next day my drunk ass was staggering around playing with this Russia girl I met and the next thing I know etrAde is blowing me up, calling back to back to back, and this had never happened so In my mind I thought “I’m fuc*ed”, something bad has happened and they want their money. I didn’t have access to my app because of the cost of data, so I didn’t know what the hell was going on. I answered and it was etrAde support asking me what the hell I wanted to do with my Tesla options. \n\n\nLet’s rewind: \nI said I was broke, and I was. I had like 23k to my name. And I had made almost all of that on a Lululemon puts a month or two before where I spent like $500 on a ton of otm contracts and that $500 turned into 23k in 20 seconds when their stock plummeted from 70 down to like 45 after bad earnings. (Just had a feeling 😉)\n\nSo I took my ass and my new found wealth of $23k to Thailand for a month lolz \n\nSo I am in Thailand, and that’s why when I say I was broke I still threw $2500 like a dumb ass into an OTM telsa calls that expired that week. I thought I had 2 days instead of 1, and I was willing to lose half the money on a gamble. And I’ll be damn if I didn’t get my days wrong, and etrAde was blowing me up as said, and the conversation went something like. \n\n“you need to deposit a half million dollars in the next couple hours if you want to exercise your position”. Drunk and confused as hell, I was terrified. And I wasn’t understanding. \n\nI was like “how did I lose all my money, the contract doesn’t blah blah blah” and that’s when they said sir, your position is currently up $60,000+ on the day and it expires at market close today. So you either need wire and exercise very quickly, or sell your options and take your profits.\n\nUmm, did you just say I am up $60,000 on the day? \n\nThem: Yes, actually now your up almost $70k. \n\nMe: Please sell all my options right meow! \n\nThey did, and I went and got to an Internet cafe, and that’s when I was able to go online and see what the hell happened. Tesla has announced their semi trucks, and hit a mini lottery being a drunk degenerate in Thailand. \n\nThat was the 2 months where I turned $500 into almost $100k on two bets. Lululemon OTM puts on bad earnings and my options went from .11 to $12-$14. \n\nThen the Tesla play you heard. Sorry, I have ADHD if this doesn’t make any sense.  \n\nNever had a run like that since!
