That is when I found out that vol expansion and price can move together ü§£ü§£ (NatGas is one hell of a drug)\n\nThen I started learning about how exchanges can spike up margin requirements out of the blue, how market makers widen spreads or even pull out their books when the shit hits the fan and other wonderful systemic risks.\n\nThen I started looking into non correlated equities etfs.

And when it‚Äôs time to take them out just rebalance by wheeling out. Add leverage to the point you are confirmable with, hedge the equity and bonds (this will probably be your most weighted holdings) and then over leaver  some more via options. Simulate your ports‚Äôs SPX 20% drawdown and see if you risk a margin call (most brokers can do this). Adjust leverage until you can theoretically survive a 20% drawdown then look up tail risk hedging (this is still black magic for most people).\n\nMy reasoning is to make money by selling options during good times and when the swan commeth, I will have a very diversified low correlated portfolio with some 1/3 put back ratio hedges that will hold my margin steady until the swan turns out to be black or not.\n\nIf the swan is white then I just chill and take a break from selling puts. Maybe sell some calls on the shit you‚Äôll get assigned & remember to roll the 1/3 back ratio puts so you don‚Äôt end up expiring in the valley of death.\n\nIf the swan is black then brace for impact because your wonderfully crafted low correlated port will turn to shit and will very fast autocorrelate with the SPX. At this point you should constantly keep your eyes on your maintenance margin and of that spikes you should start buying low delta puts on SPY.\n\nMonitor in the background the price difference between a S&P500 etf like SPY and a S&P500 mutual fund. In a market that is liquid the spread should be arbed out by algos. But if that spread widens then it is clear the liquidity event has started. At this moment you should start liquidating your portfolio and just keep the hedges. If you are lucky enough you can time the market bottom, dump the hedges for massive gains and go back with all that sweet, sweet cash you have on the sidelines.

It‚Äôs great for big wide orgs that don‚Äôt need a lot of organization of their projects, or project management tooling. Their calling card is *accessibility* over feature richness: great APIs, centralized SSO, big flat open organization page UX, public and free storage options. GitHub on its own is extremely anemic when it comes to kanban/scrum ‚Äúproject‚Äù tooling- which is where Atlassian has the primary advantage with Jira. It‚Äôs common to see Jira bolted onto other VCS solutions to fill the gap. GitHub also has a paid-only onprem solution. The FOSS analogous option is Gitea, which is tiny in comparison to everything else. GitHub wins with CI/CD simplicity with its @modular system which lets people curate libraries of CI functions and share/reuse them. Highly pluggable, more accessibility. They have free package repos built in. Their releases API is best in class. \n\n- Gitlab is free as fuck. As in, nearly its entire featureset works OOTB without slip-and-sliding people into buying anything at all. CI just works. Single board Kanban is there. Private orgs just work. Runners work. Releases are all there. It has a more than sufficient toolset for kanban/scrum tooling, issue management, builds, k8s integration, whole 9. Running it on-premise though is archaic. It‚Äôs still designed like a fat monolith with 12 different services composing the stack. It still does not have a good k8s implementation for running on k8s clusters, and people opt to just run the single monolithic pod or VM (native packages) version instead. I think over half of the fortune 100 use it for on prem because it‚Äôs TRULY free, whereas GitHub‚Äôs onprem option is paid only, same with bitbucket. It‚Äôs THE ONLY real on-prem free option with full features batteries included. The SaaS platform (Gitlab.com) is not anywhere near as popular as GitHub because it‚Äôs really a tool more designed for private use, and as such it‚Äôs not as UX-focused to be a big ‚Äúpublic portal‚Äù for projects. I don‚Äôt event think that‚Äôs gitlab‚Äôs goal.\n\n- Bitbucket sucks on its own. It‚Äôs minimal in featureset because Atlassian sells their *suite* of tools in bundles, and it‚Äôs intended to be sold alongside Bamboo, Jira, and Confluence to be feature-complete. \n\nEvery one of these primary options has their own market strategy and niche it‚Äôs trying to hit. I‚Äôd argue Gitlab is king of on prem, GitHub is king of SaaS, and bitbucket is king of economy of scale (institutional adopters).\n\nWhere Gitlab is ‚Äúfailing‚Äù is pushing their primary business model of CALs+Support:\n\n1. SO MUCH of the product featureset is free, most consumers can avoid paying for it at all. \n\n2. WHEN YOU DO need support, their support sucks major donkey dick because they‚Äôre frankly understaffed/underskilled to solve some of those more complex issues (when they seldom occur). They don‚Äôt have as large of a support engineering foundation as say, Red Hat, and many of the engineers that built Gitlab came from there, and never took the time to capture/outline their strategy for running a services based revenue generating part of the business- a case of too much engineering not enough business sense.\n\n3. Their upsell to paid enterprise edition (EE vs CE) is nonexistent. I have never seen them try to push us or anyone else to turn on EE-only features, and they‚Äôre just *not that compelling* to do so. Their marketing and sales strategy is just milk-toast. You can install EE, and run it in free mode which is the same as just having CE.\n\nFrom what I‚Äôve seen, most consumers just use one or two features of Gitlab that they really need, which is just proper on-premise isolation of proprietary code and content. There is so little incentive to base an entire company‚Äôs operations on JUST Gitlab that the sales exposure and opportunity there is slim unless GTLB decided to grow a pair and more aggressively upsell people to EE. \n\nThis is my experience and opinion, and I‚Äôm a $350k/yr TCO engineer in the space.\n\nWe ourselves use multiple Gitlab EE (free mode) instances on-prem, just for internal stuff that houses sensitive data and our skeletons in the closet, but majority of our real world product development occurs on both GitHub.com and Gitlab.com SaaS because we‚Äôre a FOSS leader.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Great breakdown thanks", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Holy shit.

If they do, they can make use of their huge real estate presence, like you said, and command a big share of that market.

Essentially, people who are dissatisfied with something are FAR more likely to post a review or say something on reddit (or elsewhere) than people who are happy.

Maintaining ratings was difficult because I constantly had to remind those who were happy to leave a review, while those who were not would leave one of their own accord.

The appearance doesn't necessarily mean they are, but in the fast food and drink business, I've found that many workers don't bother putting on airs.

But more than 15 years ago, Huang realised that the technology inside its GPUs was also suited to other data intensive computing tasks, such as AI.\n\nThe company is now trying to boost its PC chip business by capitalising on its dominance in AI chips for data centres.\n\nHuang on Sunday also announced deals with two PC makers, Asus and MSI, that will launch machines using Nvidia‚Äôs GeForce RTX graphics processing units to support a range of AI tasks, from running digital assistants to video editing and coding.\n\n‚ÄúYour future laptop will be constantly helping you in the background,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúThe PC will run apps that are enhanced by AI, from writing, photo editing, to digital humans that are AIs,‚Äù said Huang.\n\nNvidia did not specify when the Asus and MSI laptops will go on sale.\n\nA range of PC makers and component providers are expected to use the Computex event to make announcements to position themselves as beneficiaries of an expected ‚ÄúAI PC‚Äù wave.\n\nMicrosoft recently unveiled a string of AI-enhanced PCs and tablets fitted out with its Copilot assistant tool, powered by Qualcomm‚Äôs chips, which will begin to launch later this month. Microsoft has said it expects to include the Nvidia chips and AMD‚Äôs Radeon graphics chips in its PCs in future. \n\nPC sales have slumped since the pandemic but analysts expect that when demand revives companies will increasingly opt for AI PCs embedded with powerful chips to run AI applications, rather than relying solely on the cloud.\n\n‚ÄúAI PCs will bring the most exciting innovation to the PC industry in the last two to three decades, since the creation of the World Wide Web in the late 1980s,‚Äù Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note last month.\n\nThey said that running AI applications on devices would be cheaper and more flexible than on the cloud and would also have benefits for data privacy. AI PCs will make up about 65 per cent of PC shipments by 2028, up from 2 per cent this year, Morgan Stanley predicted.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nNow here‚Äôs the smartest comment I‚Äôve read in the Financial Times comment thread for this article:\n\n‚ÄúThe competition doesn't stand a chance.\n\nRapid product cycle upgrades which will be backward compatible just emphasises how far ahead Nvidia's hardware and software has now become.\n\nAnd given the geo-strategic nature of AI capability, there is zero chance of the US Government standing in Nvidia's way with any significant anti-trust intervention.\n\nThis company looks and feels like Microsoft and Intel combined from the 1990's and 2000's PC/Internet era, which is why I expect it to continue its march higher and become the world's most valuable company before the end of 2024.\n\nAstonishing company and equally amazing leader.‚Äù\n\nGuys, idk.
