And when it’s time to take them out just rebalance by wheeling out. Add leverage to the point you are confirmable with, hedge the equity and bonds (this will probably be your most weighted holdings) and then over leaver  some more via options. Simulate your ports’s SPX 20% drawdown and see if you risk a margin call (most brokers can do this). Adjust leverage until you can theoretically survive a 20% drawdown then look up tail risk hedging (this is still black magic for most people).\n\nMy reasoning is to make money by selling options during good times and when the swan commeth, I will have a very diversified low correlated portfolio with some 1/3 put back ratio hedges that will hold my margin steady until the swan turns out to be black or not.\n\nIf the swan is white then I just chill and take a break from selling puts. Maybe sell some calls on the shit you’ll get assigned & remember to roll the 1/3 back ratio puts so you don’t end up expiring in the valley of death.\n\nIf the swan is black then brace for impact because your wonderfully crafted low correlated port will turn to shit and will very fast autocorrelate with the SPX. At this point you should constantly keep your eyes on your maintenance margin and of that spikes you should start buying low delta puts on SPY.\n\nMonitor in the background the price difference between a S&P500 etf like SPY and a S&P500 mutual fund. In a market that is liquid the spread should be arbed out by algos. But if that spread widens then it is clear the liquidity event has started. At this moment you should start liquidating your portfolio and just keep the hedges. If you are lucky enough you can time the market bottom, dump the hedges for massive gains and go back with all that sweet, sweet cash you have on the sidelines. But don’t go back into all that diversified crap. Go back in gradually into SPY as it is probably the most liquid.

It’s great for big wide orgs that don’t need a lot of organization of their projects, or project management tooling. Their calling card is *accessibility* over feature richness: great APIs, centralized SSO, big flat open organization page UX, public and free storage options. GitHub on its own is extremely anemic when it comes to kanban/scrum “project” tooling- which is where Atlassian has the primary advantage with Jira. It’s common to see Jira bolted onto other VCS solutions to fill the gap. GitHub also has a paid-only onprem solution. The FOSS analogous option is Gitea, which is tiny in comparison to everything else. GitHub wins with CI/CD simplicity with its @modular system which lets people curate libraries of CI functions and share/reuse them. Highly pluggable, more accessibility. They have free package repos built in. Their releases API is best in class. \n\n- Gitlab is free as fuck. As in, nearly its entire featureset works OOTB without slip-and-sliding people into buying anything at all. CI just works. Single board Kanban is there. Private orgs just work. Runners work. Releases are all there. It has a more than sufficient toolset for kanban/scrum tooling, issue management, builds, k8s integration, whole 9. Running it on-premise though is archaic. It’s still designed like a fat monolith with 12 different services composing the stack. It still does not have a good k8s implementation for running on k8s clusters, and people opt to just run the single monolithic pod or VM (native packages) version instead. I think over half of the fortune 100 use it for on prem because it’s TRULY free, whereas GitHub’s onprem option is paid only, same with bitbucket. It’s THE ONLY real on-prem free option with full features batteries included. The SaaS platform (Gitlab.com) is not anywhere near as popular as GitHub because it’s really a tool more designed for private use, and as such it’s not as UX-focused to be a big “public portal” for projects. I don’t event think that’s gitlab’s goal.\n\n- Bitbucket sucks on its own. It’s minimal in featureset because Atlassian sells their *suite* of tools in bundles, and it’s intended to be sold alongside Bamboo, Jira, and Confluence to be feature-complete. \n\nEvery one of these primary options has their own market strategy and niche it’s trying to hit. I’d argue Gitlab is king of on prem, GitHub is king of SaaS, and bitbucket is king of economy of scale (institutional adopters).\n\nWhere Gitlab is “failing” is pushing their primary business model of CALs+Support:\n\n1. SO MUCH of the product featureset is free, most consumers can avoid paying for it at all. \n\n2. WHEN YOU DO need support, their support sucks major donkey dick because they’re frankly understaffed/underskilled to solve some of those more complex issues (when they seldom occur). They don’t have as large of a support engineering foundation as say, Red Hat, and many of the engineers that built Gitlab came from there, and never took the time to capture/outline their strategy for running a services based revenue generating part of the business- a case of too much engineering not enough business sense.\n\n3. Their upsell to paid enterprise edition (EE vs CE) is nonexistent. I have never seen them try to push us or anyone else to turn on EE-only features, and they’re just *not that compelling* to do so. Their marketing and sales strategy is just milk-toast. You can install EE, and run it in free mode which is the same as just having CE.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, most consumers just use one or two features of Gitlab that they really need, which is just proper on-premise isolation of proprietary code and content. There is so little incentive to base an entire company’s operations on JUST Gitlab that the sales exposure and opportunity there is slim unless GTLB decided to grow a pair and more aggressively upsell people to EE. \n\nThis is my experience and opinion, and I’m a $350k/yr TCO engineer in the space.\n\nWe ourselves use multiple Gitlab EE (free mode) instances on-prem, just for internal stuff that houses sensitive data and our skeletons in the closet, but majority of our real world product development occurs on both GitHub.com and Gitlab.com SaaS because we’re a FOSS leader.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Great breakdown thanks", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Holy shit.

What I do worry about, however, is employee satisfaction. From what I can tell, admin *thinks* they treat employees well. They do have good pay and other comp IMO. Baristas start at 18-19$/hour and they have an excellent 401k match that is managed by Fidelity, and all employees have option to purchase SBUX at discount from payroll deduction. That being said, they seem to be unhappy. Every time I’m in a shop they are super friendly, but looking a r/Starbucks they seem to be pretty overwhelmed, understaffed, and stressed. (Some of this has to do with customers being complete assholes).  I think SBUX needs to fix that.  But otherwise I don’t see the drop off in customers and “empty” cafes that other commenters are mentioning. All my local cafes (I commonly patronize three in my city) are pretty busy.  I hope you’re right that various new drink options will spark increased numbers. But I hope it doesn’t lead to attrition of stressed employees.  Edit: I have some BROS in retirement accounts that is a long term hold. And I like that company too, however  personally disagree that you should get long BROS at these prices in place of SBUX. BROS coffee quality is pretty bad IMO, and a PE ratio of ~200 is kind of absurd for a drive through coffee shop. It’s true though that they are growing substantially and they are always busy as well, and I’m sure overhead is way lower than SBUX.

Essentially, people who are dissatisfied with something are FAR more likely to post a review or say something on reddit (or elsewhere) than people who are happy. I also learned this when I worked for DoorDash. Maintaining ratings was difficult because I constantly had to remind those who were happy to leave a review, while those who were not would leave one of their own accord. I see what you're saying about dissatisfied employees, based on what you've seen on the Reddit. However, I'd suggest you balance that with the fact that you regularly see workers who appear happy in the store. The appearance doesn't necessarily mean they are, but in the fast food and drink business, I've found that many workers don't bother putting on airs.

But more than 15 years ago, Huang realised that the technology inside its GPUs was also suited to other data intensive computing tasks, such as AI.\n\nThe company is now trying to boost its PC chip business by capitalising on its dominance in AI chips for data centres.\n\nHuang on Sunday also announced deals with two PC makers, Asus and MSI, that will launch machines using Nvidia’s GeForce RTX graphics processing units to support a range of AI tasks, from running digital assistants to video editing and coding.\n\n“Your future laptop will be constantly helping you in the background,” Huang said. “The PC will run apps that are enhanced by AI, from writing, photo editing, to digital humans that are AIs,” said Huang.\n\nNvidia did not specify when the Asus and MSI laptops will go on sale.\n\nA range of PC makers and component providers are expected to use the Computex event to make announcements to position themselves as beneficiaries of an expected “AI PC” wave.\n\nMicrosoft recently unveiled a string of AI-enhanced PCs and tablets fitted out with its Copilot assistant tool, powered by Qualcomm’s chips, which will begin to launch later this month. Microsoft has said it expects to include the Nvidia chips and AMD’s Radeon graphics chips in its PCs in future. \n\nPC sales have slumped since the pandemic but analysts expect that when demand revives companies will increasingly opt for AI PCs embedded with powerful chips to run AI applications, rather than relying solely on the cloud.\n\n“AI PCs will bring the most exciting innovation to the PC industry in the last two to three decades, since the creation of the World Wide Web in the late 1980s,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note last month.\n\nThey said that running AI applications on devices would be cheaper and more flexible than on the cloud and would also have benefits for data privacy. AI PCs will make up about 65 per cent of PC shipments by 2028, up from 2 per cent this year, Morgan Stanley predicted.\n\n—————\nNow here’s the smartest comment I’ve read in the Financial Times comment thread for this article:\n\n“The competition doesn't stand a chance.\n\nRapid product cycle upgrades which will be backward compatible just emphasises how far ahead Nvidia's hardware and software has now become.\n\nAnd given the geo-strategic nature of AI capability, there is zero chance of the US Government standing in Nvidia's way with any significant anti-trust intervention.\n\nThis company looks and feels like Microsoft and Intel combined from the 1990's and 2000's PC/Internet era, which is why I expect it to continue its march higher and become the world's most valuable company before the end of 2024.\n\nAstonishing company and equally amazing leader.”\n\nGuys, idk.

{"title": "Why LULU is set to rebound 🚀", "selftext": "Ever wondered where that one good play is? That one gamble you‘d throw your whole life savings at? Well you sick apes if you listened to me last friday your calls would be already worth +30% . https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/vYojHVvnHl\n\nSo here‘s why I YOLOed my whole life savings into long term LULU calls (exp JUN07):\n\nThe market overreacted after the last earnings report, causing the stock to crash. Historically, the stock is now significantly undervalued. And looking at the chart, LULU has only dipped deeply below $300 ONCE, back in 2020. For the past four years, it has ALWAYS rebounded quickly from the $300 level, making this a prime buying opportunity for you apes.\n\nLULU also has a solid financial health, a strong market position, and high-profit margins. Their new products hit stores in May, which bodes well for the next earnings report. Regarding the product officer who left a few days ago: yes he left but that won't impact next week's earnings, not even Q2 but it will have effects in 2025. There’s no way this stock won’t go up after pricing in the worst of the worst\n\nTLDR: LULU‘s weakness is overstated. They have great fundamentals, solid financial health, consistently beat estimates, and after the market's overreaction last time, the stock is poised to rebound. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 \n\nPosition: 28k worth 72 350C for JUN07 balls deep already 11k gain printed.
