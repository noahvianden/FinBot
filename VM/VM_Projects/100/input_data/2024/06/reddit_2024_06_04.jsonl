{"title": "Elon Musk ordered Nvidia to ship AI chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI ", "selftext": "Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure.\n\nOn Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.”\n\nBut emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nBy ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\n“Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.”\n\nA more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory.\n\nThe new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCritics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023.\n\nX and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, “X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.” Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot, called Grok, CNBC has learned.\n\nMusk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with “a rebellious streak” and a would-be competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI services.\n\nWhile Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”\n\nTesla’s stock price is down 29% this year.\n\nRather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla, Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he’s been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network.\n\n“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” Musk said on the April earnings call. “We will, and we are.”\n\nTo get there, he’s said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia’s GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others.\n\n‘Consuming every GPU that’s out there’\n\nNvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it’s hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers “are consuming every GPU that’s out there,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth.\n\nHuang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to “allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,” adding “why allocate something when the data center’s not ready?”\n\nIn naming customers that are already using Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla.\n\nMusk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies.\n\nAt Tesla, Musk has promised to build a $500 million “Dojo” supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a “super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster” at the company’s factory in Austin, Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles.\n\nAt xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build “the world’s largest GPU cluster” in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February.\n\nThe memo described a “Musk mandate” to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI’s Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity.\n\nThe Information previously reported some details of xAI’s data center ambitions.\n\nOn May 26, xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk’s Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn’t disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nWhile Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a post on X in January that he’d want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction.\n\n“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” he said in the post.\n\nTesla’s latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company’s outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal.\n\nIf he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” He’s already doing that at xAI.\n\nMusk’s comments at the time rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company’s largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki’s Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as “blackmail.”\n\nJoel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent.\n\n“When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,” Fleming said. “If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.”\n\nFleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain.\n\n“That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,” Fleming said.\n\nMusk hasn’t been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies.\n\nFor example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once.\n\nAt xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup.\n\nA former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, where he was chairman and a top shareholder.\n\nHowever, the person said, redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme, given the scarcity of Nvidia’s technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self-driving software and robotics.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html", "id": "1d7wmef", "created_utc": 1717506180.0, "score": 575, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 220, "comments": [{"body": "This should strengthen the Tesla shareholders to vote against his ludicrous pay package, heck he isn’t even doing things in the best interest of Tesla, the publicly listed company.

There just aren't enough hours in the day, and I don't really need more evidence than that. It has been blatantly obvious in the news cycle when he is spending the majority of his time focused on a particular company, especially with Twitter and SpaceX at various times over the last 5 years.\n\nThis ignores other things like him getting involved in random things like Twitter feuds with random people, banging female executives and having children with them, and all the other random stuff he gets into that would clearly draw time away from his ability to manage all of these companies.\n\n> You’re also saying he’s lying his ass off on earnings calls. It’s interesting that you know that to be unquestionable truth, yet that would certainly be an issue to address with SEC.\n\nIt's the unquestionable truth because he makes claims on the earnings calls about what will happen in the next year, and it doesn't happen. And then he makes the same claim next year. He is always hyping, and rarely delivering anything close to what he claims in reality. Obviously I can't predict anything about his latest earnings calls, but when I go back to previous earnings calls I can objectively analyze what percentage of his predictions come true and the answer is shockingly low.\n\n> Lastly, this deal was made in 2018.

Unbelievable to me more people aren’t jumping in on a company so critical to the likely most important industry of the next 20 years, not even considering the fact TSMC is at an every day direct threat of being invaded by China.\n\nReasons to buy Intel off the top of my head, with my expectation that the stock is near Microsoft levels by 2030:\n\n18A- 4 nodes in 5 years is on track.Gelsinger is quoted as saying, “I’ve bet the company on 18A.” 18A will be the first node to utilize backside power and give a 6% increase in processing speeds. That’s in addition to the gains moving from 20A to the more advanced 18A node. These efficiencies are obviously incredibly important when it comes to the advancement of chip technology. Samsung and TSMC won’t have the ability utilize backside power until 2026.\n\nEUV lithography Machines- Intel bought all 5 of ASML’s 2024 machines, leaving its competitors with nothing until late 2025 at the earliest. These machines are the key to producing the most advanced chips in the world in the most efficient way possible with Intel planning on utilizing them for their 14A nodes. They will have, at minimum, a year head start on their rivals with how to best use this technology at a mass scale.\n\nChips act/subsidies: currently the largest beneficiary. Us government is heavily subsidizing their commercial fabs as well as one specific for national defense. Germany, Ireland and Israel are all giving massive subsidies to build their fabs.\n\nIFS: Intel's initiative to provide manufacturing services to other semiconductor companies. It leverages Intel's advanced manufacturing processes and technologies to produce custom chips for clients. This move marks Intel's expansion beyond designing and producing its own chips to offering its manufacturing capabilities to external customers, competing with other foundries like TSMC and Samsung Foundry. Intel aims to capitalize on its cutting-edge fabrication facilities and expertise to serve a broad range of customers in various industries. They have billions in pre orders already for 18A technology with MSFT already.\n\nTSMC Geopolitics: TSMC's operations in Taiwan make it vulnerable to geopolitical tensions with China. Any disruption in the region could impact TSMC's supply chain and operations.\n\nMobileye- is an Israeli technology company specializing in the development of vision-based advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving technology. Mobileye's technology includes features like lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems. Intel sold of 1.5 billion worth and still own 88% of the company. The stock is up big this year.\n\nHealthcare: Intel has been involved in the healthcare sector for quite some time. Intel's technology is used in various healthcare applications, including medical devices, data analytics, and telehealth solutions\n\nFinancials: Intel's financials remain strong, with a solid balance sheet, consistent revenue growth, and healthy cash flow generation when not spending tens of billions on the most important fabrication plants in the world. Long history of returning value to shareholders.\n\nThe obvious benefits of being an American Semi Conductor company when national security in the industry is being looked at as paramount.\n\nI feel like I’m taking crazy pills that this stock is only 30$ while AMD hovers around 200$.

Intel is nowhere close to a dead company. To think that is a lack of understanding of what they do. Intel products have long lasting integrations in the enterprise space which is arguably the most important. Having something that just works in an enterprise is crucial. \n\nAMDs rise comes from a few key events. Bringing in skilled engineers is one but not as large as you think. They have TSMC making their chips now, which is key. Intel decided early into that process that they wanted to go back to creating their own chips. This process slowed during covid but continued. Their first fab went up in Israel about 2ish years ago I think. Many countries wanted to prevent the supply chain issues we saw and countries like the US have started trying to invite chip manufacturers to produce in their countries. To expand their fabs across the globe they cut their dividends pretty harshly to reinvest that money. \n\nAdditionally, creating your own fab has many growing pains. Couple that with and strengthen their position is what's making them look so good. And their chips are great I have the 3700x in my machine right now. But that doesn't mean Intel is \"a dead company\". If AMD could stay in business for 15 years before they shifted to a new platform, Intel won't die in 5.

Besides for those 2, the only other CPU is RISC-V which is still in early testing, equal to performance of a 20-25 year old computer with no compatibility with common components, and Russian developed which you couldn't pay me to use. \n\nThey'll be back eventually, it's one you buy in pieces and hold.

Again, the decline in US sales compared to RoW sales is dramatic.\n\n(3) TSLA share price was NOT at $400 during the funding secured and submarine incidents, which were in 2018.   Those incidents were also different.  Neither involved hotbutton political issues.  In the submarine incident, Elon was attacked first in the media by the British cave diver.  I don't agree with Elon libeling that cave diver, but I understand why he felt he needed to hit back after being insulted on live television.\n\nWhether rational or not, Elon's behavior today is deterring some potential customers from buying Tesla products.  When there are fewer $ chasing what Tesla is producing, Tesla has to lower prices.  That is basic supply and demand.  Tesla leaders shouldn't be alienating any potential customers.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": ">Tesla threw out its plans for the \"unboxed\" manually driven NGV platform vehicle. They're going all-in on Robotaxi for NGV. Plans for getting up to 20 million vehicles/year produced are scrapped in favor of 3 million vehicles/year on existing lines.\n\n>That's a dramatic slowdown in ambition for EV production.\n\nYeah you clearly don't know what you're talking about. I know they removed the sentence in the impact report but under no circumstance were they going to hit that goal by 2030 regardless.\n\nHowever, if you read Walter Isaacson's biography you will learn that internall the goal has shifted to producing 20 million Robotaxis.\n\nAdditionally they've actually said they're still pursuing the unboxed process, just not for this next generation of vehicles, or at least not the first iteration of it, which will be made in Texas. It's possible the next iteration of cars from the Mexico factory will use the unboxed process.\n\nAnd re: your \"evidence\". IMO what you're presenting is not concrete evidence. You're showing a drop in sales but there is no evidence of the causal relationship in the drop and Elon's tweets. Again, you're conviction on this issue is akin to believing in God. It's faith based.\n\nFurthermore your geographic sales comparison isn't valid not just because of differences in interest rates. There are also other incentives, from subsidies and tax credits to inventory discounts which aren't just different from place to place but also time to time. You would need to look at each of those in 2024 and compare them to 2023 to normalize for those events.\n\nIn addition to incentives, there are also holidays like the Chinese New Years which can significantly impact production and delivery in Q1 depending on whether or not line workers were given vacation time. There is the timing of factory upgrades.\n\nAnd there is also the timing of the Model 3 Highland launch which undoubtedly has and had an effect on sales. Notably, the refreshed Model 3 launched in China before the US! The refreshed Model 3 launched in China on September 1st of 2023, but the refresh was only made available for order on Jan. 10th 2024 in the US with the first deliveries happening in Q2! Therefore it's reasonable to assume that many US-based Model 3 buyers delayed their purchases into the 2nd Quarter of 2024 whereas China\\_based buyers were already receiving the refreshed Model 3 in the 1st quarter! That alone could easily account for the 10% difference in sales declines between the two regions.\n\nI will say it again, your argument is nonsense and i just proved why. This is how blinded by bias you are. You aren't looking at the totality of evidence or facts, nor are you being objective. You're upset because the stock is down, and you're looking for a scapegoat. Then you look at only the evidence that supports your theory, and ignore the rest, without actually questioning the validity of the evidence. Classic confirmation bias and also dunning-kruger effect.\n\nBut go ahead and downvote me because i said things that don't agree with your own internalized narrative. IDGAF. You're only fooling, and ultimately harming, yourself!\n\nTesla's still have the highest retention rates. They're still the best selling EVs in the US.

The CTA oversees part of the Securities Information Processor (SIP) which consolidates all protected bid/ask quotes and trades into a single data stream.\n\nThe CTA said it experienced problems with price banding which “may have been related to a new software release” on SIP. As a result the CTA has reverted to the previous version of the software. The CTA did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nDuring the blip, the NYSE placed halts on certain trades, and will seek to determine which are erroneous and thus eligible to be canceled. The technical issue has now been resolved, it added, with all tickers trading as normal.\n\nTraders who didn’t hop on a discounted Berkshire Hathaway stock but did buy heavily discounted shares in other brands will also be subject to having their trades struck off—with the ruling not eligible for appeal.\n\nOther tickers that were impacted include American restaurant chain Chipotle (CMG), mining company Barrack Gold Corporation (GOLD) and meme stock darling\" \\*redacted\\*. \n\n\\[Full Article\\](https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-discount-deals-canceled/)", "id": "1d7vn6u", "created_utc": 1717503246.0, "score": 2452, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 470, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 762 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 6 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So the correct answer is whoever got them we all help shield and give guidance on the legal side as to win.

Thanks. \n\n\nPALO ALTO, Calif., Jan. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tesla today announced a new 10-year CEO performance award for Elon Musk with vesting entirely contingent on achieving market cap and operational milestones that would make Tesla one of the most valuable companies in the world. In order to fully vest, Tesla's market cap would have to grow to $650 billion (an increase of almost $600 billion), and important revenue and profitability goals would also have to be achieved. The award is modeled after Elon's 2012 performance award, which helped bring about a more than 17-fold increase in Tesla's market cap in the five years after it was put in place.\n\nElon will receive no guaranteed compensation of any kind - no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that vests simply by the passage of time. Instead, Elon's only compensation will be a 100% at-risk performance award, which ensures that he will be compensated only if Tesla and all of its shareholders do extraordinarily well. Because all Tesla employees are provided equity, this also means that Elon's compensation is tied to the success of everyone at Tesla.\n\nCEO Performance Award Details\n\nThe performance award consists of a 10-year grant of stock options that vests in 12 tranches. Each of the 12 tranches vests only if a pair of milestones are both met.\n\nMarket Cap Milestones: To meet the first market cap milestone, Tesla's current market cap must increase to $100 billion. For each of the remaining 11 milestones, Tesla's market cap must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments. Thus, for Elon to fully vest in the award, Tesla's market cap must increase to $650 billion.\n \n\nOperational Milestones: To meet the operational milestones, Tesla must meet a set of escalating Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets (the only adjustment to EBITDA is for stock-based compensation). These milestones are even more directly aligned with shareholder value creation than those used in Elon's 2012 performance award. They are designed to ensure that as Tesla's market cap grows, the company is also executing well on both a top-line and bottom-line basis.\n\nFor each of the 12 tranches that is achieved, Elon will vest in stock options that correspond to 1% of Tesla's current total outstanding shares (1% of that amount is approximately 1.69 million shares). If none of the 12 tranches is achieved, Elon will not receive any compensation.\n\nLeading Tesla Through Its Next Phase of Growth\n\nFor vesting to occur when the milestones are met, Elon must remain as Tesla's CEO or serve as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer, in each case with all leadership ultimately reporting to him. This ensures that Elon will continue to lead Tesla's management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future. Although there is no current intention for this to happen, it provides the flexibility as Tesla continues to grow to potentially allow Elon to focus more of his attention on the kinds of key product and strategic matters that most impact Tesla's long-term growth and profitability", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Typical ape.", "score": -5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

They will continue to need more compute over time. If they do another free trial of FSD they'll probably be compute constrained again.\n\nThey. Do. Not. Train. On. Raw. Data. The number of cars is irrelevant. It is not possible to train a vision system without a human in the loop that indicates to the model whether it was successful or unsuccessful. All vision systems are built on this. The amount of data to train on can be predicted.\n\nYou seem to be imagining a world where Tesla cars are driving on FSD, sending data to the Tesla supercomputers that are then training on this data. And that new compute is only needed once the computers can no longer handle all the data coming in. This is not how Tesla works. That is not how anything more complex than the Game of Life works. It is a fantasy version of AI. In reality, there are hundreds of engineers who manually incorporate data into training sets and try to ensure the system doesn't regress in key metrics. \n>They probably assumed their building would be ready by now, but it isn't? You can't predict to the exact month when new construction projects will be ready.\n\nWhy does it matter if the building is ready? There shouldn't be a building at all! Because as you said, they aren't compute-constrained! If you do the math, it doesn't make sense. They claim to have \"the equivalent\" of 35k H100 chips. But then say they need to open a facility that houses 50k H100 chips. Even very optimistic projections for sales will not have them more than double the number of Teslas on the road for years. So again. If they are not compute-constrained, this is a tremendous waste of money.\n\n>That's the only thing. Tesla probably could have charged a permium. However, there is likely agreements made between Nvidia and Tesla, that Tesla can't turn around and resell for higher than MSRP.

If you can ask them to swap the delivery to xAI, you can ask them to swap it to OpenAI or whoever else. And they can pay you for doing so.

The only thing you're right about is they don't literally take every single second of video from every single car and send it to their compute.

{"title": "From 🌈🐻 to 🌈🐂: Why Grindr (GRND) is Primed for a Bull Run", "selftext": "Mistakes are no stranger to me, but I like to think that I learn from them. I'm guilty of shorting NVDA and losing 15% of my IRA, but I believe I've learned my lesson about betting against the market. As a reformed 🌈🐻 I no longer believe in shorting the market because \"stocks only go up,\" right? I believe the market is presenting a chance to redeem myself (and more) as a 🌈🐂 with GRND.\n\nAllow me to introduce the stock.\n\nGrindr probably doesn't need an introduction, but in case it does, check out their website: [https://www.grindr.com/about](https://www.grindr.com/about)\n\nIt's the biggest and most popular social networking app for gay men. They went public a while back at a $2.1 billion valuation.\n\nTake a look at the 12-month chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6e6dmanrhl4d1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=727d735f17ec19c44ba3fca0114e42eb8e8c500c\n\nHere are the highlights from the latest earnings call:\n\n* 33% YoY growth\n* Profitability continues to be very strong, with industry leading margins\n* They expect even higher revenue growth into next year as the monetizaton strategy pays off\n* Company is focused on growing both top and bottom line.\n* The world's not getting any less gay\n* High user engagement with the recently launched \"Grindr Weeklies\"\n* Large investments are being made in adding additional new features and improving existing ones.\n* Strategic executive hires to lead AI division as well as engineer hires to work on AI.\n\nExpanding on the last items, I watched these interviews with the CEO from last September and November where he discusses how AI will revolutionize dating:\n\n* [Grindr CEO discusses how AI will revolutionize dating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXR20BJ4gh0)\n* [Grindr CEO: Matching Is a Big AI Opportunity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-11-14/grindr-ceo-matching-is-a-big-ai-opportunity-video)\n\nGrindr has been very successful since IPO and is planning to roll out new AI features soon which should serve to draw eyes to and whip up market excitment about the stock. Speaking of this, Grindr is hosting its inaugural Investor Day at the end of this month, on June 26th. This means we'll hear directly from the CEO about their AI strategies and growth plans. In the past these events have led to the stock to jump and I'm betting the same will happen this time.\n\nCompared to its peers, Grindr's revenue growth rate and monetization strategy suggest that the stock is currently undervalued. It's trading around $9.50 right now, but I believe it has the potential to reach $15-$20 in the near future, specifically at the end June. I've already taken a position by purchasing some July 20c and June 15c.\n\nLastly, the short interest is sitting at $18%. True short squeezes are a flash in the pan, few and far between. I don't know if this is *necessarily* a squeeze, but it is possible, especially if the gay bears rally to support Grindr.\n\nRegardless I see many reasons to be bullish on Grindr at this valuation, and the stock has plenty of upside in the short-term and long-term. Long term I see this stock 5xing as it grows into its market.

Stand by for news!\n\nYou know, they say you can’t spell \"assistance\" without \"AssCo.\" And indeed, this plucky little AI company has been kicking butt and taking names in the tech world. AssCo (ticker symbol: ASCO) has been the talk of Wall Street, and for good reason.\n\nFounded in the unassuming town of Backside, USA, AssCo was once a small startup with a big dream: to revolutionize artificial intelligence and make our lives easier, one automated task at a time. Now, I know what you’re thinking: \"Paul, is this another one of those fly-by-night tech companies promising the moon and delivering a moon pie?\" Well, hang on to your suspenders, because AssCo is the real deal.\n\nAssCo’s flagship product, the AssistaBot, is the technological equivalent of a well-trained circus monkey – smart, efficient, and always ready to perform. Need a report generated? AssistaBot’s got it. Want your emails sorted? Done. Trying to remember your anniversary? Well, let’s just say AssistaBot has saved more marriages than Dr. Phil.\n\nBut the real kicker, folks, is AssCo’s financial performance. In a market where tech stocks can be as unpredictable as a cat on a hot tin roof, AssCo has shown a bottom line as solid as a rock. Over the past year, their stock has risen faster than a helium balloon at a kids’ birthday party – a whopping 42%! And unlike some other tech firms that run on hype and hot air, AssCo’s growth is backed by genuine innovation and a customer base more loyal than a golden retriever.\n\nLet’s talk about the brains behind the operation: CEO John \"Brains\" Brainard. Now, here’s a man who’s not just ahead of the curve; he’s off in the distance, waving the flag of the future. Brainard’s vision for AssCo is simple: \"Make AI so intuitive, it’s like having a second brain.\" And with the way things are going, he might just pull it off.\n\nOf course, no review would be complete without a look at AssCo’s potential challenges. The tech landscape is as competitive as a pie-eating contest at the county fair, and staying ahead means constant innovation. But if there’s one thing AssCo has proven, it’s that they’ve got the tenacity and the talent to stay in the game.\n\nSo, my fellow investors, if you’re looking for a stock with a solid track record, a bright future, and a name that’s hard to forget, AssCo might just be the ticket. They’re not just sitting on their laurels; they’re on the move, and they’re taking the tech world by storm.\n\nAnd now you know…the rest of the story.

{"title": "Can You Guess When I Started Trading Options?", "selftext": "If you guessed that first peak, you are mistaken. That was a Reddit penny stock that unfortunately pumped and dumped. So after that, I had stumbled upon wallstreetbets and  learned about a more civilized form of investing called options. Things escalated quickly and before I knew it I found myself full ported into Nvidia 7dte right before GTC (March 18-24th). Somehow made it out alive and ahead going from 200k>150k >240k. After that, I pissed away ~40k on various options, and, naturally, decided to test my luck again and full ported on April 9th, expiring April 12th. This took me from 200k to 300k. Then, things took a turn. On April 19th, Nvidia tanked 10% due to smci decision to not release preliminary revenue (talk about abunch of bullshit). I initially told myself I should wait till end of day and then load up on calls right before close (this is my biggest regret). But I saw Nvidia had already dipped 5% that morning and I couldn’t resist and started buying calls around 25k. Every time it dipped I loaded another 25k bullet, but it just kept dipping and I kept firing. Until, finally, I was down to my last 25k bullet and bought right at close. That Friday, my account value at the end of the day fell to 97k (Ouch). Sold Monday and clawed myself back to 150k (this is what I started with when I first opened my account). Then 2 days later, I decided third times the charm, and full ported into Nvidia with 75k into 3dte and the other 75k into a Nvidia call expiring post earnings report. I sold the 3 dte for 110k and held onto the other option through earnings that was now valued at 230k. My account peaked at 383k. Inevitably, I pissed away ~50k (thanks Dell), but I now have the rest of my portfolio in Nvidia stock, like a boomer. Ending my account value around 331k today. I am done with options for the time being. I am going to buy a sauna (for the stress), some workout equipment, a mountain bike, maybe remodel my kitchen, and an espresso machine with my winnings.
