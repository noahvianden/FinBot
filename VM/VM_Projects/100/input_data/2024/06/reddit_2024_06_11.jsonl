{"title": "NVDA short thesis (puts)", "selftext": "Nvidia has soared to new heights that have never before been seen. Easily overtaking Apple as the most valuable company in the world. Now to my immaculate and brilliant short thesis\n\n• Nvidia is currently valued at over $100,000,000 per employee \n• Nvidia has a PE ratio of 71 compared to Apple’s 31\n• Book value per share of $2.00 half of AAPL which has a $4.84 \n• Annual revenue of 60B compared to 383B from Apple\n• 7B cash on hand (28B for Apple) \n\nNow this may just seem like a comparison of why Nvidia is trading at insane multiples compared to Apple. But let’s not forget Apple has been the darling of the Dow for the past 15+ years and it’s going nowhere. Especially after an extremely strong WWDC event that reminded people why Apple is the best company in the world. Nvidia is due for a pullback at these levels. \n\nAI has been nothing but a buzz word as hundred of mega-mid cap companies scramble to acquire chips to create there own LLM and other AI models. However no company yet can even remotely show how their billion dollar investments in AI has born any fruit. As these companies quickly see how fruitless AI is compared to its costs. Many companies will abandon the “AI gold rush” and NVDA strong forecasted growth will shrink and companies stop buying chips/cancel existing orders. \n\nMy final and most well thought out point of my entire short thesis. My 83 year old grandma just asked me if I’d heard of that company called Nvidia because she just bought some in her retirement account. If this is a sign for a pullback I don’t know what is. \n\nCONCLUSION: if my grandma is hopping on the Nvidia hype train. It’s time for us to hop off.

While it is favorable to hate on Boeing right now, and rightfully so due to the grossly negligent actions we’ve learned about from the leadership in the company - statistically speaking this has had virtually zero visible impact on the end result of safety rates flying on their planes so far.\n\nSo far, about 6 years ago when they had the MCAS crashes, those are the only 2 fatal aircraft failures in the ~400,000,000+ commercial flights their planes have operated in the last 20ish years. Both were caused by the same malfunction, both in third world regions where pilot training and airline regulation, maintenance etc is much, much poorer.\n\nBut again - at the same - they denied any issue with their planes until a second crash happened and made it clear that there is a failure in the aircraft’s software.\n\nSo far, the door plug *is* a one-time thing, *so far*. Fortunately, that plus the whistleblower pressure has led to an audit and hearings for Boeing manufacturing and Boeing leadership. Ideally, this puts things back on track for Boeing and their leadership personnel without any deaths ever needing to be a motivating factor, since none thankfully were involved with the door plug failure initially. \n\nUltimately, these safety rates are still best in the airline industry, and the idea that Boeing planes are unsafe and falling out of the skies is a fantasy created by the reporting spin. Nobody should be afraid, especially in a country with good aircraft regulation (like anywhere first-world). \n\n*yet*, at the same time, it’s very possible that if these things like the door plug and the whistleblower didn’t ever happen, the company’s safety practices would have continued to slip in the name of cost savings until a worse accident happened. \n\nIn the end, this is what I mean by saying it’s “somewhere in between”. As anyone with a good level of familiarity with aerospace and the airline industry will tell you - It’s not nearly as bad as the news reporting spin has made it appear for the sake of grabbing clicks at the expense of people’s’ fears of flight. On the other hand, the company’s eroded mentality towards safety practices and the oversights by their leadership deserve major criticism and potentially criminal trials for the leaders responsible for the safety erosions.\n\nEdit: Case and point - Just did the research and Boeing’s accident rate due to aircraft failure is still significantly lower than even Airbus’s, though both companies maintain ridiculously low fatal aircraft failure rates (like you can count them on one hand per decade).   Both stretches are the two best 20 year stretches of aircraft safety any manufacturer has ever seen with their aircraft.

Estimating that standard deviation is **The Hard Part** and is, ultimately, where traders win or lose. You can also adjust it to a skewed distribution if there is an upcoming event and you believe there is an uneven chance of movement up or down, or any number of additional wrinkles you want to add to your model.\n\nIf the expected value is greater than the current premium, it's a good trade.

What!!?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So, options are contracts which give you the right (but not the obligation) to purchase (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of a stock at a given price, by a given date. If that date comes up and it is not favorable to you to execute that contract because the stock price on the open market is better, the contract dies worthless.\n\nSo, as an example, as of market close last night, I could buy a $215 call on Apple stock expiring this Friday, June 14th, for $.58/share (bear in mind that they always control 100 shares, so it would cost me $58). If the price of Apple is up 3% from last night's closing price of $207.15, that would be $213.36. It would not be favorable for me to execute my contract. Why would I spend $215 to buy shares when I could spend less than that? The contract expires worthless and I've lost all of the money I put in.\n\nNow let's say it went up by 5%. Now the stock price is $217.50. So I could execute my contract and buy 100 shares at $215, and then immediately turn around and sell them for $217.50, pocketing the $2.50 difference for a gain of $250. Since I paid only $58 for that right, that's about a 5x increase. The exact multiplier for this 3%/5% scenario depends on a few factors, but basically, for steadier stocks you can make a *lot* of money on a lucky big move. If I bought $553 call on SPY expiring today (I cannot stress enough how **stupid** this would be), then it would fall in that same category of being worthless if SPY moved up 3% today and worth a lot if it moved 5%.\n\nHow much is a lot? The contracts would be $1/100 shares to purchase, and if it went up 5% they'd be worth $1085/100 shares, or a 1085x multiplier. Now, mind you, the S&P has only done this feat a few dozen times over the last 100+ years, and all of them were tied to various financial crises and the volatility that comes therewith: most were during the great depression, but there were a couple in the 2008 crisis and in the early days of the COVID pandemic.

Absolute LEGEND!", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I'll give you the important disclaimers too, because those gains are definitely very tempting and I want to be sure you are aware of the truth: most option buyers lose. I've personally lost about $7000 of $10,660 that I've put in since March of this year. This is money that I've set aside to pay off my student loans, which I'm not in a supreme hurry to do since I'm making my minimum payments and the interest is currently waived, so it definitely hurts to have lost that but I'm not cutting into my life.\n\nOptions contracts work eerily similar to scratch-off lottery tickets. There are uses for them where they hedge against losses in actual stock prices, but fundamentally they are all lottery tickets, with one important difference: you know more about how much they'll be worth closer to the expiration date. So if you buy contracts very far out, there's a lot of uncertainty, and that uncertainty is captured in paying a higher premium for a given strike price. As you get closer, that premium starts to drop unless the stock price has moved in the direction you wanted. What I'm saying is that all options contracts are *decaying assets*. They lose money over time. I *highly* recommend against them for almost any investing scenario except one in which you are using money you absolutely do not need and have a high tolerance for risk. Buying and holding stock also technically has the risk of 100% loss, but I'll leave it to you to find how often stocks, especially of large, well-known companies, go to 0, and how fast (or, rather, slowly) that tends to happen.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "closed up like 7%..just saying 'AI' makes u rich now..", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "when? today.

I saw AAPL rising in the first 5 min this morning… seemed unusual, especially for a company with this large of a market cap. \n\nI queued up a bunch of $197 calls, and hovered my finger over the buy button. I was so close to placing the order. But, I told myself…. “you’ve been here before, and it hasn’t gone well. You need to wait for the first pullback and subsequent confirmation before buying. You need to be disciplined and follow the rules. After all, we’re only a couple dollars away from the ATH.” A simple ABCD set up…. Well….. the pullback never came. Then, the stock traded sideways for quite awhile shortly after. “Surely the price will drop any moment, especially since we are literally touching the ATH… and the stock has tried and failed to break past it twice in the last year. I should hold….” Boom… another run up. This time even higher. Then sideways, then another run up, then sideways. Past the ATH nearly all day. Each time I was sure a massive drop was eminent. So I stayed out until the rise at 1 pm. Pocketed $60 then dipped when I saw the drop happening around 1:20. Came back later to see the price was up another $3. Wtf!? How did I end up only making $60 on a $14/ share increase today?  A play that, had I done what my instincts were telling me to do at 9:35 this morning and clicked the freaking buy button, would have netted me near 10k. This would have been my largest profit by far since starting trading.\n\nSo now, I’m like… ok so do I continue to follow the rules I have set, or what? I break rules and I lose money.
