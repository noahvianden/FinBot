If you put their line charts together, the rises and falls occur directly in relation.  You could overlap them and barely notice the difference. I wouldn't balk at 100+%, though. Although 12 months ago TSMC was almost double per share, you're now $90 up per share vs $76 for NVDA.  Percentage is always the better indicator, obviously, but stock can often slow as it prices out the average Joe.\n\n\n\nNVDA is always going to be the better bet while they're ahead of the game. It's the innovation that people see which drives the market. Apple is an innovator (not so much lately) and they have over 200 supply companies for components that get nothing other than a job order. But  with TSMC, no matter who is at the forefront of innovation, if you have all the contracts, how can you go wrong? There are other companies pushing AI also, but when 3 of the main competitors are also necessary for the consumer market, you're golden. There simply isn't a PC/Laptop in a home or workplace around the world without hardware designed by Intel, AMD, or Nvidia.\n\n\n\nAlphabet is also building AI (have been for many years), but I'm not sure what exactly is going on there as to who is designing and building what and where. Apple too, but again, no idea if in house or not. AWS, which is partnered with Nvidia. Cerebras, which have the fastest chips in the world by a massive amount, although they are literally multi-million dollar chips. I've read they're to IPO soon, but going through Barclays or something- No idea what any of that entails but It would be interesting to see stock prices. IBM is in the race with Samsung building their new Telum chips.  And many others...\n\n  \nInteresting times.... but TSMC just feels very safe with the consumer market as back-up.

It's early game for me and I started playing late. My knowledge in all of this comes from an interest in the PC market.\n\nBut when it comes to business, there's a lot that's blatantly obvious. 2019 to 2021 was a rollercoaster for everyone, but there was a lot of highs for Intel. Short answer; COVID lockdowns. Consumer market boomed. Not so much in new folks entering the market as the Internet became the most efficient way to keep in touch during lockdown, but a few dusted off old machines and ended up upgrading. With nowhere to go and spend our cash, if you were in the \"still employed\" boat, all of a sudden you had a boost in savings. But the majority market was work from home. Business weren't packing up their work machines, they were buying new and writing it off on tax.\n\nCome 2022, it all cooled off, and somewhere along the way, Intel had lost market share to AMD (why, I'm not really sure), and then they went and compounded their kissed with the release of 13th and then 14th gen chips which as you probably know, let everyone down. The problem was that there was nothing stopping excessive voltage, causing instability and even failure. There were quite a few YouTubers that called Intel out on it, one I know went so far as to contact them, and the response was, \"You don't know what you're talking about\". When channels have millions of viewers, word spreads quick. After a lousy couple of years, they've finally got around to updating drivers to prevent over vaultage, and there seems little in the way of an apology.\n\nSo while the chips are now fine, confidence is justly lost. These were their highest end chips, and when people paid $500ish for tech that failed, that's a burnt bridge that can't often be repaired for many. Luckily, they have businesses that have zero clue of what's going on inside the products they purchase who will always buy whatever without a thought.\n\nThese were all events that definitely did their damage to share prices. A highly respected board member left them through all this, too. Intel isn't going anywhere. It's just figuring out when it's going to go up. It shouldn't be forgotten that they're making a push to mobile chips, too. That's a big market. Even if you don't need gaming power, you need a chip and you're going to be paying for it regardless.\n\nI read an article just the other week. Someone was showing off their new game at a convention, and when it came to the younger generation, as they stepped up, they pushed the controller away and reached for the screen. There's a whole generation that's only played games on phones and/or tablets, and so much of that market is people that would never buy a console or gaming PC.
