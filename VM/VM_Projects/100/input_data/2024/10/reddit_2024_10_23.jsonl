I’ve been self employed for maybe as long as that kid has been alive, and my last 401k ended in a layoff in 2008, during our last real recession. I took that money which was $45,000 at that point (down from 90,000 just a month earlier) and I put it all into Apple stock. Left it there for a decade and it went 10x to $500k. That experience made me comfortable with going all in on a favorite stock. I did it again with TSLA for 3 years which didn’t grow nearly as much as a good ETF or the SP500, so I moved over to NVDA back in February. I’m up over $375k in around 8 months. I wish I went all in on NVDA earlier S I missed most of the big exponential growth! My investment strategy is almost never recommended, and one could argue that I’ve simply been very lucky since 2008. One thing for sure is that I am nearing retirement age so I need to diversify and get out of risky stocks soon. So I plan to do just that next year. I’ll still keep NVDA but maybe only 15%’of my holdings, and the rest will be put into safer funds. \n\nMy day trade was surely on the foolish side, but not completely. The next time NVDA spikes, we both know institutions will take profits and the stock will drop the next day or two. I only waited 2 days. The guys who are really risky are the ones who say they are waiting for 10% swings. That’s just like, my opinion though. \n\nAs for that kid, I guess he really couldn’t comprehend the assets of an upper middle class middle aged guy. Imagine if I tried to explain that I also have my own company, a house worth 2 million, a wife who makes 300k a year, and two kids with college tuitions that each cost more than his yearly salary! His head would have exploded lol.\n\nEdit: 80k is 5% of your portfolio?!

{"title": "Tesla shares jump 10% on profit beat as company benefits from environmental credits", "selftext": "Tesla shares jumped 10% following a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report, driven by strong profit margins from environmental credits. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 72 cents, surpassing analysts’ forecasts of 58 cents, though revenue slightly missed expectations at $25.18 billion. Automotive revenue rose 2%, while energy generation and storage revenue surged 52%, showcasing Tesla’s growing diversification.\n\nA significant contributor to Tesla's profitability came from $739 million in regulatory credits, which the company earns for producing only electric vehicles. These credits, essentially pure profit, helped bolster Tesla’s bottom line. Additionally, Tesla hit a milestone with 7 million vehicles produced and reported that its Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time, despite quality challenges.\n\nLooking ahead, Tesla expects modest growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024, even as it faces increasing competition, particularly from Chinese automakers and U.S. legacy brands ramping up their electric vehicle efforts. Some investors are also raising concerns over CEO Elon Musk’s political activities, questioning how it could influence Tesla's brand and stock performance amidst a highly competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains committed to launching more affordable models by 2025.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/23/tesla-tsla-q3-2024-earnings-report.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/23/tesla-tsla-q3-2024-earnings-report.html)", "id": "1galrgu", "created_utc": 1729718518.0, "score": 124, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 177, "comments": [{"body": "Whoever trades Tesla on fundamentals is a true regard", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Sucks to suck , sorry bud", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If this is your opinion then you would have been wrong for the last 5 years.

{"title": "Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat", "selftext": "* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.\n\nHere’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected\n* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected\n\nRevenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.\n\nTesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.\n\nAutomotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.\n\nOperating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.\n\n# \n\nTesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.\n\n# More than just EVs\n\nTesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. \"As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,\" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.\n\n# Balance sheet\n\nTesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nWe delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.\n\nOur cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \\~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our \"We, Robot\" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.\n\nThe Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.\n\nDespite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.", "id": "1gak7c4", "created_utc": 1729714585.0, "score": 343, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 489, "comments": [{"body": "Genuinely, I am shocked.", "score": 358, "replies": [{"body": "Reddit is an echo chamber.", "score": 39, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why?

In the US for example, they're still seeing $7500 federal tax credits on a large percentage of their total sales which allows them to maintain higher MSRPs, translating into higher profit margins.  Most of their sales are in states with state EV tax credits as well, often in the $1500-$2500 range.  Some as high as $5000.\n\nTheir energy sales are even more subsidized than their car sales.

States with the highest rooftop solar adoption rates often have additional incentives on top.  Overall, it can reach up to 50%.  \n\nI'm not sure on their grid scale power storage, but I'm guessing the subsidies and/or the amount they're charging the government, which often has mandates written into law to have storage installed, are lucrative.\n\nLike 2023... if Tesla were to exclude regulatory credit income and government subsidies from their income, they'd likely be reporting a loss for 2024.

We also know that CT sales seem to be cannibalizing model S/X sales... or maybe S/X customers are just going the way of the dodo, and new buyers came in to buy the CT.  Maybe a mix of both.

One can't exist without the other.  If car sales slow down, Tesla offloads excess cells through their energy division.  It just so happens that their energy products are subsidized to a much larger percentage than their vehicles.  How large the overall market is for their energy products is anyone's guess.  Frankly, Li-ion isn't exactly the most cost effective way for storing energy in a static location.  Solar roof seems to generally be a failure of a product.  Ironically, their powerwall sales would likely be far lower if they actually allowed V2L capabilities in their non-CT vehicles.

{"title": "$ACHR Revolutionizing Urban Logistics/Transportation in Congested Metropolitan Cities", "selftext": "**TLDR: Undervalued at 1 billion Dollars, Long Term High Risk/ Very High reward Investment, 2 Major Catalysts Soon, Large emerging market with only 2 current actual competitors(174 bill market by 2034 and 1.5 Trillion by 2040). IMO, current Fair value is $10+.**\n\nI've been diving into the world of eVTOLs lately, and I think Archer Aviation **($ACHR)** is a massively undervalued stock in an overvalued market. With yesterdays FAA approval paving the way for this new industry and some major catalysts on the horizon, I think we are at the moment of being not too early and not too late.\n\n**A New Era in Air Transport**\n\nYesterday, the FAA released groundbreaking regulations approving a new category of air transport: powered-lift aircraft. This is the **first new category of aircraft in nearly 80 years.** This historic rule will pave the way for EVTOLS to start operating, a market projected to be worth **$1.5 trillion by 2040**. This is a significant step towards revolutionizing urban transportation, logistics, and even emergency response services.\n\n[The Future of Transportation](https://preview.redd.it/b8sjqgt6zowd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=971938b24d338e68769b9e1684ff48ef32bc245f)\n\n**What Are eVTOLs?**\n\neVTOLs, or electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft, are a new type of air vehicles that offer a quieter (operating at about 45 dB), more cost-effective in build and operation(Can be 1/10 the cost of a helicopter), and cheap to supply with energy(10-50 minutes of charge in the current state of batteries) alternative to traditional helicopters. They are also easier and quicker to build than helicopters leading to scalability.\n\nThe leading companies in this space are:\n\n* **Archer Aviation (ACHR)** valued at 1.15 Billion at $3.22\n* **Joby Aviation (JOBY)** \\- valued at 4.45 Billion at $6.20\n* **Volocopter** \\- a private German company valued at 1.87 Billion\n\n**Archer Aviations Midnight**\n\nArcher's flagship eVTOL aircraft, the **Midnight**, is designed to revolutionize urban air mobility, especially in congested metropolitan areas. Here's why it stands out:\n\n* **Cost Efficiency**: Operating the Midnight can cost around **$500 per hour**, dramatically less than the **$10,000 per hour** it costs to operate traditional helicopters like the Blackhawk in disaster relief scenarios. This drastic reduction in operational costs comes from its electric propulsion system, which involves fewer mechanical parts and significantly lower maintenance needs. It make it a very affordable faster means of transportation/logistics.\n* **Speed and Range**: Reaches speeds of up to **150 mph** with a range ideal for **20-50 mile** trips, turning hour-long commutes into minutes.\n* **Quick Turnaround**: Equipped with a battery system that can **charge in minutes(10-40 depending on route) between flights**, allowing for rapid back-to-back operations.\n* **Safety Features**:\n   * **Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP)**: Uses **12 electric motors** and **12 propellers**, so if one fails, others compensate—no single point of failure.\n   * **Redundancy**: Features **6 independent battery packs** for enhanced reliability.\n* **Quiet Operation**: Operates at around **45 dBA** during forward flight, significantly quieter than traditional helicopters, reducing urban noise pollution.\n* **Payload**: Can carry over **1,000 lbs**, suitable for both passenger transport and potential cargo operations.\n* **Ease of Production**: Designed to be **easy and quick to build** for scalable manufacturing.\n* **Efficiency in Development**: Archer completed its required 400 flight hours for testing significantly ahead of schedule(4 months).\n* **Military Interest**: U.S. Air Force entered into contracts with Archer Aviation worth up to **$142 million** due to its advanced capabilities, aesthetic appeal, and potential applications in rapid response and logistics\n* **Significant Backlog of Orders**: Archer has amassed a **backlog of orders worth nearly $6 billion**, highlighting strong market demand and confidence in the Midnight's potential.\n\n[Archer Midnight](https://preview.redd.it/x8xbkx8mzowd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ea39ef5ab8569a32edd07b4e11a28caf28f951)\n\n[Archer Midnight](https://preview.redd.it/dt1t7i7rzowd1.png?width=318&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d1ef5dc2040c0f950f40a32e885c7088d87c2a9)\n\n  \n**Upcoming Catalysts for ArcherOpening of the Covington, Georgia Factory**\n\n1. **Upcoming Earnings Report (November 7, after market close)**\n   * **Potential Highlights**:\n      * **Funding Updates**: Possible announcements of new funding or partnerships.\n      * **Operational Milestones**: They've completed over 400 test flights 4 months ahead of schedule. This indicates that they are laser focused on getting to the market asap with possible updated guidance and timelines.\n      * **Market Expansion**: In the last month, the CEO went to Abu Dhabi and major announcement is rumored to be about their operation in Abu Dhabi next year as the first market. Moreover, they were in discussion in India for a possible operation over there.\n      * **New Funding?**: With Archer beating deadlines, I'm optimistic for some type of funding being announced. I wish for an announcement of No offerings lol for certain period of time like AST did where the stock rose from $8 to $27 but I dont think this would happen here just wishful thinking.\n\n**Financial Situation and Institutional Interest**\n\nArcher Aviation's financial footing is solid, especially for a company pioneering a new industry:\n\n* **Cash Reserves and Runway**:\n   * As of Q2, **$590 million** with a quarterly cash outflow of about **$80-90 million**, they have an **18-month runway**.\n* **Backlog of Orders**:\n   * They have a massive **$6 billion** backlog for their Midnight aircraft, indicating strong future revenue potential.\n* **Stellantis Partnership**:\n   * Stellantis is contributing up to **$400 million** to help Archer ramp up production to 650 units annually. Stellantis will cover manufacturing labor costs and capital expenditures for initial production.\n   * **Warrants Issued**: Archer has issued **$30 million** in performance warrants to Stellantis, which vest upon achieving certain milestones.\n* **Military Contracts**:\n   * **U.S. Air Force Deal**: Contracts worth up to **$142 million**, including the delivery of up to six Midnight aircraft and collaboration on pilot training and maintenance.\n* **Institutional Ownership**: As of Q2, 21 hedge funds held positions in ACHR with around 31% institutional ownership.\n\n**Leadership**\n\n* Billy Nolen, Former acting FAA Administrator, was pouched from the FAA to act now as Archer's Chief Safety Officer. His main job is to speed certification ASAP.\n* **CEO Adam Goldstein,** aka the Kendall Roy that Logan always wished for (doppelganger), is very active on social media with him making a video on Youtube after every Quarterly earnings explaining what happened in the quarter in details. I really respect this level of transparency as it shows how confident they are. They also actively invite YouTubers and media to tour their facilities and provide detailed updates on the manufacturing process and progress.\n\n**Valuation Gap: Archer vs. Joby why archer should be At +$10**\n\n* **Market Caps**:\n   * **Archer (ACHR)**: \\~$1.1 billion\n   * **Joby Aviation (JOBY)**: \\~$4.43 billion\n\nWhile Joby is ahead in development and timelines (10-20% ahead) with recently receiving FAA authorization for a software platform, at its current valuation, ACHR is very undervalued. It has a **$6 billion** backlog of orders for their **Midnight** aircraft, Secured contracts worth up to **$142 million** with the U.S. Air Force and has strong partnerships with industry giants like **Stellantis** and **United Airlines.**\n\nIMO, **current fair valuation for ACHR should be at least at +$10**(This post is already long can go into details if you like in a future post) and we would still not be at JOBYs current valuation\n\n**Risks and Considerations**\n\nInvesting in emerging technologys such as eVTOLS is High Risk/ High reward:\n\n* **Regulatory and Technological Risks**: Delays in FAA certification or unforeseen technical issues could disrupt progress.\n* **Financial Risks**: This industry requires high capital which increases the risk of debt and dilution.\n* **Operational Risks**: Manufacturing complexities or infrastructure challenges could delay production timelines.\n* One bad incident in this industry could derail everything\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nACHR provides a great entry point for this new industry as it's very undervalued (**Fair value +$10**) in my opinion. It's a long term High Risk(the type that might go to zero lol)/ Very High Reward play if everything pans out according to plan.\n\nI'm not a financial advisor and this post isn't financial advice. This DD is very highly speculative and might contain mistakes. It's an opinion post and my opinion might be wrong lol. That being said, don't invest in this stock based on this DD and do your own research.\n\n[.](https://preview.redd.it/5ub7baxo2jwd1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ae4b999b8cd218bd68a597e86152bec16695758)", "id": "1gae2h6", "created_utc": 1729699135.0, "score": 2067, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 9 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 138 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "a partnership with Japan Airlines could even be announced according to the Japanese press", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "With Archer?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Japan Airlines has suddenly switched its \"flying car\" partner for the 2025 World Expo (Osaka-Kansai Expo) from Germany's Volocopter to the US's Archer Aviation.

{"title": "$TSLA: The DD of a lifetime. ", "selftext": "Hello, everyone! As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let’s crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. \n\n1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later).\n2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event.\n3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. \n\nKeeping all of this in mind, this isn’t even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk’s Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. \n\nOn the day of Tesla’s Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. \n\nOn the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn’t tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. \n\nSeems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he’s in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. \n\nNow guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? \n\n*15 fucking times*. \n\nYou heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That’s triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn’t, and he’s letting us know right below our own nose! \n\nAll of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I’m betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk’s tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. \n\nThis is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. \n\nPositions: 15 minutes before market close, I’ll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th. \n\n*note*: This is NOT financial advice. Any losses on $TSLA options deep OOTM is a result of your regardedness, not mine.

In the waning days of 2007, all four of those major customers independently cancelled their contracts with me within a week.  (And the stock market had recently hit an all time high in Oct 2007 and the press was crowing how we had escaped the worst of any downturn from the housing bubble and were on the path to a soft landing.) Most people were pretty oblivious to the economy in their daily lives.\n\nOver the next few months we had Bear Stearns collapse and eventually Lehman Brothers. By Sep 2008 there was panic, and talk of something new called “quantitative easing.”  I recall about a two week period where stocks just plummeted everyday.  \n\nThen the calming voices came onto to tv.  I recall DJT (long before he was political) saying he was considering buying a lot of stock.  Warren Buffett wrote an OpEd titled “Buy America.  I Am.”  Indeed, after the crash it WAS a generational buying opportunity for those WHO HAD CASH TO INVEST.\n\nBack on the home front, my business had disappeared as previously discussed.  My house eventually dropped 60% from peak to trough, although it took years.  First the pricing just trickled down.  Then, around 2010-2012 it plummeted as a wave of cheap foreclosures became the competition.  And my stocks dropped in half, although their recovery started in 2009, long before housing bottomed.  I’m grateful that I did have cash reserves and that I doubled down on stocks circa 2008/2009.\n\nAdvice:  I think it’s essentially impossible to know how, or exactly when, a serious financial crisis will play out.  Whatever “bet” you make is likely a coin toss because something unexpected will almost certainly occur.\n\nHowever, having cash ready to deploy when most people do not is the answer.  Today Buffett has an unfathomable cash pile.  I doubt he knows anything other than these two things:  1.  Stocks are expensive today.  2.  He’ll be able to recognize and react when they’re cheap.  \n\nMy suggestion to all is to have a big cash cushion.  If you lose your job or income you’ll need it for bills.

Once Tesla does catch up, they have an Apple-like distribution advantage where all their cars can become robotaxis in an instant. Tesla has made 7M vehicles. In 3 years, that will become ~15M vehicles. I really don't see a world where Waymo can expand to even 5-10% of that install base by that time simply because it's too capital intensive to do so..the only way they could get close would be by partnering with rental car companies but then they'd have to install and retrofit their sensors to multiple models of cars.

Compute: Elon’s companies have the largest running gpu cluster on earth that is training their models (100,000-200,000 H100)\n3.

Sensor fusion complexity: Karpathy argued that processing data from multiple sensors like LIDAR and radar creates “a lot of bloat in the code and data pipelines”\\[5\\]. He suggested that having to integrate and reconcile data from different sensor types adds unnecessary complexity.\n2. Radar interference: During his CVPR talk, Karpathy revealed that Tesla’s computer vision system had advanced to the point where the vehicle’s radar was “starting to contribute noise”\\[4\\]. This led Tesla to remove radar from their vehicles.\n3. Vision-only approach: Karpathy advocated for a pure vision-based approach, arguing that cameras can provide sufficient information for autonomous driving\\[1\\]. He stated, “When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.”\n4. Potential drawbacks of multiple sensors: Karpathy suggested that having multiple sensors can sometimes lead to contradictory data, which can be problematic if not handled correctly\\[5\\].\n5. Future predictions: He predicted that other companies will also drop additional sensors like LIDAR in time, focusing primarily on vision\\[5\\].\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that this view is not universally accepted in the autonomous driving industry. Many other companies still believe in the value of sensor fusion, arguing that different sensors can complement each other and provide redundancy for safety\\[4\\]\\[5\\]. They acknowledge the added complexity but consider it worthwhile for the potential benefits in reliability and safety.\n\nSources \\[1\\] Watch Tesla Vision Development Explained By Company’s AI Guru [https://insideevs.com/news/515731/karpathy-tesla-ai-vision-autonomous/](https://insideevs.com/news/515731/karpathy-tesla-ai-vision-autonomous/) \\[2\\] Tesla AI chief explains why self-driving cars don’t need lidar [https://bdtechtalks.com/2021/06/28/tesla-computer-vision-autonomous-driving/](https://bdtechtalks.com/2021/06/28/tesla-computer-vision-autonomous-driving/) \\[3\\] Tesla AI chief explains why self-driving cars don’t need lidar [https://venturebeat.com/business/tesla-ai-chief-explains-why-self-driving-cars-dont-need-lidar/](https://venturebeat.com/business/tesla-ai-chief-explains-why-self-driving-cars-dont-need-lidar/) \\[4\\] Is camera-only the future of self-driving cars? | ADAS & Autonomous Vehicle International [https://www.autonomousvehicleinternational.com/features/is-camera-only-the-future-of-self-driving-cars.html](https://www.autonomousvehicleinternational.com/features/is-camera-only-the-future-of-self-driving-cars.html) \\[5\\] Former Head Of Tesla AI Explains Why They’ve Removed Sensors [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2022/10/31/former-head-of-tesla-ai-explains-why-theyve-removed-sensors-others-differ/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2022/10/31/former-head-of-tesla-ai-explains-why-theyve-removed-sensors-others-differ/)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "But his tweet hurt my feelings", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Hi MAN!\nYou have your reason! \nBut make a 2nd Hypo with negative outcomes is always better! \nG.
