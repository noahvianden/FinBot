I can see all of the comments and posts that were removed. Most were removed by automod, most of the others were objectively trash comments, which is expected, because the median age on this subreddit is in the low twenties, and the median amount of investment experience of a poster is pretty marginal. Sometimes I mildly disagree with mod decisions, but I don't overrule them. Most of the mods on this subreddit were elected by the community long ago in contest-mode posts. I know that a lot of the mods aren't enthusiastic about lots of posts of very popular stocks, but I like the community to dictate content. \n\nAs a commenter, I am biased with regard to whether I think any given stock will go up or down in the next year or so. As a mod, I believe in neutrality, which is a cornerstone of information sciences. I like to bull and bear cases in the comments of posts. I even like to see downvoted comments on every post. I don't believe that comments I don't agree with lead to impure thoughts and must be banned. I think that ideally, dialectical debate is the best way to combat mis/disinformation or misguided opinions, and you can't get that without a self-nominated Socratic foil in an argument. But, I'm often wrong, and every time there is a bull-bear debate, one of those people is right about the direction of the stock for a forward time period. \n\nBut, though this is a large subreddit, it is small compared to meme stock subreddits, and it makes sense that many mods will get tired of allowing the \"to the moon\" contingent to repeatedly post about stocks with trash fundamentals. \n\nBut, you should think about your central thesis: that somehow mods unethically decided that they would pump the price of second largest company in the world by restricting bear opinions on a relatively tiny corner of the Internet. To me, that doesn't sound like a good plan to make money. A better plan would be to allow penny stock posts and only allow one penny stock of the month to be posted, and censor all comments saying that a penny stock is trash, and hope to get illegally get fractional pump-and-dump gains off of that. But, penny stock posts aren't allowed and we have to get in constant debates with users about what is or isn't a penny stock. So, if we are profoundly unethical and trying to make money through unethical mod actions, then we are also profoundly stupid for not realizing that pump and dumps only really work with penny stocks. I can't even begin to follow your logic. Especially, when, as you noted, there are bears in this post, and almost every other post that gets a lot of comments. \n\nThe reason you see a forest of deleted comments is because the bot and sock puppet problem gets worse and worse every year. See Twitter if you want to get a feeling for how bad it is. The bot problem will continue to get worse and worse every year. More and more new accounts, and more and more new accounts that are LLM drivel will be restricted by automod every year.

They even have sliding doors on the 'cyber bus' so they either make that in house, if they didn't just buy an oem solution which would be smarter anyway, and obviously did think of them. \n\nSliding doors are less prone to fail mechanically as they are simple as hell and they can probably just buy the hardware from existing suppliers so getting parts is trivial.  Tesla's reputation on parts availability and service availability hasn't been great as if late. If they don't have the required capacity in both hardware and people to service the current cars out there in a reasonable time, how is that going to get any better with thousands of these things added to 'the fleet'? \n\nSliding doors are more practical, they offer the same width of access with the added bonus that they don't have the door sticking out and above the point of entry. There are quite a few tall people walking about in the world and with gullwings doors, getting in and out is annoying as there's a very real possibility of hitting your head. Especially when entering the car or walking around it as you can hit your head on the edges. \n\nGullwings/Falcon doors also need space around and above the vehicle limiting where it can load and unload passengers. Compared to sliding doors that don't have this issue at all. Sure it looks cool as hell but there's a reason they are only used on exotics for the most part. An exotic sports car isn't made to be practical but to be fast and look cool doing it. A taxi is made to be practical and comfortable. Adding fancy gimmicks isn't sensible from that perspective. Which makes one wonder what the exact design focus was. It seems it's more to make a flashy, futuristic looking car aimed at rich tech-bro investors. Not a practical, asshole-proof vehicle meant for the general public. I'm not saying you can't make a practical taxi that looks cool. But choosing (complicated) form over function in a taxi is just stupid.  \n\nThe choice for making it a two seater also raises this question actually. Why not make it a 5 seater with good trunk/frunk capacity and the option to fold the back row in sections to increase storage capacity. That would make it more usable for an array of use cases. Now instead of having to make more models to fit different use cases you have one that's a jack of all (well most) trades. \n\nAnd to top it all off, it's not like Tesla had this tech figured out completely quite yet.

A strangle is a position that requires active mgt. You want to balance your deltas as needed or at regular intervals. For the most part, strangles don't often reach a high level of max profit as a whole. Typically, you will have one leg that gets rolled up or down 1-3 times on a 45 DTE entry, before you roll the position out or scratch it entirely. I often wait longer than I probably should to scratch a trade, but I hate buying back extrinsic at a loss.\n\n>Do you ever use skewed strangles\n\nNot really. If I have a directional assumption, I'll use a directional position. There are factors like liquidity and IV that will naturally skew a position in terms of the moneyness of the strikes. For example a 16 delta put will often be a few strikes further OTM than the same delta call.\n\n>If the trade starts going against you, you just close it when it reaches de %loss or is there a smarter way to hedge?\n\nIf you keep your positions small, its highly unlikely that a position will go so much against you that it causes problems. This is where managing your overall portfolio becomes important. Too many thetagangers are way over concentrated in their holdings. You have to understand how correlated your holdings are. Sometimes a position may seem like a great opportunity, but if its highly correlated to your other stuff, you're actually just adding risk.\n\nI don't have a set % loss that I will close a position at. I may get tired of looking at a position that keeps getting worse and decide to roll it sooner rather than later. This is a more complicated topic about risk mgt.
