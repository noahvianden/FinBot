I'd assume they'd use the regular Tesla seats for less variation.\n\nDid anyone else think Cybervan looks like iron man? I agree a minivan option for large families is going to be needed.

Watch for the large interest supports nov/dec $225C. As long as those are around downside is limited until earnings next week. If those disappear the window to $170-200 opens. I don't see it going meaningfully lower than $170, but if it does that's the time to start loading up on more long term shares.\n\nOnce again, I point out potential bad outcomes for TSLA because just how expensive it is and how much is already priced in.

Model 3 and Y have hit their TAM, Model S and X are slowly shrinking and Cybertruck will ramp up to \\~250k units per year, so there may be 10% growth left for the existing models. Let's call it $25 billion / quarter or $100 billion / year in 2026. Assume a very rosy 20% automotive gross margin. That's $20 billion in gross profit in 2026.\n\nEnergy storage is only starting to ramp up, so there is plenty of growth left to go. The new Megapack factory will double existing capacity, so my guess is maximum $10 billion / quarter or $40 billion/year in revenue by 2026. Assume gross margins for energy of around 30%. That's $12 billion in gross profit by 2026. \n\nLet's be optimistic and say that $20 + $12 billion in gross profit translates into $20 billion net earnings. Multiply that with a high multiple of 40 and you get a $800 billion dollar enerprise value (in 2026).  We are now at \\~750billion market cap. \n\nFSD (unsupervised) won't be available until end of next year at the earliest. And only then in select regions, so revenue is very limited. Robotaxi won't start operating until end of 2026 at the earliest, so won't be generating revenue. If/when autonomy is fixed and Tesla starts operating massive autonomous fleets, the money will start pouring in. Until that time, it's a very pricey car that has stopped growing profits + a battery company with a great future ahead. \n\nI'm still torn about selling. I don't see profits increasing significantly until at least end of 2026 and I'm fed up with the broken promises. BUT the long term future is bright.

Especially since it was delayed for two months. You would have expected more. It's also one of those events you have to be there to grasp the full experience. A humanoid robot walking around you is still surreal and can't be replicated through a screen. So is a driverless van transporting 20 people. So I am taking that into account.\n\nMy qualms have more to do with the lack of info.\n\n2) Let's be honest, Optimus as it was presented isn't going to happen within this decade. Musk keeps regurgitating what it will be able to do but there's just no way it can water plants, wash dishes, and transport groceries within the next 10 years, IMO. \n\n3) There are disengagements in FSD... I'm not sure what Musk is riding but it's clearly not anywhere close to ready for L5. I am a fan of the 2025 release for Texas/California as a proof of concept but I am not optimistic about it being achieved by 2025. FSD has made huge and significant improvements this year switching to machine-learning but needs work in very specific critical circumstances. \n\n4) I'm totally confused by the RoboVan, which is the biggest shock in all of this. Firstly, why? The TAM is just not there for a product like this. Secondly, while it looks amazing, this was RANDOM as fuck. Couldn't we just have created a CyberVan of the same size as the Cybertruck with 7 seats or 2 seats and a large cargo area for people in the trades? A CyberMinivan would have been 10x more optimal as it addresses a larger TAM and they have the platform already in place for it. Imagine a CyberMinivan with sliding stainless steel doors. That's easy money.... The best use case I have for the RoboVan is it being a subscription-based transport for those who are looking for a more premium mass-transit option.\n\n  \nGoing back to my recommendation of a CyberVan, it would make 'minivans' cool. One of my biggest gripes with Tesla vehicles is they lack a full-size vehicle model that Americans and frankly, most growing economies look for. Why isn't there one? Model X is way too small. They have the platform available. Doesn't even need to use stainless steel. A regular looking vehicle would be just as fine. \n\n  \nI'm holding my shares for the next 15-20 years so I'm not worried short-term at all. It's also worth noting that while Tesla has overpromised, the amount of progress they have made in the past decade has been nothing short of amazing. But I am curious as to what they're seeing internally that makes them believe they can achieve unsupervised FSD in Texas/California in 2025 and RoboTaxi before 2027.

I'm not worried about that part. \n\nIf they can get FSD working this year, we launch the Model 3/Y in 2 states next year. This at least keeps us on PAR with WAYMO. No information on \"how\", no plan for execution, and I get that they don't want to lay out their launch plans. This is the part we really wanted - but I'm not sure they can even detail this if FSD isn't ready yet. That could possibly mislead investors. \n\nThat van thing can stay in the tunnels, or on a dedicated commuter lane - It didn't help the event in any way IMO. I didn't like it, but whatever - I didn't like the CT. It's not a consumer vehicle, and I think that's the idea. \n\nThe robot is what I want, but I don't know if it is just a Chuck-e-Cheese puppet or a true robot. Again no details - what can it actually do in a home or business? How much can it lift? How do you train it to make espresso? \n\nTie it all together - we need the brain - for both the car and the robot. The hardware is worthless without it - and I'm guessing it's all hands on deck for FSD over everything else. \n\nI think they are taking the CT design a little far, but I'm guessing they were initially designed when they raked in all the CT reservations. \n\nI'd feel much more comfortable if the car business was still growing 50% a year. \n\nWe are on a cusp of a little gully and investors are getting impatient. \n\nDon't worry about CNBC - Mark my words - Tesla and Musk will be punching back for weeks through X.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "If Tesla is light years ahead of everyone, it should have no problem giving a detailed roadmap of its plans.

But what they have available to the public is FSD Beta Supervised, which can handle heavy rain in most cities in the country: https://youtu.be/7jTZ6MLB5oY?si=kR6k7HSMZ3WTg2RV\n\nThe point is that Waymo requires data labelling for every road it drives on, whille Tesla does not. That‚Äôs why FSD Beta is on 400,000 vehicles, while Waymo has 700 vehicles. \n\nThe trade-off is that FSD Beta operates between L2-4, but across America, while Waymo operates always at L4 (or has a remote-assistant help it navigate) but in 3 cities. \n\n\n\nWhy I am claiming FSD can happen over night is because there are already 400,000 Tesla‚Äôs running FSD Beta, so once TSLA solves the problem (hopefully much before Waymo expands across most of America), they will have the data that shows ‚ÄúLook, FSD Beta has been running safely in this city for millions of miles with no interventions‚Äù, it would do the same with or without a driver. \n\nIn fact, FSD is saving lives by having such a lower accident rate than humans, so regulators would pretty much need to allow it. \n\nAlso, Tesla has its proprietary supercharging stations, so managing the fleet is not going to be much of a challenge. As well, they don‚Äôt need to buy and pay hefty fees to maintain the cars like Waymo, since they make them themselves.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The difference is that Waymo can drive itself reliably enough that it doesn‚Äôt need a safety driver. Tesla cannot. \n\nTesla is on 400k vehicles because it‚Äôs only an L2 driver assistance package. Not because it has some advantage over Waymo‚Äôs system which is an actual L4 system that operates without drivers. And one of the reasons Tesla operates with such low reliability is precisely because it doesn‚Äôt have any information about all the local differences in each city/region/state when it comes to road rules and signs and driver behaviors. It uses the average of all the data across the country which is pretty silly they should have models for each area. Hence why it operates so well in places like the Bay Area where more people run FSD. It‚Äôs heavily overfit to certain areas.\n\nThe reality is Tesla has zero vehicles approved for driverless operation. Not even a single test vehicle. Tesla will not be able to turn their system on overnight they will have to work with each city for approvals just like Waymo. Testing on consumer vehicles with drivers as backups isn‚Äôt the same as testing without drivers in a rigorous test program. It will be a slow process of performing driverless validation testing in each city to prove to regulators they operate reliably enough for each city‚Äôs unique roadways, road rules, signage, etc. And then it will have to also set up fleet depots and management like Waymo. Tesla will have the same pains if they ever get there.\n\nProprietary charging stations are not the same thing as depots for fleet management.
