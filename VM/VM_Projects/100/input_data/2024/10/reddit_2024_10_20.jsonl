SE operates in Southeast Asia, possibly the world's fastest growing market and high volumes. If you believe in the SEA market, SE is a good proxy to invest in. SE's Shopee business has remained robust even with TikTok's emerging presence. Shopee's deep rooted understanding of the local markets and established scales mean that it will continue to be the number one player in the region, and TikTok is instead stealing share from smaller players like Alibaba's Lazada. SEA ecommerce competition seems to be heading into consolidation, with Shopee and Tiktok frontlining the market in the long term. However, there is the pertinent risk of TikTok's viability in the US, where a blanket ban on TikTok will definitely reduce global viewership and engagement. In all, SE's main revenue source, Shopee, will continue to dominate its markets against competitive headwinds. There are still other tailwinds like dropping interest rates boosting consumer spending but these have been extensively discussed.\n\nDigital finance wise, SE owns the recently-launched SeaMoney. This is a much more competitive space with the 2021-23 digital bank craze in SEA leading to countless digital banks and fintechs springing out from nowhere. It still remains to be seen if SeaMoney will survive this initial crowding, but one thing it has going is the potential synergies from integration with Shopee, which I don't think has been fully realised yet. Consumers are still sorting out which digibank works the best for them, and while we can expect to see a few failures down the line, I believe SeaMoney will emerge victorious if SE can effectively integrate it with Shopee.\n\nGaming wise, SE's Garena studio owns (one of) the world's most downloaded games Free Fire, with user growth showing no sign of even plateauing. Although there is a concern over declining ARPU, these are likely due to the economic downturn and will likely recover in the coming months as we hit a broader market rebound. \n\nSE recently turned profitable in 2023, which is honestly very rare when looking across other SEA tech companies.

They have a myriad of big customers like Apple, Google, Cisco, Arista, and more\n\n3. Their product/service range is very wide which makes them a more stable semiconductor company compared to most competitors \n\n4. They are going to benefit massively in the coming years from huge growing areas like AI, cloud, data center, automation, cyber security, power generation, software, and overall interconnectivity of the world. As the world continues to integrate AI into their business they will be looking for businesses to customize solutions and chips for their businesses. Broadcom is one of few who provides such customizable chips and services. \n\n5. VMware is a BEAST for income and engrained in a ton of the world\n\n6. The company is very good at acquisitions of very high revenue generating enterprises to further their income long term (even if it causes a short term hit in cost)\n\n7. They are stellar at cost cutting unnecessary parts to boost profits\n\n8. While Broadcom certainly sells at a premium, compared to most other big semiconductor companies, they are still a great deal and consistently provide amazing return to holders yearly\n\n9. Some people worry about their China revenue, which yes is a risk. But if you view their world revenue sources their world ex China revenue is growing strongly yearly by year. If something happens with China Broadcom is continuing to hedge its position with more revenue sources to reduce their reliance.
