{"title": "\nTesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress", "selftext": "Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company‚Äôs long-awaited robotaxi event ‚Äî where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm‚Äôs Cybercab self-driving concept car ‚Äî failed to impress investors.\n\nTesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.\n\nMusk revealed Tesla‚Äôs Cybercab concept vehicle ‚Äî a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals ‚Äî on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.\n\nThe Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.\n\nHe also said he expects Tesla to have ‚Äúunsupervised FSD‚Äù up and running in Texas and California next year in the company‚Äôs Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla‚Äôs premium driver assistance system, available today in a ‚Äúsupervised‚Äù version for Tesla electric vehicles.\n\nThe technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nIn reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk‚Äôs vision for a fully autonomous driving future.\n\n‚ÄúAs expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla‚Äôs growth endeavors in AI/AV \\[autonomous vehicles\\],‚Äù Barclays‚Äô U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.\n\n‚ÄúYet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn‚Äôt show its low-cost model planned for 1H‚Ä≤25 production,‚Äù they added. ‚ÄúWe also didn‚Äôt get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.‚Äù\n\nPiper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that ‚Äúmost trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,‚Äù the investment bank‚Äôs analysts said in the note.\n\nMorgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank‚Äôs analysts noted that Musk didn‚Äôt mention any details on improvements to Tesla‚Äôs FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk‚Äôs AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.\n\nThe event ‚Äúoverall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,‚Äù Morgan Stanley‚Äôs analysts wrote in a note Friday.\n\n‚ÄúWe were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,‚Äù they added.\n\nIt is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.\n\nAmong the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google‚Äôs Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.", "id": "1g18fon", "created_utc": 1728649167.0, "score": 1702, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 566, "comments": [{"body": "Ah, good reminder to update my timeline.\n\n~~One million robotaxis on the road in 2020.~~  \n~~One million robotaxis on the road in 2021.~~  \n~~One million robotaxis on the road in 2022.~~  \n~~One million robotaxis on the road in 2023.~~  \n~~One million robotaxis on the road in 2024, but in China.~~  \n~~One million robotaxis on the road in 2025.~~  \nOne million robotaxis on the road in 2026. <-- you are here  \nOne million robotaxis on the road before 2027.  \nOne million robotaxis on the road in 2027.", "score": 1039, "replies": [{"body": "Looks like a Simpsons intro", "score": 172, "replies": [{"body": "God dammit", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Surely you must mean \"d'oh\", yes?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "He said no Simpsons God damnit", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Oh!

Tesla the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing **stuff** with AI‚Äù company is worth $???/share. So like with NVDA clueless investors are mashing the buy button- and it‚Äôll work‚Ä¶ until it doesn‚Äôt. The music will stop and the share prices will tank. \n\nIt will take probably years, but eventually the shareholders of TSLA will realize they were sold a bill of goods. Lots of talk about the ‚Äúpotential‚Äù of AI, not a lot of action. FSD is harder than most humans can imagine. Most humans, most TSLA shareholders, have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA how to train a machine learning model to drive a car. They falsely believe that ‚Äúhey Tesla is close, it already kind of drives itself, how much farther can FSD be?‚Äù\n\nIn the world of data science and machine learning, getting a model to be ‚Äúright‚Äù about 80% of the time is relatively easy. This ‚Äú80% accuracy‚Äù target is often good enough. It‚Äôs okay if the ML model is wrong 20 or even 30% of the time- for example, when I go to the dentist for my 6-month cleaning, my dentist has this AI dental thing look at my X-Rays and point out ‚Äúpotential problem areas‚Äù. Last time I went, it found around 6 ‚Äúproblem areas‚Äù- now I‚Äôve been seeing this dentist for almost a decade, he‚Äôs never had to do a filling or any other restorative work, I use a Sonicare toothbrush, etc. So as you can guess, he looks at all the problem areas and writes them off. Basically a ‚Äúthanks for the help, AI, but everything‚Äôs okay!‚Äù He explained that it‚Äôs nice to have a ‚Äúsecond set of eyes‚Äù but he of course doesn‚Äôt trust it to make any decisions.\n\nChatGPT is similar. It‚Äôs wrong a lot. Hard to put a percentage figure on it but I would say as someone who uses it daily, it‚Äôs wrong AT LEAST 20% of the time. This is also fine, as it has disclaimers everywhere, even in some of its responses saying ‚Äúhey man I could be wrong.‚Äù\n\nOn the other hand, for use-cases where even being wrong 2% of the time is unacceptable, as with *driving a fucking car*, relying solely on AI is, currently, impossible. I‚Äôm not aware of anything- be it cars, robots performing surgery, or those bullshit ‚ÄúOptimus‚Äù robots- that is accurate enough to not need a human monitoring it. \n\nThis is why Tesla says not to nap while your car is in autopilot mode on the interstate. The interstate is, as AI driving software goes, the easiest ‚Äútest‚Äù of abilities. Minimal traffic signs, roads are large and relatively straight, no pedestrians‚Ä¶ I would guess for this ideal scenario, Tesla‚Äôs self-driving machine learning model is 90%+ ‚Äúaccurate‚Äù. This is where you‚Äôre least likely to die from sleeping in your Tesla while it‚Äôs driving. Still a nonzero chance you‚Äôll die, but relatively low. \n\nBut FSD stands for *full* self-driving, so it **must** be able to deal with city driving- pedestrians, school zones, windy roads, stop signs, other drivers driving unpredictably‚Ä¶ this is MANY times more difficult than teaching a computer to drive on an interstate highway. I would describe it as something like 100x more difficult. It‚Äôs not just a little more difficult- this is where I think most TSLA shareholders are naively speculating on Tesla The AI Company.\n\nAnd of course there are many other companies competing with Tesla in this space. Not just Wemo. I can go on the internet and for a thousand bucks buy a device that hooks up to my ‚Äúdumb‚Äù car‚Äôs computer and will give it similar self-driving capabilities to Teslas. Identical if I recall correctly. Neither than truly ‚ÄúFSD‚Äù, but‚Ä¶ the point is, here‚Äôs proof that teaching a computer to drive on the interstate is EASY- so many other companies can do it. The one I‚Äôm thinking of is Comma AI https://comma.ai/ \n\n\n**I‚Äôm a software engineer who trains machine learning models for a living. I probably know more than anyone else here about how realistic FSD is**\n\nWhere it gets tricky is the stock play. Stocks can remain irrational longer than most people can remain solvent‚Ä¶ so while I personally am convinced TSLA is overpriced vaporware, it could rally to $1000/share before the rest of the world comes to the same conclusion. There‚Äôs also the possibility that Elon continues to ‚Äústall‚Äù successfully until they really do figure out FSD- to be clear, I think FSD will happen eventually. I also think Tesla will announce they have solved FSD long before they actually do, release it, and we‚Äôll eventually see some deadly failures in the real-world akin to Boeing‚Äôs MCAS on the 737 MAX. I have no doubt in my mind Tesla will release a defective FSD calling it ‚Äúperfect‚Äù, and then people will die, they‚Äôll recall it, the stock will tank as it‚Äôs done many times before, people go back to betting on ‚Äúthe future of AI‚Äù, rinse, repeat. \n\nSo yeah, I‚Äôve been playing with the stock market for over a decade. Mixed success of course. My opinion is that TSLA will remain very volatile until a competitor figures out true FSD. I don‚Äôt see how current technology will actually facilitate a 99-100% accurate ML model for city driving. I see this as being over a decade away. I will be VERY skeptical of any claims of FSD from Tesla or anyone else prior to that. In the meantime, playing off those Elon Tweets and fake Optimus robot demos will be tricky.

It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people? I‚Äôm not using the LAX shuttle van at that point, I‚Äôm immediately turning to a competitor. Haven‚Äôt really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. \n\nOne other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck, ambulance, or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound, I‚Äôm not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. \n\nBeyond this there‚Äôs the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it‚Äôll probably be nowhere close to. \n\nWhat are other people‚Äôs thoughts on this, did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you? It looks like an aesthetic toy, but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle, redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2-4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. \n\n\nEdit: Alright read through the comments, and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi (knowing Tesla‚Äôs history this WILL be priced higher) and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car, no Robotaxi and do everything I need? How is that budget friendly at all, and if there‚Äôs a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would I buy something without the option of a steering wheel? \nStill a toy.\n \nAlso, if it‚Äôs for personal use, how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property? If I live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is? It makes no sense as a personal car for a LOT of people.\n\nAnd even if the majority of taxi rides are 1-2 people, why not just use a model 3 that‚Äôs 10K more, already exists, and can service that additional 15-20% of your taxi market (given the Robotaxi is definitely not gonna cost 30K and over the life of the car the extra seats pay for themselves). You also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines/capacity, testing, and designing the pointless thing. \n\nMy opinion doesn‚Äôt change this thing shouldn‚Äôt exist, and it‚Äôs out of touch with what most people need.

There are some companies who have some clearance to run some cars and they are reporting back good data. But that's all based on lidar systems, not just camera based. The roll out will have to take this in consideration and this is not a technological step but a governance one. This will take considerable time.\n\nBeyond that, these cars will need charging, which might be inductive sure but that still needs infrastructure which needs to be built out.

This applies widely even beyond the US. It truly baffles me to hear people say that public transport needs to turn a profit or that it's bad that it subsidized.

There he exits the taxi and goes into the transfer hub, he could directly step onto a virtual train into the city centre, but the coffee he drank is having its effect and he needs a quick stop.

Even if they market it as affordable, Tesla will likely create a \"foundation\" series and charge much more for it. They‚Äôre not going to miss an opportunity to capitalize on demand.\n\n2. **Street legality is a major hurdle** ‚Äì For fully autonomous \"cybercabs\" to hit the streets without a steering wheel, Tesla will need overwhelming proof that FSD can safely operate without any human intervention. I imagine they'd need to demonstrate this level of capability in their existing cars (like newer Model 3s) before regulators allow a vehicle to go fully steering-free.\n\n3. **Initial versions may still be drivable** ‚Äì Realistically, it‚Äôll take some time for Tesla to develop an FSD vehicle that doesn‚Äôt rely on human input. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they release an initial version that‚Äôs drivable, perhaps with a \"drive-by-wire\" system, and offer the option to remove the steering wheel and pedals later once the tech catches up. This could allow them to tap into the market for a more affordable car in the meantime.\n\n4. **Tesla may not want to own fleets** ‚Äì A lot of people assumed Tesla would run fleets of these cybercabs like Uber or Lyft without paying drivers, but I think they're shying away from that. Elon‚Äôs mentioned how \"everyone can own one,\" suggesting Tesla doesn't want the headache of maintaining all those vehicles (cleaning, air pressure, repairs, etc.). Instead, they could offload that responsibility onto individual owners while focusing on manufacturing and software updates. They might run a few fleets for profit, but owning and maintaining millions of vehicles seems unlikely.\n\n5. **How will FSD subscriptions be offered with the cybercab?** ‚Äì Will Tesla offer a lifetime subscription with the car, or monthly? If it's the latter, you‚Äôre not going very far in a car with no steering wheel if you miss your FSD monthly payment! üòÜ", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good luck in the bloodbath this week y'awl!!!!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I thought they don't do advertising?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don't understand why we would have to pay $30k for a cybercab?

Maybe my expectations were way off, but going by my own disengagement statistics, I'm having to intervene and take control far more than I thought I would by this point.

It needs to improve. And in order for robotaxis to come to fruition on public roads, it's going to have to improve by several orders of magnitude.

{"title": "TESLA CYBERCAB VS WAYMO : AN ANALYSIS ", "selftext": "For all the regards who don't know, Waymo is the market leader in true autonomous vehicles right now. They have been operating a fleet of robo taxis (fully autonomous cars) in multiple cities for a while now. \n\nSo I did a short comparison and analysis. \n\n\n\nKEY POINTS FROM \"WE, ROBOT\" EVENT:\n\n\n\n1. The robotaxi is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production.\n\n.\n.\n\n2. Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab production by 2026 ‚Äî although he said it could be as late as 2027. \n\n.\n.\n\n3. Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000-$30,000, and is capable of performing various tasks.\n\n\n.\n.\n\n4. Cybercab was revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla's \"We, Robot‚Äù event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of non-public roads for the demonstration. \n\n\n.\n.\n\n5. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn't rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nTESLA VS WAYMO : KEY DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND APPROACH \n\n\n\n.\n.\n\n1. Sensing the World:\n\n -  - Waymo's Multi-Sensor Fusion:  Waymo uses a suite of sensors that work together. This is like having multiple senses.\n\n\nI. Lidar:  Acts like super-precise radar, creating a 3D \"point cloud\" of the surroundings. This excels in low-light and complex environments.\n\nII. Radar: Detects objects and their speed, even in rain or fog.\n   \n\nIII. Cameras: Provide visual information for recognizing objects like traffic lights and pedestrians.\n\n\n\n\n- - Tesla's Vision-Only System: Tesla relies heavily on cameras, believing that they can provide enough data for AI to understand the world like humans do.\n\n\nI. Neural Networks:  Tesla uses powerful AI to process the visual data from cameras.\n\n\nII. No Lidar:  Tesla famously excludes lidar, arguing it's expensive and unnecessary.\n\n\n- Why this matters:  Lidar provides highly accurate depth and distance data, which is crucial for navigating complex situations. Tesla's vision-only approach is more ambitious but may struggle in conditions where cameras are less effective (e.g., heavy rain, fog).\n\n\n\n.\n.\n\n\n2. Understanding the Environment:\n\nI. Waymo's HD Maps: Waymo creates incredibly detailed 3D maps of the areas where its vehicles operate. These maps include road geometry, lane markings, traffic signs, and even the positions of trees and buildings.\n\n\nII.  Localization: This allows Waymo's cars to precisely locate themselves within the map, even in challenging conditions.\n\n\nIII. Predictability:  Maps help anticipate what's coming and plan routes accordingly.\n\n\nIV.  Tesla's Real-Time Learning: Tesla relies less on pre-mapped environments. Its AI learns to interpret the world in real-time, based on the data it gathers from its cameras.\n\n\nV. Generalization: The goal is to create a system that can drive anywhere, not just in pre-mapped areas.\n\n\nVI. Adaptability: Tesla's system can potentially adapt to new environments and situations more quickly.\n\n\n\n- - Why this matters: Waymo's HD maps provide a high level of certainty in known areas, but mapping is expensive and time-consuming. Tesla's approach is more scalable but relies heavily on the AI's ability to correctly interpret complex scenes.\n\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n3. Deployment Strategies:\n\nI. Waymo's Gradual Rollout: Waymo has focused on deploying its robotaxi service in specific cities, starting with Phoenix. This allows for careful testing and refinement in controlled environments.\n\n\nII.  Safety First:  Waymo prioritizes safety and has a strong track record.\n\nIII.  Controlled Expansion:  They expand their service area gradually as they gain confidence in their technology.\n\n\n\n IV.  Tesla's Beta Testing: Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to a wider group of drivers. This allows them to gather vast amounts of real-world driving data.\n\n\nV.  Rapid Iteration:  Tesla can quickly improve its system through frequent software updates.\n\n\n VI. Driver Responsibility:  FSD is still a driver-assist system, and drivers are expected to remain vigilant and take over when necessary.\n\n\n- -  Why this matters: Waymo's approach is more cautious, prioritizing safety and controlled testing. Tesla's approach is faster and more agile, but it also carries more risk, as evidenced by accidents involving FSD.\n\n\n\nThese are some of the core differences between Waymo and Tesla's approach to self-driving. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of technology, but their philosophies and strategies are quite distinct. It will be fascinating to see how these approaches evolve in the years to come.\n\n\n\n. . . . . .  . \n\n\nEDIT:  THE MUSK PARADOX \n\n\nThe entire Tesla brand is highly dependent on Elon. Essentially Elon is Tesla. A lot of the Tesla Brand value is tied up with Elon Musk the human.\n\nThis wasn't a problem in the past when Elon seemed like a nerd who just loved tech and posted memes.\n\nFast forward to 2024, the guy is full blow republican (not saying it's bad or good). He is actively involved with politics.\n\nIMO, He's too busy \"owning the libs\" and fighting cultural wars (\"woke virus\"). \n\nNow combine this with his other behavioral problems like self administration of ketamine and using other drugs, and we have a recipe for disaster.\n\n\nFYI, I'm not an Elon Hater.

They're the pioneers of technology in the field of AI. \n\n\nYou must be thinking Why didn't we hear about this if they're the pioneers of AI? \n\n\nThe reason is that Google failed to be the first one to commercialise it. \n\nGoogle had something called \"PROJECT MOONSHOTS.\"  It was basically a division of Google solely focused on Ultra Ambitious Projects. \n\nAI research and development was a part of it.\n\nIn 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Labs that was founded in the UK in 2010.\n\nDeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), which is basically a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.\n\n\nThe Founding Research and Development Team of OpenAI, actually came from Google (DeepMind).\n\n\nNow going back to \"PROJECT MOONSHOTS\" - in 2010 Larry Page and Sergy Brin turned  \"Project Moonshots\" into \"X COMPANY\".\n\nYes, it's called X, and they did it before Musk LMAO. \n\nThis is what X Company does -\n\nX's mission is to invent and launch \"moonshot\" technologies that aim to make the world a radically better place.\n\n A moonshot is defined by X as the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. \n\nWork at X is overseen by entrepreneur scientist Astro Teller, as CEO and \"Captain of Moonshots\".\n\nThe lab started with the development of Google's self-driving car.\n\n\nSELF DRIVING VEHICLES are a brainchild of X Company. \n\nThey are also working on some secret projects (presumably alongside the US government).\n\n\nWhile Google fell behind OpenAI in commercializing and marketing of AI, they are still a leader in everything related to AI, Machine Learning and Fully Autonomous Vehicles. \n\n\n. . . . . . .\n\n\nTLDR;\n\nGOOGLE IS EVERYTHING ELON MUSK IS CLAIMING TO BE. \n\n\n\n. . . . . \n\n\nEDIT 1 : My Thoughts On DOJ Case Against Google and A Potential Breakup \n\n\nIf (a big if) DOJ actually wins against Google and is able to break them up, the most likely scenario is a spin-off of Android and Chrome. \n\nIMO, this is not a bad thing if you're looking at the bigger picture. It will get DOJ/Anti-trust lawsuits worldwide off Google's back, without really impairing their ability to develop AI and other futuristic tech.\n\n\nEven this can potentially take years to materialize, if it ever actually happens. So personally I'm not bothered by it. \n\n\n. . . . . .\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n. . .\n\nhttps://x.company/projects/\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nhttps://deepmind.google\n\n\n. . .
