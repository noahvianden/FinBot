This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.\n\nAll options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.\n\nAll options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. I took out $17K earlier this year for taxes and various expenses. I replaced some of the $17K with a $9K deposit recently. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. \n\nAdded $500 in contributions to the portfolio. This is a 28 week streak of adding at least $500.\n\nThe portfolio is comprised of 95 unique tickers with a value of $172k. I also have 141 open option positions, up from 135 last week. The options have a total value of $94k. The total of the shares and options is $266k. \n\nI’m currently utilizing $39,150 in cash secured put collateral.\n\nI sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I’m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I’m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue. As shown below, I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. \n\n1 year performance (365 days)\nME 53.65% |*\nNasdaq 44.44%  |\nS&P 500 38.73% |\nRussell 2000 33.70% |\nDow Jones 27.48% |\n\n*Taxes are not accounted for in this percentage.

Although, taxes are a major part of investing, I don’t disclose my personal tax information.\n\nI have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. \n\n2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS\nIn addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man’s covered calls(PMCC). The LEAPS are down $4,129 this week and are up $34,257 overall.\nSee r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.\n\nLast year I sold 964 options and I’m at 1,138 year to date.\n\nTotal premium by year:\n2022 $8,551 in premium |\n2023 $22,908 in premium |\n2024 $33,257 YTD |\n\nI am over $74k in total options premium, since 2021.

If your 12 month return is 55% and your \\~10 month return is 20%, that means you had a two month \"bang up\" period of \\~35%, and those will quickly fall off the table, so unless you have a similar time this Nov/Dec, your 12 month will rapidly drop down towards that 20%.\n\nSo let's use your preference of 12 months of 55%.

Good work on the 32%YTD. \n\nDo I think collecting premiums on covered calls (CCs) and cash secured puts (CSPs) is a viable strategy? It is what I have been doing for a while and it has been working for me. \n\nThings to considers:\n\nI personally don't use margin. I used to when interest rates were lower, now I collect interest on my unused investment capital. If rates get back to a level where I it makes more sense to leverage the money, I may revisit margin.\n\nCan you contribute on a regular basis? I am not saying this is a must for everyone, but if you want to grow your account, you should not just rely on returns. I personally contribute $500 per week. This is the amount that I know that I can commit to with my current budget.\n\nCSPs and CCs are one-legged options. I think these are enough for what I'm doing, you can get into multi-legged spreads that can be beneficial for managing risk and leveraging your account. I use the KISS method which is keep it simple stupid (stupid is me in this case). Once you have learned the basics of covered calls and CSPs, spreads are not too difficult to wrap your head around, but some of them can be a bit trickery to roll, manage.\n\nHow much time do you have to watch the positions during the day? Me personally, I roll a lot. My objective is to collect the premium and keep the shares on covered calls. Will I be upset if the shares are assigned and called away? No, I understand the way that the option works and like the way an option has defined risks and outcomes, upfront. This means that I roll A LOT. If the position goes in an unfavorable direction, I may roll up and out. If it goes in a favorable direction I may roll down and in. \n\nHaving a healthy curiosity for business news helps too. Knowing the companies you invest in is half the battle. Knowing the macro-economics of the business news world is necessary too. You should keep on global and domestic news stories. Not all of them, but the ones that affect the companies you invest in. This means you should be aware of tariffs, the upcoming election, fed meetings, rate cut rumors, and your companies quarterly earnings schedule. \n\nCan you invest without emotion? You have to make a lot of decisions, sometimes you have to make decisions quickly. Are you making decisions that will affect your budget in that month? When starting out, you don't want to rely on income from investing. Having added pressure to preform can lead to high risk outcomes. So, investing money that you don't need for a long period of time is a must. \n\nTLDR: Investing takes a commitment of time and money. Options can be a lucrative tool to add to your investment repertoire. You should keep up on business news and keep your emotions in check. \n\nBest of luck to you in your new journey!

Go into products for radar/tracking systems on several military craft, permanent magnets used for modern tech like phones, tv, medical equipment, used in EV batteries, wind turbines, etc. US has very limited supply chain that we are barely starting to build back up and MP Materials is the only company in the US with an operational mine and separation facility that doesn’t have to ship 100% of the raw materials mined to China for processing and then pay to import them back as processed materials or finished products. Just opened a processing facility in Fort Worth Texas 2024 which will also produce permanent magnets starting 2025 that for starters, they already have a contract for with GM to go into the EVs they build. They also have a mine in south texas and I believe a facility in Oklahoma as well.\n\nTrade competition with China in recent years has them(China) banning exports of several rare earth elements, flooding markets like lithium, cobalt, and nickel for example, to crash prices and force closure of other countries’ mining operations, and US enacting multiple tariffs on Chinese-sourced rare earth materials so that in the very near future, companies like Tesla will have to pay more for Chinese materials that go into their batteries or find a domestic supplier, like say, MP Materials?\n\nOr maybe rely on Mexico, I haven’t read too much but I think I heard they recently found more deposits they want to start mining. Potentially getting off track but I think one or two of their new EV brands will be 100% built in Mexico? Anyways.\n\nI work in manufacturing for Raytheon so my thoughts are that if China decides to cut all trade of these materials that we depend on, before long, we may no longer be able to continue building guided missile systems, radars and radar jammers, etc. And y’all know, if the US hates anything it’s not having the number one military and allowing China or anyone else to threaten our defense industry that we love pouring money into. DoD has started investing into this market and more specifically, into MP Materials, and will likely continue to increase investments as they expand.

Community Book Marks on the right include the Kook report for technical analysis among others for great sources of dd for a deep dive.  \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/t5uem4/the\\_science\\_and\\_economics\\_behind\\_asts\\_in\\_laymans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/t5uem4/the_science_and_economics_behind_asts_in_laymans/) \n\nI use this source to work valuation models based on an accumulation of information from the company, trading firms, market makers:  [https://transhumanica.com/asts/model](https://transhumanica.com/asts/model)   :  You can tweak this based on other research longer timelines, user conversion, cost of service etc.\n\nHowever, as i understand it.\n\n1. ASTS is purpose built Satellite to address SCS (Supplemental Coverage from Space) with the MNO's (mobile network operators) Globally, like ATT, Verizon, Rakuten, Vodafone, Telefonica, with Terrestrial band width to service uncovered areas (basically the entire planet, including Oceans, unserved urban markets, villages, mountains, deserts, where it is inefficient or impossible to build cell towers.  the Satellites (the largest 700sq meter when unfolded) can get complete global coverage with less than 200 satellites and closer to 100 in total).\n\n2.  The offer, 5G Broadband, and is adaptable for 6G and beyond.  Very desirable with the above mentioned MNO's,  and American Tower ( a large investors in ASTS)  Starlink can hardly do texting.\n\n3.  Starlink is adapting existing tech from the satellite company the bought, to do their Sat to receiver broadband services that was appealing for people with boats or mountain houses etc.  But ASTS provides this service as a supplement to unmodified cell phones right out the box.  as an add on service.  \n\n4. The ASTS satellites were designed for this purpose working in conjunction with the MNO's, Starlink is a pivot in response to this new model.  and the tech can't compete, (again, to get into that, is better for the experts posting in those places, than me,  I understand what they are saying, but not the intricacy's of the tech.\n\n5. Most global MNO's, FirstNet, Govt agencies, are recognizing this achievement and they have deals with over 50 global mno's and making progress toward government contracts.  FirstNet is managed by ATT one of ASTS original partners and funding is expected to be announced soon.  \n\n6. SpaceX keeps using these as talking points, SOS and TEXT etc.  but no broadband.  The satellites are far smaller, not purpose built much weaker satellites which have band width interference issues, which the have asked FCC for a waiver for because the can't satisfy the current requirements.  ASTS meets these with far more powerful satellites and worked in conjunction with everyone to build the system to work in the framework.\n\n  \nThere is a lot more, but the real research is there on the AST thread mentioned earlier.  Read the Kook report CATSe  - go back and research.  I personally am 100% convinced by the dd that this is the next evolution in communication pioneered by this sick company.  \n\nBecause the work as partners, as a service (supplemental) to terrestrial networks, they have a revenue share model.  They do not need to acquire consumers, but the MNO's are their customers and the MNO's customer becomes customer of ASTS through them.  so the sales numbers and net margins are extremely high.  It is a global cell tower space based company.  The opportunity is enormous, and they just launched, after years of development, their first 5 commercial satellites which have all unfurled into their full space waffle configuration.  will begin testing then commercialization then add more satellites and build it out.  It's pre revenue, so this is longer term, but a lot shorter than when i first got in.  It's happening now.

The biggest issue with Reddit ads is that Reddit isn't using their data well enough, and the ads on Reddit generally don't fit into the content as well as they do on Facebook/Instagram. Facebook works so well because the typical user is either low IQ or a gullible boomer. IG advertising works so well for e-commerce advertisers in particular because people use the platform for influencer content.\n\nPeople use Reddit and X more for information based content, which is much much harder to advertise against. It's much easier to tell when something is an ad, and they skip right past it. Reddit needs to push themselves as a branding advertising channel rather than one for driving direct conversions. To do this, they need to provide measurement tools for advertisers to show that although users aren't clicking the ads, they are still remembering the brand and increasing the likelihood for them to then search for the brand on Google or go directly to the advertiser to convert. This is what Google does with YouTube, because nobody actually clicks YouTube ads. Difference being Google has a signed-in ecosystem where they know if someone saw a YouTube ad and then searched for the brand on Google, Reddit just has the one platform and can't easily show that post-view uplift from their advertising.\n\nIf Reddit can make better use of their data to serve ads in a more contextual way or to very specific users, or they can provide the measurement tool above, they'd be in a good place.

It's one of the only EV makers making a profit.\n\nHere's some charts/\n\nCashflows: [https://x.com/alojoh/status/1849199873012174934](https://x.com/alojoh/status/1849199873012174934)\n\nMargins (notice the EV companies highlighted in green at the bottom): [https://x.com/alojoh/status/1826151946056515600](https://x.com/alojoh/status/1826151946056515600)\n\nAnalysis compared to BYD: [https://x.com/alojoh/status/1712014850946166978](https://x.com/alojoh/status/1712014850946166978)\n\nWhat id like to see is a similar chart for the BESS business. I suspect it's similar. There are, of course, other big players in utility scale BESS but Tesla is likely best in class, margins are massive (up to 30% now), and the business is growing fast.\n\nThen there's the Semi trucks which we know little about for now but the volume production factory is under construction. From my own research i suspect the Tesla Semi will be the highest margin vehicle in their car lineup and the demand will be absolutely insane. Exactly how profitable it will be will depend on a couple of as yet unknown key pieces of information. But imo, i think that a single Semi truck coiuld be as profitable as 10 Model 3s/Ys (nominal value, not margin). So 150,000-250,000 Semi truck sales annually, could be equivelant to 1.5m-2.5m Model 3/Ys in terms of earnings. Of course other companies also offer EV Semis, none of them offer anything remotely as performant as Tesla's Semi. So Tesla's semi looks exceptionally promising.\n\nAnd really, Tesla is only going to get more profitable over time across the current lineup. There are still a number of projects Tesla is working on which have yet to come online which will further reduce costs within their supply chain. For example Tesla is building its own a Lithium refinery in Texas. Still under construction but alot of progress made so far. Tesla is also extremely capital efficient when you look at things like OpEx/R&D ratios compared to other autos.\n\nSo Tesla is really exceptional as an automaker and an EV maker. The biggest thing going against Tesla right now is high interest rates. It's such a problem that Tesla is offering low financing on its own dime. But interest rates are on their way back down and its not clear what happens to demand when they're 1-2% lower a year+ from now. Either way as rates drop the cost to Tesla will lower so margins will improve. If demand rockets back up then Tesla may also be able to raise prices.\n\nBut despite high rates, Tesla is still growing sales. YoY the Q3 numbers were +6% which is better than alot of other automakers right now and speaks to the strong demand for Teslas: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mixed-us-car-sales-q3-181757286.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mixed-us-car-sales-q3-181757286.html) This article only mentions a few companies but most of the industry is struggling right now. Some more than others, eg. VW is particularly troubled. And while Tesla has been able to juice sales by dropping prices or offering low interest financing, much of Tesla's competition does not have the luxury of being able to do that as they are already deep in the red. \n\nRight now it looks highly likey that Rivian, LCID, Nio, Xpeng, Zeekr, Polestar, and some others will inevitably end up failing. And some of these are high volume sellers in China, so if they exit the market that will leave a moderate void which i think Tesla is well positioned to capture. But as i said before, it's also possible they get acquired and many of the legacy car companies appear to be positioning themselves for such a takeover (but seeing as they're all also struggling to make EVs profitable i doubt it will actually help them).

Like i said, if you're not aware or haven't been following the news the legacy auto companies have announced that they're scaling back on their EV plans - for a reason. They have two problems that prevent them from scaling at the moment. One, obviously profitability. If they can't make EVs profitably, they can't scale; otherwise they'll just be caling massive losses. Secondly, demand.

But anyway personally, i believe the narrative that Elon is driving away customers is mostly bullshit FUD from shortsellers and political activists. They're just trying to sow fear.

But i also never expected him to get this involved either.\n\nSo he may be losing a few customers from very fringe radical Leftists (the \"progressive\" types etc), but i think he's gaining millions more of average everyday Republicans. And i also think the sales data proves it. I mean look at Tesla sales in California. I think if there was any effective boycott of his cars you would see it in California of all places. But there's really nothing notable. Nothing like what happened to Bud Light's sales when they got boycotted. Remember that?

When they triple the energy business the profits will be close to equal the profits of the car business (including sales from credits and services).\n\nSee:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/24/teslas-surprise-earnings-beat/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/24/teslas-surprise-earnings-beat/)\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-biggest-growth-business-q3-energy-storage-batteries-2024-10](https://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-biggest-growth-business-q3-energy-storage-batteries-2024-10)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "That's the thing tho it's not a car company.
