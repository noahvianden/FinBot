The Fed prefers the PCE as its inflation gauge though it uses a variety of inputs to make decisions.*\n\n*‚ÄúThe overall trend over 12, 18 months is clearly that inflation has come down a lot, and the job market has cooled to a level which is around where we think full employment is,‚Äù Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said in a CNBC interview Thursday after the latest consumer price data was released. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like to get both of them to stay in the space where they are right now.‚Äù*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Some obstacles ahead*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*While keeping inflation at bay may not be an easy task, the latest data indicates that though prices are not receding from their troublesome heights of a few years ago, the rate at which they are increasing is pulling back.*\n\n*The 12-month rate for the all-items consumer price index was at 2.4% in September, while the producer price index, a proxy for wholesale inflation and a leading gauge for pipeline pressures, showed an annual rate of 1.8%.*\n\n*Goldman‚Äôs projection that the PCE index is heading to 2% is also about in line with tracking from the Cleveland Fed.*\n\n*The central bank district‚Äôs ‚Äúinflation nowcasting‚Äù dashboard pegs the 12-month headline PCE rate at 2.06% for September, which would get rounded up to 2.1%. However, on an annualized pace, inflation for the entire third quarter is running at just a 1.4% rate ‚Äî well below the Fed‚Äôs 2% goal.*\n\n*To be sure, there are some caveats to show that policymakers still have some work to do.*\n\n*Core inflation, which excludes food and energy and is a metric that the Fed considers a better measure of longer-term trends, is expected to run at a 2.6% annual rate for the PCE in September, according to Goldman. Using just the consumer price index, core inflation was even worse in September, at 3.3%.*\n\n*Fed officials, though, see the unexpectedly high shelter inflation numbers as a major driver of the core measure, which they figure will ease as a lower trend in rents works its way through the data.*\n\n*Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Sept. 30, addressing the rent situation, said he expects housing inflation to continue to recede while ‚Äúbroader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation.‚Äù*\n\n*From a policy standpoint, lower inflation opens the door for the Fed to keep cutting rates, particularly as it turns its attention to the labor market, though there‚Äôs some trepidation about how quickly it should move.*\n\n*September‚Äôs half percentage point reduction to a fed funds range of 4.75% to 5% was unprecedented for an economy in expansion, and the Fed at the very least is expected to return to its normal quarter-point pace. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic even said Thursday he‚Äôd be open to skipping a move altogether at the November meeting.*\n\n*‚ÄúAggressive easing would risk spiking consumer demand just as it is settling into a sustainable pace,‚Äù PNC senior economist Kurt Rankin said in a post-PPI analysis. ‚ÄúThis result would in turn put pressure on businesses to meet that demand, re-igniting gains in those businesses‚Äô own costs as they jockey for the necessary resources to do so.‚Äù*\n\n*Futures traders are betting on a near certainty that the Fed cuts rates by a quarter point at both the November and December meetings.*", "id": "1g2lc41", "created_utc": 1728809095.0, "score": 450, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 200, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But Tesla‚Äôs first car was sold in 2008. They are almost at 20 years of car making and still have not built their supply chain to meet demand. \n\nThere are also concerns of foreign EVs overtaking them which would require price drop to gain back market share. All of which is brought back to lack of production and cost of machinery for their production lines. So yeah they can make cars. They do not have the supply chain efficiency that the other car makers have.

It‚Äôs not optimal for sure, but it‚Äôs not where your analysis on the likelihood of Rivian‚Äôs success should stop. \n\nIf Rivian is able to become positive gross margin per vehicle sold within the next couple quarters like they predict then that‚Äôs a positive sign. If not, then I would be more worried for sure. This would indicate that they were correct in identifying the cost issues with their Gen1 platform, fixing them in Gen2, and otherwise improving their manufacturing efficiencies.\n\nAdditionally, the ‚Äú$30k loss per vehicle‚Äù is an old figure that we haven‚Äôt seen updated with the measures they‚Äôre taken for Gen2.\n\nSome of the steps Rivian took for Gen2:\n- Significant electronic architecture redesign that eliminates many ECUs (and thus suppliers)\n- Significant reduction in wiring harnesses as a result of ECU reduction (saves material and labor)\n- Shutdown of their factory in early 2024 where they implemented changes to the production line to improve efficiency\n- Switched to exclusively using their own in-house motors (as opposed to Bosch supplied)\n- Switched from 3 shifts to 2 shifts to capture these implemented efficiencies\n- Stopped honoring price vouchers for reservation holders as of September. Previously Rivian committed to honoring the original prices (pre covid) for anyone who already has a reservation. This is an example of Rivian intentionally taking a temporary profit hit in order to build brand image\n- Renegotiated pricing with suppliers. Initially Rivian took it in the arse from suppliers in terms of pricing. This was unavoidable because from the suppliers‚Äô perspective Rivian is low volume, new for them to deal with, and risky. So the prices for all supplier parts was consequently significantly higher than it would be for someone like Toyota or Tesla. Rivian now has much better leverage (prob still worse than older bigger companies though) than they initially had in order to negotiate fairer pricing\n- Introduction of lower cost LFP batteries\n\nNONE of these improvements have been captured in an earnings report yet. We will see in early November if they‚Äôre making an impact however Rivian is claiming it will take at earliest until Q4 (so earnings report in early 2025) to see positive gross margin per vehicle on paper. If, despite all of the efforts implemented above for Gen2, Rivian is still losing $30k then I will concede that R2 is in trouble.\n\nSo in conclusion, your ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù is very surface level and assumes Rivian is unaware of their situation, is taking no action, has no plans in place, and is that the R2 will be exactly the same despite being a different product segment. Also your belief that lower volume higher cost vehicles should have higher profit margin than lower cost higher volume cars is an incorrect assumption. It depends entirely on the business model and plans. I guarantee that Tesla is losing money on each cybertruck sold, they just dont publish that data (they dont even publish the number of cybertrucks sold), because its irrelevant to the overall business which relies on profits from their mass market vehicles.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

I liked how you excluded $50k for retirement savings as if that shouldn't be included in.. what were we calculating again? Oh, retirement savings.  So your real number is $100k in savings.\n\nBut they also *don't* pay 35% taxes on income in most states, *don't* have a $4k mortgage payment unless they recently bought a million dollar home under current high mortgage rates, and *don't* spend $50k per year on food, clothes, and entertainment unless they're living the high life.

Intel is working on cost-efficiency and nimble operations (aka milking every cent out of all those multi-billion investments).\n* Pat also revealed that Intel Foundry (18A node) has 12 active customer engagements and 8 product tape-ins expected by 2025.

{"title": "Part 3: Archer Aviation is Going to Pick Up Major News from Japanese Airlines (JAL) and Sumitomo Because of Volocopter's Insolvency", "selftext": "Insolvency is one hell of a word that nobody wants to hear but here we are. Volocopter is a German Advanced Air Mobility AAM company that has fallen on some bad times as of lately. Here's what we know. The silence is deafening and there is blood in the waters. \n\nVolocopter had a direct relationship with investors such as Mercedes Benz-Group, Geely (also backing EHang), and Japanese Airlines JAL specifically via Sumitomo Group. Sumitomo group has invested millions into Volocopter through multiple funding rounds and most recently a Series E funding round that concluded March 4, 2023. \n\nTo date, Volocopter is ahead and behind in so many ways regarding the eVTOL AAM business. Volocopter is positioned in the Asia markets nicely in collaboration with Geely in China and Singapore obtaining flight agreements with local aviation authorities to integrate eVTOL services within Singapore's urban transport network. Geely, gives them potential of market entry into China. All seem like good news and blue sky's ahead. Not so fast. \n\nThe other Asian entry point is from JAL and Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo. This is where things start to get real interesting because the background news for JAL, Sumitomo, Volocopter, Mercedes, Geely, and Archer Aviation has been decimenting at a dizzying pace. The news for Volocopter and VoloCity is not good news for Volocopter at all. \n\nThis information broke on a Japanese website and was alerted to me on another reddit sub. [https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/column/18/02892/100200027/?n\\_cid=nbpnxt\\_twbn](https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/column/18/02892/100200027/?n_cid=nbpnxt_twbn) The site is in Japanese but you can translate it. The funny thing is it was not picked up by any US news sites as of yet. The news is telling and potentially disastrous for Volocopter. \n\n**10.04.2024 Sumitomo changes aircraft from Volocopter to Archer Aviation...** \n\n>Figure 1: Status of each company's investigation published by the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition The big change is that JAL's flight operations have been taken over by **Soracle**, a company jointly established by JAL and Sumitomo Corporation, and **the aircraft used has been changed from Germany's Volocopter to the U.S. company Archer Aviation**. Incidentally, Marubeni is also considering using aircraft from the U.S. company Lift Aircraft (Source: Japan Association for the 2025 World Expo).\n\n>The major change from the status of consideration disclosed in August 2023 is that the flight operations that were previously planned to be carried out solely by Japan Airlines (JAL) will be taken over by Soracle, a new company jointly established by JAL and Sumitomo Corporation in June 2024. **In addition, the aircraft to be used has been changed from the Volocopter-type eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft \"VoloCity\" from Germany's Volocopter to the fixed-wing aircraft \"Midnight (M001)\" from Archer Aviation of the United States** (¬†**Figure 2**¬†).\n\nArcher Aviation has not reported on this news yet. There has been nothing but silence. Why? \n\nBecause of this I did some digging. Let's start with Volocopter. Why the switch? Turns out that Volocopter is going through a lot of turbulence right now. Remember, Volocopter is a private company so getting a lot of details is difficult but one can read the tea leaves. \n\nThe first sign of real trouble is none other than the Paris Olympics where Volocopter was supposed to have its day in the sun. The setup couldn't have been more perfect for Volocopter eVTOL AAM entry point into the Asian and European air transportation markets. French President Emmanuel Macron was supposed to fly one from right inside central Paris as the first commercial eVTOL flying passenger. That never happened and in short, Dirk Hoke and Volocopter fumbled the ball or rather, pooched the kick. I don't know many european phrases for \"they fucked it up\". \n\nFor some reason, Dirk Hoke and Volocopter thought that their 2 seater eVTOL/AAM in which 1 seat is a pilot and the other is a passenger was going to make it through the European Aviation Safety Agency EASA in time for the Paris Olympics. It did not and the eVTOL demonstration was scaled back significantly leaving perhaps a death blow to the eVTOL maker. \n\nThe fallout has been severe whilst coming from multiple angles and corresponding investment groups related to Volocopter. Reports started flying (more flight puns) that dreams were dashed and Volcopter failed to deliver. \n\n[August 8, 2024 France 24:](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240808-paris-flying-taxi-test-flights-scrapped-during-olympics)\n\n# Paris scraps plans for Olympic ‚Äòflying taxis‚Äô\n\n>Despite initial promises, so-called 'flying taxis' will not be circling above Paris during the Olympic Games this summer. German manufacturer Volocopter Thursday said it has scrapped test flights of the 18-rotor drones that resemble small helicopters over delays in the certification for the vehicle‚Äôs engine.\n\n>Volocopter CEO Dirk Hoke said the delay was due to \"an American supplier who was not capable of providing what he had promised\".\n\n>He said the motors would be sent back to France next week but not in time for the test flights to be held in Paris before the Olympics close.\n\n[August 9, 2024 Axios:](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/09/air-taxis-olympic-moment-whats-next) \n\n>**Why it matters:**¬†Air taxis were supposed to be¬†[zipping over Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAJQ1t6ErMg)¬†during the past two weeks, but the electric aircraft ‚Äî which take off and land vertically ‚Äî still need regulatory approval.\n\n>**Driving the news:**¬†One such company, Archer Aviation, plans to launch a Los Angeles air mobility network as early as 2026, it announced yesterday.\n\n[August 11, 2024 AP News reported:](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-paris-flying-taxis-82af3b21726dc6ebbc99da076b98d14b) \n\n# Air taxis failed to get certified for the Paris Olympics.

To put it nicely, they're fucked. \n\nI don't if you caught the repeated blaming by former, now transitioning, CEO Dirk Hoke of an anonymous \"American Supplier\" who seemingly did not deliver a part is the sole reason why they did not obtain EASA Type Certification. I get that this happens in hardware and hardware and manufacturing is well HARD. I understand that but the notion that your entire premises of existence is on a single American part is ridiculous and as my father used to tell me; I don't want to hear excuses. \n\nAgain, the fallout from here would prove to be severe for both Dirk Hoke and Volocopter. For Dirk Hoke's part [he is out as CEO of Volocopter](https://www.volocopter.com/en/newsroom/volocopter-to-undertake-leadership-changes). For Volocopter somewhere in the news cycle [via news publication The Air Current the words considering Insolvency and \"finding new funding\"](https://theaircurrent.com/feed/dispatches/volocopter-secures-new-funding-from-existing-investors/) has entered the chat; or rather the venture capital news corners. \n\nIt's so bad that [Dirk Hoke has already found another job as of September 18, 2024](https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/news/dirk-hoke-appointed-as-new-ceo-of-voith-group/). \n\n>Dirk Hoke has been appointed as the new President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Voith GmbH & Co. KGaA. The Voith Management GmbH¬†[Shareholders‚Äô Committee](https://voith.com/corp-en/company/company-overview/supervisory-board.html)¬†announced that Hoke will assume the role no later than April 1, 2025.¬†\n\nTo this day, while there are new board members on Volocopter from Mercedes (former Daimler AG) and Geely China there has been no news on acquiring a new CEO for the role. \n\n>[Volocopter to Undertake Leadership Changes](https://www.volocopter.com/en/newsroom/volocopter-to-undertake-leadership-changes): September 2, 2024\n\n>Dr. Dieter Zetsche, former CEO Daimler AG, appointed as Chairman of the Advisory Board\n\n>Dr. Zhihao Xu, CEO of Geely Technology Group, joins the Advisory Board\n\n>CEO Dirk Hoke to step down from his role in February 2025 at his own request\n\n**The GREAT News for Archer**\n\nTo me, it is very telling that NO NEW CEO has been appointed to Volocopter. Where does all that Series Funding from A - E GO? Sumitomo in that news article as of 10/4/2024 seemingly backed out of Volocopter and  is now dealing with Archer Aviation. \n\nEven though Volocopter is private you can track their balance sheet roughly through [Crunchbase ](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/volocopter/company_financials)and other sources. They roughly have $579 million of investment from investors, including Geely, WP Investment, Mercedes-Benz Group, Intel Capital, and BlackRock as[ reported in their initial Series E funding round for $170 million](https://www.volocopter.com/en/newsroom/series-e-financing-round). But you'll notice that they had a ridiculously long funding roundt that turned into a big Japanese pivot by the end - [Volocopter in Japan](https://www.volocopter.com/en/newsroom/japan-series-e-regulatory-pathway). So if we're tracking, the Series E funding round went from March 4, 2022 to March 4, 2023 concluding on the Japanese JAL Sumitomo news. \n\nTo put it in perspective, OpenAI's funding round started in October 2, 2024 and concluded in 2024. \n\nThe notion that Volocopter took an entire year to close a funding round can only mean one thing. Stipulations and milestones. And I mean stipulations and clauses like you've never imagined a contract could have. You don't deliver TYPE certification we're taking our money back. You don't do this, we're taking our money back. You don't do that, we're taking our investment back. Or, they never really got the investment in the first place through not reaching milestones. \n\nThe tea leaves are easy to follow here. You close Series E funding by the Japanese Osaka Asian corridor. You promise and underdeliver for the Paris Olympics and blame the Americans. You don't receive TYPE Certification from EASA on time. All of this has lead to Japan now pulling the rug and the seemingly that $579 million investment is no longer Volocopter's.\n\nThat's how I read these tea leaves. Moreover, Archer has not given any recognition to the news that was laid out by that Japanese news paper. One can only surmise that the deal(s) are still being worked out by Archer, JAL, and Sumitomo. Something is there obviously but we just don't know exactly what. \n\nNews on this, should be breaking soon if not immentily. \n\nIn the least, I would imagine Archer gets to take over any investment once promised to Volocopter from JAL/Sumitomo Group and is the reason Volocopter is in an absolute death spiral of solvency need. At the most, perhaps this is an opportunity for the first eVTOL AAM merger where Archer takes the entire investment, more investment, and portions of the Volocopter IP to obtain a larger Asian corridor presence in China and other premium Asian markets outside of just Japan. \n\nI hate to say it but for Volocopter this makes a lot of sense. The 2 seater aircraft is bland and uninspiring. It doesn't yield the future but rather some teenagers scaled up a DJI drone and tried to make it a company. I hate to give the brutal take there but that is what their passenger aircraft looks like. The other parts of their business seem much more promising and practical like the transport drones and object delivery eVTOL plans. Leading with a 2 seater eVTOL is DOA in my opinion but they do have interesting pieces for sure such as an already up and running smaller size manufacturing plant located in Bruchsal, Germany. \n\nThis DD is highly speculative and is based on assumptions and news articles that are leading but not anything definitive. After, Joby's Toyota announcement I believe Archer is cooking up their own major news announcement that coincides with their own regulatory approvals from the U.S. FAA, specifically the SFAR.\n\n The other news here worth noting is specifically what Japan Airlines has been doing in the eVTOL space. The company that I mentioned [Sumitomo Corporation and JAL jointly establish an eVTOL operating company as of June 3, 2024 named Soracle.](https://www.sumitomocorp.com/en/jp/news/topics/2024/group/20240603) \n\n>Sumitomo Corporation has been pursuing commercialization in air mobility services since 2018 as it seeks to diversify its longstanding aviation business. In 2020, as part of efforts to develop this new market in Japan, it invested in a company developing an air traffic control system for unmanned aircraft that will be critical when integrating these mobility services into society.\n\n>JAL aims to create relationships and social connections through the movement of people and goods by leveraging the technology, observations, and operational expertise it has accumulated in the air transportation business to operate air mobility services and further develop its business in Japan.\n\n>JAL and Sumitomo Corporation entered into a business alliance in the air mobility sector in 2020 (\\*2) and have been working toward the realization of eVTOL-based mobility services. In addition, the two companies are undertaking studies and making preparations (\\*3) for the development of a next-generation air mobility business, including participation in the \"Public-Private Committee for Advanced Air Mobility, Air Mobility Revolution and Social Implementation ‚Äì The Osaka Roundtable (\\*4), which positions Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan as a milestone toward the social implementation of air mobility services.\n\n>The establishment of Soracle will leverage the strengths of both companies. This includes Sumitomo Corporation‚Äôs airline industry network and the expertise it has built up through diversified business activities and JAL‚Äôs expertise in safe air transport operations. The new company will provide opportunities to further strengthen Sumitomo Corporation and JAL's cooperative relationship, and accelerate their respective air mobility initiatives through the operation of eVTOL services.\n\n>Both companies aim to realize the social implementation of safe and reliable eVTOLs, build a transportation network connecting the regions and create new value through mobility in the sky.\n\nSo all of this [once planned excitement for JAL and Volocopter](https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2021/10/26/japan-airlines-plans-evtol-operations-from-2025/) is now being shifted to Archer Aviation. What else may become shifted to Archer in the Asian Markets? \n\n**October 26, 2021**\n\n>JAL said that eVTOL ‚Äúis expected to play an active role in a wide range of fields, such as Air Taxi services, emergency lifesaving and disaster response, taking advantage of its mobility similar to that of a helicopter‚Äù.\n\n>‚ÄúJAL, as a professional aviation company, aims to create a prosperous and sustainable society through safe and secure comprehensive air mobility operations,‚Äù the carrier continued.\n\n>‚ÄúUtilizing our expertise in air mobility operations, we will provide next-generation transportation and mobility infrastructure that meets the needs of local communities, and promote initiatives to achieve the SDGs while solving local issues in areas such as disaster response and medical care.‚Äù\n\n>Last year Japan Airlines signed a cooperation agreement with German aircraft manufacturer Volocopter (pictured) ‚Äúto promote the development of the Urban Air Mobility industry for next generation air transportation options of passengers and goods‚Äù.\n\nWaiting for this news to break any day now. \n\nI am building shares at the current cost basis of $2.85 and \\~$3.10.

And one of the best in the whole ‚Äûelectric transportation of any kind‚Äú industry.We have designed and validated our own motors, inverters, batteries and battery management systems. Hardware, controls, software, system integration - we did it. We have established a close development and commercial cooperation with our battery cell supplier Molicell.

{"title": "Boeing‚Äôs Endless Doom Loop Gives No Respite to New CEO", "selftext": "> As Boeing Co. lurches from one crisis to the next, there‚Äôs been one constant for the embattled planemaker: Its predicament appears to be only getting worse.\n\n> From a freak accident that blew a door-size hole into the fuselage of an airborne 737 Max to revelations of sloppy workmanship and now a crippling strike entering its second month ‚Äî the icon of US manufacturing hasn‚Äôt been able to catch a break since the first days of January. Cash is dwindling, plane production is anemic and the stock is heading for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis in 2008.\n\n> Combined, the episodes have exposed quality lapses at Boeing and its supply chain, alongside a corrosive culture a quarter-century in the making, where pressure over costs and schedule permeated decision-making. Earlier this year, customers finally revolted and the board shook up leadership, hiring Kelly Ortberg in August out of retirement to fix the beleaguered manufacturer. \n\n> In his two months on the job, Ortberg has made a series of blunt moves. He removed the head of the defense and space division and tried to short-circuit a strike by taking a higher offer directly to workers ‚Äî a move that backfired and only hardened the union‚Äôs resolve. \n\n> His latest maneuver came late on Friday, when Ortberg said Boeing would cut 10% of its workforce, equivalent to about 17,000 people. And he tucked in a hint that more dramatic steps might be needed to get the company back on course. \n\n> The comments suggest that Boeing under Ortberg may double down on the field for which it is best known: Commercial aviation. The unceremonious departure of Ted Colbert as head of the defense and space business put those subsidiary‚Äôs shortcomings into sharp relief ‚Äî made more glaring still on Friday when Boeing said the unit would have about $2 billion in charges in the third quarter. \n\n> Rating agencies have put Boeing on notice with a warning that it may slip below investment grade, a move that would make the planemaker the biggest so-called fallen angel in corporate US history. The company has only a small buffer on top of the $10 billion of cash and short-term securities that it needs to avoid slipping to jut status. The toll from the strike increases the urgency to tap markets sooner rather than later for fresh financing. \n\n> All told, Boeing will record $5 billion in combined charges for its two largest businesses when it formally reports third-quarter earnings, the company said Friday evening in a surprise announcement. Besides the defense and space charges, Boeing will book additional costs for pushing back its 777X model once more, leaving its largest widebody aircraft with a delay of about six years.\n\n> Much is unclear about Boeing‚Äôs turnaround efforts. The ramp-up in production that was supposed to help cash flow has been undercut by the recent strike, and the defense and space business continues to hemorrhage money. \n\n> Longer-term, Boeing may need to make some tough calls on unprofitable areas like its space endeavors. The division made global headlines a few weeks ago when its Starliner capsule returned to earth without humans on board. It was an ignominious end to its first crewed mission to orbit after NASA decided not to risk putting two astronauts back into the glitch-prone spacecraft.\n\n> When the strike started in mid September, the CEO urged workers to embrace the future and not hold grudges, a nod to a 2014 contract that cost them their pensions. Senior management took solidarity pay reductions when Ortberg announced furloughs to preserve cash, and the latest job cuts will also include executives and management, he said.\n\n> But with so-called touch labor accounting for less than 5% for the total cost of a commercial aircraft program, some observers wonder why Boeing isn‚Äôt moving with more urgency to end the work stoppage that‚Äôs adding to its financial distress. \n\n> The strike is cascading through Boeing‚Äôs supply chain, heightening the risk that the recovery in the planemaker‚Äôs own factories will be slow and halting even once workers are back on the job. And so far, Boeing hasn‚Äôt said where the workforce cuts will occur, or what they might cost the company in terms of severance. Announcing the job cuts in the middle of labor negotiations is also a strategy fraught with risk. \n\n> On the one hand, Ortberg wants to instill a sense of urgency and shared sacrifice, said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. But on the other hand, the move threatens further antagonizing the very workers Boeing needs to restart jetliner production, at a time when skilled mechanics are in high demand. Even before Friday‚Äôs announcement, the war of words had intensified. Both Boeing and the union filed formal complaints accusing the other of breaching the protocol for labor negotiations.\n\n(Selected Excerpts from Bloomberg)", "id": "1g2wx8k", "created_utc": 1728845813.0, "score": 688, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 2275 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 8 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Boeing's hitmen haven't worked in months", "score": 158, "replies": [{"body": "They got laid off", "score": 77, "replies": []}, {"body": "üî´üî´", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "puts on BA then if the hitmen are off.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Great read I always heard the labor cost were less than 5%.

As a contract consultant I am totally capitalist, however even I know the importance of an experienced loyal workforce. \n\nI know the steps that have to have happened to fuck up that badly. The Flight Control Systems (FCS) are safety critical. They are class 1, (DO-178C DAL A). Nothing should interfere with their operation. Yet MCAS was allowed to overwrite the FCS. When you design a Safety critical system you use multiple types of sensors from multiple locations as input. MCAS used 1 sensor in 1 location and used this to overwrite outputs from the FCS. The amount of lies and fake documents produced to get that through the certification bodies is a lot!\n\nThe whole reason for Boeing doing this is because the Airbus 320 family were using engines that were 20% more efficient. That is a big saving on the operating costs and customers liked that. Boeing had to change their engines to compete. They added larger engines which changed the position of the 737 centre of gravity. When this happened the Flight Control System (FCS) software should have been rewritten and retested. This would have cause around 12 months delay  and around $20 million.
