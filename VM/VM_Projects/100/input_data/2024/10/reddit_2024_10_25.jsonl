This doesn't happen to Berkshire too often these days -- after all, the company has more than $100 billion in cash. \n\nThe second, and more common, reason Buffett sells stocks is because of changing fundamentals, or a changing competitive landscape. As Buffett said:    \n\n> We sell really when we think we're reevaluating the economic characteristics of the business. We probably had one view of the long-term competitive advantage of the company at the time we've bought it, and we may have modified that. That doesn't mean that we think the company is going into some disasterous period, or anything like that. We think McDonald's has a fine future, we think Disney has a fine future, and there are others. But we don't think their competitive advantage is as strong as we thought it was when we initially made the decision.  \n\nBad reasons to sell - To be thorough, there are some bad reasons to sell a stock that investors should avoid. These include, but aren't necessarily limited to:   \n\n> Because the stock's price plunged: This is perhaps the worst possible reason to sell a stock. If your original reasons for buying still apply, and the price has gone down significantly, it should be looked at as an opportunity to buy, not to sell.  \n\n> Because the stock's price increased sharply: I've been guilty of this one a few times, and at first, this might not sound like a bad reason to sell. For example, I sold Tesla after shares roughly tripled from its IPO price, even though all signs were pointing toward dramatically improved vehicle sales and a path to long-term profitability. In the years since, shares have increased another 300% or so from where I sold it.  \n\n> Because a billionaire sold: This applies even if that billionaire is named Warren Buffett. Now, if a billionaire sells a stock, it could be a good time to do a little digging and find out why. However, I'm saying that you shouldn't sell just because a billionaire did. For example, I mentioned that Buffett sold some Goldman Sachs a couple years ago, but a little research would show that this was mainly to finance an acquisition rather than because of fears about the stock itself.  \nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/16/how-warren-buffett-decides-its-time-to-sell-a-stoc.aspx", "score": 248, "replies": [{"body": "thanks for the input!

Then there's quite a bit of Jan 300c as well.\n\nSo basically bulls need to keep up the assault and push 260-280 next week and it puts all the 300s in Dec and Jan in play.

{"title": "TSLA shares add billions to Elon Musk's net worth", "selftext": "Elon Musk's net worth is estimated to have grown by tens of billions of dollars on Thursday, when Tesla ( TSLA ) shares hit their highest price ever. With Friday's trading volatility, his wealth is expected to increase even further.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla reported mixed earnings, but the results were encouraging, with investors focusing on several factors including strong margins, earnings per share, net income, and the company's lowest-ever cost per item sold. This was Tesla's first earnings growth in seven quarters.\n\nMuch of this growth may also be attributed to Musk's new round of promises.\n\nHe predicted that Tesla will start offering carpooling in at least two states next year (California and Texas), where he plans to get approval from “fully unsupervised” Fully Self-Driving (FSD) regulators. Musk also revealed his “best guess” for 2025 deliveries, which he said will increase by 20 to 30 percent, as Tesla plans to start selling more affordable models in early 2024. Tesla plans to sell more than 1.81 million electric vehicles in 2024.\n\nIn an earnings call with analysts, Musk said, “I predict Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long shot.”\n\nMusk controls nearly 13 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares, but could buy more at a steep discount if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. He also owns a majority stake in SpaceX, which he leads, as well as artificial intelligence startup xAI and social media platform X (META) (formerly Twitter).\n\nTesla's gains on Thursday boosted Musk's net worth to about $270 billion, up $33.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index is updated at the close of the New York market. The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires Index is expected to grow by $26 billion on Thursday to about $269 billion. Musk's net worth increased by another $3 billion to nearly $273 billion as of Friday, Forbes reported.\n\nThe second-richest person on the list is Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) founder and Musk ally Larry Ellison, with a net worth of $213.8 billion, according to Forbes. He was followed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with $207.7 billion and $200.5 billion, respectively.\n\nTesla shares were up more than 2 percent in regular trading Friday morning at about $266 a share, up 55 percent in the past six months.
