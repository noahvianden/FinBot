When you deconstruct LEU's balance sheet and remove the GAAP distortions, you get much higher valuations as LEU includes many things in its earnings category that inflate its value. At $56 it was 51 P/E. That would make its current P/E around \\~89.\n\nLEU's revenue stream is extremely blocky and not seasonally predictable.

Unfortunately, retail investors are rarely privy to accurate accounting data. The buy side never takes 10-K and 10-Qs at face value: they pay their analysts to pull apart and rebuild financial statements so they can discern which companies are good investments.\n\n> I don't understand how the P/E can go from 15 to 90. If that is indeed true then is the company is cooking up data? I'm confused lol.\n\nYes and no. The problem is with how GAAP allows companies to categorize revenue, earnings, goodwill, free cash flow, etc. They get considerable optionality in what they include or don't include. This means company balance sheets are incompatible. Even if they're in the same GICS subindustry, they are using a different set of criteria for what are putatively the same metrics. Additionally, they get penalized when their accountants aren't savvy enough to play the game properly.  \n\nMind you, for the last two decades the correlation between stock prices and earnings has considerably strengthened. Investors expect earnings to continuously grow and beat analyst expectations. It is in the companies' best interests to fudge the headline numbers to make themselves look as good as possible. \n\nI don't know if LEU does any tomfoolery as egregious as Soundhound labeling contract termination fees as revenue, but their official reports don't match the database I'm using. And I trust the latter far more. \n\n> Can you give me a link to your data?

Between 2018 and 2020 they made some great strides, but lately its been a slow march where they make it less useful as a driving assistant feature (car doesn't actually go the speed I set, so I have to tap the accelerator frequently which disables auto-braking) without much discernible improvement in it's ability to drive. It still makes stupid lane change choices. I'd prefer that it just go the speed I set and only change lanes when I ask it to, at least until it gets better.\n\nThe arguments about the cameras are valid, I think. Humans have far more neurons dedicated to vision than computers have artificial neurons for vision. We also have foveated vision where we have excellent vision in the center and mainly detect motion out of our peripheral vision. This makes our visual system much more efficient. Our visual system and decision-making processes are also less feed-forward than modern neural nets and don't rely on stochastic gradient descent for learning. We also have the ability to move our head around to get a better view of things, unlike the fixed cameras on Teslas, where the car has to \"creep\" to try to do something similar. If a bird poops on the windshield in front of your face or hail cracks your windshield there, you can lean to the side and look around the issue until you get to safety. The cameras are fixed and if there's a sudden issue with their view, the only option is to slam on the brakes and for the car to pray to the AI gods that other cars are paying attention. The cool thing about artificial neural nets is you can pretty much feed any type of information into them and they have the potential to find useful patterns. So, why not give them a leg up on humans? Radar, sonar, lidar, cameras all could add their own contributions. Removing the other sensors was pure cost-cutting. It was not because of \"false positives\" from the radar or whatever the excuse was -- false positives went through the roof when they disabled my radar. I used to be able to drive my performance model 3 behind some big SUV and know if a car was in front of them or if they were going slow for no reason, because the radar would get bounced under that SUV and would detect the car in front of them. That was a useful feature. The car was also able to start automated emergency braking when that front car slowed suddenly, often causing Teslas to brake before the human driver knew there was an issue. That feature is now gone. Doppler from the radar made the cars much more sensitive to changes in velocity. With frames from a camera, you can't judge changes in speed from just a single frame. You need to capture at least two frames and be certain of the boundaries you drew around the edges of the car to be sure it is actually decelerating. If it's rainy or there's dirt in front of the cameras, and the image isn't clear, the car's artificial depth perception isn't going to be as good (just like a human's isn't). With radar, rain and dirt don't matter. The point isn't to build a replacement for a human driver...the point is the build a car that can get from point a to point b safely without a human driver. If additional \"senses\" gives the neural net a leg up, they should take advantage of that. Artificial neural nets don't have biology's billions of years with trillions of organisms being constantly improved.

Why I’m Betting Big On RDDT", "selftext": "Position: 201 shares (across two accounts)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/195iasgqxhvd1.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=948daa1764b84aa28ed2fda3511b0e95d61c24bb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekw775hqxhvd1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0ae4c81ebaa95fc16fe65b0a01d960b5b3623a\n\nLet me start by saying I know *fuck all* about investing and I don’t pick stocks.\n\nBUT I work in digital and I’m loading up on **RDDT** because holy shit, I don’t need to be a Wall St quant to know these guys are about to print money.\n\n# Reddit’s traffic is blasting off 🚀🚀\n\nFirst off, Reddit’s organic traffic is going **nuclear**. Check out this hard-on of a growth chart, thanks to Google's search engineers:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5y3orvlywhvd1.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba80aec2dd27a78d6909c600983d6c2ef6d9e3fe\n\nThat’s **500% growth in a year**. FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT. Reddit is straight-up snorting Google's algorithm.\n\nThey're now pulling in **1.1 BILLION** users a month from Google. That's B-ILLION with a 'B'.\n\nGoogle’s so cucked by Reddit they’re basically making them their side piece. How do you pull in that much traffic and NOT back up the Brinks truck to the front door?\n\n# Sundar and Altman are Reddit's new sugar daddies 💰🤖\n\nSo why is Sundar simping so hard for Reddit?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ww81b72xhvd1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8841cbbfe29f34e5883f66d1985656750de11f8d\n\nAI is popping off, and Reddit is sitting on a fucking gold mine. The new winners of the AI era won’t just be the chip makers. It’s the **information gatekeepers** like Reddit who are set to win.\n\nAI is only as good as the data it's trained on. And UGC on Reddit is GOLD for AI training.\n\nGoogle and OpenAI already snaffled up the open web like a pair of greedy truffle hogs, but [they need more data](https://youtu.be/8_2yFCm5sSM?si=ane2hsnlq9Q-7lOD&t=319). Current events, trending topics, and hot takes? That’s Reddit folks, and the upvote system basically hand-feeds AI models what humans like. **Reddit = training wheels for AI**.\n\nIf you’ve left Reddit lately you might have noticed the open web is dying. Big tech platforms are building closed ecosystems. Google is killing off independent publishers through their ‘Helpful Content’ update (which is a huge misnomer).\n\nAs this gets worse (and it always gets worse) the only creators left to make deals with AI Platforms for FRESH data will be the large publishers that survive, the big social media firms and…Reddit.\n\nAnd Sam Altman’s packing a 9% stake in Reddit? Of course he is. Mmm backroom suck jobs for everyone.\n\n# Too many AI cucks spoil the broth 🍆🥣\n\nHere’s where things get extra spicy: Reddit’s already in bed with the big boys. [Google](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/expanded-reddit-partnership/) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-and-reddit-partnership/) hit Reddit up first like they were sliding into the DMs at 3am.\n\nReddit’s not dumb—they know they’re sitting on that sweet, sweet data juice. So now [they’re cock blocking](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205244/reddit-blocking-search-engine-crawlers-ai-bot-google) any AI models or search engines that won’t pay up. **You want the goods? You gotta pony up, bitch**.\n\nThese deals are small fry right now, but give it time and Reddit will be swimming in licensing money like Scrooge McDuck.\n\n# Ads on Reddit are getting better 🤑\n\nUntil now? Reddit’s ads have been served up like cold McNuggets. Gross and disappointing. BUT—things are changing.\n\nThey just hired some **Google vet** who helped monetize Google’s ad empire. This pro knows how to turn clicks into cash.\n\n[Google veteran now at Reddit? Yeah, that happened](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/reddit-hires-google-veteran-ad-product-development-post-ipo/715901/)\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: Reddit’s data on YOU is next-level creepy. They know your kinks, your hobbies, and probably that you ate crayons for breakfast. So once they dial in their ads, we’re talking **precision targeting** that makes Facebook look like it’s throwing darts blindfolded.\n\nWith cookies on their way out, traditional publishers are screwed. But Reddit? Nah. They’ve got you on lock with that questionable account history. Ads are about to get hella smart, and when they do, advertisers are gonna throw big bags of cash at them.\n\n# Reddit is a traffic monster that just needs to learn to make it rain 💵 💦\n\nReddit is now the **6th most visited website on Earth**. And they’re still sitting at just a $12b market cap. Let that sink in. Oh, and they just launched their machine-learning translation into 35 new countries, so the user base is about to go GLOBAL.\n\nThey haven’t figured out how to properly monetize yet, but when they do? It's over. These guys are gonna print money.\n\n# Earnings are coming 🔥\n\nQ3 Earnings are due **October 29th**.\n\nEstimated 50% YoY growth to $310m? Nah, try 86% or **$385 million**.\n\nI have no idea how I pulled those numbers out of my ass, but trust me, they’ll probably hit.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n🚀 Reddit’s traffic from Google has gone full YOLO with a 500% pump in the last year.\n\n🚀 AI companies are thirsty for Reddit’s data, so expect fat licensing deals to keep rolling in.\n\n🚀 They just hired a Google ad wizard to fix their garbage ads and make them print money.\n\n🚀 With cookies dying, Reddit’s ready to serve laser-targeted ads straight to your fucked up browsing history.\n\n🚀 If they figure out how to cash in on being one of the top sites on the planet, they’ll be swimming in green.", "id": "1g6flb6", "created_utc": 1729250198.0, "score": 1623, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 560, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 days ago\n**Total Comments** | 2 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 6 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The Google vet part is about Google Veterinarians?
