Wall Street is already looking ahead to a driverless future, with one analyst arguing that if it hadn‚Äôt been for generative AI, 2024 would have been the year of the robotaxi.¬†\n\nAs driverless networks scale, one of the fiercest debates is whether ride-sharing will survive.

The big open interest looks to have sold the $260C on tuesday into thursday giving that weakness only to reopen at the $250C strike friday. So instead of $260 being the magnet, it's going to be $250 this week unless volume increases on the higher strikes.\n\nIV is lower than before but still relatively high. Lots of hype still remains around the 10/10 event and we can either see $225 or $270 going into october opex, positioning sentiment for earnings the week after.\n\nThere is a fair amount of calls further out at $250 that can still keep it around here, but it really pales in comparison to what's going away this week. So call holders need to just keep rolling calls forward to keep it up here. The biggest problem with this is going to be likely a decent amount of IV crush after the 10/10 event (earnings seem less hyped with less expected move than robotaxi and therefore less important in the eyes of options for now).\n\nWhy I'm more cautious with these events and a lot of times it's buy the rumor and sell the news, is just because of the way options and MM work. People get excited for these events, buy lots of calls. MM has to hedge by buying shares, people keep adding more/rolling profitable calls forward. Because of the large move and popularity, IV goes up and MM has to hedge even more. Calls outpace the existence of puts and just gets offsides so MM hedges way more for calls than puts, net adding of shares for them.\n\nAfter the event, there's less uncertainty or hype, IV crushes. MM has to hedge less for both existing puts and calls. Since there's more calls than puts to crush, it's a net selling of MM held shares. That drives price down and then places the previously ITM calls ATM or OTM which causes MM to hedge those even less. Then the call holders have to figure out if they want to keep their calls as the value rapidly decreases or just keep holding, especially if bears really come in and add put volume to push the share price even lower.\n\nThe only way the share price stays elevated or goes up from here sustainably is if robotaxi is that mind blowing, important of an event, that causes people to buy more actual shares (or even more calls to continue juicing the voting machine) to counteract all of the MM selling decreased hedges. To me as someone that cares about companies making money, that means actual path to significant profitability quickly.\n\nI've been watching a lot of videos of TSLA bulls and how everyone complains that the market still sees Tesla as just an auto company. That's obviously not true with current valuations. At these levels, we're going to be much higher than 100 P/E once last years EPS falls off. Even if robotaxi is working today, doubles our earnings, we'd still be at like a 60 P/E. Auto companies trade at 5-10 P/E. Megacap tech companies are trading at like 30-40 P/E.\n\nIn order to get the big players to buy and hold then continue to add millions of shares, Tesla has to show the increased earnings to justify the current share price, let alone go much higher sustainably.

{"title": "2600% gain on TIGR options, profits over 1.1M Canadian dollars using 40k in less than 2 weeks", "selftext": "**TLDR: Made over 1.1M Canadian Dollars using about 40k in multiple TIGR option buying and repositioning in less than 2 weeks. I wouldn't call it a degen gamble as I roughly talk about the reasoning and thought processes below. Though this particular opportunity came in as a surprise initially, it is within my trading style, plus 40k is only a small amount of my actual portfolio. In the screenshot the gaining percentage is rigged because it counted the the 40k deposit as gains as well, the true percentage is more like 2600-2700% rather than 20,000,000%+.**\n\n**Edit: These trades were done in USD obviously, IBKR shows performance using my base currency(Canadian Dollars) however.**\n\n**Edit 2: There are no \"Secret Scanners\" or \"Secret Watchlist\", it's just simple percentage gainers/losers available everywhere. The watchlist is constructed with hard work when the stock is not moving or not \"in play\", and they only specifically fit my trading style, it will be useless to others. Think of this way, would you commit the time and efforts to study hundreds of stocks like this TIGR when they are boring and not moving, then be ready when it begins to move?**\n\n**PS: Reddit removed my previous post because I mentioned some ticker lower than 500M market cap, so if you see I talk about 4 companies but I only really show 3, you will know a company is removed from my original write up.**\n\nOn the morning of Sept 25, when I ran my scanner, there wasn't a lot of percentage gainers/losers. However, the ticker names YINN/YANG immediately caught my attention, they are the 3x bull/bear ETFs that track FTSE 50 index of Chinese stock market (we can think of it as SPY 50 instead of 500). At the time, they were up and down 20%+, I was like what just happened. When I went over to check the index, the SSE was up more than 4% in a single day! I quickly read over the news and realized that it's a huge huge opportunity, and perfect timing. The Chinese stock market has been in a bear market for a couple of years, this could be the inflection point, and it was only the second day. To give readers a little context about myself, I was born and raised in China, immigrated to Canada in my teenage, and started full time trading on my own after graduation from university, so I have no problem reading Chinese news (I will not discuss the news here or take any political view, the only thing I can say is if an experienced trader sees this news and market condition, he/she will know it's a big big opportunity).\n\nWhat is TIGR? It's a brokerage firm that mainly operates in Singapore/Hong Kong and some other continents, but not mainland China due to the events that happened couple years ago, it is listed on the US exchange. The direct competitor is FUTU, which is another brokerage firm listed on the US exchange, with a larger market cap and user base. These two firms mainly serve Mandarin (or other types of Chinese variant) speakers around the world, but they of course support other languages. So why did I pick TIGR from the list of about 300 US listed Chinese companies? Well, there are many factors, I will very briefly discuss some of the important ones. Before I begin, I should make clear that real \"penny stocks\" should be filtered out with experience, which only leaves a certain number of companies left.\n\n1. Market Ignorance on Growth: From the year of 2022 when TIGR is banned from doing business in mainland China, TIGR had somewhere around 50M revenue with very tiny profit (mostly just breakeven), the stock traded around 3-6 per ads/adr back then. Fast forward to 2024, in the most recent quarter, the company did 87M revenue with obvious profit, yet the stock price trades in the same range. Although I'm not using net revenue here, but the ratio on net revenue is similar. Also in the most recent quarter, there is a one time loss provision that had a negative non-recurring impact on earnings of that quarter, which I will discuss later. But the main point here is that the company obviously grew a lot (I used revenue/profit here just to illustrate, but we of course need to evaluate other metrics too, such as customer number, etc. I just can't list them all here.), yet the stock trades in the same range without any market attention, which is great for traders if we can spot them, wait patiently, and strike when it begins to go up with strong catalysts.\n2. Valuation: Valuation is always a big factor when trading legit companies. In case of TIGR, when it traded in the 3s, the undervaluation is pretty obvious if the company is reporting true numbers. Before it started rising, it was trading around 3.5, which is about $550M market cap. Reading the 6K from EDGAR, we know the net asset of this company is about $500M, with almost no goodwill, intangibles, etc., because it's mostly a financial company. So it basically trades at its book value with almost no enterprise value. Yes it's a company in the financial sector with high leverage, but still. Compare it to its most direct competitor FUTU, who had around $10B market cap at 70s (stock price), with book value of about $3.5B. Run the revenue number, FUTU does about 4 times TIGR's revenue and trades about 20 times TIGR's market cap. Now for profit, TIGR actually traded at an incredibly low single digit P/E if we take the one time loss provision out and the revenue/profit growth momentum continues for TIGR. If one just spend 5 minutes reading over the earnings call transcripts, it'd be extremely obvious that TIGR was getting better because they just had their expenses lowered due to their new clearing facilities in Hong Kong. On the other hand, FUTU always traded at least high 10th in term of P/E when it was trading in the 70s. So in a direct comparison, TIGR is extremely undervalued to FUTU. I don't think I need to bring in US brokerage firms such as IBKR, Charles Schwab, or even Robinhood into comparison, it would only make the undervaluation more dramatic. So in a peer to peer comparison (but need to dig a little bit in the SEC filings and earnings), TIGR is extremely undervalued, so I assumed it would have more room to run than FUTU.\n3. Market Hype and True Beneficiary: Market Hype is a little tricky to explain, because I did have to evaluate how much of an impact this Chinese new policy would have on the market to a certain degree. I will leave this factor out for now, just remember it's important. Turning to the true beneficiaries of this wave, it's very obvious that the trading volume had gone through the roof in China, in most of the Chinese markets, volume at least double or triple'd. As I mentioned before, people around the world can use TIGR broker to buy Hang Seng stocks (Hong Kong), since they mainly serve Mandarin or other Chinese speaking customers, they should at least be getting some very good short term boost on revenue on top of their already improving revenue right? This is probably the single most important factor that narrowed my initial picking into a group of 4 stocks only, which were: TIGR, FUTU, and LU (LU are sub lenders trading in 1-2s range, also in financial sector. I liked their valuation and stuff, but I was worried about their extreme low price per share not attracting many real/legit investors, also they were not the biggest beneficiary in comparison to brokers).\n4. Information Mismatch: This applies to multiple aspects, the first aspect is language. When the news hit the tape, people who can read Chinese can obviously understand the changes better. However this is not the focus here, the 2nd factor is more crucial, it is more company related. TIGR trades in penny stock range (under $5), and it has not so straight forward share structure, also it's a foreign company that files 6K and 20F rather than the GAAP 10Q and 10K, its financial statements can be confusing to read at times. I have talked to some people who says \"oh look TIGR has over 2b shares outstanding and have a P/E of 70 or something\" while I already gradually exited most of my positions. But in reality, if one just hit Control-F and searched \"ordinary share\" in some of their 6Ks, or 20Fs, it's not hard to know that the ratio between ordinary shares and ADS/ADR is 15:1, and the true shares count for ADS is just 158m rather than over 2b. For P/E, I already mentioned before, the true P/E is in the mid-high singles. When there are so many confusing factors (which I only listed a few, but there are way more) out there plus it being a Chinese company in \"penny stock\" range, market need time to analyze and react. And in extreme cases, over confident short sellers would short too early when the share prices rises too fast, which is what I believed happened the past few days.\n5. Preparation and Timing of the Trade: For preparation, the process is simple but highly repetitive and time consuming. I have personally spent many months and thousand of hours going through and potentially studying every ticker listed in the US market (which is almost 5k companies/stocks, skipped most obvious trash stocks/companies of course), and these obviously included all the Chinese companies listed in the US. I have a watch list of companies like TIGR with low valuation and other similar characteristics, it's basically just hours of research and study. But this is not the hard part, at least not for me. The real hard part is waiting for the right time, and right time only. In my TIGR trades, if I didn't get in on the very first day (9/25) or second day (since the second day is red), it's highly likely that I would not like the risk/reward on the 3rd day and missed this whole trade since it's moving so fast. This works both ways and in all of my other trades too. If I get in too early without waiting for catalyst, the stock usually would either drift lower or just trade within an insignificant range. If I get in too late (even just 2-3 days in most cases), the risk/reward become much worse, specially when using options with heavily increased IV and share prices.\n\nSo how did I execute my trades? Basically on the first day (9/25), I got shocked and not sure how to react initially. Then I quickly narrowed my picks to a group of 4 Chinese companies, TIGR, FUTU or LU, and I decided to use options because I thought this could be a pretty good asymmetrical risk/reward trade, and I only need to risk a small amount of my portfolio. Since the undervaluation for TIGR is so significant, broker being the biggest potential beneficiary, also dating back to 2020/2021, TIGR is more choppy when rising in comparison to FUTU, but it should get there eventually. LU are in low penny stock range (they are in sub lending business which I never liked in the first place, but they are in financial sector, which is positively impacted by the new policies). When stock prices are too low, the option pricing becomes very choppy, the spread is huge (at least 0.05 if I want to buy some meaningful amount). So I thought TIGR which at the time seemed to me the best choice available. This entire process of reading news and deciding to buy TIGR from the list of almost 300 Chinese stocks took me less than an hour, as I said before, although this news came as a surprise, I don't really need that much time going over these stocks because I already studied them before, and they either didn't move much, or drifted lower these years. The only new research I needed was to read recent filings/transcripts.\n\nI bought 400 of $4 TIGR call expiring Nov 15/2024 when the stock was just below 4.1 on the first day, the average for the option was slightly higher than 0.4. Which was like 80-90% of the total trading volume on that particular contract that day. My thoughts were that the hype has already seen the initial effects, give it 50 days, it could potentially benefit from the huge trading volume change, and potentially catch real investors looking for cheap China related assets.\n\nOn the 2nd day, US listed Chinese ETFs and almost all of Chinese ADS/ADR tanked because they overshot too much on the 1st day, rising way above what the SSE index gained in China on the 1st day. The weird thing is, FUTU actually closed green that day, while TIGR dropped 3%. That got me thinking: \"I think I'm wrong, people would pay high premiums for high/top quality companies, and the valuation gap would almost always be there between TIGR and FUTU.\" On this day, I bought 150 more $4 strike price TIGR contracts expiring January of 2026, they were bought at $1.15 each. My thoughts were to \"protect the losses\" of those 400 calls bought earlier. Because the company is growing, profit is going up, even without any near term boost impacts, the stock traded $5.72 for 52 weeks high, and it should at least trade somewhere near $6 some time in this more than 1 year period. Looking back at it, the trade itself wasn't that bad, but clearly it was somewhat impacted by the other trade earlier, which should be avoided tbh.\n\nHowever on the 3rd day which got me back to my original thought and almost confirmed my thesis to a certain degree. TIGR rose 15% while FUTU gained less than 8%. I thought: \"yeah, TIGR will rise for sure, even though FUTU has the better quality here, but TIGR should eventually rise about the same amount of percentage as FUTU. Looking back at what they did back in 2020/2021, it's just TIGR would be more choppy.\" Also on the 3rd day, I finally double confirmed my belief of brokers being the most beneficial group in this wave, at least initially, before any sector rotation. Because almost all of the brokers listed in China ran the most, they were all reaching their daily gain limit everyday, some rising 35%, and others rising 60-70% in the span of 3 days depending on their daily limit. But that's not all, the trading volume in China was so huge that the official Shanghai Exchange had issues processing orders for 2 hours, which is unheard of! I actually stayed up late that night watching the Shanghai Index, as I feel the euphoria of the traders in public text channels in China (just like stocktwits or similar stuff). This absolutely proved that any brokers who had many Chinese related assets would benefit huge in the short term. Moreover, TIGR, FUTU or any other similar broker can put out \"surprise\" press releases saying they got a huge trading activities increase anytime, which would further fuel the rally. Maybe it was the lack of sleep, or maybe it was me just being too stupid, I never thought of going more aggressive during trading hours knowing the new information (Actually I lied, it was just me playing World of Warcraft during the entire market hour like a douchebag). After the close of that day, I saw the $6 contract expiring Nov 15/2024 going for only 0.10 on the ask! Because of the information disconnection between Chinese traders and US traders, at that time I knew I missed a huge opportunity. Indeed in the hindsight, I lost a big potential gain.\n\nMoving on to the 4th day, Sept 27, which is my \"hero day\", it had an early premarket high, then tanked in premarket, after it opens, it formed a double top and tanked all day. Although I just used \"pro technical words\" like double top and stuff, I think they are just non sense crap, at least in this case. Because it should move with the index, or with FUTU, if FUTU goes up, so should TIGR, which FUTU did go up that day for 5%+. In the meanwhile, I realized the huge trading volume on TIGR, also number of available shares to short were decreasing, then I realized that it must be a lot of retail shorting (specially with that double top technical crap in this case that day, without knowing shit about the fundamentals of the company). As I watched the stock tanking from 10%+ to breakeven on the day, and my options dropped even further, I knew my opportunity has finally came. I was so relieved that the market has given me the 2nd chance to correct yesterday's mistakes. I sold all of my 400 $4 contracts expiring Nov 15/2024 at a over 100% gain, some of my $4 contracts expiring 2026, bought 200 of $5 contracts expiring January of 2025, then I bought 2000 (Yes 2000) of $6 expiring Nov 15/2024. My first buy on those $6s were 0.20, but as the stock drifted lower all the way to -5%, majority of my purchases were in the 0.15s. Although not as cheap as the day before, but hey, at least I got a second chance. Because of the euphoria I was seeing in the Chinese market, I added another $15k or so to complete the purchase of these 2000 $6 contracts. But due to the risky nature of options, specially this short term one, I won't let my exposure get out of whack, so I mainly just put back all my previous gains from earlier options with just a little extra addition of funds. Up to this point, my buys has been complete.\n\nNow for my sales, since the stock rose double digits everyday for the last week, I pretty much been selling everyday, with the initial sale in the mid/low 5s (stock price) for less than a dollar a contract, all the way up to low 6s (option price) when it reached high 11s or low 12s (stock price) in the last trading hour on Friday. I never thought it could rise this high this fast, my original goal was more towards $7-8 (stock price) near the end of this bull run. On a side note, I did make a stupid hedge later which costs me about just six figure in total. With the short borrowing fees going from 0% to 6% atm, this is a turning into a very crowded trade, last week's meteoric rise involved a lot of short covers in my eyes. When trades get crowded, options become extremely expensive, there will be times where the stock goes completely insane (just anything during Covid era really), but more frequently these trades don't work out in my favor, so I just completely cut them when I feel the crowdiness. Now with the entire position of 2000 $6 contracts sold, I'm only left with the 200+ longer term position left on my $4, $5 strikes, which I just completely hedged by shorting TIGR overnight in the high 13s (which turned out to be too early, again. Who knows if it will reach completely insane numbers like back in Covid times). I will be back to sniper mode and patiently wait for the next bull run, be it a stock on my watchlist or a sector wide hype.\n\nIn summary, this entire trade netted me about 1.1M in Canadian dollars. Because this is really an unexpected event to begin with, (unlike other catalysts such as earnings, at least we know the date beforehand) I'm quite happy with how I dealt with the situation with almost no preparation. I have uploaded some images about my account gains and some trade statements, the percentage gain is completely out of whack because I took a break from trading for couple months after a string of stupid losses. (Portfolio wise they didn't hurt that much, but they were mentally frustrating) When I fund the account again with a small initial amount, the funding get calculated into gains as well. The real gaining percentage is more like 2600%-2700% rather than tens of millions.\n\nTo whoever wants to know a bit more about my trading style similar to what I did on this trade. I read at least 100+ books on trading and found Jessie C Stine's \"Insider buy Superstocks\" and Cornwall Capital's option strategies from \"The Big Shorts\" the most useful. My trading styles are very different than theirs, but I derived most of my trading methods from their general ideas. I left many hints and trails on how I would structure my trade from thought process to building a position then finally exiting in this example. It's my first post on reddit, I just wrote wherever I was thinking, so the ordering or even the logic itself will be very messy or incomplete in many places, but overall this write up should roughly explain the trade in a fairly straight way.\n\nIn the end, I want to do a shoutout to DL12345 for encouraging me to write about this trade.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvn492g08ctd1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=872813e2f51272b47162b0305b6155172302e968\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88hwnvv08ctd1.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=2794f17fee2fa27b060667e01a2bb4f96a5d1ed7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/comggb618ctd1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c1ebc98cb6a9b3169f4afe3a11262b132a69bd9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0al3w7g18ctd1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea0e097012276b8bc22b2d03cafdc83d00f21291", "id": "1fy7u0u", "created_utc": 1728308298.0, "score": 849, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 6 | **First Seen In WSB** | 5 hours ago\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 11 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Next Canadian who will sue RBC sighted over here", "score": 398, "replies": [{"body": "This guy was hedging his positions, not doubling down every opportunity possible.
