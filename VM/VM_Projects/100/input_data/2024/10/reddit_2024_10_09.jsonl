The 32-page filing lays outs a framework of potential options for the judge to consider as the case moves to the remedy phase.\n\nAntitrust enforcers said Google gained scale and data benefits from its illegal distribution agreements with other tech companies that made make its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nMehta, who ruled this summer that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets, plans to hold a trial on the proposed remedy next spring and issue a decision by August 2025. Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta’s decision, but must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so.\n\nGoogle’s Android business encompasses the operating system used on smartphones and devices as well as apps.\n\nOn Monday, a different federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store for the next three years to resolve a separate antitrust case related to its dominance of app distribution on Android smartphones.

The union is asking for 10% more than Boeing offered (30% vs 40%) and is asking for restoration of pension plans. Pension plans, according to the BLS, are about 2.6x more expensive for companies than 401k plans for union workers. Also according to the BLS, average burden rate for 401k plans is ~3.5%, so switching to a pension plan amounts to an additional compensation increase of ~5.6%. In effect, the union is asking for a raise 15.6% higher than Boeing is offering. That's about $780 million per year after the end of the current contract. So, assuming that it takes place somewhat ratably, that's ~200 million additional costs year 1, 400 mm year two, 600 mm year 3, 780 mm year 4, and then 780 mm in perpetuity.

They demoed a use case that was very compelling in their keynote. \n\nThey are casting a very wide net on B2B and B2C.\n\nI also attended their investor sessions (virtually) and was very impressed with their long-term plan.

We will expand into other markets as soon as we get regulatory approval to start tunneling in other major cities. \n\nThe cybercab prototypes we showed tonight will give you a glimpse into the future of our design ethos at Tesla. The renderings will evolve and final designs should be complete with all pencils down in the 2nd half of 2025. \n\nPrototypes are easy production is hard. We at Tesla aim to make the actual product look as good or better than what we’ve shown tonight.

Looking to mass produce in 2028 and be on the roads in all major cities shortly after - of course this will depend on regulatory approval. \n\nAnd finally we’ve partnered with McDonald’s.

{"title": "17 years ago today", "selftext": "On September 18, 2007, the Fed made a 50bps rate cut, greater than expected, despite reasonably good economic data. Markets rallied for about 3 weeks, and SPX closed at an all-time high on October 9, 2007, which would not be matched again until March 2013 in recovery from the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nOn September 18, 2024, the Fed made a 50bps rate cut, greater than expected, despite reasonably good economic data. Markets rallied for about 3 weeks, and SPX closed at an all-time high today, October 9, 2024.\n\nThis is not financial advice nearly as much as it is anecdotal evidence that we live in the Matrix.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nThe Sahm rule stood at only 17bps as of the unemployment reading of September 2007, as opposed to 50bps in September 2024. Albeit, unemployment was generally higher right around 4.6-4.7% between late 2006-2007. Additionally, the part-time gig economy is MASSIVE today compared to 2007 (but BLS still counts that as not “unemployed”)\n\nThe VIX was hovering between 16-18 during the October 2007 market peak, compared to 20-22 today.\n\nYear-over-year CPI change from December 2006 to December 2007 was 4.1%, so inflation was NOT dead when the Fed started their easing cycle. The bond market is implying a similar problem in today’s economy with increasing US treasury yields, although current YoY CPI readings are generally lower today than in 2007.\n\nUnlike 2007, this is an election year, and I operate under the assumption that all current BLS statistics are not just cooked, but deep fried.\n\nEDIT: Going to try to address some of the repeated comments I’m seeing here.\n\n“PAST PERFORMANCE DOESN’T GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS”\n\nOf course, the main point of this post was to highlight the similarities in timelines between today and 17 years ago. Our economic situation is MASSIVELY different, although I’d argue still weak.\n\n“BUT THERE’S NO SUBPRIME CRISIS”\n\nRight, probably not. However, we still have skyrocketing consumer credit defaults paired with an abysmally low personal savings rate. Additionally, we have something along the lines of $1 trillion CRE loans with balloon payments or adjustable rates kicking in within the next 6 months, on a bunch of loans that are underwater with their respective banks, and many of which have been collateralized into CLOs and sold both domestically and internationally. I still think there will be some blood in the water.\n\nAdditionally, the median house price to median income ratio is HIGHER today than it was at its 2007-2008 absolute peak, so I’d still argue that real estate has been over-speculated.\n\n“THE GOVERNMENT WON’T LET THE MARKET CRASH DURING AN ELECTION YEAR”\n\nProbably not! In fact, there’s a very real scenario where the Fed steps in with hyper-QE if things hit the fan. Congress is scheduled to meet in January 2025 to negotiate the current US debt ceiling, and the US frankly can’t afford a recession right now - they need those tax dollars. Hyperinflation to erode the real value of the US debt and prop up the markets is highly plausible IMO.\n\n“DUMB BER”\n\nDumb bol.\n\n“POSITIONS OR BAN”\n\nI’m short term bullish on bonds. TLT just bounced off its 200 SMA twice and I wouldn’t be surprised to see investors eat up those nice high yields if earnings season goes sour. I have 6 figures on TLT calls expiring post-election, I’m gonna wait on SPX plays until the election is over.\n\n**TLDR: The Fed cut rates on the exact same date (9/18) in 2007 as 2024, and SPX hit an all-time high on the exact same date (10/9) in 2007 as 2024, except it was a massive crash afterwards in 2007.

Yes, the Fed’s 50bps rate cut in September 2024 has driven markets to fresh highs, much like 2007, but the context around these moves is vastly different.\n\nIn the labor market, we're seeing turbulence, particularly in tech, where layoffs have become increasingly frequent. However, we’re not facing the same systemic risks as we did in 2007. Back then, the cracks in the foundation—particularly in housing and credit—were already severe. Today, there are vulnerabilities like consumer credit defaults and shaky commercial real estate, but the tech layoffs are more a reflection of sector-specific restructuring than a signal of an impending financial crisis.\n\nThe housing market, too, looks precarious. Prices are outpacing incomes at a level we didn’t even see in 2007. However, unlike then, we aren’t dealing with a subprime mortgage collapse, even if over-leveraged commercial real estate could pose a similar systemic risk if those balloon payments start to hit.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that monetary policy and the broader economic environment are significantly different. The Fed has more tools at its disposal today, and in an election year, we could very well see aggressive moves to prevent a crash. The specter of quantitative easing looms large. However, if the market does falter, we will rebuild, rehire, and reinvest. The resilience of the U.S. economy has been proven time and again.\n\nWhile consumer sentiment is wary and some are praying for a crash, we are far from a repeat of 2007.

Today, we’ve got rising consumer credit defaults and an overheated real estate market, but there’s no single crisis point like back then. This means the risks we’re dealing with now aren’t quite the same.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about the labor market. Unemployment was higher in 2007, but the gig economy today makes it harder to get a clear picture. A lot of people working part-time aren’t counted as unemployed, which might hide some economic weakness that could show up later.\n\nInflation is another tricky topic. Back in 2007, inflation was already a big deal, while current CPI readings are lower. But that doesn’t mean people aren’t feeling the pinch—it just complicates how we understand the economy.\n\nThe idea that the government will step in and prevent a crash during an election year could lead to some false security. If everyone thinks the Fed will always bail them out, we might end up with bigger issues down the line.\n\nAs for being short-term bullish on bonds, that’s a valid strategy, but it’s risky to assume that shifts in monetary policy won’t shake things up.\n\nIn the end, while it’s tempting to draw parallels between then and now, we should be cautious.
