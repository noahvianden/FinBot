AWS, Amazon's subsidiary in cloud computing, has a massive and increasing need for clean energy as it expands its services into generative AI. It's also a part of Amazon's path to net-zero carbon emissions.\n\nAWS announced it has signed an agreement with Dominion Energy, Virginia's utility company, to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, or SMR, near Dominion's existing North Anna nuclear power station. Nuclear reactors produce no carbon emissions.\n\nAn SMR is an advanced type of nuclear reactor with a smaller footprint that allows it to be built closer to the grid. They also have faster build times than traditional reactors, allowing them to come online sooner.\n\nAmazon is the latest large tech company to buy into nuclear power to fuel the growing demands from data centers. Earlier this week, Google announced it will purchase power from SMR developer Kairos Power. Constellation Energy is restarting Three Mile Island to power Microsoft data centers.\n\n\"We see the need for gigawatts of power in the coming years, and there's not going to be enough wind and solar projects to be able to meet the needs, and so nuclear is a great opportunity,\" said Matthew Garman, CEO of AWS. \"Also, the technology is really advancing to a place with SMRs where there's going to be a new technology that's going to be safe and that's going to be easy to manufacture in a much smaller form.\"\n\nVirginia is home to nearly half of all the data centers in the U.S., with one area in Northern Virginia dubbed Data Center Alley, the bulk of which is in Loudon County. An estimated 70% of the world's internet traffic travels through Data Center Alley each day.\n\nDominion serves roughly 3,500 megawatts from 452 data centers across its service territory in Virginia. About 70% is in Data Center Alley. A single data center typically demands about 30 megawatts or greater, according to Dominion Energy. Bob Blue, its president and CEO, said in a recent quarterly earnings call that the utility now receives individual requests for 60 megawatts to 90 megawatts or greater. Dominion projects that power demand will increase by 85% over the next 15 years. AWS expects the new SMRs to bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region.\n\n\"Small modular nuclear reactors will play a critical role in positioning Virginia as a leading nuclear innovation hub,\" said Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a release. \"Amazon Web Services' commitment to this technology and their partnership with Dominion is a significant step forward to meet the future power needs of a growing Virginia.\"\n\nAWS plans to invest $35 billion by 2040 to establish multiple data center campuses across Virginia, according to an announcement from Youngkin last year.\n\n\"These SMRs will be powering directly into the grid, so they'll go to power everything, part of that is the data centers, but everything that is plugged into the grid will benefit,\" Garman added.\n\nAmazon also announced a new agreement with utility company Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, to fund the development, licensing and construction of four SMRs in Washington State. The reactors will be built, owned and operated by Energy Northwest but will provide energy directly to the grid, which will also help power Amazon operations.\n\nUnder the agreement, Amazon will have the right to purchase electricity from the first four modules. Energy Northwest has the option to build up to eight additional modules. That power would also be available to Amazon and Northwest utilities to power homes and businesses.\n\nThe SMRs will be developed with technology from Maryland-based X-energy, a developer of SMRs and fuel. Along with Amazon's other announcements, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund disclosed it is the lead anchor in a $500 million financing round for X-Energy. The Climate Pledge Fund is its corporate venture capital fund that invests in early-stage sustainability companies. Other investors include Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation, NGP and the University of Michigan.\n\n\"Amazon and X-energy are poised to define the future of advanced nuclear energy in the commercial marketplace,\" said X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell. \"To fully realize the opportunities available through artificial intelligence, we must bring clean, safe, and reliable electrons onto the grid with proven technologies that can scale and grow with demand.\"\n\nLast spring, AWS invested in a nuclear energy project with Talen Energy, signing an agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company's existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a nuclear power station in Salem Township, Pennsylvania. AWS also purchased the adjacent, nuclear-powered data center campus from Talen for $650 million.\n\n", "id": "1g4zenu", "created_utc": 1729085363.0, "score": 1177, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 227, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3A%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Both uncommon at most companies.

It often comes with re-orgs, hiring new talent to fit the new bill, and cutting existing teams that have become irrelevant. I worked in tech, including self driving cars, for 15 years and I've been through all of this. Tesla's failure to foresee \"local maximas\" requiring \"full rewrites\" is a problem unique to Tesla. Keep in mind that Elon Musk is a manufacturing engineer, not a software engineer, and he's definitely enforced his mindset of manufacturing engineering to the software development cycle. Testing to see what breaks is what you do in hardware, so that you can start over and try again on a new part that works better. This isn't how you should work on software though. Software on this scale is supposed to be built upon, not re-written over and over again. You're just setting yourself back for years. Most big tech companies have gone through one, maybe two, major rewrites in all of their history. Tesla did it on an annual basis.\n\nFor a properly run vision-only program, you should look at MobileEye's Supervision and Chauffeur. Even so, MobilEye admits vision only will not likely work for L4+, so they have MobilEye Drive. All are highly structured programs with well defined goals and roadmaps to achieve their goals. Tesla has none of this. Musk fails so hard at even predicting what Tesla is going to accomplish within a year, so how is any multiyear roadmap even feasible for Tesla?

In these crashes, the reduced roadway visibility arose from conditions such as sun glare, fog, or airborne dust. In one of the crashes, the Tesla vehicle fatally struck a pedestrian. One additional crash in these conditions involved a reported injury.

This Preliminary Evaluation is opened to assess:\n\n>The ability of FSD’s engineering controls to detect and respond appropriately to reduced roadway visibility conditions;\n\n>Whether any other similar FSD crashes have occurred in reduced roadway visibility conditions and, if so, the contributing circumstances for those crashes; and\n\n>Any updates or modifcations from Tesla to the FSD system that may affect the performance of FSD in reduced roadway visibility conditions. In particular, this review will assess the timing, purpose, and capabilities of any such updates, as well as Tesla’s assessment of their safety impact.\n\n>SGO Report numbers: 13781-8004, 13781-7181, 13781-7381, 13781-7767.

At $250k a piece you're looking at $175m in capex.\n\nBut what do you think the average salary of the employees at Waymo is? A high-tech, cutting edge industry like autonomous driving... working in LA/SF... what are wee looking at? $200k? $300k?\n\nAt $200k average salary, you're looking at a -$500m in wages alone.\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo announced in January of this year that they had just hit 10million driverless miles and 1m paid trips since inception. \n\nNow if you Google how much Waymo charges customers per mile you'll find various rates.\n\nFor example one article claims that during the busiest times a Waymo can cost up to $14/mile in SF with the average closer to $11 ([article here](https://thelastdriverlicenseholder.com/2024/08/01/costs-of-waymo-rides/)).\n\nAnother source claims a five-mile, 20-minute Waymo ride cost just $11, the same price as an Uber trip to the same location in Phoenix, Arizona. That works out to roughly $2/mile ([source here](https://www.businessinsider.com/waymo#:~:text=Waymo%20ride%20prices%20are%20based,trip%20to%20the%20same%20location)).\n\nSo the price per mile depends on geography and time of day with San Francisco fares at around 5-7x more expensive than Phoenix.\n\nSo let's do some math. Even if we use the most generous assumption of $14/mile travelled and multiply that by 10million customer miles, the revenue generated by Waymo over the course of its entirely lifetime would amount to a measly $140 million. That's not enough to even cover the cost of the cars, not to mention HD mapping, maintenance, and oh yeah... the $500m in employee wages??\n\nSo nevermind debating whether LiDar or cameras is the right approach. Nevermind the fact that their current taxis cost $200k+ per vehicle. Nevermind all of the overhead of HD mapping, map maintenace, car insurance, electricty, office space, warehousing, etc, etc. Nevermind all of that and just look at the cost of their employees and tell me how they scale operations enough to cover just that.\n\nI don't know man. But to me it looks like Waymo needs to at least 5x the amount of Taxis in the field while keeping headcount flatish just to cover the cost of wages and salaries. And remember i'm using the most generous assumption of $14/mile in SF.\n\nIf i were to assume the average revenue/mile was closer to the fare in Phoenix, at lets say $3/mile uh... how are they supposed to turn a profit here?

You can assume acceleration, but that's an assumption.\n\nI'm dubious about this lol. Admittedly though i don't follow Waymo closely but i wonder, has anything really changed about what they're doing over the last \\~7 years?\n\nI mean i think it's publicly known that they are not even close to profitable. And their approach relying heavily on LiDar is burdensome and limited by HD mapping. Their vehicles are also very costly. And while what they're spending right now is peanuts to Alphabet, if they wanted to scale to say 100,000 or 1 million vehicles... that would probably cost too much if the product/service isn't profitable.\n\nFor instance, at $200k per Waymo, it would cost $20B alone to put 100,000 cars in the field. That's $20B just for the cars, nevermind the cost of making and maintaining the HD maps plus all the supporting personnel, the teleoperators that have to intervene, etc.\n\n1m cars would be a $200B capex investment, needless to say... not happening.\n\nBut maybe you don't need that many, i don't know. Based on a quick search i see on Google there are over 1.7million UBER/Lyft drivers in just the USA, in addition to an estimated 280,000 cab drivers.\n\nAnd remember, Waymos aren't cheap. They're actually more expensive than a regular taxi or Uber/Lyft.\n\nSo i just see hurdle after hurdle for Waymo. I don't think their hardware/software is good enough. I don't think it's affordable enough. I don't think they can scale and maintain their current technology. And i don't think they'll be profitable at scale, or at any meaningful scale to Google/Alphabet's bottom line, much less any meaningful scale to take a significant chunk of ridehailing marketshare.\n\nIt begs the question then, what exactly are they doing?? Yes, they're expanding into Texas, great... but they're just subsidizing that growth at a net loss, which is fine as long as it's small enough that it doesn't significantly impact Alphabet's earnings.\n\nSo the way i see it, this is a kind of pet project for Google. Google doesn't mind footing the bill as long as its small. The potential payoff is huge if they make some breakthroughs, and the risk is small. That said the likelihood of success is probably very very low, failure very high.\n\nStill they're growing and moving into another city or two. But does anyoen really believe we're going to see some massive nationwide rollout from Waymo anytime soon? Doubt it. They'll move into Austin and Atlanta and probably wont expand for another 3-5 years, if at all.\n\nFor all we know Alphabet might be planning to spin-off/IPO Waymo and their plan is to expand so they can show investors that they are able to \"grow\" and make it more appealing? Maybe they realize that their project is doomed and can't be successful at scale so why not spend a little more, pretend like it can scale, try and convince investors it will eventually be profitbale if they can further reduces COGS or something, and sell it off and recover some of their investment?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Forgot about that critical pre-scanning HD maps step.

{"title": "Get in on Uranium Now", "selftext": "**Since 2020, the price of uranium has gone from $21/lb to a high of $106/lb in Feb 2024. The price has experienced a slight pull back since then to $83/lb. I believe this 4-5x change in the price of uranium to be small compared to what lies ahead, and I will explain the reasons why in this paper.** \n\n**What is Uranium?**\n\nUranium is an abundant, radioactive metal naturally occurring in earth's crust. The vast purpose of it today is used for creating nuclear fuel to provide energy. It is one of the cleanest burning fuels and very easy on the environment. Think of Uranium as a gas pump, there are different options you can choose between based on grade. We will focus on the two main isotopes for Uranium. When it is mined, approximately 99.3% is uranium-238 and 0.7% is uranium-235.\n\nU-238 is a critical component of plutonium production which in itself gives a TON of demand. The major application of Uranium in the military sector is depleted Uranium (DU). DU is mostly U-238 after U-235 has been removed. It is used to create armor piercing rounds and military projectiles. The high density of DU makes weapons highly effective. There are other important uses of U-238, such as counterbalancing aircraft, though we are not focusing on those.\n\nU-235 is even more important because for the most part, this is what fuels nuclear reactors. In order to power a nuclear reactor, the concentration of U-235 needs to be 3-5% instead of 0.7%. The higher concentration makes it fissionable, meaning it can power light-water reactors which are the most common reactor design in the USA (United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission). One kilogram (2.2 LBS) of U-235 produces as much energy as 3,306,930 pounds of coal.\n\n**HALEU**\n\nHigh-assay low-enriched uranium. A crucial material needed to deploy advanced nuclear reactors. Currently, HALEU is not commercially available from US based suppliers. Boosting domestic supply could spur the development of advanced reactors in the US (Energy.gov). In November, the DOE reached a key milestone under its HALEU demonstration project, when a company produced the nation’s first 20 kilograms of HALEU. Thus, providing a first of its kind production in the United States in more than 70 years. Amid growing efforts to secure a reliable domestic nuclear fuel supply, the DOE has awarded contracts to six companies as part of an $800 million initiative to bolster the deconversion of high-assay low-enriched uranium (Roan, 2024).\n\nThe existing fleet of US reactors run on enriched uranium up to 5% with U-235. However, most advanced reactors require HALEU which is enriched between 5% to 20% in order to achieve smaller and more versatile designs with the highest standards of safety, security and nonproliferation. HALEU also allows developers to optimize their systems for longer life cores, increased efficiencies, and better fuel utilization. Together, the US, Canada, France, Japan and the UK have announced collective plans to mobilize $4.2 billion in government-led spending to develop safe and secure nuclear energy supply chains (Energy.gov). \n\nAs we now know, enriched uranium is crucial. Although, the enrichment process is very costly. Russia is the biggest player in the enrichment process. They are responsible for roughly 44% of the world’s enrichment capacity and supply approximately 35% of imported nuclear fuel to the US. As of August 12th, 2024, Uranium imports into the USA from Russia are outlawed. This allows $2.7 billion in funding to build out the U.S uranium industry specifically, to increase production of LEU and HALEU. The DOE estimates that US utilities have roughly 3 years of LEU available through existing inventory or pre-existing contracts. To ensure no plants are disrupted, a waiver process is in order to allow some imports of LEU from Russia to continue for a limited time. “In the meantime, we’re taking aggressive steps to establish a secure and reliable uranium supply market” (Energy.gov). \n\n**Uranium Supply**\n\nNow, the supply that was once held of uranium is running out. “The inventory overhang that was so damaging to the market for almost a decade has been largely consumed, and going forward, we’re going to have an increasing reliance on primary supply” (World Nuclear News). Idled mines are now starting production again, as well as increases in mines under development, and planned mines. “There is no doubt that sufficient uranium resources exist to meet future needs, but producers have been waiting for the market to rebalance before starting to invest in new capacity and bring idled capacity back into operation. This is now happening (World Nuclear News).\n\nThe uranium market has been facing a supply deficit for years due to underinvestment. The problem is that uranium mines take a long time and require a ton of capital to get up and running. A mine can take 10-15 years to begin production AFTER they are opened. \n\nAs with other minerals, investment in geological exploration generally results in increased known resources. Over 2005 and 2006, exploration efforts resulted in the world’s known uranium resources increasing by 15% (World Nuclear Association). Therefore, there is no need to anticipate any uranium shortage.The world’s current measured resources of uranium will last about 90 years. This represents a higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. There is nearly limitless supply because most of it has not been discovered due to little investment in mining and exploration. To be clear, although we know this uranium exists, that does not mean it has been mined. \n\nPrimary Supply - This type of supply refers to uranium extracted directly from mining.The primary supply has been under heavy pressure in recent years due to low uranium prices. Low prices lead to reduced mining operations. This is because mining is incredibly expensive and companies won’t do it if there is no good price incentive at which they could sell the uranium. It is forecasted that uranium mining will not meet the reactor demands for at least 15 years. Now, it is also estimated that by 2035, primary uranium production will decrease by 30% due to resource depletion and mine closures. New mines will only be able to compensate for the capacity of the exhausted mines.\n\nSecondary Supply - This refers to all uranium that is not sourced directly from mining but from other inventories and recycled materials. This includes, civil stockpiles, military stockpiles, recycled uranium and enrichment tails. Civil stockpiles (uranium reserves held by utilities, hedge funds, and government) grew immensely after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Many reactors shut down due to the worries surrounding uranium, and investment in the nuclear sector decreased. Due to this, there was a large oversupply of uranium. Since then, these stockpiles have been largely drawn upon to meet reactor demand, instead of relying on primary supply. So, utilities have been relying on their inventory to fuel their reactors, instead of getting fresh uranium from mines. This has caused a gradual depletion of their reserves. There is no mathematical way to rely on reserves anymore. The ONLY option is to produce uranium in order to keep reactors operational, while meeting future demand.\n\n**Uranium Demand** \n\nThe United States, China, and France represent around 58% of global uranium demand. Uranium demand can be characterized as a predictable function of the number of operating nuclear power plants, their capacity factors and fuel burn up levels. As of April 30th, 2024, there are 94 operating nuclear reactors in the United States. The global count of operating nuclear reactors is 440. These account for 9% of the world's electricity. Currently, there are 60 nuclear reactors in production across 16 countries spanning into 2030. About 90 more reactors have been planned and over 300 have been proposed. \n\nLooking ten years ahead, the uranium market is expected to grow. The 2023 World Nuclear Association’s Nuclear Fuel Report shows a 28% increase in uranium demand over 2023-2030. This same report predicts a 51% increase in uranium demand for the decade 2031-2040. Global demand for electricity may rise 165% by 2050 while at the same time, 101 countries have committed to net-zero carbon emission goals and are actively pursuing a shift to clean energy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld8y5xf7u4vd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cd6d742feca0b2df30d583972a4ed949e064941\n\n**Global Price of Uranium Last 25 Years (USD/Lbs)**\n\n**Uranium Production**\n\nThe main producers of uranium are Kazakhstan, Canada, Namibia, Australia, and Uzbekistan. Kazakhstan is the major producer. In 2022, they produced 43% of the world’s uranium. The company Kazatomprom is responsible for the massive production within the country. Very big news came out recently stating they have slashed their production target for 2025 by 17%. This is due to project delays and sulfuric acid shortages (a critical component of uranium extraction). They are expected to produce 25,000-26,500 tonnes of yellowcake (a concentrated form of uranium ore produced during the early stage of processing).This move is likely to continue the upward pressure on uranium prices. This slash in production is occurring while Kazatomprom has their lowest reported uranium inventory levels since 1997 of 4,142 tonnes of uranium, down 31% from the previous year (Dempsey, 2024). “This is a structural problem. It won’t just be the west saying this is an issue for us; it will also be Russia and China saying it’s a problem for our new nuclear power plants” (Nick Lawson, CEO of Ocean Wall). \n\nUranium prices have been low for decades due to oversupply and stockpiles. This has made it less appealing to develop new mines and instead, rely on existing mines and supply. However, the US and other countries are showing increased signs of uranium mining at an alarming rate. In the first quarter of 2024, the United States produced more than 82,000 LBS of uranium which is more than the entire 2023 production. In Q2 of  2024, production increased to 97,709 LBS, an 18% increase from Q1 2024. While this increased production is significant for a domestic supply, it does not begin to put a dent in the global deficit. It simply goes to show the US is beginning their own production of uranium. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0i0y5ta8u4vd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fea4c5c8d96e63e0991cbee91763b86ffdd1d513\n\n**United States Uranium Production 2000-2024 Q2 lbs**\n\nIn a recent interview with Justin Huhn, a uranium market expert, he stated, “YTD there has been 54 million pounds contracted. Demand pulled back temporarily and when that happened, price kept rising. It's a hugely important indicator that when demand comes back in, which it is starting to, the prices are going higher. We're starting to see early signs of that. Honestly, I think we are on the cusp of a very large movement in the coming weeks. We're going to see a competitive environment for limited supply. That's what is coming next. The ceiling in the contracts tells you where the price is going. The 3 and 5 year forward tells you where the spot is going. Every piece of evidence in the physical market is telling us that prices are going higher.\"\n\n\"Companies need uranium and they aren't going to not buy it at price xyz. Now, could we get to a point where logically the price of uranium utility does not justify continued operations? That's possible. And unless we have a balanced market, that might be the limiting upside factor. Price would have to be somewhere in the $700s for the average utility to not afford to buy uranium in order to operate their facilities.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tryxvqs8u4vd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d232e82dee2be8fcd1a85af980584987b2bcb4d\n\n**World Uranium Production vs Reactor Requirements, 1945-2022 tU**\n\n# Conclusion \n\nAlthough we’ve seen drastic changes in the price of uranium already, I believe the bull market is just beginning. There is immense demand, and production simply can’t meet the requirements. Prospective mines can take 10-15 years to become operational, while 30% of current mines are estimated to be depleted by 2035. There is not enough time available for the uranium supply to meet the demand despite increases in production. Companies are willing and obligated to secure nuclear fuel at almost any price. Increased investment into nuclear energy is happening from a governmental side and big tech. Amazon, Microsoft and Google have all come out with news recently, investing insane amounts into nuclear. Countries are uniting in the fight against climate change to establish a global supply of clean, zero-carbon energy. Therefore, I believe that as the supply continues to dwindle and demand continues to increase, the fight for uranium that will ensue is going to send the price to levels we have never before seen in history. \n\n**Investment Ideas**\n\nI think mining companies are best set up to gain from this market. A high uranium price means they earn higher revenues by selling it. This also allows them to further develop mines and explore new areas, increasing overall production. We are in a seller dominated market where prices are based on bidding wars between utilities, governments, and hedge funds. These mining companies are Cameco (CCJ) currently trading at $50.86 and NexGen Energy (NXE) trading at $7.26. I also like the mining ETF Range Nuclear Renaissance Index (NUKZ) trading at $38.31 and Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM) trading at $48.26. The other companies I like in this sector are Clean Harbors, Inc. trading at $257.48 and Constellation Energy (CEG) trading at $265.86. Clean Harbors has a dominant position in the market for the handling and disposal of nuclear waste. They also have very good management. I’d say they are my favorite pick out of the entire sector. Aware that this is WSB, YOLO calls on URNM is the play. This is a chance to create generational wealth.\n\n**Disclaimer** \n\n**This is not financial advice.**\n\nEdit - These companies are trading higher now.

The report suggests that this increase is only the beginning, with further growth expected.\n\n**Uranium Overview:** Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive metal, primarily used for nuclear energy. The key isotopes are U-238 (used in military applications) and U-235 (used to fuel nuclear reactors). U-235 is particularly efficient, with one kilogram producing energy equivalent to over 3 million pounds of coal.\n\n**HALEU and Enrichment:** High-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) is critical for advanced nuclear reactors. The U.S. is investing in domestic HALEU production to reduce reliance on imports, especially from Russia, which controls a significant portion of global enrichment capacity. The U.S. has started producing HALEU domestically, supported by government initiatives.\n\n**Supply Challenges:** Uranium supply is tightening due to depleted inventories and underinvestment in mining. Mines are expensive and slow to develop, often taking 10-15 years to become operational. The market is shifting to rely more on primary mining as secondary supplies dwindle. Primary production is forecasted to decrease by 30% by 2035, highlighting a potential supply gap.\n\n**Demand Growth:** The U.S., China, and France account for 58% of global uranium demand. As of 2024, there are 440 operating reactors worldwide, with many more planned. The World Nuclear Association predicts a 28% increase in demand from 2023-2030 and a 51% rise from 2031-2040, driven by global clean energy goals.\n\n**Global Production:** Kazakhstan is the leading producer, supplying 43% of global uranium. However, production cuts due to delays and shortages could put further pressure on prices. The U.S. has also increased its domestic uranium production in 2024, signaling a shift toward self-reliance.\n\n**Investment Insights:** The report suggests that mining companies are well-positioned to benefit from rising uranium prices. Companies like Cameco, NexGen Energy, and ETFs such as URNM and NUKZ are highlighted as investment opportunities. Big tech companies like Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy, emphasizing the growing interest in this sector.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report anticipates a bullish market for uranium due to increasing demand and limited supply. With countries seeking clean energy and reducing carbon emissions, uranium's role as a key energy source is set to grow, potentially driving prices to unprecedented levels.\n\n**Investment Disclaimer:** The recommendations are not financial advice.", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "PUT YOUR HANDS UP mardie007!!!

The problem with the latter method is because there are independent contractors paid by their rate of work, a lot of them exploit the system and rush their work, providing lousy training to the model.\n\nAI is not as smart as it seems.
