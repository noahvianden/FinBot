Lower material costs, an expanding energy business and sales of regulatory credits to automakers that need help complying with emissions limits also contributed to Tesla’s best quarterly earnings in more than a year.\n\n> Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk offered an upbeat outlook for 2025, citing the rollout of more affordable models that Tesla has yet to identify. “Something like 20% to 30% growth next year is my best guess,” he said on a webcast.\n\n> Tesla’s shares jumped 22% Thursday in New York, the biggest gain since May 2013. That helped add tens of billions of dollars to Musk’s net worth and sent the stock into positive territory for the year, erasing a slump in the weeks since the CEO unveiled self-driving taxi and van prototypes.", "id": "1gbcged", "created_utc": 1729801533.0, "score": 208, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "How much of this has to do with the sales of regulatory credits?", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "739MM regulatory credits contributing to a 2,167MM net income.

Companies are free to trade credits, so those automakers who don't produce hybrids or EVs must pay other automakers with excess credits to avoid the penalty.

But they are not suited for data center needs. \n\nThe location that we were at for example, as I said was a 10MW farm....you know how much space it takes up? 55 acers. Do you know how much a typical data center/hyperscaler requires? 50..70...100MW plus. The math doesnt math. 100MW is literally a small single cycle gas turbine.

Did you read what I said? I'm not sure if you know how forecasting works. Do you think demand is somehow a known factor more than 5 years out and generation is not?

We want more green, as much green as we can get. Tax credits are good. But the IRA is, irrelevant to this discussion.

{"title": "Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection", "selftext": "Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.\n\nThe company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.\n\n“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.\n\nTesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.\n\nAutomakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.\n\nTesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”\n\nCEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.\n\nEven bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.\n\nIt “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.\n\nA grain of salt\n\nMusk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nBernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”\n\nMusk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. \n\nThe Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”\n\nThey pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.\n\nThe share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/24/tesla-shares-surge-as-analysts-react-to-q3-earnings-musk-predictions.html", "id": "1gbcgse", "created_utc": 1729801558.0, "score": 552, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 387, "comments": [{"body": "If you bought this stock in October 2021, you would have just broken even 3 years later. 😂", "score": 376, "replies": [{"body": "I bought on 21 July 23 - still down 6%", "score": 111, "replies": []}, {"body": "My little sister dumped 50k into Tesla 2019, I hate her even more now.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "That's what brainwash gets you.\n\nIt's a stock.

I personally think current models are near saturated (as evidenced by need for so many current incentives), maybe a little more with cybertruck as that ramps. I think the higher volume will come from the cheaper model that will supposedly will start next year.\n\nSo cheaper model, non-foundation CT, energy growth, continued progress on FSD (but still far from the golden goose).

So my expected range is $144-$240 with current EPS.\n\nHow does this work into my personal strategy of not losing money? When we're at the higher range, I keep my delta lower and subsequently lower range I get my delta higher. So for example, now we're at the upper end of my price range, I'll keep a delta of 10-20% of my shares. I'll only participate 10-20% of the ups and downs from here. If it gets closer to the middle of the range, I'll move my target delta to 50%. Bottom of the range, 100%. I'll also let options positioning and momentum influence those targets a bit.\n\nWhat this does is allows me to always participate to upsides while minimizing any potential downsides when things are 'expensive' for me. Then allow bigger potential exposure when things are on the 'cheaper' side. All the while keeping a constant theta decay for cash flow. This definitely doesn't work for everyone since I'm perfectly happy with capped 10-20% gains every year as long as I avoid any significant drawdowns.\n\nI'd be curious to see what other people think about current earnings and hopeful growth for the future.

Basically how much the option moves if the underlying moves by $1. If you're fully exposed or 100%, $1 share price move means $1 move in the underlying. TSLA goes up $30, you go up $30 for every share. But this also means if TSLA goes down $30, you go down $30.\n\nSince I want less exposure to the ups and downs as we get higher, every $1 TSLA moves I only move $0.20.
