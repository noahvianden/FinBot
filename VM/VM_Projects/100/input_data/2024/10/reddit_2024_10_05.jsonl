If we do a little crude extrapolation from user numbers based on twitter user numbers and market cap, Reddit market cap would be hovering around 8 billion with its current user number. I bought around then and I still find good reasons to buy into it now even when overvalued cuz I will be holding for the long term (+5 years).\n\nFor a social media website it dominates the forum sphere and I doubt we will see anyone compete against it. Many have tried and failed miserably (looking at last year api Reddit revolution). + Management has set up measures to never have these kind of risks occur again (limiting mod powers...).\n\nFrom a complete non bias user perspective (mobile user since 2016) Reddit has definitely improved despite what most Redditors are saying. Video loading is good among other things, much less lag overall. The user experience has improved tremendously. And you can see it clearly once Reddit decided to target mobile users. The reaction from Reddit users is the same as YouTube when it went through its ad friendly phase. Old users hated it, but in the grand scheme of things, their opinions was meaningless (they still use the website)\n\nRedditors hate the CEO. But objectively speaking he has done more to \"improve\" the platform in the few years vs the entirety of Reddit without him. \n\nFurthermore, Reddit finds itself in a perfect timing situation, twitter is stagnating and Reddit and Twitter users share a large userbase with Reddit being in the ramp up phase. 99% of Reddit and Twitter users are lurkers, and content on twitter is not great when it's dependant on famous figures for content. While I don't think Reddit will ever replace twitter, it definitely has advantages over it / completes it. \n\nThe demographic for twitter is largely conservative and Reddit is largely liberal. That's an entire demographic that is not targetted by twitter. That's by the nature of Reddit being more community oriented with upvote downvote vs twitter focusing on the individual. But Reddit can find ways to have more individualism. I can imagine Reddit having verified users who can post on a different tab that people would love to follow (especially since it's current follow system is garbage. Why do they make following a two step process when it could be done in one? Why prioritise blocking or chatting over following when clicking on a user's avatar??).\n\nReddit also has the advantage that the content it generates is unique when compared to other platforms. It has its fair share of unique posts, but also has the unique attribute that it can parasite content from other platforms. Think of subreddit like r/twitter for example.\n\nReddit also has a richer relationship with content in general. For e.g,  Reddit has a strong opportunity to fortify it's sports/gaming forums. If you look at any sports related content you will find user engagement like no other.\n\nI also believe that monetization will be easier on Reddit compared to the likes of twitter which pretty much never saw profits. Monetization is easier by the nature of subreddits. Despite its current lackluster ad targeting, they are trying to find ways to improve. They acquired AI ad targetting tech recently. + Its much easier to learn from the mistakes of other companies. \n\nSpeaking of AI, Reddit is a gold mine for data. Since Reddit is not part of any other larger conglomerate, the likes of Google/Microsoft will be able to buy the data the user generates. Reddit is an unrestricted supplier of training data. It's already happening with open AI buying data to train chatgpt.\n\nThe mathematical analysis for reddit user growth is based on a logistic curve. If we compare any user growth of social medias. The growth, assuming no population ceiling, is around 25-30% (based on twitter and Facebook trend). Aka you can expect the current user growth of any social medias in its early stage to move at that rate yearly. I assumed Reddit will have a max logged-in users population cap around 500-600 million (based on twitter user growth trend assuming no user drop from poor management aka twitter).\n\nIt's hard to price Reddit based on earnings since we have very low data and typically companies like these consistently lose money until they don't. But people never cared about twitter earnings and it still went up in price.\n\nAt worst the current price of Reddit won't move much for the 1-2 years. But I definitely have the minimal expectation that Reddit will 3x if you give it more than 7 years.  And that's a better return than the average of the S&P. So it's good enough for me.\n\nWill Reddit ever have a larger userbase than tiktok/shorts/instagram? Never. People who use Reddit need to be literate and have a better attention span. But Reddit is still pretty addictive with the infinite scroll brainrot.\n\nConclusion: Reddit may be overvalued now but it doesn't matter if you hold it long term. You may not see much return in the next year at its current price but you sure as hell would have wished you bought some shares 7 year from now.

You buy puts in lots of 100 so if a particular put is say $5 then you'd spend $500 for 1 put. The stock doesn't necessarily have to be at or below the strike price for you to make profit. Let's say a stock is at $100 and you buy a put today for $5 for one month out at a strike price of $75 and tomorrow the stock plumets to $85. Even though the put isn't at or below the strike price yet the value of the Put should go up, so now your $5 Put is worth say $7. At that point you can sell there and take profit or continue to hold if you think the stock will plumet further.\n\nIf the stock just stays at $85 your put will decay in value each day. You also have the option to exercise the option if it is \"in the money\" which means you'd go short 100 shares - but that's a story for another day.\n\nThen there's selling calls and selling puts which entails more risk.

{"title": "Robotaxis will not be a trillion dollar business", "selftext": "I fail to see the trillions business that Musk and all the analysts parroting for robotaxis.  It’s a stupid idea built on fantasies.  Here’s my argument:\n\n1. Every single Tesla owner I know won’t lend out their cars. The lending out is the stupidest idea ever.  Every car owner I know won't lend out their car either.  Tesla will have to run their own fleet which will increase costs, maintenance etc.\n2. Percentage of people willing to take a robotaxi daily are low; like Uber.  At best; it’s will be an Uber like service with limited use cases:  Traveling, airports, designated drivers etc.\n3. Costs are astronomical when you add up all your small daily trips.  Two kids household in the US suburbs with limited public transportation.  I take approximately 8-10 roundtrips a day, sometimes more on the weekends.\n\nFor example: $7 per trip according to Musk: commute(2), kids school(2), kids activities(2-4), leisure or Starbucks or McDonald’s or family visits(2). $60-80 per day= $1500+ per month and that’s assuming every trip is $7.  Why not just own a car at    that price?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add the emotional, pride and freedom of owning a car.  US consumers love their cars and trucks more so than guns.  A lot of people will die rather than give up their cars.\n\nEdit: All the pro responses are parroting the same spiel that Musk, Woods and analysts are spewing.  No examples, no numbers, no market.  It's \"Believe me, it will happen\".  Same as the metaverse, Vision Pro, 3D printing, 3D TV which were all touted as the next big thing but ended being a limited market.\n\nTheir car and energy businesses will be fine but the trillions robotaxi business has always been a fantasy.

That’s level -3 autonomous driving, not level 5.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Why do companies franchise?  Why does Uber use independent contractors?\n\nTo answer your first question, to begin with, that's what Elon Musk has literally said several times. You will buy the car from them and they will take a cut managing it for you when it's being used as a taxi.\n\nBut, to further explain why that's a better business model in the eyes of Wall Street, Tesla gets to sell a vehicle and book immediate profits (and it apparently won't be an existing Model 3/Y like previously discussed so new cars will have to be purchased).\n\nYet when (if) it rolls out Tesla still retains a big chunk of the taxi profits because those cars will only be able to connect to their app (unlike an Uber driver who could switch to the Lyft or a delivery app).\n\nMeanwhile Tesla maintains none of the costs or liabilities associated with building and owning a fleet of cars that need to be insured, maintained, cleaned, etc for a business model that's still in its infancy.\n\nAll the while Tesla can turn insurance, cleaning, etc into profit centers that would otherwise be expenses if it's their own fleet.\n\nAt any point in time in the future, if the model shows success and they're leaving money on the table they can always raise the percentage of what they keep without changing a thing (ala Uber) or begin to build their own fleet in their most profitable markets first while always leaving unprofitable routes to the poor saps who bought the car thinking they'd get rich from it.\n\nLastly, if the model proves to be a bust as a whole or in select markets, Tesla still recorded the sale of the cars and is really just out the cost of developing the app.\n\nBut let's be honest.  Wall Street loves short-term profits and good stories.\n\nFor years Tesla benefited from insane growth.  Now they're sitting on huge new factories and selling less cars than a year ago and the cars they are selling aren't as profitable because they've cut their margins.  Their only new product in years (CyberTruck) has sales closer to S and X's than 3 and Y's.  Opening up their charging network to companies like GM is a smart long-term move but short term there's not a lot of meat there because it's just not that many drivers yet.\n\nSo Tesla desperately needs a good story to distract large investors and if there's a business model Wall Street understands and loves it's the old sell a razor and book profits today and then sell razor blades and book profits tomorrow model.  The days of simply distracting retail investors with robot maids or jumping on whatever is trendy (AI) is over.\n\nOf course their challenge is the only cars to make it past Level 2 autonomy, other than things like Waymo taxis, are the Mercedes S class and EQS and I think maybe the BMW 7 series. They're Level 3 autonomy.  Basically Tesla fucked around and let the world catch up and now surpass their technology.\n\nSo long-term pay attention to how much R&D they're spending in comparison to competitors because right now they're literally telling you the future of their company is on a feature they're trailing other car companies in.\n\nYet also, this is currently a meme stock; Real life means nothing.  But there are plenty of large Wall Street investors that are getting nervous that there aren't enough retail investors to keep the stock rising and they're afraid of getting stuck holding the bag of it starts to sink.  That's why they're starting to ask the same business questions they would of other car companies.

Ridiculous.\n\nOnce true self driving is attained, automobile manufacturers will no longer be incentivized to sell cars to consumers. Why? Because the value of owning capital (ie cars) for the business of transporting people will skyrocket. Why sell a car I built for a one time price when I can put that car on the road for my own company's taxi/rental service for ongoing profit? \n\nSecond, economies of scale and labor are going to seriously drive down the price of rides. It's going to become infinitely more affordable to use a monthly subscription AI taxi/rental service than to buy your own vehicle. The more it becomes a cultural norm to have cars built into the public transit model (imagine a monthly transit pass for your city includes an Ai car share service for last mile delivery), the more car ownership becomes a unnecessary luxury, like owning your own moving van. \n\nThird, government regulation is going to reduce the appeal of personal ownership significantly. The transition to AI driving is necessarily a universal one. The safest roads will be those that *only* allow AI drivers, and the systems safety improves universally: by which I mean, there won't be good and bad AI drivers, they will all get better together. Human drivers will quickly become an outsized risk on shared roads, and there simply won't be a good reason for governments to allow them. Much like they don't make tanks street legal even if they let you own one. \n\nThe notion of personal ownership of vehicles is a long standing one, culturally, established will before cars (we owned our own horses, buggies, coaches, etc). It's definitely a new phenomenon that will take getting used to, which is why people have a hard time letting go of basic premises like continued personal ownership.

When the cost per mile is driven down to near zero from economies of scale, isn't that going to seriously dampen profits for auto manufacturers? Yes, recurring subscription revenues are better then one time payments, but that's only assuming the subscription revenues are good. If the ride-hailing cost per mile is driven to lets say 5 cents per mile, thats only $5K for 100K miles, and certainly not all of that is going to be profit.
