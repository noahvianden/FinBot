I think we'll see a pullback due to the market being overextended along several parameters. Then we'll have the typical post-election November and December surge, and investors should stay bullish until mid-2025. Besides having some downside protection, no one should overreact: election volatility is normal.\n\nLong-term I'm bearish on the major indices because valuations are too bloated (Bank of America arrived at the same conclusion on 19 of their 20 metrics). That won't influence anything regarding my *current* portfolio as valuations have no predictive timing before 3 years; however, they are like gravity and will dictate returns over the long-term. Beyond that, the relevant indicators in the credit market are not flashing red and it always front runs a potential crash/recession. Although access to credit for small private businesses is terrible, SLOOS is not showing the same case for large companies.\n\n> It personally feels like you are trying really hard grasping at straws trying to spin this as weak when it isn't.\n\nHardly, I know how to read data and look past the headlines.

This is the largest jump in September on record.\n* The unadjusted September change in private payrolls was -458k, seasonally adjusted +133k.\n\nWhen ~86% of all seasonally adjusted job growth is created by local and federal government, that don't imply a strong economy. All of this is easily verifiable in the [A-8 section for Household](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t08.htm) and [B-1 for Establishment](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm).", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Is it possible valuations are not as high as you think?\n\nIf Fed achieves its long-term target FFR of 2.75%, stocks are actually incredibly cheap using Buffett's DCF model.\n\nIf short-term earnings forecasts are reasonably correct, valuations are pretty much in line with history.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "> Is it possible valuations are not as high as you think?\n\nPossibly, but I highly doubt it.

Valuations are crucial to estimating future gains, not because of raw price but due to time. \n\nThe problem with most bears is they don't understand how to read the market or prepare downside protection. They assume the worst and run around like Chicken Little. There are reliable indicators that presage a market crash, which most investors don't look at, and they are not flashing right now. So I'm not worried.\n\n> I am referring to 12 month forward earnings.\n\n12-month forward earnings are risibly overstated. I've addressed this topic extensively several times by breaking down the components of earning growth that accord with Bloomberg analysts' projections, and the head of investment at Wells Fargo has echoed my criticism. \n\nIn short, analyst assumptions regarding disinflation and sales growth mean profit margin growth must increase from 1.7% (the 25-year average) to 6.5%. This will justify the 15% earnings growth that's expected next year and the 8.6% afterwards. There is no catalyst justifying this assertion. Additionally, they are projecting EBIT margins to rise to 18% and plateau when the historical average since 2001 has been 13%. This is based on misreading *why* EBIT margins reached 18% in 2022.\n\n> You said you are both tactically bearish to EOM and long-term bearish.

This is at least the fifth time you've gotten into an argument with me under an alternate account - you're incapable of hiding your tells - and it's quite tiring to hear the same insults when you're using said models in a naive fashion. \n\nBluntly, your usage of the discount rate is backwards. I'm not sure how you managed to do this as I assume you know how the discount rate works. If you apply a 3.7% discount rate or any discount rate higher than the baseline to a DCF model, you get a reduced valuation. Lower discount rates raise equity valuations. Your baseline discount rate for the top equation is 0%. \n\nYour conclusion only make sense if you were finding the delineation point where a stock with 1% growth in cash flow and 0% terminal growth would justify a 3.7% discount rate at ~$44 over 10 years. That is, its growth would have to be 5%. Or you were highlighting the impact of a 3.7% discount rate to the base case and comparing that to its complete removal.\n\nLet's go a little deeper.\n\nSince you dislike WACC for legitimate reasons, then the cost of equity should be your discount rate: after all, we are talking about holding equity stock, not holding debt or preferred shares. That would be the 10-year Treasury yield + (beta x equity risk premium). \n\n* Historically the 10-year has stayed rangebound between 4.25-4.75% when the FFR was at 2.50-3%. The FFR dictates SOFR and short-term rates, but it has very limited power over long-term rates.\n* We'll assume beta is equal to the S&P i.e. 1.\n\nTherefore, the discount rate would be 4.50 + (1 x (5-4.5)) = 5. \n\nAlternatively, let's be generous and assume you meant 2.75% - the difference between the peak FFR and the FFR target. The two problems are that the 10-year Treasury yield is the basis of the risk-free rate for your DCF model (and the baseline for deviation is not zero), plus the 10-year yield does not move proportionally with the FFR.\n\n> A company with as little as 5% growth and 0% terminal growth will be worth 41x today's cashflows. That number skyrockets if you allow for more growth (likely for many tech names) and instead of 0% growth you allow for at least inflation growth of 2% or so.\n\nNo, that applies to a *0% discount rate*. The lower the risk-free rate, the lower the discount rate - and the higher the valuation.\n\n> I'm sorry. If you do not understand that tail risk is less, chances are you do not understand how the modern Fed works at a basic operational level, or all the myriad of changes both the financial system and more importantly Fed have undergone in just the last few years.\n\nThe possibility of economic catastrophe has been lessened at the expense of making the system more fragile and more dependent on intervention and creating new tail risks. I'm sorry but if you don't understand that, you don't understand complex systems theory and emergent behavior. In fact, we've already seen this play out over the last 4 years. \n\nAdditionally, I find it hilarious that you'd come to that false conclusion considering I'm the only person on this entire subreddit that talks about the Fed's inner mechanisms at length. Also, I'm the only one who explains how money markets actually operate. \n\n> Because he's no longer trying to significantly outperform. He's made it clear he's catering to a group of investors who want stability and steady appreciation with a lot less risk than the typical stock. Besides, he's not selling off the vast majority of his holdings.\n\nThat's not true. He's talked about this very issue at several conferences.\n\nBerkshire's entire problem is that it's so large, the number of companies it can invest in without outright ownership or destroying price discovery is tiny. The companies Buffett used to buy wouldn't give Berkshire enough capital appreciation to register in their quarterly reports, not even if they tripled or quadrupled. He is stuck with choosing from large companies instead of the ones that made him famous.\n\nThis is a similar problem with most large hedge funds, and a big underlying reason why they often fail to outperform the market. They are pressured to prove they can contribute more alpha to clients versus putting money in SPY or QQQ, but they have limits on how types of companies they can invest in. So they end up taking undue risk, chasing momentum, or secretly indexing while subtracting management fees from alpha.  \n\n> Fair, we seem to agree on that. What is your base case for EOY 2025?

Working on removing free public parking spaces for vehicles and installing bike parking. \n\n\n All of the above and any other information I'm forgetting has heavily increased travel times and congestion for people driving traditional vehicles (traffic was already bad in NY before this, but this just made it several times worse), which New York is using to implement \"Congestion Pricing\" a toll/tax on gas vehicle traffic that ranges from $7 to $15 per use of the roads in the areas covered by the \"Congestion Pricing zone\" (ebikes and buses are obviously exempt from this and there is a hearing regarding it on 10/15).  \n\n\nAll of that isn't even including the activists (who have been protesting, blocking traffic lanes, publically shaming tradional drivers etc.), support from other companies (for example Con Edison which is offering to install free ebike charging stations in underserved communities etc.). \n\n\nThen when you look at the company themselves they have since inception (in 2017 I believe) expanded to around 40ish retail stores (mostly in New York, but also acrossed many other densely populated cities with an influx of migrants, most of which are cities that are following New Yorks lead, just at a slower pace, funded by the federal government).  \n\n\n Notably, Philadelphia is expected to have a lot of illegal immigrants and are currently seeing expansion in their delivery services. FLYE is already there and is established in the delivery community, as they took feedback from delivery workers in NY and changed their bikes to meet the delivery workers needs this whole time (another ebike company that has seen growth in NY has seen that Philadelphia is going through the same and just within the last month or so have expanded to take advantage of this as well).  \n\n\nThe company is already on the stock exchange ahead of popular brands like Trek and Surron, i have to look a little deeper but pretty sure FLYE as a company is performing better than Harley Davidsons emotorcycle brand (Live Wire), has better earnings, profitability, and less debt than other publicly traded ebike companies etc.  \n\n\n They've expanded to include a delivery service of their own, they are completing their apps, and offering a rent-to-own program that will be less expensive ($6.60/day) than paying the \"Congestion Toll\" that will likely be implemented in NYC and California (which they're also located in) in the very near future.  I could probably go on, but this is already an entire book. ", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I will say TSLA.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "IonQ", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Sold too early", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Given that the wide marketization of the technology is decades away, I’ll say.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "AXON.

The next week $260C I've been watching and commented on the increased volume yesterday decreased open interest to 31,085 from 77,476. Just means much less support from MM holding shares to hedge for that particular position. They previously held like 3M shares for it, now like 870k. As IV decreases, time passes without TSLA going back up, they just keep selling the shares to not hedge for these anymore. \n\nIt's on the remaining call holders to hold and hope for robotaxi event to provide narrative and spike for the voting machine to take effect again to the upside. There's still good support to the downside with Nov and Dec $225C at 27,130 and 43,268 respectively.\n\nIf not, then it's on the weighing machine and how much that'll impact the voting machine for earnings. If that deep dive estimate is close, our TTM EPS goes to $2.18 or a current P/E of 111 for a company shrinking earnings, at best stagnating until energy catches up or FSD/robotaxi works.\n\nThe way options are looking, robotaxi needs to absolutely blow it out of the water to provide hype and narrative for it to contribute to the top and bottom line soonish. Upside is challenging unless more calls start piling in again. \n\nAfter the robotaxi event and IV crush associated with that, current earnings or growth (lack of earnings growth specifically) absolutely do not justify the current price. IV will probably stay highish for earnings then really crush after that. Downside has support at $225 after that and I'm watching those Nov/Dev $225C open interest. If those disappear or voting machine pushes down hard below that, then the window to $170-200 opens up.\n\nI'm personally fully hedged to downside to not lose money. I do still have some small upside exposure along with continuous theta decay as well. It's always fluid and I'll go super long once TSLA valuations and growth makes sense to me again.

Those in more rural areas, poor people and those in states with less social safety net can all struggle to obtain government ID. Getting a driver's licence for example is not a given when people turn 16 anymore as other forms of transportation as well as telecommuting become more common. Gen Z and many millennials have opted out of driving due to the enormous costs of owning a vehicle. Furthermore, traditionally marginalized groups (ie. immigrants and minorities) in society were vastly underrepresented in elections due to not having government issued ID. It seems like such a simple solution to people who are part of the majority or who have always had government issued ID. But for these groups, it's just not normalized yet due to the hurdles and burdens that were present to obtain ID (costs, geography, etc.)\n\nOverall, I think the long-term solution is to make government issued ID easier to obtain overall for all groups.

Employment practices are based off of identification so they have to base hiring for the construction of these fat facilities based off of how people identify themselves so if you say yeah I'm a guy nope I'm a girl nope those quotas are filled we need others.. it also has to be 51% women workers building last time I've been to job sites I don't see 51% women swinging a hammer putting in rivets and iron worker. \nSo this Fab facility that's courtesy of the taxpayer money cuz the government's betting on winning and losers we know how that always turns out just look at solyndra with Obama and every other company that he put billions of dollars in as kickbacks and payoffs to his friends oh yeah I'll save you the trouble they all went to zero their bankrupt.. so these fat facilities best case scenario are not going to be up and running until 2029. Wall Street doesn't wait around 4 years number one number two they're not going to get it done by 2029 because nothing is ever done on time it always takes longer so you're probably talking Midway 29 or 2030 before they're up and running and starting to generate dollar one in revenue that's a long time from today. \nTheir balance of their business the chip business they missed the boat they went the wrong direction they zigged when they should have zagged. \nIf I owned Intel and I don't think God I would be selling cover calls against it every week a dollar or so higher than the current price to try to generate a return on the investment. \nIf I wanted to buy and tell and I don't I would be selling puts a dollar or so below the current market and collecting the premium for a very short period weekly basis at the stock falls and closes below that strike you get put the stock you on it but you collected the premium and then I'd start selling calls against it the following week. \nI think this approach of selling calls is going to generate a far greater return then the oscillations and gyrations of the stock relative to broader market conditions within the sector", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
