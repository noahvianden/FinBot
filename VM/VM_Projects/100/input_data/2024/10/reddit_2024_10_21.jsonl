While I have nothing but respect for Vanguard and Mr. Buckley, since that prediction the nominal price return on the S&P 500 has been over 100% (inflation-adjusted it's 58%). \n\nThis translates into an 11% annualized return (inflation-adjusted it's 7%).\n\nSo, more than 6 years in, Mr. Buckley is wrong. And interestingly, Vanguard's current 10-year estimate is about the same--i.e., they expect about 4.2% for the next decade through 2034.\n\nBut turning back to Goldman's 10-year estimate of 3%, the thing they said that was most interesting is that ‚Äú[t]he current high level of *equity valuations* is a key reason our 10-year forward return forecast sits at the lower end of the historical distribution.‚Äù \n\nThey specifically point to the outperformance of the ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù in the S&P 500.\n\nSo let's discuss equity valuations, but my key point is going to be that objective measures of equity valuation have changed more than you might think, and there are reasons.\n\nThe average S&P p/e ratio of the last 60 years (1964 - 2024) is about 19, but that's deceptive.\n\nLook deeper and you'l see that the average p/e ratio of the S&P 500 over the last 30 years (1994 - 2024) was 25 whereas the average p/e from the *previous* 30-year period (1964 to 1993) was a lowly 14.\n\nLet that sink in, four-fucking-teen. Can you imagine?  \n\nThis is not your parent‚Äôs stock market; this is not the market experienced by Peter Lynch and other old-school market luminaries.\n\nSo what's going on here? Why did multiples expand so much in the last 30 years?\n\nThe answer is technology, which has historically outperformed and traded at higher multiples. \n\n60 years ago technology made up a tiny fraction of the S&P 500 market capitalization. Even 30 years ago it was *less* than 10%.\n\nToday, the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks make up more than 30% of the S&P 500‚Äôs market capitalization and all are \"tech stocks‚Äù [Personally, I hesitate to call Tesla a tech stock, but whatever.]  That‚Äôs triple the weighting from 30 years ago and much higher than it was even during the peak of the dot-com era when it was about 20%.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs those 7 stocks that have driven more than 90% of recent stock market gains.\n\nBut what about the other 493 stocks?\n\nThe p/e ratio of the \"bottom 493‚Äù S&P 500 stocks is currently . . . wait for it . . . 19. \n\nIn other words, the \"bottom 493\" are consistent with the S&P 500's average 60-year p/e ratio and below the average of the S&P 500 p/e ratio over the last 30 years. In addition, analysts are currently predicting 15% earnings growth for the entire S&P 500 in 2025, putting the S&P 500's overall 12-month forward p/e at 22.\n\nI'd also argue that multiples have expanded in the last 30 years because our sense of valuation has changed from 1964 versus 1994. After all, valuation is mostly a subjective application of recency bias. Recent p/e ratios serve as valuation anchors, informing entire markets of what is currently ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù So a p/e ratio of 25, which is the average S&P 500 p/e ratio from the last 30 years, is ‚Äúnormal\" because that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs been for *three decades.*\n\nGoldman and others do not discuss these kinds of changes. As best as I can tell, they look back as far as they can and apply the logic that we will \"revert to the mean.\" \n\nThe last 30 years, however, says otherwise.\n\nAll this said, I don't know how anyone can predict 10-year returns with a straight face.\n\nI personally expect single-digit returns, but that's about as far as I am willing to go.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I really enjoyed this post!

{"title": "I wait all year for this opportunity - now I'm going to share it with you. ", "selftext": "If you trade long enough, you begin to see patterns emerge. On October 30th, one of my favorite patterns is starting. If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2tzzcmjy0wd1.jpg?width=1942&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f0f907afeaf646562e6d6e20b0ab4099f9c38c6\n\nSome of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.)\n\nIn my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time.\n\nA quick word of warning‚Äîthis time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hd4mviffy0wd1.jpg?width=1930&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa8987a1dab26da66ba129a56fd4b0e5122154c5\n\nHere is a quick comparison \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36id0g9my0wd1.jpg?width=646&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d57997661eaf54f6e39d4f64aabc3fb8593827f2\n\nI do all this shit manually so I apologize if there is an error in one of my calculations. \n\nMy positions: Long 1000 shares with a cost basis of $157.90.

According to Bloomberg survey statistics, analysts expect NVIDIA shares to rise to $ 148.37 in the next 12 months, including a number of highly bullish analysts on NVIDIA, for example:\n\nOn Friday, Bank of America raised its Nvidia price target from $165 to $190. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, among others, said buying Nvidia is a ‚Äúonce-in-a-generation opportunity.‚Äù\nLast week, investment research firm CFRA raised its price target on NVIDIA from $139 to $160.\nIn the view of Bank of America analysts, the overall AI market demand is growing strongly, in addition to this is also worth noting that NVIDIA's strong performance in the field of enterprise AI, such as partnerships with Microsoft and Accenture and other companies, Bank of America to raise its target price of the other factor, NVIDIA is the preferred partner for enterprise AI hardware and software.\n\nWedbush analyst and NVIDIA majority owner Dan Ives expressed a similar sentiment in a report sent to investors on Sunday. He claimed that enterprise spending is growing in giant waves as AI adoption scenarios explode, and NVIDIA is leading the way.\n\nIves predicts that the AI infrastructure market will grow tenfold between now and 2027, with companies investing $1 trillion in AI capital expenditures during that time. ‚ÄúIn short, we think tech stocks are poised for another 20% rally in 2025, and this tech bull market driven by the AI revolution is just entering its next phase. We believe that the Fed and Powell have initiated an aggressive rate-cutting cycle, that a soft macroeconomic landing is still the way forward, and that tech spending on AI is a crossover spending wave that is just getting off the ground in the tech sector.‚Äù", "id": "1g90siv", "created_utc": 1729544665.0, "score": 762, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 month ago\n**Total Comments** | 5 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I hate thoughts and posts like this, because I was committed to taking profits at $150, but now I feel even more greedy.....perhaps $160?", "score": 228, "replies": [{"body": "I took profit at 850, and now I kinda wish I didn't, but no matter what it does I got my principal + back from the sale.", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "yeah, I had a secondary batch I got around $750 when many on WSB were saying \"good luck bagholders, way over valued, bubble, yadda, yadda\".
