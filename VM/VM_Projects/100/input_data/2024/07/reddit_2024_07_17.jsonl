It can do things like take a research paper and generate a short summary or a slide deck for a briefing in a couple minutes. It is also useful for identifying images quickly, including facial recognition and shape recognition.

From another Redditor:\n\n\n\n\"There hasn't been a major basin discovery since the turn of the century. Most of the major basins in the world were discovered around 100 years ago. This includes Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The oil that get discovered these days is the equivalent of a few days, weeks, or maybe a month worth of world supply. Despite the best technology we've ever had they don't discover any more major oil basins. The oil is running out. It's a finite supply. The technology advancements ensure that the oil will run out even faster due to the efficiency of extraction (like sucking through a straw with twice the power your drink will run out quicker). \n\nIt's a highly debatable topic and the interview that OP linked is the only \"evidence\" I've ever seen that oil is abiotic and infinite. While I tend to agree that oil didn't come from dinosaurs (if there even were any), I don't agree that oil is infinite. On the other side of the argument you have wall street investors who have done extensive research and reporting on the current state of oil in the world and they've concluded that we are indeed reaching Hubbert's Peak right now. There's a link below to their blog, but their newsletter had a 50 page report about peak oil recently.\n\nThis is reason for the depopulation agenda brought about by the COVID vaccines. Population growth can only occur at such an exponential pace as we've seen the past few hundred years with oil production. Without energy, population will decrease as oil is needed for the massive farming undertaking to feed the world. Now that oil is going to be running out, the powers that be recognize this and are trying to kill off what they consider to be the useless eaters. This is the soft landing. They want to gradually decrease the population to match the decrease in oil supply. And this effects economics as well. For thousands of years interest rates declined all the way to the unprecedented and frankly insane interest rate of 0% and bottomed out. Now interest rates are on the rise and will continue forever. This means the end of cheap money and debt expansion. The stock market is going to go down forever. The population is going to go down forever. Consumer consumption is going to go down. This is deflationary. No amount of money printing can change the trend of the macro forces of declining energy and population. \n\nhttps://blog.gorozen.com/blog/hubberts-peak-is-finally-here\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "‚ÄúDepopulation agenda brought about by the Covid vaccines‚Äù\n\nSure mate.

What does America get out of this deal. That's why he see relationships with countries as transactional rather than building relationships based on common interests and foes. He doesn't understand why funding NATO is important. Why supporting Taiwan is important.

{"title": "Why your port is getting nuked today", "selftext": "Aight I know this isn't an educational sub, and I'm CERTAINLY not an educator, but tons of folks are asking why everything is falling harder than a 737 Max today. Given that the market forces influencing today's drop are less nebulous and more intuitive than usual, I figured I'd explain what I'm seeing. Bear in mind that I have no actual qualifications, most of this just comes secondhand from people smarter than me. \n\n\n\nThere are two large scale things at work today that are getting the bulls gunned down in the streets; one is an overall force that's just inherent to how the market moves, and one is more specific to the current outlook and recent news.\n\n\n\n**TLDR: Monthly options expire on Friday, and options on VIX (the volatility index) expire today. These lead to increased market volatility, multiplying every potential market shift. Couped with some pessimistic news for semiconductors and big tech last night and this morning, we were put at high risk of a big drop across the board.**\n\n\n\n\n\n1) The Overarching Market Mechanic: \n\n\n\nThere are two important expiry dates this week. First, Friday is OPEX, when monthly options expire. This happens on the third Friday of every month, and creates volatility as big money tries to influence the market in the direction that benefits them. Naturally, this volatility is most felt by the tickers that have the highest volumes of options expiring that month. Currently that's big tech, MAG7 and semiconductor centric stocks in particular.\n\n\n\nThe other date is today, when VIX options expire. This happens on the third Wednesday of every month, which means it's usually (but not always) two days before OPEX. VIX is a measure of volatility in the market as a whole, rising when the market is fluctuating more and falling when it's consistent. In the same way that stocks get more volatile when options on them are close to expiry, volatility itself gets more volatile when VIX options are close to expiry. So volatility is changing at a faster rate.\n\n\n\nBoth of these add up to make this week more prone to big swings in market prices overall. Without this extra volatility, the market is more likely to continue on its trend and pace (consistently bullish of late). These dates instead make reversals and spikes/dives more likely, but they're not inherently bearish.\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Specific Developments:\n\n\n\nThere have been a few developments since yesterday's close that increased bearish sentiment. First, current presidential betting favorite Donnie T seemed to commit to not defending Taiwan against potential Chinese aggression during his RNC speech last night. This is bearish for Taiwan-based companies and those dependent on them, which most significantly includes the leading semiconductor manufacturer TSM and the tech companies dependent on it, NVDA most of all. We can see that Intel is doing particularly well, up over 1% during today's bloodbath, because they're one of TSM's largest competitors and aren't dependent on Taiwan.\n\n\n\nSecond, ASML (a Dutch semiconductor manufacturer) released disappointing earnings this morning. They technically beat EPS expectations, but were down since last quarter and had only lukewarm future guidance. This is a big step down from the recent expectation of continued exponential growth for semis and AI-related stocks, and decreases optimism for other companies in the same field. Which, once again, is big tech.\n\n\n\nThird, news came out this morning that President Biden is considering increasing restrictions on chip sales to China in order to slow their growth in their own semiconductor market. Restrictions on sales are obviously perceived poorly for growth, so this is once again bearish for chip makers and those dependent on their success. TSM, NVDA, and Big Tech in the crosshairs again.\n\n\n\nAll of this combines into bearish news for semiconductor companies specifically, and Big Tech by extension. Since Big Tech makes up a huge portion of the market, it drags down everything. We can see this in SPY, 34% tech, failing almost twice as much as something like IWM, only 15% tech.\n\n  \n\n\nIn a quick summary: a few pieces of pretty bad news for semiconductor and tech since yesterday's close increased bearish sentiment across the board. Since we're in a period of higher volatility due to options expiry in the entire market and on the volatility index, this bearish news had a much larger impact than it normally would. Volatility will probably cool off next week after the VIX options expiry and monthly OPEX, TBD on whether we get some upwards push in the tech market movers.", "id": "1e5pr79", "created_utc": 1721241486.0, "score": 497, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 422 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 7 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Youre overthinking.

Unless SPY drops another ~1% or more this week, assume that we‚Äôll be back in the bull market soon enough and buy long/mid term calls at Friday‚Äôs close. Otherwise, all bets are off as we might be recession-ing\n\nFun advice: wait until 7 am and fire a 0 DTE put/call in the direction we‚Äôve moved since close, slightly further than whatever you‚Äôd assume for a 0 DTE. Higher volatility means moves will be bigger. So if market sensibility stayed bearish overnight, we could fall a lot. If it flipped back to the bulls, we could rocket. If you don‚Äôt know, just buy a strangle since we‚Äôre probably moving a lot intraday\n\n\n(Keep in mind I‚Äôm not crazy experienced at this, so don‚Äôt blame me if you lose more money)", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "this guy trades...", "score": -1, "replies": []}, {"body": "What a jerkoff post \n\nLet‚Äôs see your YTD returns, bro", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}
