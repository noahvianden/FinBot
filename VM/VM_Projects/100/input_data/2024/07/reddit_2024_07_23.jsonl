Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown at a rapid speed under Rappaport, who had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May. A person familiar with the company’s thinking cited both antitrust and investor concerns as part of the motivation behind the decision to walk away.\n\nWiz’s cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response — a range that has appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft which also sells security software.\n\nCNBC reported in July on the talks between Google and Wiz.\n\nThe company reportedly hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue after 18 months, and achieved $350 million in annual recurring revenue in 2023.

What is objectively true is that Groupon's customer demographics consisted mainly of bargain hunters, leading to a lack of upselling and returning customers for businesses. While Google might have found value in acquiring Groupon, perhaps not $6 billion worth, it illustrates that people have both underpaid and overpaid for things in life. Google hasn’t always made perfect acquisitions, but that’s beside the point—Wiz is actually good.\n\n>On a similar note, I was in my teens when all of this was happening but I vividly remember how everyone thought FB’s $1b purchase of Instagram was throwing money away.\n\nThis isn't quite a similar note. I also remember the skepticism around Facebook’s purchase of Instagram. However, the success of Instagram wasn’t guaranteed from the start. Facebook invested heavily to make it successful. Look at Snapchat: they turned down Facebook’s offer, only to see Facebook copy their features and integrate them into Instagram and Facebook, leading to Snapchat's decline. If Facebook hadn't bought Instagram, they likely would have copied its features as well. This is why smaller companies sell to bigger ones—the big players find it more convenient and often cheaper to acquire than to build from scratch.\n\nThat said, integrated suites and features, as seen with Instagram, Office, and Adobe, provide significant value. Users often prefer the convenience of integrated services. Even a platform like Groupon might have thrived under Google through integration with Google Maps and Google Reviews, potentially stealing market share from Yelp.\n\nAll in all, I think we're deviating from the real topic at hand which is Wiz", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate your reply it’s very interesting and educational.

I am currently visiting my long distance girlfriend and I'm staying at her family's house. For a lads day out I went mountain biking with her dad and brother, it was my first time (probably last time as well) doing it.\n\nLong story short, we went quite far uphill and chose a moderately hard track to go down from. Brother went first, I went second, and the father went last so that he could watch me if I made any mistakes for my first time. While going down I heard a sound of someone hitting the ground, but he was a bit behind me and I hadn't heard a scream so assumed it was OK, although at a resting point I told the brother and we decided to wait 20 seconds and if he didn't come we'd go uphill to go looking for him.\n\nHe wouldn't respond to shouting, and the brother went running up the hill and I realized something wasn't right. Once I shouted and didn't hear anything back from the brother I jogged up hill as fast as I could and my girlfriend's father had hit his head and was lying there unconscious with quite a damaged bike and helmet.\n\nThe brother has some emotional problems, so I basically had to manage him through the situation in manners in which I don't want to go into details to much, but we were very lucky because there was a lady who came down the hill next who was a GP and also a mountain biking instructor. He might've choked on his tongue if she wasn't there because we did not know how to move him on his side without potentially causing further injury.\n\nHe got heli'd off about after an hour of having to communicate with the family and tending to the stressed out brother, while giving details to paramedics and police. Both the family and paramedics thought he was going to die because of the insanely long time he had been unconscious and the severity (GCS 3). Miraculously, he has no visible brain damage on the CT scan and has \"only\" broken a few ribs. \n\nNow we're just managing the emotions, and sadly had to cancel a trip to London which I was looking out to.

All currently operating robotaxi networks are locked to specific cities though.

Sure, sometimes it can drive 99% of the trip, but do not confuse “FSD can drive 99% from point A to B” with “FSD is 99% solved”. \n\nThat’s not how it works. \n\nEven bad, dangerous drivers who shouldn’t even be on the road can drive 100% from point A to point B most of the time. Even if they only have one accident in 100 days of driving to work, that means they can drive 100% of the way to work 99% of the time. \n\nFSD being able to drive 99% of the way to work (let’s call it one disengagement) would result in 100 accidents (or incidents) in 100 days. \n\nAnd these are just arbitrary numbers. We can say it’s 90% there, or 95%, or 99% or whatever…. but from a training perspective, FSD may not even be at 20%. \n\nThe current capabilities are all low hanging fruit. They are normal stop and go conditions with endless samples to feed the algorithm. This may only account for 50% of all cases with the other 50% being the countless edge cases. Again, these are such arbitrary numbers, estimates are useless. \n\nBut FSD can’t even drive in reverse to get itself out of a situation, like a narrow alley with a parked truck or closed road with construction. And every disengagement represents an edge case that it doesn’t have enough data, or compute, or vision, to solve. It can’t even figure out the speed bumps on my street. \n\nSo, what appears to be that last 1%, could be 10X the compute and 100X the training data to solve. It’s like getting a rocket into space. It’s not the speed and distance that’s exponential, it’s the amount of energy required to push it that last 1% that’s exponential. \n\nAnd we haven’t even talked about the regulatory hurdles  and political resistance to wiping out millions of jobs.

{"title": "CRWD is going to die.", "selftext": "Im sure you all saw that video of the microsoft dev telling us why the bug happened. If you havent, Crowdstrike is a virus/malware security company that packaged their program as a \"driver\", so they have access to the kernel. On top of that its a bootable driver, so it loads as soon as you turn on the computer. I cant speak for all drivers, but at least in the case of NVDA driver updates to graphics cards, they have to go through Microsoft testing, which is done by Microsoft to determine it is functional and doesnt cause any issues before providing a certificate to let that driver be published. \n\nAs for Crowdstrike, being the incredibly fast and up to the minute protection, they dont have time to do a certificate test to get an approval from microsoft, so they change 1 text file, and push it to all of the machines using their driver. Well on friday, we all saw that driver failed to boot due to an error in the text file. I believe it was a file full of 0's?\n\nBlame the EU for allowing Kernel access in the first place, as they didnt want MSFT to have a monopoly on a virus protector. \n\nWhat could very well happen in the long term is Crowdstrike will get their kernel access removed, or be required to update their certificate every time they have an update. **Getting their kernel access removed, would make the an average run of the mill virus scanner, and if they are required to update their certificate every time, they would then be behind the ball in terms of protection as a threat would potentially have days/weeks to infiltrate before Crowdstrike gets to update.** \n\nIn the short term, I also believe customers will break their contracts and move to competitors. Lawsuits will also happen for all the loss of business, as negligence isnt covered under insurance. \n\nPUTS!!! If youre buying calls, or stock, youre nutty. \n\n  \nTL;DR Crowdstrike is fked.

If I were an engineer there, I would just spin up 1000 different host machines, windows/linux/mac with different hardware configs and run some automated tests on them as full on integration tests. This would give me a lot of confidence in what is being released. As you can imagine, spinning up 1000 virtual machines and keeping them updated with recent hardware configs isn’t cheap. But it can be done. This won’t guarantee a bug free release, but atleast you could be more sure about the hosts booting up if nothing else.\n\nRemember degenerates, when it comes to tech, it’s not about what is possible, it’s about how much money and time you are ready to throw at the problem.

{"title": "Why I'm playing TSLA puts today", "selftext": "Guys, we have an insane earnings week and I just wanted to put in my two cents for TSLA today. \n\nHere’s what they're expecting:\n\n* Earnings per share: 62 cents expected\n\n* Revenue: $24.77 billion expected\n\nJust for comparison:  A year ago, Tesla reported 91 cents of EPS and sales of $24.9 billion. First and formost, I'm getting a put spread. Not puts. IV is just way too high for just puts. Spreads reduce the IV and focuses more on the underlying. But why puts? The stock actually PUMPED hard last earnings. Well, let me explain. \n\nLower sales volume and vehicle prices are behind the expected decline. Tesla delivered about 444,000 vehicles in the second quarter at an average realized price of $42,500. A year ago, the company shipped about 466,000 vehicles at an average price of about $44,000.\n\nThere's really no indicators telling me that they're doing better as a constant decline in sales will probably continue well into 2025. Just look at the headlines. Musk's cybertruck is a complete failure. The tesla semi is a dud. The tesla roaster isn't out and will never be out. And his other projects? Hyperloop, solar panel shingles? All busts. \n\nYea I'm expecting a >10% drop today. TSLA 7/26 240p is just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so this is why I'm getting the spread. Buying the 240p while selling the 225p (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 477 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if TSLA drops as much as I expect today, this spread should profit over 3x.

This includes companies involved in software, hardware, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies.\n\n>Energy storage companies, on the other hand, have gained increasing attention and valuation in recent years due to the growing importance of renewable energy and the need for efficient energy storage solutions. These companies play a crucial role in enabling the adoption of renewable energy sources like solar and wind by providing means to store excess energy for use during times of high demand or when renewable sources are not generating electricity.\n\n>Valuations in both sectors can fluctuate based on market conditions, technological advancements, regulatory changes, and other factors. In recent years, some energy storage companies have seen significant increases in valuation as renewable energy adoption accelerates and governments implement policies favoring clean energy solutions.\n\n>Ultimately, whether one sector is valued more highly than the other at any given time depends on the specific companies involved, market dynamics, and investor perceptions of future growth potential.
