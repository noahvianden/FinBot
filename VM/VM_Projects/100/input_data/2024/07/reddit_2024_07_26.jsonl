Here is what we know. There was a HARD rejection at 107. Meaning, that is a major buy signal for several players. In fact I was waiting for that drop to go to 7% and the recovery was so fast at about 6.8% that I never had the chance. So, there is that. \n\nFor me a settlement at 104.75 or below can mean a 90 - 97 multiple week objective. Most people with the technicals don't mix in the sentiment. Here's my take. Microsoft should improve on AI return in a major way. The key factor here is throughput. Microsoft said on the previous call that there is more demand than supply i.e. and I know this for a fact there isn't enough throughput to deliver to people so that they will pay for it. \n\nWith 4o there is throughput now and that can scale enterprise use cases by a factor of 4x's. So you know I am not talking out of my ass let me explain. \n\nGPT 4 use cases and product development had a token limit of 20k. Now, the ads will say 30+ k but realistically it was about 20k. With newer models of gpt 4 that is now \\~80k. So when we will telling partners we couldn't scale the product with more users now we can. \n\n4o only amplifies that further. \n\nPoint is, Microsoft should, in this quarter, post an impressive AI return result that is much more than 7%. I would hope it is 10% plus if not a 15% increase. \n\nThis not only bodes well for Microsoft but puts a serious dent in the argument that AI doesn't do anything or doesn't earn revenues.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "exactly.

Private equity often load a company up with debt and/or other obligations and rely on public investors to essentially pay them off.\n\nAnother major issue is things like \"unicorns\", namely companies with an idea (eg Cameo) valued as a private company at an absurd values so when these unicorns go public the valuations are completely absurd.\n\nMind you, a major problem at the moment is, for whatever reason, many companies have become detached from reality with respect to valuation. Tesla is the obvious example of this but there are many companies with no reasonable prospects for growth trading as growth companies. It is downright scary in tech which is what I followed.\n\nNonetheless, some IPOs end up being good investments. Generally speaking you need to be extremely well-informed with respect to the company and industry to know the differences.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your insight.

I think solving (at least to a first approximation) protein structure was pretty useful. When I was at McGill (admittedly long ago) a single protein was half a career. \n\nPeople are very good at certain types of pattern recognition (images, for example) but bad at other types, like data driven pattern recognition, especially if it is multidimensional. \n\nOne example, I think, is a cheap second opinion for radiology or pathology. Never a first opinion (because AI is a black box), but I think it will be routine in the future. I am surprised I haven't seen AI applied to network security more (i.e. why is Sally in accounting accessing our source files?). I don't think AI will replace doctors for several reasons, not the least of which being patients often lie to doctors or misrepresent issues and/or symptoms. A good doctor can often see stuff before the patient even knows it: my wife hurt her knee, we ended up going to see my doctor, he took a look at her and said \"you are anemic\", dealt with the knee, ordered a blood test, next thing you know she was being treated for an ulcer. How is an AI going to do that?\n\nMy sons are in software, both have worked for one or more FANG companies and one still does. They use AI regularly for things like compliance for style standards, finding appropriate libraries, etc.. (Or at least that is how I understand it as they keep their proprietary very proprietary). A friend of mine's son, who is a former short order cook, uses AI to design web pages for a living. There are applications out there, just pretty low profile. In 1996, when the web was in it infancy, it would have been hard to predict many of the applications we take for granted today. AI is an enabler for solutions, not an end for itself. \n\nAnd example of the bullshit is when you read about an AI passing the bar exam or something. Like, no shit, exams are a proxy to test if humans have learned a subject, they are not real life.\n\nFunny story, one of the last conferences I was at there was a key note speaker going on about how, in 5 years, AI would make doctors \"toast\". Somebody next to me asked me what I thought, as a (then) well know tech analyst). I replied \"It is not clear to me the guy knows nothing about AI, nothing about medicine, or perhaps both.\" Anyhow this was 6 years ago and doctors are not toast but the guy is still making the same speech. \n\nI don't mind the conversation (it is nice not to be called names).

The fact that most people don‚Äôt see that proves the Wall Street thesis that Alpha comes from arbitraging the difference between what Main Street thinks should be, versus that which actually is. And most of the time, what Main Street thinks is based on feelings, not facts. Feelings have an odd way of distorting reality. We see it in politics, in celebrity, influencers use it to drive growth (Mr. Beast for example has mastered the art of manipulating/playing into people‚Äôs feelings and is now very wealthy as a result). In a world of democratized investing, now more than ever we are seeing retail move markets based on feelings ‚Äî e.g. GameStop (so yes, sometimes feelings win, but it‚Äôs the exception). Generally that delta, between what ‚Äúshould‚Äù be versus what is‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how Wall Street generates alpha and ‚Äúbeats‚Äù beta. Remove your feelings toward Elon. Look at the company objectively. Look at the robotics. The design patents. The engineering patents. The charging networks. The solar technology. Past execution. Operational efficiency https://www.bocconitrading.net/post/tesla-s-operational-efficiency-analysis, etc‚Ä¶\n\nYou need to look at the micro and macro. Objectively folks.

If you have an Optimus with baby-AGI, it's by necessity going to be running local models, and the evidence we have thus far (AKA the history of computing) is that once models reach that scale, everyone has them running on their desktops/phones anyway & such technology is quite reproducible by many companies (conversely, such 'amazing technology' wouldn't be viable if it needed massive datacenter support, as then it couldn't scale).\n\n2. And if multiple companies are reproducing this technology, Tesla by then could trivially spin up its own subsidiary, which competes with Musk's side-hustle, for far cheaper. Alternatively, if baby-AGI hits consumer-device scale, Tesla should just buy one of the 100 companies seriously pursuing it at that point, most likely for less than 5 billion of today's money.\n\n**xAI is a nonviable business:**\n\n1. xAI is not an industry leader. If Tesla does acquire a company in the space, there should be basic due diligence to ensure the company's finances are used efficiently, and there is seemingly no evidence here.\n\n2. xAI would be a drain on Tesla's finances w/ no clear horizon to profitability. Who's going to keep pumping money into it for the next decade? How is that a positive for Tesla, which has predominantly benefitted by externalizing the cost of R&D onto the rest of the industry & focusing on efficient production?\n\n3. xAI has no real monetization / B2B angle to scale.

Tesla's energy division showed significant growth, particularly in the \"unsatisfied performance obligations\" (UPO) metric.\n\n2. UPO represents future revenue from current deployments that Tesla will recognize later, potentially at very high margins (estimated 90% gross margin).\n\n3. The UPO balance grew from $197 million in Q1 2023 to $5.7 billion in Q2 2024, with $2.5 billion expected to be recognized within 12 months.\n\n4. The analysts created a model projecting Tesla's energy division performance, estimating:\n   - Energy gross margins increasing from about 25% to potentially 40% by 2026-2027.\n   - Earnings per share (EPS) contribution from energy could reach $1.10 in 2025, $1.45 in 2026, and $1.90 in 2027.\n\n5. They believe these projections could be conservative, as Elon Musk suggested production capacity might triple rather than double with new factories.\n\n6. The analysts argue that most Wall Street analysts are undervaluing Tesla's energy division, potentially by 5 years or more.\n\n7. They expect the next 2-3 quarters to be crucial in validating their hypothesis about the high-margin nature of the UPO revenue.\n\n8. If their projections are correct, Tesla's energy division alone could justify $68 of Tesla's current share price.\n\n9.

If an energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\n\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December¬†31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $1.60¬†billion and $863¬†million, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms.

Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n1. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) training loop uses a combination of H100 GPUs and AI4 chips (previously called HW4).\n\n2. The patent describes two main components:\n   - Network Service: Possibly corresponding to H100 GPUs, processes real-world and simulated data.\n   - Simulation System: Potentially aligned with AI4 chips, creates virtual environments for testing.\n\n3. Advanced environment generation techniques are used, including bird's-eye view projections, identification of road users, and a lane connectivity network.\n\n4. The system integrates real-world data from Tesla's vehicle fleet with simulated data.\n\n5. A continuous improvement loop is implemented, constantly refining autonomous driving capabilities through data collection, simulation, analysis, and model updates.\n\n6. The patent aligns with Tesla's announced use of H100 GPUs and AI4 chips in a 2:1 ratio for FSD training.\n\n7. This approach combines vast real-world data with sophisticated simulation techniques, potentially leading to significant advancements in autonomous vehicle capabilities and safety.\n\nThe post suggests that this patent provides insight into Tesla's innovative strategy for developing and improving its autonomous driving technology.\n\n+-+-\nidiot me: \"Explain this really simply to me. I thought hw4 was inference compute only? Not training?\"\n+-+-\n\n\nYou're right to be confused, as this represents a change in how Tesla is using its hardware. Let me break it down more simply:\n\n1. Originally, HW4 (now called AI4) was indeed designed for inference - running the AI models in Tesla cars.\n\n2. However, according to Elon Musk's recent statement, Tesla is now also using these AI4 chips for training, alongside their traditional GPU-based training setup.\n\n3. The new setup looks like this:\n   - About 90,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs for most of the training\n   - About 45,000 AI4 chips also being used in the training process\n\n4. This is unexpected and innovative because Tesla is essentially using the same type of chip that's in their cars to help train the AI models.\n\n5. The patent described in the post might explain how Tesla is doing this - by using the AI4 chips to run simulations that help train the overall system.\n\nSo in simple terms, Tesla has found a way to use their car computers (AI4) not just for running the AI in cars, but also to help create and improve the AI in the first place. This is a novel approach that could give Tesla an advantage in developing self-driving technology.\n\n+-+-\nidiot me: \"\nThese hw4 chips are running in a data centre right, not in the cars?\"\n+-+-\n\nYou're absolutely correct, and I apologize for not making that clearer. Let me clarify:\n\n1. The AI4 (formerly HW4) chips being used for training are indeed in data centers, not in cars.\n\n2. Tesla is using about 45,000 of these AI4 chips in their data centers, alongside about 90,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs.\n\n3. This is separate from the AI4 chips that are installed in Tesla vehicles for running the AI models (inference).\n\n4. The innovation here is that Tesla is using the same chip design in their data centers that they use in their cars, but for a different purpose (training instead of inference).\n\n5. This approach could potentially allow Tesla to better optimize their AI models for the specific hardware that will run them in the cars.\n\nSo to sum up: The AI4 chips used for training are in data centers. The ones in cars are still used for inference only. Tesla is essentially using their car computer design in both places, but for different purposes.\n\nThank you for asking for this clarification. It's an important distinction that I should have made clearer initially.\n\n+-+-\nidiot me: \"They probably have lots of extra hw4 chips laying around bc the car sales have been below expectations? What is your hypothesis? Be creative and give several ideas.\"\n+-+-\n\nYou raise an interesting point. Tesla's decision to use AI4 (HW4) chips in their data centers could indeed be related to their car sales and chip inventory. Let's explore some creative hypotheses:\n\n1. Inventory optimization:\nAs you suggested, Tesla might have excess AI4 chips due to slower car sales. Rather than let them sit idle, they're putting them to use in their data centers. This could be a clever way to utilize resources and maintain cash flow.\n\n2. Cost-effective scaling:\nTesla may have secured favorable pricing or production capacity for AI4 chips. Using them in data centers could be more cost-effective than purchasing additional specialized data center GPUs.\n\n3. Hardware-software co-optimization:\nBy using the same chips in both cars and training, Tesla can fine-tune their AI models to run optimally on this specific hardware, potentially improving performance and efficiency in their vehicles.\n\n4. Rapid prototyping:\nHaving the same hardware in data centers and cars might allow Tesla to test new AI features more quickly, as they can be developed and validated on identical hardware before deployment to vehicles.\n\n5. Unique simulation capabilities:\nThe AI4 chips might offer specific capabilities that are valuable for running certain types of simulations, complementing the H100 GPUs in ways we don't fully understand yet.\n\n6. Future-proofing:\nTesla could be preparing for a future where they might want to do more edge computing or distributed AI training using their vehicle fleet. Using the same chips now helps build towards that capability.\n\n7. Supply chain resilience:\nBy creating additional demand for AI4 chips, Tesla maintains production lines and supplier relationships, providing flexibility to ramp up quickly if vehicle demand increases.\n\n8. Data center power efficiency:\nThe AI4 chips, designed for use in power-constrained vehicles, might offer superior energy efficiency for certain tasks compared to traditional data center hardware.\n\nThese are speculative ideas, but they highlight potential strategic thinking behind Tesla's unconventional approach. It's a reminder of how Tesla often finds innovative ways to leverage their technologies across different parts of their business.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "We probably have excess AI4 chips from car sales being down.

It's about what I suspected when Elon said they're using AI4 chips for training but it spells it out in a clear way the *how* and *why* (even if speculative).\n\nTo me it sounds obvious. We know the Nvidia chips are expensive AF. And we know Tesla needs a LOT of training data, and results from the model running, collecting that data.\n\nMy immediate theory was that the AI4 chips are used for testing the model, using simulated worlds but also recordings from the field. Running those tests on Nvidia HW would be expensive and the AI4 HW is of course the same as what runs in the actual car.\n\nI could also see them use it as a beta test datacenter. Instead of having to push your experimental new model to 100 cars and hope they don't crash, you run it on 1000 AI4 chips in a datacenter overnight, against simulation. Once you know the new model isn't driving into pedestrians in the simulation, it may be safe to roll it out to drivers.\n\nIn conclusion I think it's a smart way to reduce cost, shrink the feedback loop and reduce \"time-to-deployment\" of updated models.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Closed out my 240s. ~2k premiums for the week.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Well done", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Good tip if 12.5 is too slow for your area¬†https://x.com/CocJii/status/1816642618639462818\n\n\nI disabled auto speed and set mine to relative with 10% increase", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I found that‚Äôs the only way to deal with school/playground zones that don‚Äôt have a new speed sign afterwards.

While progress on FSD has been disappointing through 12.4.x, no other company is pushing as hard as Tesla for a *general* FSD (non-geofenced) solution.  FSD 12.5.x is showing early promise.  YouTubers like AI DRIVR and Dirty Tesla report a much smoother experience in 12.5 vs. 12.4.x, although there's still a lot of work to be done.  \n\nTesla's valuation will IMO stay in the multi-hundred Billion dollar range while the investment community has some faith in the FSD experiment.

However, I expect the volatility to continue, and emphasize that there's still significant risk here:\n\n* Nobody can know ahead of time whether Tesla's FSD methodology will prove correct, and in what timeframe.  Anyone who says today they know the outcome for certain, whether success or failure, doesn't know what they're talking about.  \n* My predicted range of outcomes for Tesla is still $60-$70/share if AI/Robotics fails, and $1,600-$1,700 if AI/Robotics succeeds.  High Risk, High Reward\n\n \n\nI strongly advise people to have a backup plan.  Wholemars/Omar plays the part of the most ridiculous Elon simp on Twitter, yet he's admitted that TSLA was around 30% of his portfolio *at the peak,* and that he practices risk management.  Not all the superfans are as confident as their social media presence might imply.   \n\nS&P500 and Total Market Index funds are boring, but they'll also provide steady returns as long as civilization keeps running.

It's been exceedingly long since it put me in an interaction with other traffic where I thought it would result in a safety-critical disengagement (potential accident). \n\nI understand your point and agree that the system should operate within the bounds of the law a vast majority of the time.

In this instance, the car may have been registering an excessive closure speed from behind and made the decision that the risk of being rear-ended exceeded the risk of rolling through a late yellow light.

{"title": "I spend $4m a year facebook ads and I'm shorting $META earnings", "selftext": "This is a play based purely on anecdotal experience in the ecommerce space. Here's the anecdotal take:\n\nI started my ecom business 7 years ago and have built it on the back of the meta ads platform. Year over year we were able to grow and increase our spend. Last year we did around 9m, with 4m spend on Meta. This year, we're down about 30% on revenue and the efficiency of our META spend is down 10%. I'm in groups with hundreds of other founders, and this is the same situation for about 80% of the members in these groups. Just head on over to r/facebookads and look at all the depressing posts lol. Ask anyone you know who works in ecom how their company is doing this year.\n\nThe internal reality at Meta is that the ads platform is totally fucked up right now, more so than after the iOS update that sent the stock to $100, and barely anyone is talking about it. Google the stock and all you'll find is that 100% of analysts agree that it's a strong BUY, talking about AI and literally not mentioning the ad business (which effectively drives 100% of META revenue). In November 2022, when facebook was at $100, all the same analysts said META was dead and to stay away.\n\nAlso, I'm not a TA guy, but just look at that fuckin chart. Straight up for like 20 months. Looks toppy as hell.\n\nIn the 7 years of owning my business, all of my biggest pay days have come from anecdotal meta earnings call plays. This is nearly an identical situation to when the iOS update broke the ads platform while they were simultaneously blowing money on the metaverse, except nobody knows exactly what broke the ads platform (including facebook) and the multi billion dollar pit is their AI investment currently driving 0 revenue. I'm confident at the very least META EPS will be an underwhelming beat like google or a miss. They'll do damage control by saying \"AI\" 250+ times on the earnings call but that didn't work for Google so I don't see it working for them either.\n\nI've got 15k worth of options, positions below. This is some purely anecdotal gambling, do with it what you will. Not financial advice \n\nPositions [https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/f1acBVy.jpeg)\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up. Some clarifications:\n\n1) I'M GAMBLING YALL. Anecdotal evidence does not paint a full picture, obviosuly. But each of the massive multi year moves up and down by Meta over the last few years were felt first by advertisers. General advertising performance has worked as a leading indicator multiple times before, and the ads platform has had loads of issues this year.\n\n2) I think META is a great long term investment. I very much plan to continue spending my money on it, it's the dominant platform in the ad space by a long shot. But I also think its in a really good spot to take a fat shit in the short term. That's the play guys, I dont think Meta is going to die, I think its going to dip.\n\n3) My business did 9m last year, but as I stated, I spent half of that shit on fucking facebook ads. Considering we have to also, ya know, purchase the products, pay for shipping, staff, software subscriptions, hosting, etc. Net income generally lands between 7-10% of total revenue, and much of that get's reinvested back into the business. I make good money, but I'm not just rolling in cash. It's money I can afford to lose, but lol at everyone calling 15k on weeklies for an earnings play peanuts. Playing earnings is risky no matter your conviction levels.\n\nThere's so many factors that can play into an earnings call. Anyone with aggressive certainty going into an earnings call is an idiot, you can be right and get reamed by a stock buy back. But I personally feel strongly enough about the information to make a bet, and I'm sharing that insight with you guys cuz I haven't seen many people talking about it. If I'm right, this could easily be a 5-10x play. If I'm wrong, I lose. That's gambling you pussies.\n\nEdit: I am, in fact, cooked.", "id": "1eca49y", "created_utc": 1721952302.0, "score": 2471, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 900, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 137 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "And yet he didn't say he dropped his Ad spend on Meta.....", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "OP might be on top of something\n\n\nMy personal experience with FB, I get so many ads and a bunch of suggested posts, sometimes more than actual posts, it's unusable at this point", "score": 2235, "replies": [{"body": "This is true it‚Äôs terrible nowadays", "score": 480, "replies": [{"body": "Not to mention 90% of the non-ads are just influencers that I don‚Äôt follow popping up on my timeline promoting something", "score": 345, "replies": [{"body": "I had to get back on Facebook for my job (marketing funny enough) and it makes me want to gouge my eyes out every time I open the app. WHY IS EVERY OTHER POST A SUGGESTED USER!?!", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "Someone I know made a post 2 weeks ago about this very problem.

It was a very different world but social¬†and google ads never worked for us. It's a money churning treadmill that just makes mega cap tech richer and you beholden to¬†them. I don't imagine that has changed.\n\n\n\nGoogle ads particularly were ridiculous. Their algo meant the ads didn't even break even til you were spending¬†25k a week and above that a good roi was like 5%. That was basically 80% of our turnover at that point. It was for us a black hole that we stayed out of (we¬†had our own content business anyway and back then you had a lot more alternatives for advertising, particularly in our niche: sponsoring athletes, comps etc). It was also obviously bullshit as the roi was effectively decided by Google's algo which was entirely in their control. They simply played you against your competitors and arbed away everyone's profit.\n\n\n\nWe had a compeitor who relied entirely on google ads and was turning over 50x what we were but making less (usually negative) profit. Tiny changes in Google's algos had massive effects on their business and a really big change was nearly an extinction level event (they did eventually go bust though for other reasons). We decided to stay small and highly profitable: it was less work and more money.\n\n\n\nI can't imagine running that kind of business now. Our edge was that we had a lot of IT experience in house and managed and built the infrastructure and software ourselves (the only ecom package available when we started was OScommerce and it was dog shit and AWS etc didn't exist). This kept costs minimal and control and margins high. This isn't possible anymore. I don't know what they charge but Shopify alone is miles better than what we had and it's practically impossible to avoid running in the cloud (despite it being much cheaper not to do so) simply because it's impossible to find devs and sysadmins who can and want to do that and they anyway only want to work for megacap tech and expect C-suite level salaries straight out of college. Where's the profit?\n\n\n\nI digress, but to my eyes their competitive bidding models were always going to bump up against a ceiling because there is only so much profit to leech and it's highly dependent on economic conditions. Meta have never been through a real recession, they're going to get a massive shock when it does happen: ad agencies are usually the first to go.\n\n\n(Another digression/prophecy: most companies have lost any handle on IT costs¬†and the salaries they're paying aren't sustainable.

It's not DD based on fundamentals, it's just technicals. The fundamentals for chip makers ( especially market leaders such as NVDA ) remain the same and remain positive. So I'm only looking at the technical aspect here, because the fundamentals haven't changed, yet.\n\nThis is the daily chart for $SMH, the semiconductors index ( chip makers ) ETF.  \nSemiconductors formed a double top in early July. A bearish technical structure that often indicates more downside is ahead.  \nDouble tops form all the time, but unless they're confirmed they're usually harmless.\n\nA double top is confirmed when price closes below the neckline ( the purple line ). This happened on July 17th. As soon as that happens we can extrapolate a full measured move. It's basically a price target that's equal to the distance between the top and the neckline. ( the vertical blue line you see is the full measured move )  \nIf you take that distance and you place it below the neckline you get the downside target for this technical structure.\n\nAs of yesterday, we have hit this downside target.\n\nA similar but slightly different bearish structure also formed when chip stocks topped in March-April. It wasn't a double top, but a slightly different variation. That looks like a spike, then an inverted cup. The spike represents euphoria and the inverted cup represents buyers trying to get going again to crack through the highs, but failing to get momentum going and eventually they give up and sell and it results in a sharp sell off and a bottom. Chip stocks also bottomed right around the full measured move down from the neckline back then. And it's happening again.\n\nThis will sound a lot like meaningless mumbo jumbo reading tea leaves or astrology.  In reality technical analysis works for two main reasons.  \n1- It's just a representation of investor sentiment and psychology. Just like an ECG is a chart of your heartbeat.  \nThere's no fortune telling, there's no clairvoyance. It's just putting market psychology in defined, measurable numbers on a chart.  \n2- It works because everyone uses the same concepts. Just like I saw this double top and full measured move, every technical analyst at every big bank will have seen the same thing and came to the same conclusion.\n\nI plan to build an aggressive position once an S&P 500 bottom is confirmed. We're getting very close here, probably just days away. I don't want to buy any chip stock until the S&P 500 bottoms. So for now, just waiting patiently.", "id": "1ecr87j", "created_utc": 1722008391.0, "score": 280, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 416 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsk34m/woof_woof_this_dog_is_about_bark_up_a_tree_a_big/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u446bu/long_amd_my_next_potential_10x_amd_trade/) \n**Account Age** | 8 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">Chip Stocks Are Bottoming, Including $NVDA.\n\n>Looks at my INTC\n\n>-34.32% YTD\n\n>-40% 5YR\n\n>Lower than it was in 1998\n\nMan...

If the stock price falls below $80, the trader can sell the stock at the higher strike price, potentially making a profit.\n- **Cost Breakdown**: The price of each put option is around $3.25, and since each option contract typically represents 100 shares, the total cost is calculated as $650,000$", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "That sounds like a lot of free money for us to take!

For 1 contract (100 shares), you will have to pay $41\\*100 = $4100 (premium) now when you enter into the contract.

Mastering emotions like fear and greed, hope and pessimism to view things clearly. This takes a lot of inner work.\n\nOther stuff I‚Äôve found useful:\n\n- Set a stop loss at 20% for whatever option you bought. If you get stopped out, go home for the day. \n\nIf your account is $1,000 and you put 20% ($200) of capital in play, your risk is $40. That‚Äôs recoverable. \n\n- Set a target to lock in gains. Move your stop up as you keep winning. Don‚Äôt chase if you get stopped out, thinking you can buy back in. Just take your win. \n\n- Best intraday indicator for trading SPY is watching the vol ETFs (UVXY, SVXY). Compare the price action in those to the price action in SPY. You‚Äôll notice patterns in the behavior. \n\nWhat you want to look for is if vol is holding a firm level even as SPY is rising ‚Äî this means a surprise is probably lurking. \n\nIf SPY is declining (like on a midday dip) and vol isn‚Äôt really spiking or breaking new highs, it‚Äôs more likely a buyable dip. \n\n- I prefer OTM options with two week‚Äôs duration. Anything shorter gives me a heart attack. They‚Äôll retain enough value if spot price moves against you that you can at least roll into something else. \n\n- Options around 20-delta will have the most explosive potential. This is because *speed* (the second derivative of delta) tends to peak around this level. \n\n- Know the market trend. Right now the market is not strong.  Even up days are marked by weak closes.
