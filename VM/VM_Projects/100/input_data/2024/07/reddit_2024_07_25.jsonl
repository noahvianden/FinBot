When you buy at 118 with a 50:50 chance of gaining money, and stock gets to 135, you sell.  \n  \nSo that is what happened. Now, coincidentally, as everyone started selling at 135, although normally the stock would bounce back at around 115, shit happened.  \n  \nRighr when people were already selling, Trump says shit about Taiwan,Musk says tey will support competition, China trade war is ongoing. UN declares Israel's occupation of Palestine a complete shit show. Biden steps down months before elections. On top of that, time before earnings is naturally almost always a time when a stock can go down a lot, due to people taking profits before they buy back in before earnigs (or not, depending on the sentiment around the company).  \n  \nIf you consider all of this together, you can see that it is nothing more or less than just life being life.  \n  \nIt is not some omnipotent illuminati MM wiping their hands together laughing at how they fucked some poor assholes. It's just a lot of different things happening at the same time. That's all.  \n  \nI think it will skyrocket after earnings, but personally, I will be selling 50% of my position at 140 and diversifying elsewhere. Get out while you're on top.

You can sell two covered call contracts at a price you'd be comfortable selling your stocks for.  Then if you don't want to completely miss out on a massive upside movement in price, you can buy two call options above the call contracts you sold.  Your purchased call options will be paid for by the call options you sold since the strike price is higher, thus the premium cheaper.

Buying a single 12 month long call is going to be cheaper than buying twelve one month short calls.  But if the underlying price skews away from your strike price, that makes the long call lose value (thus you'd have to lose money to close position) and market price continues to drift away from your exit price, which lowers the premium you can receive on the covered call.

Fundamentals aren't weak. They are the only profitable EV automaker in the world with a $30b cash stack and little to no debt. Other automakers lose billions selling a few thousand EV's. Ford just reported results and loses $44k per EV sold - the same amount they sell EV's for. For this entire year, Ford is expected to lose $5.5b selling EV's. \n2. P/E ratio is such a horrible metric to use. Companies grow in stages. P/E ratio only works when you're comparing mature companies in similar industries. It's a metric highly valuable in 1990's but largely phased out as soon as tech companies burst into the scene. Tech companies take time for R&D to pay off. Often times, losing money for many years (increases P/E ratio) for a payoff in the future. Think companies like Amazon.\n3. EV sales are a downward trend in high inflation, high rates, and declining incomes. It's common sense. If you're struggling due to a higher cost-of-living, you're not going to take a chance buying an EV (new technology) and will buy what you know because it's consistent. When these factors reverse, EV's will benefit more than ICE sales.\n4. You forgot to mention energy storage, supercharging network, self-driving tech, and robotics. Self-driving tech/robotics, you either believe it will happen or not. These are very difficult products/services because they are revolutionary. So it will take time, R&D, and insane amounts of effort to perfect it. There are lots of YouTube videos for you to make a decision on whether self-driving will happen. I'm betting that it will. Robotics is tricky because Tesla wants to make it a humanoid robot with human actions. I'm not as high as they are on it and think it's better suited as a commercial robot that can replace tedious work in a factory or work environment.\n5. The only thing that affects a stock price is what people are willing to pay for it. The low P/E ratio with other automakers has to do with the fact that no one wants to buy those companies. Low growth, highly leveraged debt, and an inability to innovate. Ford's stock price today is the same price it was in 1996. Imagine holding for nearly 30 years and you've made nothing except paltry dividends.\n6. The Elon factor is huge. And why wouldn't it be? People hate on him because of his politics but one thing you can't question is his vision and innovative mindset. EV's don't exist without Elon. FACT. What other auto companies are trying to accomplish by having a profitable EV, Elon led Tesla to accomplishing it without having any experience previously working with vehicles. He wanted to buy a rocket from Russia to launch his own space rocket. Russia laughed at him because of his lowball offer. What did he do? Started SpaceX. Last year, they launched the largest space rocket into space in human history. And btw, it's a REUSABLE rocket. People all across the world can now access the internet using Starlink, a product that uses satellites launched into space via SpaceX rockets. It went from doing $1.4 billion in revenue in 2022 to expected revenue of $6.5-7 billion this year. They're securing contracts from cruise and airline companies because it's the best option by far. My point is, whilst I disagree with Elon being as politically involved as he is, the market loves a visionary and innovative individual and no one can deny that he isn't.

Imagine it acting as a constellation of big space cell phone towers orbiting the world and all the carriers use it to patch gaps in coverage areas - without having to build terrestrial cell towers ever again to get full coverage for their customers.  ATT, Verizon in USA get first crack as they have made investment deals and prepayment deals to help build out first - but eventually everyone will get coverage and prioritized by similar prepayment structure (as a means of funding the buildout vs dilutive offerings) and/or strategic markets with the best return to maximize cash flow.  They tout 45 agreements with MNO's currently serving 2.8 billion customers - maybe more to come.  - maybe 10% 280 million customers or 20% 560 million get signed up for revenue share - (estimates of $2. per sub per month) 24 x 580 million? sick, right with  250 million in operating expenses?  These are just numbers i have read about, no way to know how it all plays out from current subs, and new ones, ARPU or any of it.  but 5 to 10 billion annually in profit over the next 5 to 10 years after full build out?  again, not certain numbers, but need to create projections from what is out there.  That's why i'm in this.  I could be wrong, but it's how i and a lot of others see it.

It seems to not be a major issue anymore and ATT and Verizon have seen enough in testing from the BW3 satellite up there to move forward.
