Is this worth it?\n\nThat's a reasonable plan and you are asking the right question. What you need to get used to is that *the market is not required to offer you a good deal.* So most of the time, the answer is no, it's not worth it. You should *expect* for CCs to not be worth it most of the time, given that plan. Although, of course, it depends on the forecast for the stock. The higher the stock is expected to go, the more a CC seller can demand in premium. So if the market is setting a low price, it means the market doesn't think the stock is likely to go that high.\n\nI personally don't set a target for premium based on cost basis with CCs, or indeed, on anything. For me, it's not the premium that is the goal, it's the gain on the shares. So if I need at least a $5 gain on the shares to take assignment, I don't care that the premium is only paying $.05 or whatever.

And what stock cost? This could be a very good gain when looking at it as an annual return. Having more details of the position would help.\n\nIf you are not expecting the stock to spike higher and would be happy selling the shares at the strike price, then whatever premiums are made can be seen as a bonus. You already own the shares so there is no additional investment or cost (other than fees) to sell CCs, so even small amounts can add up over time.\n\nNote that depending on where the current stock price is compared to the net stock cost it may not be possible to sell CCs for much, so that may mean to hold the shares waiting for the stock to move back up.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.

Another CC sold for .60 would see the net cost drop to $86.68 and so on. \n\nUsing this method, you can more easily tell that an 87 strike CC would bring in a small profit if the shares were called away.

It would be helpful to know the expiration date and IV evolution, or you could just tell us the full trade details (ticker, type, expiration, strike, etc.) and we can look it up, in order to explain why the bid fell from .70 to .05.\n\nFor the ask, people can ask for as high a price as they want and the price they ask for doesn't have to be realistic. Like if they have an 8 oz. bottle of water to sell, they can demand $1000 for it. Nobody in their right mind would pay that when you can get the same bottle of water from the convenience store for $.69, *but in an auction, there is nothing stopping you from asking for a ridiculous price.* It's the same principle for the bid/ask of options price. Since there is no upper limit on the asking price, it's close to meaningless. Whereas for the bid, there is a limit on what people can bid, since you can't bid less than zero. If you bid zero, you are pretty much saying that the item is worthless to you, so it's not worth offering anything for it.\n\nThe only thing that keeps the asking price to a reasonable level is competition. It's that $.69 bottle of water at the convenience that makes is economically infeasible to ask for $1000. As long as someone else is willing to sell for a lower price, the asking price will stay reasonable. That also works for the bid. If you get outbid by competition, you'll have to raise your bid if you want the item.\n\nSo when people talk about liquidity, they are essentially talking about the competition for the contract. High competition leads to good liquidity, evidenced by a narrow bid/ask spread. Lack of competition leads to bad liquidity and wide bid/ask spreads.\n\nDo you understand why a .05/1.95 spread is terribad liquidity? And why .05/.06 would be ideal (best) liquidity?

The value of that call would either go up or down, and you'd make or lose money based on the choice to buy or sell.\n\nThe problem is that there is a spread between the bid and ask prices.  Take JPM 210 ATM (slight ITM) Call- you can buy it for $3.95 but sell it for only $3.80.  If the true value of the contract falls within the spread (efficient market hypothesis), then you're being slightly upcharged for buying and slightly undercut for selling.\n\nThis is similar to flipping a coin to return $1, but betting for heads costs $1.02 and betting against heads returns $0.98 (heads being an increase in value).  Over enough iterations of this process, you're losing money and ending up with a negative EV.\n\nProfitable outcomes happen when the efficient market hypothesis fails.  If JPM spikes over the next few weeks, and the (RV) realized volatility is greater than the (IV) implied volatility(the spike was larger than the market anticipated), the true value would be higher than the call's bid or lower than the call's ask.\n\nHere's where my knowledge starts to hit its limit.

Both are possible in the options market.\n\n> If there is a \"**losing** strategy\", then doing the opposite should grant a \"winning strategy\".\n\nCorrect. So what? That doesn't imply 50/50. It just implies that every trade has a winner and a loser. There are no trades where everyone wins (positive sum game) and no trades where everyone loses (negative sum game). So all that's left is a zero sum game, where every win has to be paired with a loss. But the wins can happen at any frequency, like 90%. In order for the 90% losers to be willing to play the game, their 10% payoff has to be worth their time (positive expected value). That's where \"it works until it doesn't\" comes in. That 1 in 10 win for the other side of the trade has to be a big one.\n\n50/50 is not the only way for a proposition to be break-even. Suppose that the option market only offered trades that are 90% win rate for buyers. So buyers win 9 out of 10 times and sellers win 1 out of 10 times.

This tends to *understate* returns, because worst-case risk assumes highly improbable, but not impossible, outcomes, like black swan events.\n\n(2) Structured/defined Return on Risk\n\nMany option trades have defined maximum risk amounts.

Since managed risk is usually lower than the max risk on a trade, this method can end up *overstating* your return.\n\n(4) Annualized Return or CAGR of total portfolio value\n\nDon't sweat the trade-by-trade details. Just look at your overall portfolio value and compare to some earlier point in time. \n\n(5) Sortino Ratio\n\nAnnualized return can hide how much risk you had to take to earn that return.

{"title": "Nvidia Just Getting Started: Stock Heading to $150 and Possibly $200 by year’s end", "selftext": "A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. \n\nAI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.\n\nYes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.\n\nEvery time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger.\n\nThat’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.\n\nPlus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.\n\nOverall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia’s growth story.", "id": "1dshht2", "created_utc": 1719798810.0, "score": 1047, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 514, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 11 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What about AMD?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Why stop at 200?", "score": 544, "replies": [{"body": "One million dollars", "score": 275, "replies": [{"body": "***Everyone laughs***\n\n\"Sorry, ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS!\"", "score": 139, "replies": [{"body": "AFTER the next split", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "And ONE CENT", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Pennies matter on beet farms.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Not to me, I just actually like their company and their video cards.  I bounce on that phat bc I appreciate the love my 4090 does for me.  It knows me.  Cherishes my touch.  I would sacrifice for the 4090.  I do sacrifice.
