It has completed 2 million trips to date. In June, Waymo removed the waitlist and opened Waymo rides to all San Francisco users.\n\nThe unit raised $2.25 billion in its first external funding round in 2020. The company raised another $2.5 billion in 2021 in a round that included funding from Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management & Research Company and more.\n\nAlphabet‚Äôs increased investment in Waymo comes after General Motors‚Äô autonomous vehicle unit Cruise said it would indefinitely delay the production of the Origin, a self-driving shuttle designed for use in cities. Tesla on Tuesday delayed plans to unveil its CyberCab, a dedicated robotaxi, from August to Oct. 10.\n\n‚ÄúAlphabet has committed up to $5B to Waymo,‚Äù Waymo CEO Tekedra Mawakana said on X. ‚ÄúWe are grateful for their immense vote of confidence in our team and recognizing the amazing progress we‚Äôve made with our technology, product, and commercialization efforts.‚Äù\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/23/alphabet-to-invest-5-billion-in-self-driving-car-unit-waymo.html", "id": "1eanere", "created_utc": 1721779757.0, "score": 608, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 191, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3A%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If your mark ups don‚Äôt change, but the item is more expensive, you make more money. You say the president doesn‚Äôt control it, yet he would take credit if the dollars amount went down? Gas prices when Biden took office were drastically lower than they even are today. Gas prices on his watch increased nearly 150%. In 2008, when Obama took office, the national debt was 11.9 trillion. When he left, the national debt was 20.8 trillion. A 74.78% increase during his 2 terms alone. The total increase of 8.9 trillion comes out to 1.1 trillion a year. When Trump entered office, it was 20.8 trillion, and when he left in 2020, it was 28.4 trillion. Now, when you subtract all the excess money spent on covid, something you liberals seem to forget happened, which is estimated between 3.5 trillion and 6 trillion, and I‚Äôll use the lower amount to be more fair to your argument, that puts us at 24.3 trillion, an increase of 16.8%. Under Donald Trump, not including covid funds, it increased 3.5 trillion, or 875 billion a year, which is less than Obama. Now, I‚Äôll fast forward to when Joe took office, and not include any of that covid spending, which the national debt calculator would already have that money factored in in 2020. Joe Biden took office at 28.4 trillion dollars, and the debt currently sits at 34.9 trillion, or an increase of 6.5 trillion, an increase of 22.88%, which is 6.08% more than Donald Trump, and still 51.9% less than Obama. The 6.5 trillion in 3.5 years is 1.85 trillion a year, outpacing even Obama. At current trends, based of Joe Biden‚Äôs spending policies, by 2028, we would be looking at 46.6 trillion dollars in national debt, and 18.2 trillion dollar increase under Joe Biden‚Äôs policies, or 2.275 trillion a year, doubling Obama, and nearly tripling Trump. Even with COVID spending factored in during 2020, we still spent less than we‚Äôre spending this year under Joe Biden‚Äôs administration. If you keep the same policies in place, we‚Äôll spend 10.1 trillion dollars in 2028, which is a deficit of 3.58 trillion dollars, which is 900 billion more than during covid. Our TOTAL is debt in 2020 was 82.6 trillion, in increase of 14 trillion during trumps presidency. Today, it‚Äôs 101.2 trillion, an increase of 18.6 trillion, despite spending 3.5-6 trillion less on covid. At current spending trends, 2028 would be 126.7 trillion in total debts, or an increase of 44.1 trillion, or a total increase of 53.38%.

So the question is, when it comes to your capital investments, your AI R&D, your AI engineers, how do you make allocation decisions among these various ventures and how do you make Tesla owners comfortable that you're doing it in a way that really benefits them?

So it was just -- there was -- this wasn't a, let's pick xAI of Tesla.\n> \n> There's -- there was no -- the Tesla data centers were full. There was no place to actually put them. The -- we've been working 24/7 to complete the South extension on the Tesla Giga factory in Texas. That South extension is what will house 50,000 H100s and we're beginning to move the H100 server racks into place there. But we really needed -- we needed that to complete physically. You can't just order compute -- order GPUs and turn them on, you need a data center, it's not possible.\n> \n> So I want to be clear, that was in Tesla's interest, not contrary to Tesla's interest. Does Tesla no good to have GPUs that it can't turn on. That South extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week. We are moving the GPUs in there and we'll bring them online.\n> \n> With regard to xAI, there are a few that only want to work on AGI.
