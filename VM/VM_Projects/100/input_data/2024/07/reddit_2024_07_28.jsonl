However, I'm considering creating DCF, DDM, and multiples templates for quick and dirty valuations, along with tools for portfolio management for better decision making.\n\nI avoid investing in hyped companies (I never bought Nvidia, which in hindsight was a mistake) and focus on companies that are profitable and likely to remain so.
