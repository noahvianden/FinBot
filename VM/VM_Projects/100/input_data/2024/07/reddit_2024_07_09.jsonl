What i can tell you is this.\n\nWe are in the the pre-game warm up of a 9 inning double header. The elites smell blood in the water. And you can thank China and Russia for this gamesmanship. China is doing AI, therefore, US must do AI. Who knows what the hell Europe is doing. They'll just wait for the US to do what needs to be done I guess but I digress.\n\nThe elites know that there is something here. What do I mean. Robotics is not next year on a mass scale per se but all of this pre-game work will lead to robotics. Elon knows this. Amazon knows this. Bill Gates knows this. Everyone knows this. There have been movies about this for decades such as Terminator. Kidding kidding. But seriously, humanoid robots are on the table. But it's more than that.\n\nIt's automation and cognitive tasks that can now be automated too. Many white collar cognitive jobs will be shaken. Later, blue-collar cognitive labor will be shaken.\n\nThink about human history. Cheap labor that can 24/7 and doesn't need health insurance is too rich pass up.\n\nThere will be railroad track after railroad track laid down until there is a robust economy behind it.\n\nEvery household will have a humanoid robot doing laundry and cooking 3 meals a day in some near future.\n\nThe promise is JUST TOO GOOD to pass up.\n\nThe people telling you that 100 million dollar training to 1 billion dollar training is coming and then on to 10 and 100. Why? Because all of those robots and all of those capabilities of automation will be delivered by these cloud companies.\n\nAmazon just hired I think it was 750,000 robots for its factories.\n\nAnd the reason why you know that for Nvidia it has just begun is because those things aren't here YET. There is still compute, more models that need to be trained and scaled. More throughput is a huge issue meaning, there is more demand BY FAR than supply of AI throughput.\n\nSome people think WingStop and Chipotle are great investments and you know a 3000 forward PE is justifiable. Others, way smarter than I, can see into the future. The future is AI and breakthroughs will gain at a greater pace because a little 10 billion investment produced so much return.\n\nWe are still on GPT-4 and in words of Sam Altman - it sucks (not really that but you get my point). Something more profound and useful is coming.\n\nUntil I have a damned Jetson's robot in my house cleaning up after me and my kids I will then, and only then, start to believe we have enough GPU'S and accelerated compute.", "id": "1dyu0as", "created_utc": 1720500971.0, "score": 156, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "Yep, this is the big picture that most people don‚Äôt understand. \n\nGuys and gals, the nerds are in the AI labs with line of sight to super-intelligence.

There are many economic sectors that have dependency on image and graphics technology(military, health, transportation, commercial flight, business etc.). The use of AI will go beyond robotics, it will assist with all models where predictive analytics and imaging are needed capabilities. What do all these have in common? Processing power. And more powerful, faster processors. This is where NVidia is the hub in an ever expanding wheel with various technologies as the wheels spokes. Will there be a time where other companies catch up to NVidia? That‚Äôs possible only if NVidia fails to continue to innovate. No one sees that happening any time soon. Nvidia has true visionary leadership in Jensen and they know they have the best solutions to offer. Staying the best requires meeting the current and foreseeable demands of technology. Nvidia will expand to acquire AI startups to drive the software capabilities that align with their hardware. 5 years from now I expect (if not sooner) they will 10X again. Will there be fluctuations? Of course. Early whales will want to take profits. Who can blame them. But to get totally out will be a massive mistake.

There are many people that melt with a stock all the way up; meaning, they go very heavy in and ride for a very long time. Krispy Kreme, JDSU, LU... There are bad bad examples of what may happen with this strategy. \n\nIn today's world, Apple and Tesla are the biggest examples of this. If I melted up with Tesla I would firmly say I would have been out with a much smaller position than what I would have started with. The years of good returns of Tesla where good and still maybe but it's not like buying it back in the 5 / 7 years ago. Apple, for about 2 decade if not longer was a great investment. Today, do we think it's going to melt up the same as a decade or 2 ago, no. There is no reason to believe that. \n\nI believe, the only reason why Nvidia hasn't melted up right past Apple and Microsoft is because it's a massive valuation - like, it's too large. I get that part of it. Also, I am happy it's not going too far into the abyss of valuation because that would be a lot more scary. a forward pe of 35 - 40 is not outrageous for now as it is a grower and the margins are so juicy. \n\nDo I really see this company being larger than Microsoft? In the long run, no. Eventually, the cloud business from AWS and Microsoft are too important. Here's the caveat. Could Nvidia become the direct source provider of cloud accelerated compute more directly than they already are. They could, and I would reevaluate my position on whether I think Nvidia should rightly pass MSFT in valuation. This is an unknown X factor that I think will take 1 - 2 years to fully understand by anyone.

Grids need a constant background level and nuclear and geothermal is great for that, but the problem is that they also need to be able to boost and drop capacity as demand changes throughout the day. You can't just power up and power down a nuclear plant. Building only nuclear would be very inefficient because they're expensive and you would need to find ways to waste their power overnight if you build enough capacity to meet peak demand with nuclear alone. This is where wind, solar, and hydro excel. You can turn them on and off on pretty much a moments notice to boost capacity when you need it, and shut them down when you don't. Solar and wind tend to peak output during the day, and as such they're great for being on demand. \n\nGeothermal is pretty good at being both on demand and constant, but it's also very niche and not suitable for a lot of locations.

If something goes wrong with that single plant, or it needs to go offline for maintenance for an extended period of time, you're going to be scrambling for alternative sources or buying it from further afield. A great example is the blackout in the early 2000's. The local nuclear plant took days to come back online after it's emergency shutdown was triggered by the blackout. The hydro dams on the other hand were able to come back on in a matter of hours (it would have been faster but they first had to isolate grids to ensure they didn't just go off line again). Places that relied primarily on the nuclear plant were down for over a day in some cases while those supplied primarily by renewables were up and running in a few hours.

It should make up alot of the difference because my friend has a hard time selling Nvidia calls without them expiring in the money usually (lost profit overall).  He is also always trying to sell in the money because he doesn't understand the value your gaining from time premiums alone and he thinks somehow hes gaining more that way from anticipating a drop....  You gotta make the time premium specifically work for you, in the money calls do not carry shit for time premium.  Calls that are a few dollars off atleast will give you a wider chance to swing a deal.  Besides that, usually people who day trade Nvidia are missing out on a large percentage of the longterm ride up anyway regardless.  You need to collect the entire ride up along with the time premium from calls you sold to maximize your gains.  You will make more money this way than just holding Nvidia long and Spy will not fuck you in the end, it ALWAYS comes back.\n\nYour fine for now but you better have a plan not to get fucked.  I'd start selling out of the money calls right now (I call them shit tickets because usually they expire worthless on most stocks).  Collect the time premiums for as long as you can, this will hedge yourself from the bubble pop, but this is probably SOO late to the game.  You will need to have some skill to pick when to sell calls and obviously, a call has to be covered by 100 shares.\n\nGet your ass on tradingview, check the low 1 year price target on Spy, and that's your point of entry.  Whether you do it with sold puts or just a limit buy order is up to you.\n\nAnd before you trade your first option - never sell at the bid or buy at the ask.

When annotators view the data, they can see a timestamp from when the footage was taken and the geolocation, but they're unable to view anything that explicitly identifies the specific vehicle or driver. Instead, annotators said they could rely on context clues, particularly the routes and locations the vehicle visited.\n\n>Some workers said the cost of failing to label Musk's data correctly could be high. Two former workers recalled an incident where a data annotator was terminated shortly after labeling a clip they believed came from Musk's car. The worker was escorted out of Tesla's facility in Buffalo, New York, the workers said, after the data labeler failed to properly label a highway exit sign. One former worker said it was highly unusual for someone in data annotation to be fired without warning and that the employees were typically put on notice if they were not hitting their metrics.\n\n  \nThis may partially account for why Mr. Musk persistently says that FSD builds are \"mindblowing\", while the broader user base still experiences what is a buggy product.  \n\nThere may also be issues with overfitting for certain YouTube influencers.  \n\nWhile I consider Business Insider to be a somewhat unreliable tabloid, the fact that a former Tesla employee was willing to put their name on the line for these allegations, lends some credibility to these allegations.  \n\n  \nIn fairness, Mr. Bernal may have a grudge against Tesla.
