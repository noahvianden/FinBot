Short version, nobody can answer this \"right\" without a crystal ball. The best way for laymen to invest is to try and learn as much as you can about a stock, make an informed decision and then ride it out. The market is a tool to transfer money from the poor/middle class to the rich, but it's also a tool to transfer money from the inpatient to the patient.

I guess \"protective,\" of NVDA and you have a lot of people who come in here, start spouting nonsense about how it's like the Dot Com bubble, and then speculate it's going to fall. \n\n  \nMy advise? I'd buy now. You don't know when it's going to go up, you're trying to time the market and that's a bad idea. If you believe NVDA will grow, that it's fundamentals will continue to drive the stock price up, you buy. \n\nYou could fuck around, wait it out, put a buy order in at 110 and hope, but...what if it goes up to 122 on Monday and then never gets below 120 again?\n\n  \nI personally thought it'd trade between \\~110 and 130 after the split and until the next earnings...and then it went up to nearly 141 and it never really traded below 115.\n\n  \nThis is a decision you have to make and be comfortable with. So sure, you can wait, you can put the buy order in at a certain limit...or you can just buy it now and then DO NOT watch the stock every day. This NVDA daily thread, it's not healthy for investors. I wasn't on here in 2022 when the stock went from nearly 34 a share to 12 a share. I'd have probably sold if I'm being honest, but I held. \n\n  \nI also set a buy order for SMCI at 700 when it was dropping. Just 100 shares, I was just kinda toying with the idea of day trading with some money, but IIRC, it got down to like 701 and the buy order never went through, the stock then shot back up shortly thereafter to 950 and I missed out. Conversely, I DID buy AVGO at 1440 or something and then sold it shortly thereafter at 1740. This was only 20 shares, but it was a nice little 4000 profit.\n\n  \n-Here's the take away from my LITTLE dabbling in day trading. I'm not informed enough to do it, it's too stressful and I shouldn't. \n\n  \nSo nobody can give you the \"right\" answer without knowing the future. It could go down to 90 a share even with good earnings due to geopolitical events.

Fix that.  NOW.  IDK what the fuck you're thinking but you're not on a path to success.\n\nOkay, with that out of my system, let me say one more thing:\n\nFirst of all, a disclaimer:  I have no clue if AMZN is going up, down, or sideways.  The answer is \"YES\".\n\nLet's objectively look at AMZN.\n\nIF you believe that the options \"tail\" wags the stock \"dog\", then I present the following:\n\n[https://imgur.com/4j5PQnt](https://imgur.com/4j5PQnt)\n\nThis shows that notionally, at a 50 delta, there is 2.768x control of the underlying stock in options transactions.  Put another way, when we place options trades, the Dealers have to respond, more than they do with simple stock, only because the tail is literally wagging the dog.\n\nThe risk - \"delta\" - of the options complex creates movement in the underlying price, hence, we need to look at the structure of the underlying options complex and see how the market is positioned in context of Greeks.\n\nTo do this, I rely on some data that I've posted here as an interactive link:\n\n[http://charts.gammaedge.us/8dfa138b/AMZN\\_-1\\_8dfa138b\\_db\\_history\\_daily\\_07\\_20\\_2024\\_00\\_46\\_51.html](http://charts.gammaedge.us/8dfa138b/AMZN_-1_8dfa138b_db_history_daily_07_20_2024_00_46_51.html)\n\nThis shows price and something called \"Detla Balance\".  Basically, if there are a whole bunch of people/institutions betting that AMZN will go up, we'll see it in a DB that is > 0.\n\nConversely, if we see that DB < 0, we lack upside speculation (which is what you want), and this suggests lower prices as people speculate with puts.\n\nThe graphic at the link above is interactive.  When you hover over prices, you get a value:\n\nValues > 0 are considered bullish  \nValues < 0 are considered bearish\n\nThere are 3 components here:\n\n1. Blue DB:  this is an oscillator that is designed to rail -1 to +1.  It is comprised of the following two components:\n2. Net Delta LHP Pct:  The LHP, or \"left hand plane\", that area below spot price, has a moneyness associated with it.  Here, calls are ITM (in the money) and puts are OTM (out of the money).  OTM puts are speculative to the downside; the ITM calls were placed long ago when AMZN was in an uptrend.\n3. Net Delta RHP Pct:  The RHP, or \"right hand plane\", is that area ABOVE spot price, and it too has a moneyness associated with it.  Here, calls are OTM (speculative) and puts are ITM (deltas are growing and these holders are most likely positive.\n\nValues above DB > 0 mean that OTM calls outnumber the ITM put deltas.  This is good for price expansion.  \nValues below DB < 0 mean that OTM puts outnumber the ITM call deltas.  This is good for price contraction.\n\nIf you hover over that link, yep, I can see where you got screwed if you placed your trades after July 16.  July 16 EOD (end of day) was the last day DB was = 1, and both the RHP and LHP were still call dominated.\n\nJuly 17th EOD would have been your signal to exit.  Yes, this would have sucked.  That's trading.  Know your exits BEFORE you enter the trade.\n\nJuly 18th EOD was a continuation day down.  You're really hating life, and moreso, you're adding to a falling position where DB (downside put speculation is growing), and you're screwed.  Dealers are SELLING AMZN to hedge flat, and you have no support.\n\nPrice stabilized yesterday on July 19th and bounced.  Too little, too late.  The DB value is now -1, meaning, it's constituents are < 0.  Puts are controlling the stock.

LHP < 0.  This means that in the LHP, which contains ITM calls and OTM puts, the puts outnumber the deltas of the ITM call deltas.  They are in control.\n\nGreen line almost railed near -1:  This means that for the next week, in the RHP, which contains the ITM put delta and the OTM call delta, there is little OTM call delta to offset to the puts.  There is no upside speculation to speak of, and more importantly, charm in the overhead is very heavy and is pushing the complex down.\n\nAs the complex gets weighed down by ITM puts (as well as OTM puts), charm continues to grow in the overhead and this charm is NEGATIVE DELTA.  This means our book gets shorter, the Dealer's book gets longer, and to hedge flat, they SELL those deltas back to 0.  There is downward pressure on AMZN for the next week>\n\n(timeframe matters - you're dealing with options that have finite lifetime).\n\nYour TL;DR is that for the next week, life is going to suck for you, given Friday's structure.  It can chance, AND IT WILL, but it's going to take something other than the current structure to save your tail.\n\nWhat about all that data to the right?  Glad you asked.\n\nThe data to the right in that figure shows the positioning into August 2, August 9th, and finally August 16th.\n\nThe next two weeks do not look great from today (but we have no clue if price will go any direction - all we can do is read the structure that is in front of us TODAY).\n\nAugust 2 has a DB < 0\n\nAugust 9th has a DB that is < 0,  We note that we do see, at the current price level, some speculative calls that create the upward-moving green line > 0, and that will grow in delta in that week, so there is a ray of sunshine.\n\nThe monthly on August 16 jumps, which is good.\n\nAMZN could continue to fall.  Where it goes is a different analysis.  Luckily, with options, your risk is defined, but with a zillion calls, you may blow your account by next month.\n\nNote again:  I have no clue what AMZN is going to do and this may all be irrelevant.  I use this info - no need for you to do so.  This being said, I would have have never done what you did because I manage risk and you have to yet learn this.  Most learn this by blowing their account - hopefully things work out in your favor before you get a margin call or go broke.\n\nLearn how things work dude.  Take your time.

For all of the massive gains posted on WSB , I realize now many if not most are from blind luck. Buying and holding wild long term calls in one or maybe a few companies & benefiting from a ride up. Ofc luck vs skill is a nuanced debate. My point is there are not a lot of strategic bets and systems of trading for most of the WSB gains I've seen, I realized it correlates strongly to buy and hold on call options of a few stocks that the person rode to the $$$. \n\nIt's not repeatable as a strategy IMO , it's throwing a dart at a dartboard and hoping it hits a 🎯 \n\n  \nNothing wrong with this but I don't think it's repeatable or consistent and I think there are many people with the same \"strategy\" who ended up much less fortunate when they selected the wrong calls expiration, companies etc. \n\n  \nAs for Nvidia I bought puts at 120 back in June , they were too short I lost  the. All, I rebought many more at 135 and sold at 95, I'm happy with the trade. All indicators and statistics available showed the stock was massively overbought even compared to big tech stocks which themselves as a sector tend to be very overbought. I spent hours upon hours breaking down the companies financials earnings and comparing them with other big cap tech companies all the ratios etc and I can without a doubt say that all indicators show Nvidia was and maybe still is overbought. \n\n  \nMaybe you are right and they bounce back but that's a risk I wouldnt take. Although if you still held the year end calls I think you probably have a solid chance to make money but I have no idea how reliable the earnings will be to increase the price after a big chunk of late adopters to Nvidia lost a bunch of money. \n\n  \nTbh in interested in your thinking / basis for NVIDIA going past it's all time highs? \n\n  \nDo you think this pattern will repeat endlessly? It already became the biggest company in the world with a 3 trillion valuation, does it go to 5 trillion? 10? \n\nAnd if so why / how., if it's based on the earnings being good I'm not sure how much higher it can go. It's all opinions I could be dead wrong but the thing that pushed me over the edge was seeing Jensen huang sell the legally allowable limit of stock to a total of over 600Million at the moment. \n\nWhat goes up ,.must ...

But when I have conviction, I nail it bigly. I've been buying NVDA calls since it was split adjust $30. Actually, I owned $70k in shares back in 2002. Had to liquidate them to settle my divorce, but that's a different story.\n\nI've paper handed so much profit on NVDA on the run-up because I too thought it had run up too far, too fast. I almost bought 10 $90 calls for $60 when it was at $85 before earnings. It ran to $1200 before they would have expired. Literally missed out on $250,000 in profits because I was too scared. \n\nSo, my more recent strategy has been to buy deep ITM calls. When NVDA hit $110, I bought 30 Jan 2025 $120 Calls. As soon as it hit $135, I knew it was too far and too much in the short-term, so I sold 30-day OTM calls against it. Ended up looking like a genius. Closed out a $15k position for only $500. \n\nBut I didn't think NVDA would dip so low, or I would have sold calls against the position once again. Lesson learned.\n\nAs for how far NVDA will go. I've already posted too many times about how the cyclicality of semis. Even the new fandangled AI hoopla will become cyclical - The question is when. I have no idea. Most people don't.

Historically, periods of high demand, driven by innovations and consumer electronics growth, led to increased production and investment. However, overcapacity and inventory build-ups can result in sharp downturns. Economic conditions, shifts in consumer preferences, and geopolitical factors also contribute to this cyclicality. Boom cycles often see rising prices and profits, while bust cycles involve price declines, reduced profits, and sometimes industry consolidation.\n\nNVDA isn't immune to any of these industry realities. However, NVDA has some characteristics that most semiconductor companies can't claim.\n\n* **Nvidia's Unique Position:** Nvidia is uniquely positioned with its dominance in the GPU market, which is essential for AI, gaming, and data centers. The demand for AI and machine learning applications is surging, providing a strong growth catalyst for Nvidia that isn't as impacted by the specific issues facing ASML.\n* **Strong Financial Performance:** Nvidia has consistently posted strong earnings, often exceeding expectations. Their latest earnings report highlighted a significant growth trajectory, driven by robust demand in their core markets. This positions Nvidia differently compared to companies like ASML, which face distinct challenges.\n* **TSMC's price hike strategy:** Price increase isn't what propels NVDA's stock.  Nvidia's growth is fueled by technological advancements and increasing adoption of AI across various industries, rather than just price adjustments.\n* **Diversification and Innovation:** Nvidia's diverse product portfolio and continuous innovation provide multiple revenue streams and mitigate risks associated with geopolitical issues affecting specific markets or products.\n* **Market Sentiment and Momentum:** Market sentiment around Nvidia remains positive, supported by strong institutional backing and analyst upgrades.
