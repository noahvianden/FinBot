Nvidia is supplying the chips that are essentially upgrading the brain of AI. Imagine if cavemen had upgraded brains when they started inventing the wheel or hunting tools—their progress and speed of innovation would have increased tenfold. That’s exactly where we are with AI. Think of ChatGPT as the equivalent of inventing the wheel. From here on out, innovation and efficiency will advance at five times the current speed.\n\nWith AI's help, programmers will soon be able to code entire programs in hours, a task that used to take weeks or months, and they'll be able to do it alone instead of with a team. And this is still just elementary AI. Future developments, like Blackwell, will likely boost it even more. Tech companies will need to upgrade their hardware annually to be the first to achieve breakthroughs in this new AI-driven world. Stopping upgrades would be like throwing in the towel.\n\nIt’s similar to when World of Warcraft guilds competed for first clears, spending countless hours to achieve them. But this is real life, with implications far beyond a game. The first to harness AI’s full potential will likely be the ones to influence how the world operates. This isn’t just about staying ahead—it’s about shaping the future.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nope. Its still strong.

Car accelerates to speed limit but almost always immediately slows back down to below. Still extreme hesitancy in right turn on red scenarios. When giving way to pedestrians, the car seems to have an issue where it takes excessively long to proceed after the conflict has passed. Almost a lag in the processing within FSD itself. It just waits there and then 'wakes up' after 10-20s. Strange.  In the final part of the drive, the car tried to drive into a \"do not enter\" lot. Obviously, its ability to read road signs needs more training.\n\nI'm going to reiterate what I said yesterday.  V12.4.3 just seems like 12.3.6 with attention monitoring capability rather than constant nags. It does not display any new behaviour or enhanced capabilities. It's just kinda...the same as 12.3.x.

Am I wrong?* - market liquidity and corporate liquidity kind of go hand in hand i guess. for those of us that are not Apple corporation or corporate bond investors, we don't really care about any of this. all we care about is if corporations can raise cash when they need cash, as a general sign of the health of overall markets. if interest rates on corporate bonds are low, its because there are so many people lined up around the block waiting to buy corporate bonds that they dont have to offer very high interest rates. this is a sign that corporations are not in any sort of liquidity troubles. \n\nwhen we see corporate bond interest rates rising, it means that even while corporations desperately need money, nobody is lending to them. so they have to raise the interest rate a little and see if there are any takers. if not, they have to raise interest rates a little more. and a little more and a little more, until someone is willing to take the risk to lend them money. this signals that people are not very confident in corporations ability to pay them back. at the same time, higher interest rates mean its more expensive for corporations to pay them back, so its more of a drag on the cash flow of the company moving forward. its kind of a double whammy. so the moral of the story here is that rising corporate bond interest rates is a signal of very very bad things to come.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.
