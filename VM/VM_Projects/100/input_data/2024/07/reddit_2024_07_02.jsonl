Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”\n\nSluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.\n\nBut the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”\n\nTesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.\n\nTesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.\n\nIn China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.\n\nColin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees “declining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.” He recommends selling Tesla shares.\n\nWells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the “likelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes” as the year continues.\n\nInvestor focus will now shift to Tesla’s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or “CyberCab.”\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/tesla-tsla-q2-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html", "id": "1dtlvh3", "created_utc": 1719926973.0, "score": 1002, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 426, "comments": [{"body": "Naturally Tesla stock is soaring on this news.", "score": 762, "replies": [{"body": "A 58x P/E on a declining company.

But here is Morgan Stanley’s take on the numbers:\n\n“1st Positive Surprise of the Year\n\nTesla started its Independence Day celebration early with a positive 2Q delivery beat, 33k lower inventory and a large storage beat to remind investors it's not just an auto company.\n\n1. Deliveries beat, but... 2Q deliveries came to 443,956 units vs. MS at\n427,303 and cons at 437,812. While this is one of the first and only positive auto surprises of the year for Tesla, we still believe matching last year's delivery number would be difficult to achieve. Tesla would have to grow 2H deliveries by around 6% YoY to hold volume flat.\n\n2. Inventory reduction, a $1.5b boost to working capital. Tesla delivered\n33k units more than it produced in 20, driving a 7-day reduction in days' supply of inventory (on a full calendar day basis) in the quarter. The 2Q inventory reduction substantially (but not fully) offsets the increase in inventory seen in 1Q (see chart). At an ATP of $45k/unit this, by itself, drives a $1.5bn working capital inflow during the quarter - higher than the $600mm tailwind we have expected. Our 2Q forecast for $0.9b FCF burn looks incrementally more conservative following this print.\n\n3. Energy storage deployments. A 'show stealer' from today's update is the all-time record high stationary storage number (9.4 GWh) for 2Q which is nearly 2x our forecast. As Gen Al acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand, electricity generation, and data center investment, we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the US electric grid accelerated by the Al boom.\nTesla getting its mojo back? Little more than 2 weeks ago our clients were preparing for shareholders to reject Elon Musk's 2018 comp package potentially setting up a change of management and strategy, compounding many months of negative newsflow. Fast forward to today, clients are beginning to ask us about positive catalysts into 2Q results and beyond.

Because of that, it should go down.\"\n\nThe people with money don't give a shit what ya'll think about Elon.\n\nThey care about opportunity in the market.\n\nThis report is all about Tesla showing resilience in a tough EV market. IDK if you guys have been paying attention or not but EV's aren't exactly a hot commodity as much as ICE vehicles in the North American market. Tesla has had to do price cuts and offer many incentives to push sales. Again, this is a strategy shift by Tesla that shows resilience because they operate at a profit. Do you think Ford/VW and other automakers can drop EV prices the way Tesla can when they are already burning billions of $? Another issue is China competition. China's whirlwind economy and no shortage of EV competitors were expected to eat away at Tesla's sales but Tesla just had their best June in China and is keeping up with vehicle deliveries for the year.\n\nComing into this year, Elon had already stated that sales would be roughly the same as year 2023. Again, tough EV market. ICE and Hybrid vehicles are just easier to sell in this environment. People aren't going to want to try something new when their bank account isn't looking as disposable. \n\nYou hear people talking about Tesla selling fake shit to pump the stock. Look, I'm not a fan of Elon overpromising and underdelivering on new products/services. And you'd have a point if Tesla was the only company he runs. But an even more successful (based on engineering feat) company he runs is SpaceX. SpaceX recently launched the largest space rocket into outer space in human history. Oh, and it's reusable. So all of you guys saying Tesla is selling something fake, just explain to me if SpaceX is also fake. NASA pays SpaceX for transport to space. They sign billion dollar contracts to SpaceX all the time. Not because SpaceX is another pump-and-dump scheme but because no other company can do what SpaceX does. Starlink went from $1 billion in revenue in 2022 and is expected to do $6-7 billion in 2024. They're securing massive contracts with cruise/airline/transporting companies.\n\nAgain, you'd have a point about Elon being a scammer if SpaceX didn't exist. Unfortunately, SpaceX does exist. It's also the most valuable private company in the world right now with no shortage of investors looking to purchase a stake. Worth over $200 billion. Half of Elon's networth is actually from SpaceX. So the guy is clearly doing something right.\n\nNot a single sane person is investing into Tesla because it's just a car business. That's what YOU are treating it as. That's like saying people invested into Amazon in 2017 because of their e-commerce store. No, what people were investing into was Amazon collecting the data and now becoming an advertising giant and their AWS cloud - two things investors in 2015 probably never expected. A significant part of investing in tech companies is to allow the innovation to grow and materialize. That can take many years. \n\nI sure as hell would not invest in Tesla if all they did was did and plan on doing was to sell vehicles. The auto business is low growth, low margin, and very capital-intensive. It seems like Elon realized this very early on and shifted his focus. That's why Tesla went from Tesla Motors to Tesla - because Elon didn't want Tesla to just be an auto company.\n\nLastly, I'll just say this, way smarter people than any of us are tasked with evaluating Tesla for their firm and fund. I guarantee you these people are NOT evaluating Tesla solely as a car company. They are betting on Tesla and they have billons of $ on the line. They are doing their due diligence. The only people who are treating Tesla as a car company are the very same people who would have never invested in Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Meta, etc., in the earlier days before they became behemoths and are now saying these are the absolute best investments to make in the market. And then there are people who dislike Elon politically and that basically means they will never support an Elon-product. If that's you, I completely understand.

That's how they learn and improve, and their willingness to do that is one of the primary reasons they have progressed so quickly.\n\nFalcon 9 has had a single failed launch in its history - out of something like 350 launches. That was back in their very early days, during CRS-7. This was their 7th actual operational launch, and they were sending supplies to the station. A strut broke inside the rocket, which caused helium to flow into a liquid oxygen tank. This overpressurized the tank and caused it to burst, which blew the rocket up.\n\nEven with that failure, the Dragon capsule activated its launch abort system. Had it been programmed to deploy its parachutes, it would have survived. As it was an unmanned capsule carrying perishable supplies, there was no real point in trying to protect the cargo in this event, so the chutes were not deployed.\n\nThe only other failure in the company's entire history was their first ever mission, CRS-1. During this mission, they successfully delivered supplies to the station, completing their primary objective. However, they were also carrying a small secondary payload that was going to be deployed. An engine on the first stage of the rocket shut down early, which caused the second stage to need to burn more propellant to reach orbit. This left the second stage with less propellant than expected, leaving only a 95% chance of successfully raising the orbit of the secondary payload to deploy it in a higher altitude than the station. NASA requires a greater than 99% chance of success to allow such an operation, so they were forced to cancel the second stage's second burn.\n\nWith 361 Falcon 9 launches and only a single failed launch, Falcon 9 has a 99.7% success rate. Even counting the CRS-1 mission as a failure that would still put them at a 99.4% success rate. Falcon Heavy has a 100% success rate, with 10 total launches.\n\nRussia's Soyuz-U rockets have a 97.3% success rate, with 22 failures over 786 launches (they started back in 1973). The newest version of Soyuz has launched 55 times since 2001.. a rather small number compared to Falcon 9, but it has also had a 100% success rate.\n\nOverall, SpaceX has one of the best track records of any launch provider.

Snapchat's basically sitting on the largest and fastest-growing collection of almost certainly not legal pornographic material known to man, second only to the FBI's own crime labs. A single, fruitful breach of these archives, and it's joever for not just consumer and investor confidence, but also the company due to the fucking tidal wave of lawsuits and class actions they'll face, assuming they can even hide behind S230 and laws like it at that point. Just because the sender and recipient don't have the image anymore, doesn't mean Snapchat doesn't still have it stored on their end. There's also a very real risk of these photographs being leaked or accessed inappropriately (whether intentionally or unintentionally) by engineers and/or vendors, which is a massive Achilles heel for the company in the long-term. You can't put that genie back in the bottle once its out.\n\nAs for its userbase, it's still fucking huge, especially with Zoomers and older GenAlphas, but as many have pointed out, it's losing steam to TikTok and other shortform user-created content delivery systems. There's also very limited financial growth potential, given that Premium simply doesn't offer enough value for money to justify the cost. The AI is neat, but very few people in Snapchat's most dedicated user demographics will ever use it more than a couple times, let alone pay for the upgrade. The other convenience and premium features offered are laughable, considering the core userbase (minors) isn't likely to pay for a \"free app\" unless they get something flashy out of it. Snapchat Premium doesn't really exist as \"status symbol\" like other upsells present in platforms popular with minors do (Fortnite Skins, Roblox cosmetics, etc)\n\nOn the bullish side, as mentioned above, there's still a fucking massive userbase and it thus offers an enticing platform for advertising and data collection, though minors are a large portion of this userbase so the upside here is limited by law, but there's still a lot of room for upgrades that can be made given that the app incentivizes users to use it daily, if not several times a day, and this is an obvious avenue for monetization or increased advertising time. Not only that, it's instantly recognizable as a brand, with good sentiment behind it among the general public. Very few people have an overall negative opinion of Snapchat compared to Meta's offerings, or the soon-to-be-illegal TikTok. This lack of negative sentiment allows for SNAP to potentially pivot their target demographics or diversify their core product to be more broadly appealing. Snapchat could do something similar to Meta's Messenger and add a way to process payments natively between users, possibly through a partnership with a preexisting fintech vendor, like Cash App. This would let the app carve a niche for ecommerce (through cloning TikTok Shop, etc) as well as letting Snapchat reap a wider profit margin from the adult content creators on their platform.\n\n***In the here and now****,* I'm pretty sure they'll meet or exceed earnings for a little bit. Summer's in full swing and kids aren't seeing their friends in school, so they communicate through apps like Snapchat, etc. Even if they dip and miss this earnings, they'll almost certainly meet or exceed them next go around.
