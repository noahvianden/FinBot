{"title": "Slow Down", "selftext": "No need to listen to me, but I do feel compelled to write this. \n\nThere is a lot of hysteria right now with this stock. I just read a post about someone buying big, and high, on leverage. \n\nI’ve heard of people using loans, and home equity lines. I’ve seen others selling other quality stocks to buy this is mass. I’ve also seen many saying they are 100% invested in NVDA. \n\nMy advice would be to slow down. \n\nI have learned the hard way. Shit happens. \n\nDo I believe in this stock? Yes, very much so. But for the long term. \n\nDon’t lose your senses hoping to cash in on the gold rush. Can you make money here? Yes, of course. But is the potential gain worth the risk many of you are taking? \n\nNo, it’s not. Especially now. The massive gains already happened. \n\nStay cool. Make slow decisions. DIVERSIFY. \n\nThis is a marathon and not a sprint. Things can surely go up a lot. I’m hoping they will. But it’ll take time. \n\nSo much can happen. Both interval and external events can have massive effects on how this plays out. \n\nDo what you will. But I truly hope some of you heed this advice. I hope you benefit from it. This is just the latest craze and will eventually even out. \n\nAs it stands, things are very volatile for a reason. Slow it down. Make long term decisions. \n\nWritten by a guy with a fair amount of wisdom, based on a lot of regret. \n\nGood luck. \n\nEdit to add: some of you clearly don’t get the meaning of this post. It’s not about buying or selling…today. It’s about investing in a thoughtful manner. \n\nThis post wasn’t timed based on what a lot of you are calling a “dip”. That’s exactly the point. \n\nAnd if you think yesterday was a bloodbath, this post is meant exactly for you. I hope you learn from it. But I’m confident you won’t.

This dangerously obvious outcome is why most people simply let a falling knife drop to the floor. The analogy with the market is that if you try to buy stocks that are in a sharp decline, you are essentially trying to do something stupid, like trying to catch a sharp falling knife with your bare hands.\n\n**Stocks can Become ‘Falling Knives’**\n\nThe term “falling knives” refers to stocks that have a precipitous drop in value, and in most instances such a sharp decline will likely continue, even if these stocks seem tempting to buy.\n\nStocks receive this moniker because they can cause real damage to an investment portfolio, if an investor continues to pour money into them during their ongoing decline, hoping for their recovery.\n\n**Doubling Up on Falling Stocks**\n\nAn all-too-common investment mistake is buying stocks because they have fallen a lot in value. After all, if a stock recently hit an all-time high of $100 per share and it is now trading at $60, it seems destined to return to that high price, doesn’t it?\n\nThe truth can be hard to hear. Just because a stock has hit a price at some point in the past is no guarantee that it will ever reach those lofty levels again. Many investors have wreaked havoc on their portfolios trying to chase these types of “falling knives” by doubling up their investment, as a stock continues to go down, down, and down some more.\n\nWhile it’s true that the market as a whole has always eventually gone on to make new highs after selling off, there are plenty of stocks that will never see their all-time high again.

Netflix’s stock has been uplifted in recent quarters by its push to gain subscribers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier, in addition to its crackdown on password sharing.\n\nThe company has also begun adding live sports, such as NFL games on Christmas Day over the next three years, a move that will likely attract more ad dollars for the streamer.\n\nNetflix had roughly 270 million global subscribers at the end of the first quarter, up 16% from the same period in year prior and surpassing expectations.\n\nWhen Netflix made its pitch to advertisers during its Upfront presentation in May, the company said its ad-supported tier had amassed 40 million global monthly active users, nearly double the figure it had shared months earlier.\n\nLast quarter Netflix warned investors it would stop providing quarterly membership numbers or average revenue per user beginning next year, noting the company is “focused on revenue and operating margin as our primary financial metrics -- and engagement (i.e. time spent) as our best proxy for customer satisfaction.”\n\nThis decision showcases Netflix’s “pivot from a high-growth, low-profit business to a slow-growth, high-profit business,” according to an analyst note from Wedbush last week. However, the note emphasizes that although Netflix has a big lead ahead of its competitors when it comes to the streaming business, that pivot “is far from complete.”\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/18/netflix-nflx-earnings-q2-2024.html", "id": "1e6kptq", "created_utc": 1721333121.0, "score": 406, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 185, "comments": [{"body": "question is how much more can they raise their prices before people just stop subscribing", "score": 455, "replies": [{"body": "That's been the case for majority of companies out there for the last couple of years. \n\nThe likes of McDonalds, Starbucks, Nike etc. seem to have hit the ceiling and their customers are basically starting to say f off. \n\nI think this push to lower tier and raising prices are just their way to squeeze the last drops out of their customers before they start eventually leaving.", "score": 237, "replies": [{"body": "McDonald’s and Starbucks are different.

Executive positions are drastically fewer in number and most of their compensation (including bonuses) is typically in the form of equity/options. It's not something the company is really 'paying' for - the stockholders (owners) are implicitly paying for their compensation.

Not to mention that UK/France would have to further build out their own arsenals. \n\nLike I said, proliferation is a terrifying and horrific idea. They are not easy weapons to develop and produce. It can lead to a runaway arms race that puts the whole world at greater risk for war with much higher stakes.

It provides a huge portion of the funding but the joint operations as well as strategic command and control are just as important as the equipment. Europe proliferating nuclear weapons would just provide more fuel to the fire as it creates even more uncertainty about command and control of those WMDs. Also, you think France and the UK will enter a nuclear engagement if Poland gets invaded? Not a chance unless there's a mutual defence pact like, I dunno, NATO. Impenetrable strength comes from resources and resolve of the collective, not the individual state.\n\nIf Trump wins and NATO is disbanded, Europe is in trouble no matter what. That is why there is a lot of talk about Russia waiting until a possible Trump second term. I don't see NATO going away, but I see Trump trying to minimize it in order to de-legitimize it. This may force European countries to pick up the slack and increase their defence budgets but under no circumstances should each European country have their own nuclear arsenal. Each country already has their own conventional forces to defend against a conventional invasion, but nuclear war is a completely different game. It is literally impossible to \"win\" a nuclear engagement.  All the nuclear-armed nations know this and it is the reason for the launch-on-warning policy employed by the US and the dead-man's hand used by the Russians. If one nuke is used in combat, they will all eventually be used by definition of these policies and the world literally ends as we know it.\n\nIn a perfect world, NATO waits out the Russian oligarchy and maintains a forceful front in Eastern Europe until the Russians collapse yet again under the mafia state. Russia can't and won't last forever in its current form, but strong partnerships and alliances like NATO will. The ultimate goal is to enter into a disarmament phase long term to eliminate or at least minimize to an acceptable level the ramifications of a rogue nuclear weapon being used.\n\nNATO didn't disappear under Trump V.1. It won't under Trump V.2 if it comes to that. The stakes are too high and even Trump and the Republicans wouldn't be able to pull that off.

Chicks dig guys that are physically healthy.\n\n2) Get an education. Chicks dig guys with masters degrees.\n\n3) Get a hobby, but try to pick a good one. Video games, gym and collecting doge coins aren't good enough hobbies to stand on their own, so you need something more classy. Chess, specific sports (hockey, wall climbing, etc.), photography, playing an instrument, cooking are better examples.\n\n4) After you've done all the previous steps, which could take multiple years to begin with, you can try finding woman. They are usually never in your apartment unless you have arranged for it previously, in which case you already have a woman and can stop here. Dating apps are really depressing, but they sometimes get you a date, and importantly they give you a lot of practice in talking to woman. In person classes, the gym, bars and flower filled meadows give you good opportunities for finding women IRL.\n\n5) Once you have located a womans, for example at a bar, try approach her in a way that feels comfortable for yourself. You can tell them that they have nice hair and that you would love to suck on their toes, with their permission. If that doesn't work, start crying and tell them how lonely and touch starved you are. This will likely make them feel uncomfortable and they will try to console you. This is good, since she is still talking to you. Recite love poetry - I recommend Ovid's Ars Amatoria, since it's from the Roman times and chicks dig the Roman empire. If she has to go to the bathroom a few minutes into you reciting love poetry, tell her you'll escort her there to make sure she's safe and not to lose track of her. And don't like ''offer'' to escort her there, ''tell'' her you will. That will make you seem more confident, and chicks dig confident men. If all goes well, once you get to the bathroom, compliment her physique and ask her for a blowjob.

{"title": "RDDT is going to crush its next 2 earnings and you are overlooking it", "selftext": "**\"B-but reddit sucks and fuck spez... amirite?\"** Yeah yeah yeah, it's super cool to hate on Reddit as a Redditor.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that you are using the platform right now, and YoY daily active users increased by 37% as of the first RDDT earnings call.\n\n**\"But Reddit has never made a profit\"** \\- Yes, low expectations are why this is an opportunity, dumbass. As dumb as it sounds, Reddit has never *tried* to be profitable. This is changing as they are now a public company with fiduciary responsibility.\n\n1. **Advertising -** RDDT's huge investment in improving their advertising technology for advertising customers is beginning to manifest. They are beginning to **finally** enable effective target marketing based on user interests, demographics, etc. **Remember, Reddit user interests and hobbies are neatly sorted into what subreddits they are subscribed to, visit, and their comment history.** I can feed an AI a Reddit user's comment history and it will create a pretty accurate profile of their interests, hobbies, age, location, and problems. **This is a medium absolutely RIPE for advertising, and Reddit's recent partnership with OpenAI WILL be leveraged for both target marketing and advertisement creation.**\n2. **Reddit marketing campaign -** Reddit's marketing campaign to get companies advertising on Reddit is in full force. Ads are beginning to swarm Facebook and Instagram. I believe that based on the companies I've seen advertising on Reddit recently (Apple, Samsung, HIMS, small businesses, and much more) that it has been effective at gaining customers. I've been seeing a few different variations of this ad, utilizing common subreddit slang. For example, this one uses the LPT template. I saw another that was ELI5:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hju0obs9cadd1.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=f50e0d1c611f535c8cea5f72456bd265c9b33b67\n\n3. **Reddit user growth 37% YoY -** Reddit's partnership with Google is serving up Reddit to normies in swathes. People who might not have been aware of it have been using it for research, opinions, hobbies, etc. Many of these people will, and are, being pulled in as full reddit users. **I caught my normie wife using reddit for her crafting hobbies and pregnancy products research. People are appending \"reddit\" to their Google searches because they crave authentic human discussion**. This is not even mentioning short term catalysts for people visiting reddit for human discussion: *2024 US presidential election and associated turmoil*\n\n4. **Reddit user demographics -** Reddit is inherently commercial. People discuss purchases, hobbies, and interests constantly. Its users are also largely high income individuals in 1st world countries between the ages of 18 to 40. This is the most valuable demographic for advertisers, as these people actually have discretionary spending ability.\n\n5. **Reddit's moat and competitive advantage** \\- Reddit's collection of communities and cultures spanning almost every interest has kept it growing steadily for over a decade. No other single platform beats it for ANY individual to find several communities that meet their interests in one place, share news, participate in authentic human discussion, and access a treasure trove of questions asked by users over the past decade. Reddit doesn't always have the best answers to questions, but its discussions are largely real people sharing honest opinions, and that has a lot of value.\n\n\\-----------Long term bull cases----------\n\n6. **AI Data Deals** \\- AI is getting more advanced and will rapidly continue to do so for the next decade. Reddit contains 15 years of human discussion on every topic imaginable, and it is constantly building its data for every fresh topic. This is a valuable data source for LLM training, and there could be growth in this sector. **\"B-But pizza glue\" -** We are still in the early stages, and the pros will outweigh the cons long term.\n\n7. **Reddit Marketplace** \\- It's only a matter of time before reddit facilitates C2B and C2C transactions for its many hobbies and interests. There is money to be made there.\n\n8. **Acquisition** \\- If big tech decides to acquire reddit for any number of good reasons, you win as a shareholder as they will pay a premium.\n\n9. **International expansion and AI translation -** Reddit is investing heavily in using AI to translate all content as human readable across all languages, with the goal of connecting people internationally and expanding its audience internationally. There is a shit ton of money to be made internationally and it is only a matter of time before this occurs. **Here is a courtesy timestamped link to a recent interview where the CEO discusses this:** [https://youtu.be/xJn\\_0cFPw0g?si=SiCXCOt573DB8kOW&t=782](https://youtu.be/xJn_0cFPw0g?si=SiCXCOt573DB8kOW&t=782)\n\n**\"When is the next earnings call?\"** \\- August 6th. I think this has the potential to crush, and the following one in early November will have even more potential.\n\n**Similar company valuation comparison:** I believe the following valuations are FAIR for how much revenue has been reported recently, but I believe it does not account for what will be a big surge in RDDT revenue. Reddit will easily meet the valuation of Pinterest, making it 3x. Longer term, I see 8x-10x.\n\n**RDDT - 10.6bil**\n\n**PINTEREST - 28bil**\n\n**SNAP - 24bil**\n\n**\"Okay bitch then post positions or GTFO\"**\n\n176 shares:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/Ne4XX5t](https://imgur.com/a/Ne4XX5t)\n\n4 call options: 1/17/25 expiry 80 strike price\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/WJcVtkL](https://imgur.com/a/WJcVtkL)\n\n**DONT SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU**\n\n\n\n10/29 edit: I warned you :)", "id": "1e6cgno", "created_utc": 1721312012.0, "score": 185, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 167, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 60 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 11 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So their business is advertisements and AI?\nSo....this is basically META 2.0?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Comparing to Pinterest and Snap valued at 28 and 24b is what has convinced me to hold.
