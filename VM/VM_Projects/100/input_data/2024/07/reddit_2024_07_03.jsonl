Known for its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) and innovative contributions to artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA has been a driving force in the tech industry. Recently, NVIDIA's stock has been making headlines, showing impressive growth and catching the attention of investors worldwide. Let's dive into the factors fueling this surge and why you should keep an eye on this tech giant.\n\n#### The AI Revolution\n\nOne of the primary drivers behind NVIDIA's stock performance is its leadership in the AI space. As industries across the globe increasingly adopt AI technologies, the demand for powerful GPUs has skyrocketed. NVIDIA's GPUs are not just about gaming anymore; they are the backbone of AI applications, from autonomous vehicles to advanced data analytics. The company's latest AI-focused products, like the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, have set new benchmarks in performance, making NVIDIA an indispensable player in the AI revolution.\n\n#### Gaming and Beyond\n\nWhile AI is a significant growth driver, NVIDIA's roots in gaming remain a strong pillar of its success. The gaming industry has experienced exponential growth, especially during the pandemic, with more people turning to gaming for entertainment. NVIDIA's GeForce RTX series continues to dominate the gaming market, offering unparalleled graphics and performance. Additionally, the company is expanding into new areas such as cloud gaming with its GeForce NOW service, ensuring it stays ahead of the curve.\n\n#### Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions\n\nNVIDIA's strategic partnerships and acquisitions have also played a crucial role in boosting its stock value. The company's acquisition of Arm Holdings, a leader in semiconductor design, is a game-changer. This move positions NVIDIA to leverage Arm's extensive ecosystem and innovation, potentially transforming the landscape of the semiconductor industry. Furthermore, partnerships with tech giants like Microsoft and Google to integrate NVIDIA's AI and cloud computing capabilities further solidify its market position.\n\n#### Financial Performance\n\nNVIDIA's impressive financial performance is a testament to its strategic vision and execution. The company's revenue growth has been robust, driven by strong demand in gaming, data center, and professional visualization segments. For the fiscal year 2024, NVIDIA reported a record revenue of $26.91 billion, a significant increase from the previous year. This financial strength has not only attracted investors but also instilled confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects.\n\n#### The Future of NVIDIA\n\nLooking ahead, NVIDIA shows no signs of slowing down. The company is poised to continue its dominance in the AI and gaming sectors, while also exploring new frontiers like the metaverse. NVIDIA's Omniverse platform, which enables virtual collaboration and simulation, is gaining traction and could revolutionize industries from entertainment to engineering. As NVIDIA continues to innovate and expand its reach, its stock is likely to remain a hot topic among investors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNVIDIA's stock surge is not just a fleeting trend; it is backed by solid fundamentals and a clear vision for the future. From its leadership in AI and gaming to strategic acquisitions and partnerships, NVIDIA is well-positioned to maintain its upward trajectory. For investors and tech enthusiasts alike, keeping an eye on NVIDIA's developments could provide valuable insights and opportunities.

They are expected to have a megapack factory in China to be operational next year. There is over a billion $ in Tesla's energy storage profit that isn't yet recognized because of accounting reasons that Tesla could book as 100% profit this year as the contingencies are met. I am very bullish on Tesla Energy. It is playing a very significant role for Tesla and is largely being discounted by people who are just focused on vehicle sales.\n\nWhat intrigues me is people are going to blame the stock price on Elon's politics.

We plan to scale our existing production-ready GenAI models from Nevada to Kansas while introducing newer models and use cases.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "having a bunch of people over tomorrow for dinner so im doing it up!\n\nwas at costco and they had these giant foot long beef ribs. i got so damn many\n\ndecided to prepare them as i would a steak in some ways. seasoned them super well after silvering them all which took a damn hour, letting them dry out on a rack in the fridge over night. i decided to go a little experimental and mix american bbq with Korean bbq. so the dry rub has Korean bbq seasoning & gochujang soaking in all night. i also made a spicy vinegar based bbq sauce but also added a Korean twist to that. \n\ntheyll be mopped with the sauce before being reverse seared suuuuuper low in the oven until they hit 100 degrees or so. then when people come ill toss them on an ultra hot coal grill and sauce them a few more times and pull a dark sear. think im going to sprinkle on some sesame seeds at the end as an omage to that korean style\n\nalso marinating and grilling up a bunch of shiitake mushrooms, and making a side of aglio e olio pasta \n\nohh and for the appetizer i take slices of fresh sourdough, brush them with olive oil on both sides, top each one with fontina cheese, grilled asparagus, and truffle oil, then put them on the grill till it all melts together and the toast is crispy\n\ntheres also an apple salad and some veggies and crap but that’s not as interesting \n\nok i gotta sleep now ✌🏻", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Which LLM generates these for you?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "😂😂😂😂😂", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "beep boop, ur mom", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "LOL My mom is indeed a very **L**LM harharhar", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "🤤 ", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm glad I don't yet feel the need to do this when friends come over  \nI offer them whatever drinks I happen to have on hand, and might buy some basic snacks", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It’s definitely a modern millennial thing, I’m not trying to trash it but I think there’s a ton of pressure from social media to kind of “keep up with the joneses” in terms of a good time.

This is pure misinformation being spread, constantly. \n    \nRepublics and democracies are not mutually exclusive. Literally all \"republic\" means is that you don't have a monarchy, your head of state is a non-monarch, like a President, for example. You don't have a king or queen or emperor or tsar or whatever. The president may be elected, or may be appointed (like by the other politicians in government for example), but they don't inherit the position based on who their parents are, like monarchs do. \n     \nThe US is a democracy and has always been a democracy for its entire existence. Even when only wealthy white male landowners could vote, that's still a form of democracy. The existence of the electoral college, and the fact that each state gets 2 senators each, does not mean that the US isn't a democracy.\n   \nYou can have a democratic republic, like the US, or you can have a democratic monarchy, like the UK. And you can have a non-democratic republic, and a non-democratic monarchy.\n   \nBut the fact that the US is a republic does not mean it's not a democracy for fuck sake. Its not a ***DIRECT*** democracy, but direct democracies are not the only form of democracy.\n  \nWhat the US is is a representative democracy. Instead of a direct democracy where every citizen votes on every bill, you elect people to do it for you. There's been very very few direct democracies in history, because they're unfeasible outside of tiny city states. You can't have an entire country the size of the US, or even the size of somewhere like the UK or Belgium, be a direct democracy. It just doesn't work, there's too many things that need to be voted on daily, and so nobody would bother to vote 99% of the time because they have work to go to and kids to raise and so on. So it'd be pointless, since the vast majority of things would be voted on by a fraction of a percent of people anyway.\n  \nThat's where referendums come in.

The last two presidential terms have generated exponentially higher debt versus US GDP than ever. Enough that on current projections, half of every dollar collected by Uncle Sam will go to paying the interest on the debt within 4 to 6 years. Already, all discretionary spending is borrowed. Within 10 years, every cent collected by Uncle Sam goes to servicing the interest on the debt. \nAlready, social programs have outgrown military spending. \nThe only routes are to cut spending more than in history, invent something on the level of nuclear fusion, or a global conflict.

You should let them accumulate.\n2. If you expect to gamble to have more than enough, then just gamble enough. It's not that hard! You have enough set aside in the event your gamble fails and you can pay it off, you use a foreign account that can't be very well audited outside of the Western Hemisphere, or you actually studied the law and regulations that pertain to each country and their functions!\n3. Companies will always bounce back, unless you have a catastrophic scenario in which you can only rely on the currency involved in physical cash to pay for what is needed. If you have a bank, did yourself the task of ensuring you have enough, and ATM machines still operate in such a situation, then you'll be fine! \n4. Why is everything you're talking about meant to convince anyone, any person, or individual to go ahead and change what they've already learned throughout history as it pertains to trading shares? Is it to help you benefit, the government, the change in currency between the USA's and the Yuan; is it designed for me to stop trying to focus on having my own piece of land?

{"title": "$DIS Disney is at a once in a decade buying opportunity", "selftext": "This is the weekly chart for $DIS. Each candle represents one week of trading and the chart goes back to 2010.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wqkuxf0ldad1.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=33e19b58c9f5fa193d355ad551aca96a5061c85c\n\n$DIS has been in a clear uptrend for more than a decade, until the 2022 bear market showed up, inflation and the mini recession wrecked the stock market and $DIS in particular. \n\nThe dark green line is the 80-week moving average. Which represents the average weekly closing price of the last 80 weeks.   \nWhenever this moving average is trending up, the equity in question is in an uptrend and vice versa.\n\nNotice how the moving average trended down for nearly two years between 2022 and 2024.\n\nSince the beginning of the year it flattened and has actually been slowly curling up.\n\nOnce price breaks above this moving average and comes back to it, it's called a breakout and backtest setup.\n\nThis is an incredibly bullish setup with high odds of success. It gives buyers one final chance of entering after the first major breakout.\n\nNow I want you to take a closer look at the volume. Notice how weekly volume has actually been declining as the price has been dropping throughout the last 3 months. This is exactly what you want to see. You want to see sellers less and less interested as the price drops and then you want to see volume expand once buyers are back in and price is trending higher.\n\nENTRY :  \nNow, let's talk about timing the entry. Let's take a look at the zoomed-in portion in pink.  \nYou will notice that $DIS has a tendency to form a bull flag / bull penant / wedge structure and as soon as price breaks above the resistance level of this structure the stock rallies for several weeks.\n\nRight now we are in the middle of a 3rd one of these structures that hasn't broken out yet. The objective entry would be on the first breakout of this structure if you're looking to trade this aggressively.\n\nPersonally. I'm quite happy with the 80-week backtest and I don't want to wait for the breakout so I can buy it here while it's cheap..\n\nTARGET :  \nIf the stock simply retraces back to the middle of its long-term uptrending channel. That would translate to a rally upwards of $160 by the end of next year.\n\nThe December 2025 $120 leap call options are trading at $7.3. That means if the $160 target is realized by the end of 2025, those options will net $40 in profit. a 550% gain in 18 months.  \nIf the price target is realized earlier, those options will net even higher profit. And if $DIS exceeds this price target, again those gains would be much higher.  \nI like the Dec 2025 $120 calls because the far out expiration drastically reduces this risk of theta decay, and gives this setup plenty of time to realize the price target.\n\nKeep in mind that the full-measured move from this consolidation pattern actually puts $DIS at $150 by the end of this year. Which can return an excess of 2000% given how cheap the call options currently are. Just beware of the risk if you're trading this year's Dec expirations.\n\nGood luck regards.\n\n", "id": "1duqpbi", "created_utc": 1720044469.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 307 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsk34m/woof_woof_this_dog_is_about_bark_up_a_tree_a_big/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u446bu/long_amd_my_next_potential_10x_amd_trade/) \n**Account Age** | 8 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">inflation and the mini recession wrecked the stock market and $DIS in particular. \n\nI think their shitty movies and changing bosses every 5 minutes might have something to do with it", "score": 252, "replies": [{"body": "And having no new IP just changing skins on the same tired franchise.\n\nIm in shares.", "score": 42, "replies": []}, {"body": "and spending hundreds of millions on tv shows that don’t generate revenue", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "You do know Disney has zero clue they are making shit movies?", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Their Q1 Earnings Report actually hinted they were like \"*hey guys we suck shit but don't worry, we're going to be good now!!!*\" and............  fuckin' lmao at what they came up with\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndg6n2ijkead1.png?width=1395&format=png&auto=webp&s=75bfe97096592f9c98c27866c760cd916b9f1f0c", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "That’s cuz they have to be careful now so they won’t make anymore outdated cultural depictions and get sued.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Shitty movies can still make tons of money.
