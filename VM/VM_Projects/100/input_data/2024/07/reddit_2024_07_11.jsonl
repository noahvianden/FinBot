{"title": "Nike is a bargain right now ", "selftext": "Right now, these prices are an absolute fire sale. Maybe I missed the part where people are going to stop buying nike worldwide. Apparely Nike has less going for it than it did in 2018! I mean just look at this chart below that covers 10 years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iu6j7po4esbd1.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c1f26a35134503bac803a0e66745e0570dd984\n\nYou have a volume read of 129,996,982 on June 28th. Right now the markets are highly infactuated with tech stocks and things like TSLA or PLTR. Something boring like Nike is far from the excitement anyone is looking for as new ATH's are being made every day on QQQ or SPY. Theres nothing sexy about it at all. \n\nThis is where the best prices can be obtained. No one wants the stock. So few people  want the stock that they are willing to actually sell it at prices first seen May 25th 2018. Even in 2020 with a full blown pandemic breaking out with unknown consequences only saw Nike hang out below this price for a whopping 7 trading days. Lil trip down and V shape recovery. \n\nEven from a pure volume only perspective the following shows some interesting things: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bzv8typfsbd1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1d49c9ce85029ead6b011b9f6e80c6212a4aedc\n\nThe lowest volume day is about 15.95M for any day since the big drop. The volume on the day of the big drop is unprecedented. The 2nd highest volume day in the last decade was 12/23/2015. Hilariously almost around the same price! The high of that day back then was 68.20 and was a new all time high. \n\nThe difference with large volume down here is its the opposite. Large amounts of demand are showing up down here. In the past the big volume was correlated with being near big highs. But Nike wasnt even near its high right before it dropped either. \n\nSo what I would say is that finding a bottom is a matter of flushing people out. You gotta get to that point where even the most committed person who would have a 1% chance of selling pre earnings is now ready to and currently selling. Thats probably going on and we couldn't sport such volume down here if there wasn't some equal demand. The price has not moved much. You have a high there of 79.05 and we are down to about 72 now. \n\nLets just look at the actual income here: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xzur7vt5hsbd1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af40a030a7bcd30e707eced540bcd4b524d0718\n\nOver the last 10 years, the revenue is only going up. Even if the company is faltering so to speak, these prices are far from connected to the reality of actual income. \n\nCheck out the P/E below\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.macrotrends.net\\/stocks\\/charts\\/NKE\\/nike\\/pe-ratio](https://preview.redd.it/txpvgitihsbd1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c906deacc2aff197edbf483fb08d2f96ff77eb9)\n\nEven right here you can see that right now Nike is sporting a P/E that looks to be just over 20. But its actually even lower and this chart is delayed: \n\n[https:\\/\\/www.macrotrends.net\\/stocks\\/charts\\/NKE\\/nike\\/pe-ratio](https://preview.redd.it/clkllnaqhsbd1.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=1086c990d16ec783406e0232352d91dd436b1460)\n\nThe last time the P/E was under 18.30 was Nov of 2011...\n\n  \nNow heres what I do know. Alot of fund managers are going to be looking at these beautiful pictures over the coming weeks/months:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k89wawq9isbd1.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=584b84419187792d995cf8564dd1b2a8b2634a30\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rt6lldodisbd1.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=8be01e03ad07e2755ad782bb82ba9ede8386eaf3\n\nThey are going to potentially sell some of those wildly running high stocks. Then they will be sitting on some cash they need to find another play for. All of a sudden, seemingly out of nowhere on your favorite stock channel, all the analysts will be upgrading nike. Show hosts and guests will be talking about how the stock is too cheap and all that fun fancy stuff they do AFTER they bought the ol dippity skippity. They are going to have to do something with the money. They will see Nike. I doubt  they will just pass it up. \n\nSince  the fed hasnt cut rates yet, theres nothing to really worry about. Even when that happens markets should run a good 3-5% further before they tap out from whatever caused the fed to cut in the first place. \n\nNow lastly, what brought me to this trade idea at all? Adobe. How did Adobe lead you to see something in Nike? I remember 2022.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oj4sxjz7ksbd1.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=1865e6cf78f673a4d37ae4b46ff9aeb0e85f2271\n\nIn 2022, there was a big gap down and this brought Adobe to prices not 1st achieved since Sept of 2018. I passed this one up. I let the fear keep me out of the trade. Surely everyone who was selling was correct. Obviously thats the crowd that always wins. \n\nSince we are dealing with panic, lets get up close and examine how the panic works: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xrmmklaxksbd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=7998168ec3829f129b26d6c91fabde81a34a86d5\n\nThe day of panic was mid Sept and a bottom was put in over the  next two weeks. It did however fight against going higher. You can see that in those micro higher lows leading into mid Nov where it said goodbye to those lows permenantly. So quite clearly any attempts to make the stock run in the near term should be expected to be stamped out. Espeically if we see a run back up to 78. It will probably have to retest its low whatever it is a couple of times over the coming months. \n\nQuite clearly those retests whenever they happen SHOULD end higher on that day as they did with adobe there. That would be a sign of people buying the dip 10/10. \n\nIt won't happen overnight, but I do think the stock could fill its gap within the next 3-4 months. Even if things get \"bad\" around the election period, Nike already got the business. \n\nTLDR; Everyone hates Nike so you should love it long time. Thats all you really need to know.

A camera does not have the same dynamic range as the human eye and has to use one aperture to image the entire scene at once. Therefore, the camera absolutely struggles with high contrast. On a very bright day shadowed regions under overpasses or in alleys or behind street signs will show up as nearly black to the camera. Furthermore, a human can use their eyelids, their hands or use visors to block the sun or glare. They can move their head around to avoid said glare. A fixed camera cannot. Therefore sun or glare impinging on the camera sensor will wash out the image and blind it. Lastly, the human eyes are mounted to a head which can move around in 3 dimensional space to avoid dirt and debris on the windshield. A camera with a speck of dirt on it can be completely blinded.
