What matters more to you is that you can still sell and buy that new car you wanted to buy, renovate your house or go on an expensive cruise. And buying dips to get to a bigger profit may only yield a larger profit in a few years, and just looking at your portfolio that says that you have 600% profit is not the same as actually owning a new car.\n\nSo, there is a huge amount of selling potential for stocks like NVDA that at this moment is still dormant.
