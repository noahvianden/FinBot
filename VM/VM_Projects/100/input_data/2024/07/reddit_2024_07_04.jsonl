Then with a huge number of investors having bought NVDA at low values, around $20 to $40 who are sitting on massive paper profits, there won't be much appetite of buying dips when the market starts to decline. They will want to liquidate their NVDA shares, because they can always reenter the market later and liquidatring means getting to real profits.\n\nIf you have 500% profit, and it goes down to 450% profit and it is steadily declining day by day, you may not care all that much that selling only yields 450% profit. What matters more to you is that you can still sell and buy that new car you wanted to buy, renovate your house or go on an expensive cruise. And buying dips to get to a bigger profit may only yield a larger profit in a few years, and just looking at your portfolio that says that you have 600% profit is not the same as actually owning a new car.\n\nSo, there is a huge amount of selling potential for stocks like NVDA that at this moment is still dormant. The drop in market cap when the investors who made a massive profit start to liquidate will be huge. The market cap will drop by a lot more than the amount that investors will gain by liquidating.
