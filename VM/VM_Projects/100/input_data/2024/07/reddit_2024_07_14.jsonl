This is good.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out what drove you to open 134, 136, and 150 for August, but in the end, here you are.\n\nThis week is the biggest expiry in the context of gamma and delta over the remaining time. A standard ATM straddle for this Friday indicates +/—9 points, so from Friday's close, you're looking in a range of 120 to 137-ish.  This has a 68% chance of being in this zone, so who knows?\n\nI'm also showing the 8/16 OpEx is also +/- 23 points, which will take you from 105 to 152 with a roughly 68% chance of happening.  So, there may be a chance to get to 150.  This is the market's pricing of TODAY's view, and much can change in time.\n\nTHIS WEEK's expiry, the 7/19th monthly has some things going for you.\n\nFirst, you're in a call-dominated environment.  This means that under you there are a considerable amount of ITM calls, and also a large amount of OTM puts.  Why this matters to you is that this setup has CHARM, and charm will add deltas as time ticks on.  Call charm increases for ITM calls, and put charm decreases for OTM puts from a more negative number, also supporting an upward push.\n\nYour sails are being filled by charm contributions under the current price and current structure.  This will make the trader's book longer in delta, over time, and the Dealer's book will get increasingly shorter, resulting in them having to hedge flat by buying more NVDA or correlated instrument.  \n\nLook for sharp upward price movements in NVDA as we march through time to possibly see these Dealer footprints. \n\nI've generated two charm charts that are interactive.  When you click on this first one, you see that there is a significant amount of call charm that is ITM (on the left, green) and also some OTM put charm on the right (in the red).  As stated above, this is supportive as long as we don't collapse in price.\n\n[http://charts.gammaedge.us/charm\\_oi\\_3d\\_NVDA\\_0\\_60\\_2024\\_7\\_12\\_16\\_0\\_0\\_adedea83.html](http://charts.gammaedge.us/charm_oi_3d_NVDA_0_60_2024_7_12_16_0_0_adedea83.html)\n\nThis next chart is the net of those two call and put complexes:  \n\n[http://charts.gammaedge.us/net\\_charm\\_oi\\_3d\\_NVDA\\_0\\_60\\_2024\\_7\\_12\\_16\\_0\\_0\\_e5270955.html](http://charts.gammaedge.us/net_charm_oi_3d_NVDA_0_60_2024_7_12_16_0_0_e5270955.html)\n\nWhen you spin that visual around, you'll see that the critical downside levels are 120 and 125 to the low side, and 135 and 140 to the high side.\n\nIt will be easier to make progress above the 135/140 with some upside OTM call speculation, and if we get it, we could push higher saving your 134 and 136 trades.\n\nAgain, why this matters to you is that if call buyers step up and put holders get scared and close, adding long deltas to the NVDA complex will most likely push the price up.  It's hard to tell how high, because this is largely driven by the market dynamics in any given day.\n\nIF we take the 135 strike then that charm at 135 will flip to dominant ITM calls, and it too will be supportive.\n\nYou see where this could go.\n\nThe challenge for you is that the market is path-dependent and is also dependent on the structure that we're in at any given moment.  The current NVDA structure says that we could bounce between 125 and 135 quite easily for this week, so who knows if you'll get the launch pad to move forward and higher.\n\nGood luck and let us know how you fare.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Wow.

The % EM is this number x 100.\n\nThe price range is the % number \\* spot price, +/-\n\nRound up or down.\n\nExcel makes this easy.\n\n---------------\n\nCharm is a bit more complicated.  Let's do that in another response....", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "What is CHARM?\n\nIf your option is a sailboat, then CHARM is the breeze that fills your sails. Now, this breeze can be pushing you in the direction that you want to go, or it could be a headwind. \n\nCharm is the change in the delta of an option that is due to time decay.  Charm has two peaks:  one that exists above the spot price, and one that exists below the spot price. \n\nHere's a picture of a single contract, long call or put.  Long calls and puts have the same profile.  This specific image has a spot price at 5600, right where it crosses the x axis.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/OUNPICZ](https://imgur.com/a/OUNPICZ)\n\nShort calls and short puts flip that picture. This is important because ALL options have charm.  That means that they all contribute to changes in delta as time changes.  This change in delta is larger as time --> 0, and this can cause the price of the option to change. For a single contract, the left-hand side of the peak is the same height (magnitude) as the right side.  The \"change\" nets to zero for a single option and no others.  Not realistic, but you need to understand ONE option contract before you can consider 100's of thousands at once. This net-zero thing changes when we bring the option open interest (OI) surface to the game.\n\nWhen you bring the OI surface to the game, we have unequal numbers of puts and calls on each strike, for each expiry.  This impacts the net of CHARM, and it changes dramatically. To visualize this, here's an updated example for NVDA, as of the close tonight (7/15); these are interactive so spin them with your mouse:\n\n[http://charts.gammaedge.us/charm\\_oi\\_3d\\_NVDA\\_0\\_60\\_2024\\_7\\_15\\_16\\_0\\_0\\_a4483913.html](http://charts.gammaedge.us/charm_oi_3d_NVDA_0_60_2024_7_15_16_0_0_a4483913.html)\n\nThis view separates the calls on the left and the puts on the right. Each view is further separated into left and right sides:  green (ITM) and red (OTM). The spikes are strikes where charm is either helping support the NVDA complex (pointing upward) by adding deltas as time decays, or it is eroding the complex (pointing down) and removing deltas.\n\nIn this case, the peak that is below spot price gets amplified by these calls, and hence, that option complex has a large contribution from net call charm.  Although there is a \"balancing \" amount above the spot price, this balance can get upset by puts that are in the same strike range above spot, and this unbalanced the complex.\n\nNote that there are 4 weeks of expiries here but you only see the impact of this Friday's monthly.  This is because monthlies, especially on liquid stocks, are traded by the bigger boyz and gurls - retail trades weeklies but not nearly near the volume that we have for institutional players. These strikes can be netted against each other to produce a net charm chart:  \n\n[http://charts.gammaedge.us/net\\_charm\\_oi\\_3d\\_NVDA\\_0\\_60\\_2024\\_7\\_15\\_16\\_0\\_0\\_69fa2c01.html](http://charts.gammaedge.us/net_charm_oi_3d_NVDA_0_60_2024_7_15_16_0_0_69fa2c01.html)\n\nThis is a pretty important chart to the OP's problem.  S/he wants to get to 150 by August, and 134/136 soon. This net charm chart has a \"downward spike\" at the 135 strike that is pretty big, and it has 4 days to expiry (it's this Friday's expiry). It's quite possible that the OP may get to 135 (it's not a magnet, but it's effects are smaller the closer spot price gets to it).  By my eye, people are going to have to step up and really start buying NVDA to overcome that 135 charm. I also see that downward (delta-removing) strike at 130 for Friday.  This is also eroding deltas too.   \n  \nSo in the sailboat analogy, the spikes at 130 and 135 for this Friday are headwinds. The strikes at 120 and 125 are tail winds. When I spin the complex around in that net view, it looks pretty balanced. I think the OP is going to have a hard time getting above 135 this week, let alone 150. AFTER this week's expiry, things change. \n\nThat's a different analysis.\n\nHope you understand a bit more about charm.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for taking time and responding in detail, going to read few times to understand fully", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Close at your pre-planned profit or max loss target.\n\nWithout having targets and a trading plan then you are just gambling and will often lose . . .", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "A trading plan should include a lot of details, including whatever edge someone may have and use.", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "do yourself a favor and don't trade options because you don't have enough expertise, or discipline. and following someone else's methods is no guarantee of anything.", "score": 52, "replies": []}, {"body": "When were the 146 & 150 strikes ever ITM?", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "He probably meant “profitable” and “green” not actually ITM", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "And the fact that he doesn’t use the right terminology is a hint that he shouldn’t be trading options, especially when the potential loss is 10’s of thousands of dollars.", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yup.
