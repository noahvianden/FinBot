When you're doing that it doesn't matter what you buy, for as long as you're choosing good stocks or ETFs and Nvidia is definitely a good stock for the long run. Even if the price crashes right now and it loses 50% of it's value I believe it will eventually grow back up because the company is legit and not some coin with no value behind it. \n\nIf you're putting a lot of money in then you probably won't like the risk. In that case you would like to diversify your portfolio in which case you'd be better off with buying a bit of nvidia, a bit of meta, a bit of bitcoin, a bit of mastercard, a bit of sp500 and so on, since those are different types of stocks and some ETFs and that way your money is protetected from a crash in 1 industry. Meaning if the tech sector crashes and you lose money on nvidia and smci, then the market(sp500) might still be doing good overall and also your money in meta, mastercard, coke, bitcoin and so on is probably still gonna be growing. If crypto crashes then the other investments are safe.\n\nSo, if you're making a small initial investment(what is small is obviously dependent on your financial situation but let's say 500$) and you're going to contribute with 100$ every month then for the first couple of months it won't hurt if you only buy nvidia.

{"title": "Boeing to plead guilty to criminal fraud charge stemming from 737 Max crashes ", "selftext": "Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud charge tied to the fatal 737 Max crashes, the Justice Department said Sunday, months after U.S. prosecutors said the aerospace giant violated a 2021 settlement that shielded it from prosecution.\n\nUnder the deal, Boeing agreed to pay a $243.6 million fine. An independent compliance monitor would also be installed to oversee compliance at Boeing for three years during a probationary period. Boeing would also have to invest at least $455 million in compliance and safety programs, according to a U.S. prosecutors‚Äô court filing late Sunday. The plea deal requires the approval of a federal judge to take effect.\n\nBoeing also agreed for the board of directors to meet with crash victims‚Äô family members, under the agreement.\n\nThe plea deal offer forced Boeing to decide between a guilty plea and the attached terms, or going to trial, just as the company was seeking to turn a corner in its manufacturing and safety crises, pick a new CEO and acquire its fuselage maker, Spirit AeroSystems.\n\nThe guilty plea would brand the planemaker a felon and could complicate its ability to sell products to the U.S. government. About 32% of Boeing‚Äôs nearly $78 billion in revenue last year came from its defense, space and security unit.\n\n‚ÄúWe can confirm that we have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department, subject to the memorialization and approval of specific terms,‚Äù Boeing said in a statement.\n\nIn May, the Justice Department said Boeing had violated the 2021 agreement. Under that deferred prosecution agreement, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion, including an original $243.6 million criminal fine, compensation to airlines and a $500 million fund for victims‚Äô family members.\n\nThat 2021 settlement was set to expire two days after a door panel blew out of a nearly new 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines on Jan. 5. While there were no serious injuries, the accident created a fresh safety crisis for Boeing.\n\nThe U.S. accused Boeing of conspiracy to defraud the government by misleading regulators about its inclusion of a flight-control system on the Max that was later implicated in the two Max crashes ‚Äî a Lion Air flight in October 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. All 346 people on board the flights were killed.\n\nU.S. prosecutors had told victims‚Äô family members on June 30 that they planned to seek a guilty plea from Boeing, a plan family attorneys called ‚Äúa sweetheart deal.‚Äù\n\nPaul Cassell, a lawyer for victims‚Äô family members, said he plans to ask the federal judge on the case to reject the deal and ‚Äúsimply set the matter for a public trial, so that all the facts surrounding the case will be aired in a fair and open forum before a jury.‚Äù\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/08/boeing-to-plead-guilty-to-criminal-fraud-charge-stemming-from-737-max-crashes.html", "id": "1dy5jf3", "created_utc": 1720434545.0, "score": 684, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 131, "comments": [{"body": "244+455 million? 699 together, that's it?

They work on contingency, or getting a percentage of the winnings if the lawsuit is successful, typically 25% or so.\n\nFor example, suppose (1) someone was injured on my company's property, and (2) the injured person sued my company for $100,000, and (3) then they won the jury trial against my company (for the purposes of this example, set aside insurance settlements, which is often what happens).  If the injured person and attorney agreed to 25% contingency, the attorney gets $25,000 as their payment.  If the injured person had lost the lawsuit, the attorney would get $0.\n\n>\n\nWhat exactly would they be compensated for?\n\nThe attorneys in the Tesla case argue that they saved Tesla's shareholders from massive dilution of shares.   Tesla would have eventually had to issue hundreds of millions of new TSLA shares (more than 300 million) to Mr. Musk upon exercise of the options.  The attorneys say they should get approximately 10% of that savings, or 29 million shares, and that dilution of 29 million shares is better than dilution of 300+ million shares.\n\n>because that would be even way more outrageous than elons comp package.\n\nIt is outrageous.  The problem I have is that this situation was entirely foreseeable on Tesla's part.  Anyone with even basic experience with corporate matters would have immediately seen the conflict of interest and fiduciary duty problems -- these were obvious, not some obscure thing.\n\nTesla's board played the whole compensation deal like they were above the law, and some ambulance chasers exploited Tesla's incompetence to maximum effect.  The board fucked this up, and they should pay for it personally, not Tesla's stockholders.\n\nPeople like Robyn Denholm cashed out hundreds of millions in TSLA stock for essentially being stooges and brain-dead rubber stampers on behalf of Musk.

In today's digital age, the influx of automated or templated emails has indeed reached a point where distinguishing genuine human interaction from automated responses can be challenging. This phenomenon can lead to a sense of detachment and disinterest, as you mentioned, where one's eyes might just glaze over upon encountering such emails.\n\nThere are several reasons behind this growing trend of automated emails. Businesses aim to streamline communication, maintain consistency, and manage large volumes of customer interactions efficiently. Automated emails are designed to save time and resources while ensuring that the core message is delivered promptly. However, the downside is that these emails often lack the personal touch and nuance that comes from human-written communication.\n\nThe human brain is adept at picking up subtle cues in language, tone, and context that convey authenticity and empathy. When these elements are missing, as is often the case with automated emails, the recipient may feel a disconnect. This can lead to a lack of engagement and, as you pointed out, a tendency to become immune to such communications. The overuse of automation in emails can desensitize recipients, making it harder for genuinely important or relevant messages to stand out.\n\nFurthermore, the saturation of automated emails contributes to a broader issue of digital noise. With inboxes flooded with messages that range from promotional offers to transactional updates, individuals may develop a habit of skimming through emails or ignoring them altogether. This behavioral shift poses a challenge for businesses that rely on email as a primary mode of communication.\n\nTo combat this issue, companies need to strike a balance between efficiency and personalization. While automation has its place, incorporating elements of human touch can make a significant difference. Personalized greetings, customized content based on the recipient's preferences or past interactions, and a conversational tone can help make emails more engaging. Additionally, allowing for human intervention in critical touchpoints of the communication process can enhance the overall experience.\n\nUltimately, the goal should be to create a communication strategy that respects the recipient's time and attention while fostering a sense of connection and trust. By prioritizing quality over quantity and incorporating genuine human elements, businesses can improve their email engagement rates and ensure that their messages resonate with their audience.\n\nYour observation highlights a critical aspect of modern communication and underscores the need for businesses to adapt and evolve their strategies.
