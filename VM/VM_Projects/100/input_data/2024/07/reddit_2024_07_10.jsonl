While even 3-4 years ago I was able to pull off some riskless arbs, now they no longer work. Exchanges are also protecting MMs and even forced brokers to disallow sending riskless trades to the exchanges, which may be illegal because MMs themselves are able to make some trades without risk while colluding to  disallow others from doing the same, thus forcing everyone else to lose money. On a other hand, we need MMs to buy/sell options when there is no volume, because their systems can perfectly hedge after buying/selling any options.\n\nIn terms of ‚Äúregular‚Äù trading with risk, MMs are very sophisticated and also control the game as they‚Äôre able to adjust the volatility surface. I often see volatility going up in steps when a stock or index shoots up or down, due to MMs first limiting how much the IV goes up, then buying options themselves, then increasing IV to the higher extent where it should be. This way they can usually buy vol cheaper than everyone else, while knowing or planning to make it more expensive. So they practically can‚Äôt lose.\nThere are still some ways to get alpha out of options, but very few things work and are almost impossible to identify without backtests. Especially because you still have to allow for losses and just need to have confidence that you have specific edge that will let you be profitable statistically, and have to understand when and why you‚Äôre losing, and when you may win. Now I run pretty sophisticated scanners to find best options combos, and it would be very difficult for me to trade without them. Proper trades also take a lot of margin due to complexity of trades and large number of legs and contracts to balance things out, so aren‚Äôt accessible to most retail. OI and dealer gamma are meaningless to me, especially when they‚Äôre usually wrong, while I can get more information out of volatility surface itself (IV at every strike and expiry), as it offers more complete view of volatility levels and dealer positioning, Though then I have to compare it to historical vol surfaces, and determine what may happen next.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Oh hey, I thought i recognised your username!

It'll take a few dozen sweaty nerds and six months, then it'll take some serious financial incentive to get widespread adoption. The reason CUDA is where it is right now is that much of that tooling is built by grad students and sweaty nerds working with potato consumer hardware, and you can't do that with a radeon card, since AMD drops support for anything older than one generation, two if you're lucky. The hardware itself is super competitive, but if you don't do the bare minimum for the open source community to do the bulk of the work for you, they won't.\n\nAMD could make a firm commitment to do so, and release some cards priced at consumer level but with meaningful amounts of fast vram, it really wouldn't cost them that much, and they don't really have a meaningful enterprise GPU market that will be cannibalized by a product like that. A two slot, blower GPU with 48 gigs of HBM2 sold for at most 2k will probably still have a great margin compared to their most profitable consumer stuff from five years ago, and will convince every single enthusiast that can't afford enterprise shit to switch teams once it's time to upgrade. The compute of an RX 7900 XTX would be plenty for most enthusiasts, just slap on more and faster memory and put it in a more viable form factor. If they did that today, with a commitment to support that card for the next 10 years, Nvidia's software lead would be gone by the end of the year, and at that point they'll pretty much be competitive in the enterprise market as well, and only slightly cannibalized, because most high volume enterprise customers need way more compute (and density, and memory bandwidth) than a card like that could offer. At that point, Nvidia would have to slash their prices in half in order to stay relevant in the long term.\n\nSo the problem isn't that Nvidia's lead is just too insurmountable, it's that AMD and Intel are both too stupid and too stubborn to take that sort of risk, to protect an enterprise market which doesn't have enough volume to be worth protecting.", "score": -9, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

{"title": "Tesla will rally on the 8/8 Robotaxi reveal", "selftext": "[Position: a single $265 Call 3/25](https://imgur.com/a/6YExxsL)\n\nDespite this month's insane rally, I think Tesla is undervalued due to their insurmountable lead in real-world data collection for Full-Self Driving (FSD) training.\n\nTheir only competitor is Waymo, but Waymo's advantages are limited and can be easily copied by Tesla. Here is Waymo's approach to self-driving:\n\n* Taxis are limited to geo-fenced regions with high-resolution maps\n* If the taxi is stuck, a human driver will remotely take over with no indication to the passenger.\n* Dependent on very expensive sensors (i.e. lidar and radar)\n\nComparison of Fleet Size and Mileage:\n\n* Tesla fleet: 4,000,000  -- Waymo: 600\n* Miles driven: Tesla: >1.3 Billion -- Waymo: ~10-20 million\n\nWaymo does 50,000 paid trips per week in cities, but the growth potential of their AI is limited due to the relatively small, homogeneous training set. In my opinion, their main accomplishment is the illusion of proficiency created by these \"silent\" human interventions.\n\nWhen Tesla releases their robotaxi, they will be able to adopt all of Waymo's advantages, even the silent takeovers. Couple this with their insurmountable lead in training data (Over 1 billion hours of FSD data in all driving conditions/environments), and I think they will rapidly outshine Waymo.\n\nIn particular, I think the impact of the silent human takeovers cannot be overstated.  Tesla could easily adopt this and achieve essentially perfect self-driving overnight.  It will impress the general public and make the share price go up.\n\nI am eager to hear what you fucking idiots think.\n\nFor some background, I have used FSD daily for the last year and am massively impressed by its rate of improvement.  I bought the call option after I realized that most of the public thinks FSD is a fraud, impossible, or uninteresting.\n\nI am already at 460% return but I intend to hold until expiration.\n\n\nEDIT: If there's any smart people reading this, tell me what you think of the recent talent departure.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-ai-director-leaving-company-after-4-month-sabbatical-2022-07-13/\n\nEDIT2: lol its delayed to october", "id": "1e02f97", "created_utc": 1720634512.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 47 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e02f97/tesla_will_rally_on_the_88_robotaxi_reveal/) \n**Account Age** | 11 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why hasn‚Äôt tesla yet to obtain permission to do any self driving taxi service in any US city ?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "No, it is smoke and mirror", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Their robotaxi is still in development.

Any major auto can retrofit their lineup to add cheap cameras to bumpers and B pillars and be collecting billions of miles of data within a couple years. If a company like Hyundai/Toyota/VW retrofitted their lineup and sold 10-20M of those cars then within 2 years they would be collecting hundreds of billions of miles of data annually. The models themselves aren't the secret sauce as ML models are quickly commoditized. This is a much simpler approach then all the other competitors are taking so it will be easier for them to dumb down their hardware and retrain end to end models based on camera data.\n\nIf autonomous vehicles are truly as lucrative as Tesla investors think there will be tons of competitors copying their approach if it works.

The best they can do is sell more FSD subscriptions to existing customers and increase take rate on existing manufacturing capacity. I don't think that's enough to run away with anything.\n\nCompetitors don't need to build a data center. They can pay for time on existing cloud computing platforms with any of the massive cloud players (Amazon, Microsoft, Google). Two of which have top tier expertise in autonomous driving and are training their own systems (Google Waymo, Amazon Zoox).The biggest initial hurdle would be retrofitting manufacturing to integrate COTS cameras into their existing lineup of vehicles. That isn't a huge lift. So they could be collecting the data quite quickly if Tesla's approach is proven to work. If say Hyundai/Kia took 1 year to update manufacturing lines and they sell 7.5M vehicles per year then within 2 years they could have 7.5M vehicles collecting data and if the average vehicle is driven 13,000 miles per year that's 100B miles collected within 2 years.
