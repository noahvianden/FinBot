You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "1dvtyr1", "created_utc": 1720171808.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 173, "comments": [{"body": "Unemployment rate 4.1%, Exp. 4.0%, highest since Nov 2021\n\nPrivate Payrolls +136K, Exp. 160K, Last 193K\n\nGovernment payrolls +70K, Last 25K", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Odds continue to increase of a rate cut in September (there is no August meeting).

When the economy was sluggish enough to create deflation, the value of cash was on of the few assets that was rising. A lot of people invested in the stock market had margin accounts, and their borrowing to buy shares meant that they had to sell other assets at whatever price they could get to avoid getting wiped out in the market. And then they were often wiped out anyway.\n\nSo people who had assets outside of the assets that fell bought up a lot of things that had been devalued.

And because of a resulting glut of fiber in the years after the dot-com bubble burst, there was a severe overcapacity in bandwidth for internet usage that allowed the next wave of companies to deliver sophisticated new internet services on the cheap. By 2004, the cost of bandwidth had fallen by more than 90 percent, despite internet usage doubling every few years. As late as 2005, as much as 85 percent of broadband capacity in the United States was still going unused. That meant as soon as new “killer apps” were developed, there was plenty of cheap capacity allowing them to roll out to the masses.

My theory is that after seeing the poor performance and realizing that it basically needs a re-train for the model, they pushed the real 12.4 to 12.5 and in the meantime put out the strikingly-similar-to-12.3.6 V12.4.3 to get hands-free out there.\n\nI put this out there because 12.4.x is not much different from 12.3.x in any significant way.
