Ultimately I no longer hold Micron.\n\nWhat I learned is it is extremely hard to predict the supply/demand cycles for memory. Because memory is a commodity, the memory business is actually tough for three reasons:\n1. Prices for DRAM and NAND are deflationary in nature. Good for consumers; tough business for MU/Samsung/Hynix when they need to spend through Capex cycles while facing deflationary cycles. Micron has yet to reach peak gross margin like it did back in the 2018 cycle\n2. The cost basis (pay to play) for DRAM is now going require EUV. See point 1 on gross margins\n3. Semi cap (maybe not now because multiples are so high) are just higher quality companies in terms of gross margin, FCF, & product differentiation of not having to deal with commodity pricing. I hold the portfolio of LAM, KLA, ASML. Never selling. \n\nThe X factor maybe High Bandwidth Memory. I have since left the semi industry, but if you are long Micron you really have to believe HBM is going to be such a differentiated product that it can generate 60% gross margins and sustain those gross margin through the “winter cycles”\n\nKudos to Micron management though. Having seen them weather 2016, 2020 downturns, they are in much better financial shape in FCF and balance sheet than before.\n\nUltimately, it’s the commodity pricing reason and not having any ability to control cycles is the reason I’m no longer a share holder.

Several studies have analyzed the impact of stock splits on stock prices and found trends that indicate a typical pattern:\n\n1. **Short-term increase**: On average, stocks tend to see a price increase in the short term following a split announcement and the actual split. This increase is often attributed to the factors mentioned earlier, such as perceived affordability and increased liquidity.\n   \n2. **Long-term performance**: The long-term performance of stocks after a split can vary. Some studies suggest that stocks continue to outperform the market for a period after the split, while others indicate that the effect diminishes over time.\n\nFor instance, a study published in the “Journal of Finance” by Fama, Fisher, Jensen, and Roll in 1969 found that stock splits were followed by positive abnormal returns. More recent studies have generally confirmed these findings, though the magnitude and duration of the post-split performance can vary based on market conditions and the specific company.\n\nIt’s important to note that while historical trends can provide insights, they do not guarantee future performance, and each stock’s reaction to a split can be influenced by a variety of factors.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Nancy always wins!", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "All of us regards trying to (pretend) DD while Nancy printing money by rigging the game.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nancy is an ant in front of the nvda juggernaut", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Everyone in here is saying puts are a bad idea.
