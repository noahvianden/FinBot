What you want is more money, which aligns with your response. I’m sure what you want is simpler than your current retirement savings plan, which I get. Society does not provide enough to protect the middle and lower classes, nor does it prepare them for retirement. Be careful. Maybe follow my advice, yeah?

Don’t overthink it or do. Regardless, there isn’t anyone or a community of people working for a common good. It seems like most are working towards profit. While Bitcoin’s original intent wasn’t a get rich scheme, it turned into one. Whatever its intent is now, I have no idea, and whoever says they know, I call bullshit.

Examples:\n\n>I think you’re in for a rude awakening when you realize Bitcoin is solely influenced by the amount of money whales put in and take out.\n\n>The biggest whales are institutions such as the United States government and BlackRock.\n\nThe US government and BlackRock have zero control over the rules of the Bitcoin network. The only way they can \"influence\" the Bitcoin network is by digitally signing valid Bitcoin transactions to be added into the blockchain, or by participating in mining.\n\nAny other type of unimportant \"influence\" you want to talk about on its USD trading price are completely irrelevant and short term thinking. The people who own all the Bitcoin do not get to change the rules to benefit themselves, the rules are applied to everyone fairly, to me, to you, to the banks and governments. \n\n>You missed the human greed aspect that fueled the growth and institutional taken over.\n\nTo pretend like greed isn't a real thing is hilarious. One of the many amazing traits about Bitcoin is that it is the only thing that we have that turns greed into a positive force that helps other people. Billionaires being greedy and buying as much Bitcoin as they can helps all of the smaller holders as well by increasing the value of the Bitcoin they hold. Through incentives everyone can mutually benefit. In a fully Bitcoin economy, you will spend sats on things that provide real value to your life, if you don't find anything you really need worth your money you simply can save it and prices will continue to fall to the marginal cost of production like the natural state of the freemarket would be. You can be a little richer every year doing literally nothing, this is how we make like prosperous for 8+ billion people.\n\n>What you want is more money, which aligns with your response\n\nI don't want \"more\" money. Bitcoin is a proof of work system. You only get what you work for, no one gets Bitcoin for free. The difference between Bitcoin and fiat money is that I get to KEEP my money that I worked hard for. I work hard for my money, I don't have to gamble it on real estate or stocks or whatever over financialized market product you want to point to in order to keep the wealth I rightfully earned.\n\nYou made a large USD profit in a short amount of time, congrats, most real Bitcoiners would have thought that was a big win at some point early on in their journey too, it definitely used to matter to me. When it takes millions of shitty government pieces of paper to buy 1.0 Bitcoin in the next couple decades, will you be as happy with yourself you decided to \"take profits\"?\n\nBitcoin is the money.

The coalition assessed that the Democrats have historically had very robust “get out the vote” campaigns and took note of the amounts of money that the Biden administration has dedicated to so-called “on the ground” efforts in swing states.

In response to strong customer demand, NVIDIA has increased its chip investment in TSMC by 25%, which not only means that the AI ​​market is booming Unprecedented, it also adds strong momentum to TSMC’s performance in the second half of the year and leaves the groundwork for raising its full-year outlook.*\n\n*TSMC will hold a legal meeting this Thursday (18th) and is currently in the silent period before the legal meeting. As of yesterday's deadline, no response from TSMC was received.*\n\n*The industry believes that with the news that TSMC has begun producing Blackwell platform architecture graphics processors (GPUs), it means that the countdown to the launch of Huida's AI server equipped with \"the most powerful AI chip on the surface\" will open a new page in the AI ​​industry, and is expected to become TSMC's The Dharma Conference is the focus of heated discussion.*\n\n*Analysts estimate that the average selling price (ASP) of the Huida B100 GPU built on the Blackwell architecture is US$30,000 to US$35,000, and the super chip GB200, which connects the Grace CPU and the B200 GPU in series, is priced between US$60,000 and US$70,000. The U.S. dollar is even higher, which means that Huida-related chips are the most expensive chips that TSMC has ever produced for terminals, and its investment in TSMC's operations is even more anticipated.*\n\n*Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU is known as the \"most powerful AI chip on the planet\". It is equipped with 208 billion transistors and is manufactured using TSMC's customized 4nm process. The GPU die is twice the mask size through a 10TB chip per second. The chip interconnect connects into a single, unified GPU and supports AI training and real-time large language model inference, with models scalable to 10 trillion parameters.*\n\n*According to industry insiders, major international manufacturers such as Amazon, Dell, Google, Meta, and Microsoft will introduce Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU to build AI servers, and the capacity exceeds expectations. To this end, Huida has increased its order for TSMC by about 25%. %.*\n\n*As Huida expands its Blackwell architecture GPU wafer production, in terms of the number of terminal server cabinets, shipments of GB200 NVL72 and GB200 NVL36 server cabinets have increased simultaneously, from the original expected combined shipment of 40,000 units. increased to 60,000 units, an increase of up to 50%, among which the total number of GB200 NVL36 reached 50,000 units.*\n\n*According to industry estimates, the average selling price of the GB200 NVL36 server cabinet is US$1.8 million, and the price of the GB200 NVL72 server cabinet is as high as US$3 million. GB200 NVL36 has 36 super chips GB200, 18 Grace CPUs, and 36 enhanced B200 GPUs; GB200 NVL72 has 72 super chips GB200, 36 Grace CPUs, and 72 B200 GPUs.*\n\n*Before the handover of the leadership in June, former TSMC Chairman Liu Deyin predicted that the demand for AI applications is now more optimistic than a year ago. \"This year is another year of great growth.\" Current Chairman Wei Zhejia also revealed that AI applications have just begun. , \"I'm as optimistic as everyone else.\"*", "id": "1e3k4jh", "created_utc": 1721011506.0, "score": 893, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 204, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 1798 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If any company is going to emulate NVDA meteoric rise, it's TSMC.", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "The two stocks rise together if you havent noticed...

It's literally one of the first things that pop up once you google his name.\n\nIn the past month, CVNA went up 40% from $100 to $140, for no apparent reason. Meanwhile father Garcia continuously sold his CVNA position. He held 1,177,500 shares on 2024/17/06, and was down to 187,500 shares on 7/09/2024. That's 84% of his CVNA position sold off in the past 3 weeks.
