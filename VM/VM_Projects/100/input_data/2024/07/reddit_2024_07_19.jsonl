Convenient you left that part out huh? \n\nIn July 2023, Rudy Giuliani’s right-hand man, Lev Parnas, wrote a letter to Chairman Comer explaining that Giuliani declared in 2018 that he would use Vice President Biden’s call to fire Shokin “as a way to discredit the Bidens.”  Parnas explained:  “The truth is that everyone, from Giuliani ... to the people at FOX News, knew that these allegations against the Bidens were false.  There has never been any factual evidence, only conspiracy theories spread by people who knew exactly what they were doing.” \n\nIn 2019, Trump Administration United States Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker told House investigators that Giuliani’s theory “had been debunked” and had “no evidence to support it.” \n \nIn February 2016—a month before Shokin was fired—Republican Senators Rob Portman, Mark Kirk, and Ron Johnson sent a letter with Democrats urging then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to “press ahead with urgent reforms to the Prosecutor General’s office.…”  \n\nAt a March 15, 2016 Senate hearing before Shokin’s removal, John E. Herbst, a former Ambassador to Ukraine in the Bush Administration, testified that “Shokin was a compromised figure” and described how by “late fall of 2015, the EU and the United States joined the chorus of those seeking Mr. Shokin’s removal as the start of an overall reform of the Procurator General’s Office.”  \n\nIn 2019, Republican Senator Johnson stated: “The whole world, by the way, including the Ukrainian caucus, which I signed the letter, the whole world felt that this that Shokin wasn’t doing a [good] enough job.  So we were saying hey you’ve...got to rid yourself of corruption.”   \n\nIn 2019, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent told House investigators that “there was a broad-based consensus that he [Viktor Shokin] was a typical Ukraine prosecutor who lived a lifestyle far in excess of his government salary, who never prosecuted anybody known for having committed a crime, and having covered up crimes that were known to have been committed.” \n\nUkrainian officials had been calling for Shokin’s removal for months.  In October 2015, news outlets reported that “more than 100 of Ukraine’s 450 members of parliament have called for Shokin’s dismissal.” \n\n In February 2016, a senior Ukrainian prosecutor, Vitaliy Kasko, resigned, stating:  “Today, the General Prosecutor’s office is a brake on the reform of criminal justice, a hotbed of corruption, an instrument of political pressure, one of the key obstacles to the arrival of foreign investment in Ukraine.”\n\n Also in February 2016, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, threatened to suspend a $40 billion aid package, stating:  “I am concerned about Ukraine’s slow progress in improving governance and fighting corruption, and reducing the influence of vested interests in policymaking.  Without a substantial new effort to invigorate governance reforms and fight corruption, it is hard to see how the IMF-supported program can continue and be successful.”  \n\nOn March 29, 2016, Jan Tombinksi, the European Union’s envoy to Ukraine, stated that Shokin’s removal would be “an opportunity to make a fresh start in the prosecutor general’s office” and adding a new Prosecutor General would ensure that this office “becomes independent from political influence and pressure and enjoys public trust.” \n\nThe Executive Director of the Anticorruption Action Centre in Kyiv, Ukraine, Daria Kaleniuk, explained that Shokin “was fired not because he wanted to do that [Burisma] investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.”  She said Shokin “was not doing much on corruption” and “was unwilling to prosecute Burisma.”  \n\n Shokin’s former Deputy Prosecutor General, Vitaliy Kasko, explained that his office’s probe into Burisma and Mykola Zlochevsky, had been “shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.”  \n\nIn his recent transcribed interview with the Committee, Hunter Biden’s business associate and fellow Burisma board member, Devon Archer, explained he was informed that “Shokin being fired was a—was not good, because he was like under control as relates to Mykola [Zlochevsky, Burisma’s owner].”    \n\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent explained to Senate investigators in 2020:  “Rather than back the U.S.-supported anticorruption investigators, however, Shokin undermined their efforts.”    \n\nFormer Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, agreed with House investigators in 2019 that Shokin’s removal “would increase the chances that corrupt companies in Ukraine would be investigated,” including Burisma. \n\nOnce again it's right wing boot lickers spreading nonsense conspiracies.

{"title": "The wisdom (or stupidity) of the investment crowd: A reality check", "selftext": "Exactly 3 years ago, there was a thread shared on X (back then Twitter) - **“Top 20 stocks that have 50x potential\".**\n\nThis list was based on 700+ responses from other Twitter users, and I thought it was a solid representation of what the average investor was excited about, back then. So, I bookmarked the thread, and here we are, three years later, ready to have a look at the wisdom **(or stupidity)** of the investment crowd.\n\nBut before I start, do not forget, that the sentiment at that time was very positive. The S&P500 was up over 90% in a bit over a year, since the pandemic low back in March 2020.\n\n\n\n|Company name|How it was described|Ticker|% change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Alteryx|Big Data Analytics|AYX|-39%|\n|Boston Omaha|Berkshire Hathaway 2.0|BOMN|6%|\n|Beyond meat|Plant-based meat|BYND|-95%|\n|Desktop Metals|3D Printing|DM|-95%|\n|ContextLogic|Discount e-commerce|WISH|-98%|\n|Fiverr|Online freelance marketplace|FVRR|-90%|\n|Global-E|Software for internatiocal e-commerce|GLBE|-38%|\n|Jumia|E-commerce in Africa|JMIA|-47%|\n|Lemonade|Next-gen insurance|LMND|-74%|\n|Upstart|Credit scores 2.0|UPST|-76%|\n|Latch|Hardware/software for property management|LTCH|-97%|\n|Nano-X Imaging|Bring medical imaging to the world|NNOX|-71%|\n|Origin Materials|Carbon negative plastic|ORGN|-85%|\n|Open Door|Real estate iBuying|OPEN|-82%|\n|Sofi Technologies|Digital financial services|SOFI|-50%|\n|Redfin|Real Estate 2.0 & iBuying|RDFN|-86%|\n|Ozon|e-Commerce in Russia|Ozon|Delisted|\n|Virgin Galactic|Space tourism|SPCE|-99%|\n|Twist Biosciences|DNA on demand|TWST|-56%|\n|YETI|High-quality outdoor gear|YETI|-57%|\n|||**Average**|**-70%**|\n|||**S&P500**|**28%**|\n\n\n\nThe table shows the performance of these “top 20 stocks that have 50x potential” and as you can see, the average decline was a **staggering 70%,** compared to the **S&P500’s gain of 28%** over the same period. Not only that, but **all of the 20 stocks underperformed the index.**\n\nThe reality is, that it is easy to look like a genius in a bull market. Positive sentiment drives stock prices up, and it hides the underlying weaknesses. The fear of missing out adds more fuel to the fire. But also, there was fuel in the form of stimulus checks.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t last forever and market conditions change. When that happens, risky investments and poor strategies are exposed, and those following the crowd without doing their homework, eventually learn a harsh lesson, as we’ll see in this perfect example.\n\nThe dramatic decline in these stocks serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of following the crowd in investing. Despite the initial optimism and promising potential, the reality has been a harsh lesson in the importance of thorough research.

You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "1e6zmfe", "created_utc": 1721381409.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 301, "comments": [{"body": "cloudstrike only being down 9% despite bringing down the global IT infrastructure is kind of amazing", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "I was just thinking this - this is like worst case scenario for them and they’re not even down double digits..", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "And even with the dip it's still overpriced.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "What makes it even more amazing is that it was already on a downtrend.

How did that improve access to EVs?

Elon even talked about Tesla's necessity to pivot to micro controllers instead of chips during the massive chip shortage lest they be unable to deliver any cars at all. Furthermore, Tesla couldn't make enough cars at this time to satisfy demand (no other car manufacturers could deliver cars at this time). So as they detailed multiple times on earnings calls, they had to use price as a demand lever.  Being able to deliver cars at all during this period was indeed beneficial towards the transition to sustainable energy as no other manufacturer pivoted as smoothly as Tesla.\n\nAlso, Tesla cut prices drastically as parts shortages and shipping costs disappeared and demand started to wane. They made huge improvements to COGS on all their vehicles in this time and still managed to maintain positive margins while trying to reignite demand. Ironically, the IRA with its EV tax incentive also helped stimulate this demand and we seem to be seeing a resurgence in Tesla's sales (and hopefully margins).\n\nNext, Elon himself has said that the they dug their own grave with Cybertruck as it's incredibly difficult and expensive to produce. They've done a good job mitigating this by roping the simps and uber-rich in to buy the Foundation Series. But by your logic, Tesla never should have conceived a product that is initially so cost prohibitive to produce.\n\nTesla has also open-sourced a lot of its patents with respect to EV production, including a how-to guide for other OEMs to transition to a more efficient 48V architecture. This doesn't necessarily contribute to Tesla's bottom line, but it does encourage the adoption of more efficient techniques by other manufacturers and with it, the transition to sustainable energy.\n\nI wholeheartedly disagree with your assertion that a mission statement is just a platitude.

{"title": "CrowdStrike ($CRWD) is Not Worth $75.84 Billion (at time of writing)", "selftext": "**$300 EOD**\n\n**My Position: $CRWD $270 Put 08/02/2024 Expiry. (edit, typed** **~~07/19/25~~** **before)**  \n**tl;dr:** $CRWD is fucked by reputational damage alone, not to mention their insane P/E to begin with\n\n**CRITIQUES**\n\n**Irreparable Tarnish on Core Product** CrowdStrike’s core product is trust and reliability. Today's outage, caused by their own human error, has irreparably tarnished this trust globally. This incident has shown their failure in delivering their fundamental promise, which is simply trust and reliability. The company should and will eventually be sold for scraps as customers move away in droves.\n\n**Forward Guidance Concerns** Even if the next quarterly earnings are good, forward guidance cannot be positive. Customers will inevitably look to move to other providers. If not simply for better security, for the purposes of demonstrating the strength of their security to their end clients (who know nothing about the true ins and outs of cybersecurity). CRWD has become a household name now for being a failure. For a similar example, Boeing (a company with a formerly incredible reputation) is now known as a failure in the eyes of the public. Imagine CRWD, which was unknown to the average citizen until today, now being known as a colossal failure.\n\n**Failed Public Response and CEO’s Lack of Remorse** The public response from CrowdStrike has been an absolute disaster. Instead of taking full responsibility, their statements have been riddled with excuses and deflections. The CEO has failed to show any genuine remorse for the mistake, demonstrating a lack of accountability and understanding of the gravity of the situation. This kind of leadership is unacceptable and only adds insult to injury for their customers who are already suffering from the fallout.\n\n**Competitive Landscape** Competitors like Palo Alto Networks ($PANW) offer similar services without the tarnished reputation and fear of failure. They will undoubtedly learn from CrowdStrike's mistake, ensuring they do not repeat it. This gives them a significant edge in the market.\n\n**Political Risk** With the next US government (likely Trump 2024) already hesitant around tech in general, CrowdStrike is in a precarious position. A single tweet from Trump could tank this stock, exacerbating the already significant damage.\n\n**Customer Backlash** In the coming weeks, customers will be demanding compensation for billions lost in revenue due to CrowdStrike’s outage. Fixing the damage will cost time and money for individual customers, and CrowdStrike may be liable or required to contribute to these costs.\n\n**Potential Fallout with Major Partners** Microsoft (MSFT) may move away from involving CrowdStrike in future defense of their systems. MSFT has its own security offerings and the issue originated from their OS. To protect their own reputation and stock price, MSFT would be smart to limit any connection to CrowdStrike.\n\n**COMMENTARY**\n\n**Black Swan Perspective** Nassim Taleb’s concept of a \"Black Swan\" event highlights the profound impact of rare and unpredictable events. For a cybersecurity company like CrowdStrike, the recent outage represents such an event. The fragility of their trust and reliability has been exposed, showing that even a small error can lead to catastrophic consequences. The cybersecurity industry is built on the foundation of preventing and mitigating risks. A company like CrowdStrike, which fails to uphold these principles, demonstrates an inherent fragility. The outage is not just a technical failure but a breach of trust that cannot be easily repaired.\n\n**Similar Company: SolarWinds** A notable example of a similar company that suffered a major breach is SolarWinds. In December 2020, SolarWinds experienced a significant security breach when their Orion software was compromised, leading to one of the most sophisticated and wide-reaching cyberattacks in history. The breach affected numerous government agencies and private companies, severely damaging SolarWinds' reputation. On December 11, 2020, SolarWinds was trading at $24.83, but by September 23, 2023, it had plummeted to $7.68. The majority of the damage was done reputationally immediately. Despite efforts to recover, SolarWinds has faced substantial backlash, legal challenges, and a loss of trust among its customers. This incident serves as a cautionary tale for CrowdStrike, showing how a single event can have long-term detrimental effects on a cybersecurity firm.\n\nCrowdStrike’s recent outage has revealed deep flaws in their reliability and trustworthiness. With competitors like Palo Alto Networks standing ready to capitalize on this failure, and potential political and customer backlash looming, CrowdStrike’s future looks bleak. Their customers, partners, and investors should consider this incident a major red flag, and avoid investing in a company with such compromised integrity and performance.", "id": "1e76uwn", "created_utc": 1721403829.0, "score": 604, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 weeks | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So...
