You are generally right about earnings; however absolutely smashing them at a consistent rate is showing massive growth which is what grows valuations. \n\nThe honest to gods truth is no one knows what nvidia is going to do, but a million people will tell you it’s going to ten trillion, and a million people will tell you it’s overbought bullshit, and the only thing those two groups of people have in common is any lack of understanding of the business nvidia is in. What I can say with absolute certainty is that nvidia is the top dog when it comes to selling AI infrastructure and that is not possible to change for quite some time. I’m heavily invested because I see the writing on the wall and I understand that AI is going to fundamentally change business and life as we know it. It’s ease of life and cost cutting - the two things everyone in the world that can afford it will pour money into. All these companies increasing capex? Wait for nvidias earnings, if you follow the market and tech in particular you’d realize where that capex is going.\n\nI’m not going to go into why fundamentally nvidia is a monster because that’s debatable, however the benefits that their technology brings is undebatable. I’m not investing in nvidia as much as I am investing in the technology they are the only ones capable of bringing right now. I’m not going to rant about the magic of AI and all the ways a layman does not understand the benefits, you can google basic functions and use your imagination for the rest. \n\nI would be willing to bet my left testicle that 95% of the people online telling you nvidia isn’t a great investment, doesn’t deserve its valuation and is due for a correction never mind another run work in a field or have a job in particular that will be replaced with ai in the next decade. Simply because computers can now read, write, speak and listen and they can do all those things without requiring insurance bills, and pesky things like wages and lunch.

I was legitimately surprised by your question and thought you were yanking my chain - something that happens quite a bit on Reddit. I apologize, that was a dick move on my part. \n\nI have a 20 bagger in Tesla right now. For a while it was a 30 bagger. I’m in my 30’s and back in 2019 I put two years of my company bonus into the shares at that time, after around 9 months of owning a Model 3. At the time that investment was ~$40,000. Today, when combined with my company 401k and pension, it’s an order of magnitude more than enough money for me to retire. But I actually like my job and plan to hold the shares for a long time. \n\nMaybe you were around this sub back then, but if you weren’t, Tesla probably would have ranked low in the 9th decile of investment decisions. Anything positive about the company was downvoted into oblivion. There was an incredible amount of just pure shit-slinging. Having the experience of actually owning the product helped me cut through the noise. \n\nAnyway, back to the point. I’m keep this brief, and I would love your thoughts. I see seven major growth opportunities on the short/medium term radar, in no particular order: \n\nOptimus - Production experience/AI. Humanoid robotics play.  The product has the potential to be attractive in the labor market (a very large market) by replacing dangerous/boring tasks leading to unprecedented efficiency and cost savings. Big market. \n\nRide share services - Tesla has a low-cost, massively-scalable, generalized solution for autonomous vehicles. In the past they’ve said they need more compute and more video data. Now they have both. And they’ve rewritten their software stack to feed vision as a direct input to a control based neural network. Ultimately will lower costs and increase safety of getting around. Big market. \n\nEnergy - Huge market & profitability. The stationary energy storage market is projected to experience significant growth in the coming years, driven by factors such as increased renewable energy investments, global expansion in the electric vehicle sector, and regulatory changes requiring energy efficiency. It’s a marketing expected to conservatory grow at 25% CAGR for the foreseeable future. Tesla has a competitive hardware product and bundles it with best in class software. Just look at the growth in their energy business. It’s on track to be larger than the automotive business. Big market. \n\nCompact - High production capacity. Lowering costs using their unboxed production method they are going to dramatically expand their TAM. They will be punching down market and I think they will do well. \n\nDry cathode - Reduction in costs. Significant advantages over a wet cathode battery in terms of production costs and factory space savings.  Eliminates the need for solvents, reducing the energy consumption and costs associated with solvent recovery. Also eliminates a significant portion of factory space. \n\nCybertruck - Capable offering in the electric pickup truck market. They’ve said they are tracking for profitability by the end of this year. Hitting growth phase. Big Market.\n\nSemi - Capable offering in the commercial trucking market. Expected to ramp production in 2025. Big market.\n\nYes I do see a few growth opportunities ahead.

The street is valuing the stock on that plus revenue and earnings from auto sales (the biggest chunk), which are flat to down, and likely to have a tough couple of quarters. \n\nSo in the near term, the stock is likely to drop further if auto revenues are not good, which is likely. \n\nIn the long term, we haven't seen a rollout of Tesla robotaxi yet. Will it work? Will it run into regulatory and legal issues when there are inevitable mistakes? Will they try to roll it out too fast with too little human intervention, or roll it out slowly - risk versus near term revenue - risk of first-mover self inflicted black eyes.\n\nThere is a lot of risk with FSD and robotaxis, and the software is not ready yet for fully autonomous. There has been another delay of the rollout to October. Will it be ready by then? Will it still be making mistakes? Can they get the software stable and keep it that way?\n\nElon has a history of delivering, but not on anyone's schedule.\n\nSo the street is factoring in current known problems with demand and revenue with the risk of FSD being very late, underwhelming, and other problems that can occur on the way to doing something no one has ever done before.\n\nThe TL;DR is that there is a good chance that TSLA stock will drop further, and perhaps a lot further if the auto sales crater for a few quarters. Might be a good time to pick up some shares cheaply, until Tesla can show that they have a high-profit, ready to roll robotaxi service. \n\nIf you pay attention and understand what is likely to happen, you can reduce your risk ahead of the street.

There are still risks, and FSD has been going on for a long, long time without being quite good enough. \n\nThe analyst is right though.

But yes it’s possible but rather unlikely and less if you expect to do it in a small time frame at that price. There’s a premium on the time horizon, the longer the more expensive, it also means that it’s more likely to “hit”.\n\nWhat an option is, it’s a contract with an option seller that gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy 100 units of a stock for a price by a certain date.\n\nSay a stock trades at 4 usd, and I say it will be at 10 by next month. With the premium etc the break even would be stock price of 11 (probably less). Let’s say the option is priced at 100 usd.\n\nNow for whatever reason the stock is now trading not at 10 but at 100. That’s a 90 dollars difference with the strike. And the option gives you the right to buy 100, so that options contract would be worth 9000. You made a 10x nearly.\n\nThis case is extreme as it is highly unlikely this would happen, however, playing with the greeks and having luck in your side can net you a 1000% return yes (see OP).\n\nFor more regarded plays go and check u/DeepFuckingValue and his first posts. He was convinced the videogame retailer was not dead while options sellers did. He got really cheap 2 year horizon options (called leaps). He put his money where his mouth is with a 50k bet. After 2 years and a lot of ridicule he converted that into 40M. \n\nAgain, this is a rarity and if you browse long enough this sub what happens regularly is people losing 100%.\n\nFor context, I put 60 euros in some out of the money options on Apple before this years wwdc. I think they were 8 usd out of the money and expiring the same week so quite cheap. \n\nWwdc happened and the price tanked on the mention of AI. I panic sold at a 50% loss. 2 days later apple had one of the craziest runs on the AI news and each of my contracts would have been worth 1.2k.\n\nWith stocks you just need to guess the direction. With options you need to guess direction, an time frame, and there’s an additional premium so you’re also fighting against an algorithm that is pricing the options efficiently for you to lose money even if you’re right (the money is made on the rare events that cannot be priced effectively).\n\nCheck IV and Theta crush. You can be right big time but still lose money cause the pricing of the option expected a lot of volatily (IV) and now that the move happened the contract is not worth as much (extrinsic value) or because you bought it long ago (high theta) and now that it’s close to expiry the contract is ITM (in the money) but not netting you anything. \n\nEverything is against you when trading options but if you know all this, you can indeed throw 100 usd monthly chasing the dream.

I appreciate the friendly competition, good sir, and I thank you for taking the time to  summarize the first google result for \"meta earnings expectations\" for us here in wsb. But unfortunately for you, your wife's boyfriend and I will be riding these puts to fuckin Valhalla.\n\n\"CPMs are up, that's bullish\" is such an oversimplification and I get it, it makes a lot of sense when you have no actual understanding of the ads platform. Increasing prices should be a good thing, but charging too much can be bad for a business if you end up pricing out a huge chunk of your customers which is my whole argument. At the end of the day, CPMs are a vanity metric that generally don't affect decision making internally at companies. All that really matters is your return on ad dollars. CPM up 19% is still a loss if overall spend is down 25%\n\nAnd there are a lot of reasons CPMs could be up. You'll often hear meta reference the ever growing number of users. But here's the thing, when you run an ad campaign optimized for conversions, your ads aren't being shown to every single user on meta. The reality is, probably 80% of metas users are broke as fuck and never buy shit. Nobody but fuckin temu and microtransaction mobile game developers advertise to this audience.\n\nThat means meta derives most of its revenue from the other 20% of users who actually convert and who are the reason people like me spend so much fuckin money on meta. Well guess what, good sir. We're in a recession. The consumer is weakening. Karens all over the country have less disposable income to spend on my drop shit, hand crafted European textiles. Only your wife's boyfriend can afford my high end cum rags at this point cuz the dudes *fucking* ***loaded***.\n\nSo this pool of buyers, that last year was 20% of total users, may be 15% of users this year. CPMs are a supply and demand metric. This means it's not necessarily demand driving up prices, it could also be a lack of supply. If CPMs are going up due to weakening supply of converting users, aka facebook customers are having to pay more for less, the reality is that facebooks customers just start spending less because they can no longer afford to acquire customers at the increased cost. I guess I didn't clarify in my original post, but our facebook spend is down almost 30% YTD and its a similar story for many of the members of my fake network of wannabe entrepreneurs.\n\nMETAs a beast of a business. I started my company at 23 with 10k and pretty much no experience, and over 6 years have grown it into a business doing 9m in revenue. And of that 9m, Zuck keeps 40-50% of it while I get to keep 10% or less. That's a great fucking business. But there's thousands of people with similar stories, who make up a huge chunk of metas annual revenue. These people almost all unanimously agree that meta has been completely fucked up this year. Some have stopped spending entirely, some are still growing, but most that I know of are flat or down. Once my puts print, I'll roll half of them into META shares because its a great long term hold.
