The company has now lost one-third of its value since July 19, when a historic outage of Microsoft systems, caused by a software update from CrowdStrike, knocked numerous industries offline, including airlines.\n\nLate Monday, CNBC’s Phil Lebeau reported that Delta hired Boies, chairman of Boies Schiller Flexner, to seek compensation from CrowdStrike and Microsoft. No suit has been filed, Lebeau reported, and Delta didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nDelta is handling over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests after almost 7,000 flights were canceled. The outages cost the airline an estimated $350 million to $500 million. \n\nThe Department of Transportation said last week that it’s investigating Delta due to the widespread flight disruptions and service failures.\n\nBoies is known for representing the U.S. government in its landmark antitrust case against Microsoft and for helping win a decision that overturned California’s ban on gay marriage. He also worked with Harvey Weinstein, the imprisoned former Hollywood mogul, and Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who is currently serving a prison sentence for defrauding investors.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/30/crowdstrike-shares-plunge-11percent-on-report-that-delta-may-seek-damages.html", "id": "1eg3dei", "created_utc": 1722370291.0, "score": 1738, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 315, "comments": [{"body": "Wait til all the other airlines hop on this one", "score": 755, "replies": [{"body": "Wait until every single business jumps in on this", "score": 444, "replies": [{"body": "Even if the terms of service hold up in court (which I don't think they will), CrowsStrike simply can't afford to fight half of the Fortune 500 in court at the same time.

Intel, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings Thursday, has about 110,000 employees, excluding workers at units that are being spun out.\n\nChief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is spending heavily on research and development aimed at improving Intel’s technology and helping it return to prominence in the semiconductor industry. The company’s once-dominant position eroded under Gelsinger’s predecessors as rivals, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc., have caught up and taken market share. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIntel shares rose about 1% in late trading, reaching as high as $31.11, on the news.\n\nOther chipmakers led by Nvidia Corp. have sprinted ahead in the development of lucrative semiconductors tailored for demanding artificial intelligence-related tasks. Intel is also coming to grips with uneven demand for chips that run laptops and desktop computers, its main business.\n\nGelsinger, betting that Intel can improve its technology, embarked on a plan to build factories to manufacture semiconductors for other chipmakers. Last week, Intel hired Naga Chandrasekaran from Micron Technology Inc. as chief global operations officer, putting him in charge of the company’s overall manufacturing efforts.\n\nIntel reduced its workforce about 5% in 2023 to 124,800 by year’s end after announcing job cuts beginning in October 2022. It also has slowed spending in other areas. The company expected those cost reductions would save as much as $10 billion by 2025.\n\nAnalysts project that Intel will report that second-quarter revenue was flat, compared with a year earlier. Growth will pick up modestly in the second half of 2024, and total sales will increase 3% to $55.7 billion for the full year, according to Wall Street estimates. That would be the first annual revenue increase since 2021.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-30/intel-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs-to-reduce-costs-fund-turnaround", "id": "1eg872p", "created_utc": 1722382253.0, "score": 630, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "Didn't they just get billions from the government to create jobs in America?

{"title": "An NVDA Price History Lesson.", "selftext": "TL;DR: Looking at the chart in this post, NVDA is showing similar patterns in price action between last qtr and this qtr. Despite being on a bearish downtrend, it may not be completely dead as we head into earnings on Aug. 28 based on the previous qtr's price action. There's more nuance than that in the post. Learn to read idk.\n\n*^(This post is purely observational/technical, no fundamentals, so take that as you will.)*\n\n“History Doesn't Repeat Itself, but It Often Rhymes” – **Mark Twain**.\n\nCringe quote aside, I wanted to make this post to prove a point that NVDA bulls are freaking out for nothing (...yet) and to explain a little bit of what has happened in the past regarding NVDA's price action before earnings and to give some insight for what could occur from here up until their earnings report is released on Aug. 28, 2024. For that we'll have to go *back to the past*, all the way to... four months ago.\n\nWe all know NVDA has had an insane year with a 125% gain YTD, but it hasn't gotten here by going up in a straight line (even though it may feel like it) and people already seem to be forgetting what happened leading up to their Q1 earnings in May, so please allow me to remind you. March 8th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others. NVDA closed the previous day(3/7) at $92.66, then opened 3/8 at $95.14(+2.67%). As the morning progressed, euphoria was high, and eventually NVDA pumped to $97.40 at it's peak(now a 5.1% increase from prev close). What occurred almost immediately after was an intense fall from grace as the stock price fell all the way down to $86.51 within two hours of it reaching its peak (-11.2% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. Two weeks later on 3/25 we were already testing the high again at $96.77 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**).\n\nThen came April. WW3 was FOR SURE happening between Iran and Israel, chips were losing momentum, and earnings were disappointing ^(()\\*^(calls on VIX)\\*). People were starting to wonder if NVDA's earnings were actually going to be as amazing as everyone had hoped. Worst to come, (NV)D-day (i'm *really* sorry) was just around the corner. April 19, 2024: SMCI's earnings report is approaching, and in previous quarters they would usually release preliminary earnings ahead of the actual report... but this time they opted not to. Panic. \"Their report must be horrible\", \"AI doesn't make money\", so on, so forth. NVDA dropped in sympathy from $84.66 prev close to $75.61 at its trough intra-day(-10.6%). **This was the bottom of this quarter.**\n\n***$97.40 to $75.61 from peak to trough in just 42 days. a -22.3% correction, all occurring within Q1.***\n\nFast forward to this quarter. Coming off of a blowout earnings, euphoria was once again fueling everyone and their Uber driver to buy NVDA stock. We took this sucker from $102.03 post earnings to it's peak at $140.76. June 20th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others... wait hold on. This seems familiar. On this day NVDA fell from it's peak at $140.76 to $129.52(-8% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. *Three\\** weeks later on 7/11 we were already testing the high again at $136.15 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**). This quarter's bottom so far is sitting at $106.30 that occurred last Thursday 7/25 before deep V'ing back up to to being \\~$112 which was basically flat on the day.\n\n***$140.76 to $106.30 from peak to trough in just 35 days. a -24.4% correction, all occurring within Q2... so far.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axdtcsdb4mfd1.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b7a76b2898dc2009d104ae2c5d3692096328e7\n\nIf it isn't obvious these events intra-quarter are practically parallels, but there are some differences of course.\n\nThis quarter we have:\n\n* 100% Priced in rate cut in September, whereas before it was more speculative on when we'd get a cut, if at all.\n* With that\\^, small caps are being rotated into.\n* The Election getting closer and historic events occurring leading up to the election(Trump shot, Kamala Replacing Biden, etc.)\n* Both Presidential Nominees/Administrations commenting on the geopolitical climate between Taiwan and China.\n* Nancy Bought.\n* NVDA at historically low volume as I've laid out in this post from 7/17 if you want to read: [NVDA's volume in the past 2 days have been at a near 2.5 year low with the exception of July 3, 2023. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e51wcl/nvdas_volume_in_the_past_2_days_have_been_at_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* Arguably stronger NVDA selloffs within this quarter; the 6/20 and 7/11 dates mentioned were both deep, aggressive selloffs sitting at -8% and -6.6% intra-day changes respectively whereas on 3/25 that sell off started off more slowly.\n* Jensen making Uninformative Sells of 240,000 shares starting in June and continuing to every other day in July.\n* AI fatigue now that everyone on Wall Street had their eyes on NVDA for the entire first half of the year.\n\nThis weeks mega-cap tech earnings also aren't accounted for yet and could absolutely affect NVDA negatively or positively, so we will have to wait and see on that one.\n\nAll that being said, nothing is guaranteed of course. This time it could be different and we could continue gapping down here and not even recover for quite some time, but I'm just trying to outline that we aren't *too* deep in the trenches yet. There needs to be more evidence of further selloffs before we have to give up hope that NVDA could ever recover before August earnings, but based on just this year's price action alone we're at a tipping point of either breaking down past a point of no return on NVDA or, similarly to last quarter, we've already seen the bottom for this quarter and we begin the gap up leading into NVDA earnings on 8/28. This week is an absolutely ***crucial*** moment for NVDA's trajectory leading into earnings.\n\nMy Copium: NVDA 10 contracts of 9/20 140c, avg cost: $6.75 currently $2.55, -$4,195 return.\n\nEdit: NVDA made a new bottom today 7/30/24 at $102.54. The updated difference from peak to trough for this qtr is now $140.76 to $102.54, -27.2% difference. Looking less good now, but still holding.\n\nEdit 2: New bottom in AH at $100.01 lol. $140.76 to $100.01, -28.95% difference", "id": "1efof3p", "created_utc": 1722329264.0, "score": 318, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 5 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 801 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If I know anything about investing (which I don't) I know for sure that 7/11 is a great deal.... buy there for sure!\n\nEDIT: Go all in on 7/11!

There's plenty of shit I don't understand. In all seriousness, it's ok if you don't understand how financials are prepared or what the data is conveying.\n\n\nHere's a quick rundown on why margins are overstated: \n\n\n\nInventory is only booked as a cost when it is sold creating an accounting lag. This means in times of rising prices corporate margins will increase. Think of it this way, let's say you sell widgets for 2x (x being the cost of production) and the lag to get your inventory sold is only 30 days. Now let's say we're in a period of rapid inflation. During June and July x=1 but in August x=2 (absurd but we're using this to illustrate a point). Well if you always sell at the current market value then your total July profit margin would be 50% [(current month revenue - prior months inventory cost)/ current month revenue]. However August would show profit margins at 75%.\n\n\nRemember McDonald's is not some professional service company in a small town that determines price based on whims. Their prices are directly tied to inventory costs and if you adjust for this you will find for McDonalds (and nearly every other company that isn't in a professional service field), that those prices are not artificially inflated. If it was then they could reasonably lower their prices,  however currently, the only thing that could lower their gross margins is deflation. And deflation is not a good thing. There is not a single economist or learned person alive who would prefer deflation to hyperinflation or inflation. \n\n\nI understand why you might be skeptical as there are many people who cosplay in this field. But I do this shit for a living. And if you're curious in learning an interesting flaw in financial reporting, try the math out yourself. Or if you don't want to,  at least plug the price of any McD menu item into an inflation calculator from 2019-2024.

Test that out this year and then perhaps use it as such in 2025 - thoughts (and please be brutally honest?) For that, and laughter is expected, positions to obtain that I’ve considered:\n\n- increasing stake in the volatile MSTR, writing against a portion post split. \n\n- starting CMG, because IV has been so high, but Idk longterm.\n\n- increasing MSFT (especially if down still,) as a safe and consistent holding to write against abt half. Would be huge in my overall portfolio, though. (And the ability to do something like this is recent. But MSFT I believe in for a decade+?)\n\n- game store and writing when IV high bc shares are cheap and it’s sometimes volatile. \n\n- QQQ or SPY, though I don’t usually hold those … maybe it’s time now my portfolio has grown? Idk. Also to write CC against. \n\n- how viable is PMCC? If I set my LEAPS up as a debit spread, essentially? This confuses me, as I usually hold them bc I think there is huge upside. But also, would buy ATM or ITM as a capital efficient share proxy. \n\nLess appealing is screening IV each each week/month and acquiring to sell against…seems…\n\nLast question! Is there any reason, beyond an expected continued upswing, not to acquire shares by buying puts?

UA is underlying asset, as in the stock. Crush stands for IV crush, IV is implied volatility, which just means the amount the community believes the stock could move within a certain amount of time. Unless specified otherwise, IV is a percentage that the stock is estimated to be able to move within a year; according to the amount of standard deviant points you apply. 70% IV means theres a certain percent chance the stock could move 70% up or down within the year. Vega, which is one of the Greeks, is used to show the relation between the value of the contract, and a 1% increase in the implied volatility. with a 0.2 Vega, a 1 percent increase in IV will bring the value of a contract up by 0.2 dollars per share, or 20 dollars per contract. Meaning a one dollar per share contract would increase from 1.00-> 1.2 dollars per share. Delta is the Greek that represents the amount of value the contract increases by for every dollar the underlying asset (stock) increases by. With a 0.5 delta, for every dollar that the UA increases by, the contract will increase by 50 dollars, or 0.5 dollars per share. \n\n\nDoes that all make sense?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for dumbing it down as much as possible.

The delta on that option was 0.89, and you would have been able to buy 38 contracts at that price. Based on the after-hours closing price of 149.11, you would have made 40.6k on the trade for a profit of about 66%.. If it had dropped to 127, you would have lost 20k, just about as much as you would have lost on the option you bought.\n\nIf you had bought the 125 call for August 16th during the dip today, it would have only been 13.45 per contract.
