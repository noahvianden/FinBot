What Am I missing?", "selftext": "\\- Japan  slipped into a recession at the end of last year, losing its title as the world's third-biggest economy to Germany.\n\n\\- Japan factory output falls at the fastest pace in nearly four years. Industrial output fell 7.5% in January 2024 from the previous month, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed.\n\n\\- \"The plunge in industrial production in January suggests that GDP will fall yet again this quarter, which will add to the view that Japan's economy is in recession,\" said Gabriel Ng, assistant economist at Capital Economics.- Production declined the most in motor vehicles, down 17.8% in January from the previous month. Output decreases in regular passenger cars and electrical drives systems pulled down the overall figures.\n\n\\- Birth rate reached to historically low last year. And the administrative even says that if they don't reverse this by 2030. There is no turning back but nose-diving crash..  \\*\\*\\*The birth rate in Japan is not a long-term problem (like it is in China); its the problem right now because low rate been there for decades, and now its taking actual effect now\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd now, Warren Buffet in his annual letter claiming that he will keep holding and buying more Japanese stock for indefinite period of time as he already hold 8.5% across the group of top five firms. Buffett had previously expressed caution about investing in foreign companies, citing his inability to forecast foreign-exchange movements. Despite this, he has shown a clear interest in Japan‚Äôs economy. And he has been praising about Japan future economic several occasions now.\n\nThis is not some speculative movement, He's talking about long-long term investment like 10+ years. I just can't understand how can someone be optimistic about Japan economic given its aging population, birth rate, and recently performance.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "1b3kc05", "created_utc": 1709263962.0, "score": 362, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 180, "comments": [{"body": "Kinda obvious, the Japanese yen has been depreciating steadily, and of course their GDP in USD equivalent terms, and which measures their domestic economic activity shrinks with the currency.

GM CEO Mary Barra said at the time that her company expected to save up to $400 million of a planned investment in building out EV charging stations.\n\nThe partnerships mark a strategy shift for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who for years touted the exclusivity of Tesla‚Äôs charging network and his company‚Äôs ability to build reliable charging locations that would keep consumers from sitting in long lines. Becoming the charging standard has required Tesla to invest heavily in technical and business development.\n\nBut Tesla has plenty to gain from working with others.\n\nSam Fiorani, vice president for global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said these efforts should eventually yield huge financial benefits for Tesla, including from environmental credits and fees for charging sessions.\n\nCurrently, Tesla operates about one in three charging stations in the U.S. Even if adoption of battery electric vehicles slows domestically, and the fleet of electric vehicles is smaller than what the government and many automakers planned six months ago, ‚ÄúTesla could still see $6 billion to $12 billion a year,‚Äù by 2030 from its expanded charging business, Fiorani said in an email.\n\nWhile Tesla could lose some customers to other brands by making charging easier, AutoForecast said there are other reasons car buyers flock to Tesla.\n\n‚ÄúPeople shopping for a Tesla aren‚Äôt typically cross-shopping at Kia, Ford, or Mercedes-Benz dealers because they simply want a Tesla,‚Äù Fiorani wrote. ‚ÄúCompetition will continue to heat up and Tesla will inevitably lose some sales to rivals, but loyalty to the brand means the vast majority of owners will return to Tesla with little or no comparison shopping.‚Äù\n\nAllowing other automakers to tap its charging network also opens up some federal money for Tesla under President Biden‚Äôs Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n‚ÄúTesla is not afraid to use government regulations for income and has been working all possible revenue streams for much of its existence,‚Äù Fiorani wrote.\n\nTesla didn‚Äôt respond to a request for further information.\n\nTesla reports charging revenue with its ‚ÄúTotal automotive & services and other segment revenue.‚Äù The company hasn‚Äôt said whether it may break out revenue from non-Tesla vehicle use of its charging network.\n\nWilliam Navarro Jameson, Tesla‚Äôs Strategic Charging Programs lead, wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Thursday that getting to this point with Ford has required a lot of ‚Äúinteroperability testing‚Äù along with creating all the necessary hardware and software integrations and working through legal issues.\n\n‚ÄúThere have been so many pieces to this puzzle that have been put in place over the past 18 months,‚Äù he wrote.\n\nOn social media, Tesla touted the opening up of its charging network in North America and circulated a link to entice more retailers to host Superchargers at their facilities.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/tesla-to-earn-billions-from-charging-partnerships-with-ford-others.html", "id": "1b3kl34", "created_utc": 1709264726.0, "score": 549, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "So Tsla is going to be the Shell and Chevron EV Charge station for America?", "score": 266, "replies": [{"body": "Yes and more.\n\nJust why do you think Tesla is valued more than all the other auto makers combined?

Thought CELH had wider appeal to different audiences that MNST - which continues to turn in solid earnings even after the insane run that it has had over the years - did not. The Amazon reviews were actually good - people liked the flavors and weren't just acting as if they tasted blah but were an excellent delivery system for caffeine.  People on Youtube were drinking them rather than soda.\n\n I had zero interest in energy drinks though as a consumer.\n\nWalked by them one day and thought well, I'd better actually try this if I'm invested in it. Realized that I'd probably hate it, not understand the appeal and wind up selling the stock. Thought I'll have a few sips maybe and dump the rest. Tried it, thought it was delicious, had half and rather than dumping the rest wound up finishing it. Went to try other flavors, added to the position more than a few times and bought a stockpile of various flavors.\n\nI was a Diet Coke drinker for something like 25 years with multiple a day before quitting last year. People's mileage may vary, but for whatever reason one Celsius doesn't get me jittery (or make me feel acidic) in the same way that a few Diet Cokes - which have less caffeine - did. Plus, Celsius has the value add of vitamins for about in the same cost neighborhood as a single 20 oz Diet Coke, which has no value add.\n\nA number of the flavors - probably because of the ginger - also have the sort of 'bite'/crispness that made Diet Cokes appealing and there's a nice range of flavors from crisp/refreshing to more sweet but they are all what I'd consider 'flavor forward' - the flavors are not subtle. Again, everyone's different but imo some of the CELH flavors are the most tasty canned beverages I can recall having in years which - given the caffeine and vitamins - is a feat of food science.\n\nLately, I've seen space devoted to it in many stores start to expand further, as well. They've started to appear on Bravo shows recently too - they were drinking them in a scene a couple of Vanderpump Rules episodes ago. \n\nSo, started because wanted some exposure to a trend that didn't seem to be going anywhere despite all the success over the years, tried it, loved it, bought more of the stock and now drink one most days.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I was curious about BBAI as their earnings is next week.

Extraordinary Popular Delusions\n\n**The Mother of All Speculative Bubbles: Tulip mania**\r  \nTulip mania occurred during the Dutch Golden Age, when the Dutch Republic became a maritime and economic powerhouse, and the Netherlands had the largest economy in the world. The Dutch East India Company held a monopoly on the spice trade, and established the world‚Äôs first stock exchange, boosting Dutch economic growth. When Tulip mania occurred, contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels. The major acceleration began in 1634 and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637.\r  \nTulip mania is widely considered to be the first recorded speculative bubble or asset bubble in history. During this time, tulip bulbs became a symbol of wealth and status, and their prices soared to incredible heights. At the peak of tulip mania, single tulip bulbs were selling for more than ten times the annual income of a skilled artisan. During the height of tulip mania, a skilled crafts worker typically earned about 300 guilders per year (equivalent to around 1,800 euros today). Imagine paying 18,000 euros for a single flower bulb! The rarest tulip bulbs fetched even higher astronomical sums.\r  \nThe term ‚Äútulip mania‚Äù is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble when asset prices deviate dramatically higher from intrinsic values. It serves as a cautionary tale about irrational exuberance in financial markets. Tulip mania gained popular attention in 1841 with the publication of the book ‚Äú**Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds**‚Äù by Scottish journalist Charles Mackay. Mackay claimed that many investors were ruined by the fall in tulip prices. Tulip mania was a fascinating episode in economic history, where the speculative allure of tulips led to both incredible wealth, and eventual disillusionment and financial ruin.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\r  \n**The reported net profits for all of the ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù stocks for the year 2023:**\r  \n‚Ä¢ Apple: The net profit for Apple in 2023 was approximately **$96.99 billion**.\r  \n‚Ä¢ Alphabet (Google): Alphabet‚Äôs net profit for 2023 was approximately **$66.732 billion**.\r  \n‚Ä¢ Microsoft: Microsoft‚Äôs net profit for 2023 was approximately **$72.361 billion**.\r  \n‚Ä¢ Meta (Facebook): Meta‚Äôs net profit for 2023 was approximately **$39 billion**.\r  \n‚Ä¢ Amazon: Amazon‚Äôs net profit for 2023 was approximately **$30.4 billion**.\r  \n‚Ä¢ Tesla: Tesla‚Äôs net profit for 2023 was approximately **$10.79 billion**.\r  \n‚Ä¢ Nvidia: Nvidia‚Äôs net profit for 2023 was approximately **$4.37 billion**.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Id say it is overvalued at this point and wil likely lead the way into the next depression.¬†", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just keep in mind just because it's up now doesn't mean it will still be that way, stocks that go up too fast eventually crash hard.

At the time of the signing, it was said that the energy storage plant will start construction in the first quarter of 2024. But about the exact location of the land has not been found, after the Spring Festival, a source with knowledge of the location of Tesla's energy storage plant, through the map to find, the location is located in the southeast corner of the Tesla factory about 1 kilometer location. It seems to be very close to the Tesla Motors factory. After confirming the location of the factory, we took this photo.   \nAt the site, there are already some building houses and concrete floors on the wet ground, which are on the outside of the fence of the energy storage plant, which may be the land of the construction company. I consulted a person who is doing other works at the site, and he said that the construction of this land will be started soon.   \nAccording to the plan, Tesla's Shanghai energy storage plant will start construction in the first quarter of 2024 and go into production in the fourth quarter. The factory will specialize in the production of Megapack, an ultra-large commercial energy storage battery pack, with an expected annual production of 10,000 units and an energy storage scale of nearly 40 GWh. The products of the Shanghai factory will be sold to the global market. The factory will be Tesla's first factory responsible for manufacturing energy storage systems outside of the U.S. domestic market. Another industry source speculated that Tesla's Superfactory in Shanghai will initially be mainly responsible for packaging integration.
