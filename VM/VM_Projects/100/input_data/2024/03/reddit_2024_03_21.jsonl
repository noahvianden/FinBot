{"title": "DOJ sues Apple over iPhone monopoly", "selftext": "The Department of Justice sued Apple on Thursday, saying its iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its “astronomical valuation” at the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers.\n\nFederal antitrust enforcement and 17 attorneys general also say that Apple’s anti-competitive practices extend beyond the iPhone and Apple Watch businesses, citing Apple’s advertising, browser, FaceTime and news offerings.\n\n“Each step in Apple’s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,” the complaint filed in the District of New Jersey said. Apple shares were down around 1.8% as investors anticipated the lawsuit.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a release that to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple moved to block cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.\n\nThe challenge represents a significant risk to Apple’s walled-garden business model. The company says that complying with regulations costs the company money, could prevent it from introducing new products or services, and could hurt customer demand.\n\nThe lawsuit could force Apple to make changes in some of its most valuable businesses: The iPhone, in which Apple reported over $200 billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, part of the company’s $40 billion wearables business, and its profitable services line, which reported $85 billion in revenue.\n\n“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release.\n\nApple said in a statement that it disagreed with the premise of the lawsuit and that it would defend against it.\n\n“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”\n\nThe lawsuit follows years of investigations into Apple’s business practices and two prior DOJ cases against Apple: One over e-book prices and another over allegations that it colluded with other technology companies to depress salaries.\n\n“This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apple’s monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible,” the complaint said.\n\niMessage, Apple Watch, and cloud gaming\n\nThe complaint highlights comments from CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Some users have asked Apple to improve Android-to-iPhone messaging. Developers have gone as far as creating apps that can circumvent the platform limitations, only to be shut down by Apple.\n\nProsecutors highlighted one exchange between Cook and a consumer.\n\n“Not to make it personal but I can’t send my mom certain videos,” the complaint says one user told Cook, referring to a 2022 interview at a Vox Media event.\n\n“Buy your mom an iPhone,” Cook responded.\n\nThe DOJ is also focusing on Apple’s smartwatch, Apple Watch, saying the company designed it to only work with iPhones, and not Android devices. The company’s decision means that “users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones,” according to the complaint.\n\nThe DOJ said Apple has fought cloud streaming services on its App Store platform, blocking consumer access to high-quality video games on iPhones, echoing complaints from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta.\n\nApple has faced several significant antitrust challenges more recently, largely focused on its control over the iPhone App Store. It mostly won in a civil suit against Epic Games in 2021, although it made concessions during the trial and had to make some changes to its policies under California law.\n\n“Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets,” Assistant Attorney General for antitrust Jonathan Kanter said in the release.\n\nThe company is currently jockeying with the European Commission over whether it’s complying with a new Digital Markets Act, which forces Apple to open up the iPhone app store to rivals such as Microsoft or Epic Games. Apple plans to charge big companies that eschew its app store 50 cents per download.\n\nApple was fined $2 billion in the EU over a dispute with Spotify about whether the music streaming service can link to its website and account system inside of its app.\n\nApple had 64% of the market share for U.S. iPhones in the last quarter of 2023, versus 18% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nApple isn’t the only big tech company facing government scrutiny. The DOJ filed an antitrust case against Google in 2020 over its dominant search position and another year over its advertising business. The DOJ also famously sued Microsoft in the 1990s, eventually forcing it to allow users to unbundle the Internet Explorer browser from the Windows operating system.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/doj-sues-apple-over-iphone-monopoly.html", "id": "1bk7xgd", "created_utc": 1711031573.0, "score": 2723, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 912, "comments": [{"body": "AAPL is 5.92% of SPY.

It's because they can't do the second - they don't have access to the APIs that the iPhone uses to feed notifications to the Apple Watch.\n\nThe \"green bubble\" example is instructive. iPhone users complain about how Androids are junk partly because of the clunky \"green bubble\" experience of trying to text Android users on iMessage.

{"title": "Reddit pops 38% in NYSE debut to open at $47 per share", "selftext": "Reddit shares jumped 38% on Thursday to open at $47 in the first initial public offering for a major social media company since Pinterest’s debut in 2019.\n\nThe 19-year-old website that hosts millions of online forums priced its IPO on Wednesday at $34 a share, the top of the expected range. Reddit and selling shareholders raised about $750 million from the offering, with the company collecting about $519 million.\n\nTrading under the ticker symbol “RDDT,” Reddit is testing investor appetite for new tech stocks after an extended dry spell for IPOs. Since the peak of the technology boom in late 2021, hardly any venture-backed tech companies have gone public and those that have — like Instacart and Klaviyo last year — have underwhelmed. On Wednesday, data center hardware company Astera Labs made its public market debut on Nasdaq and saw its shares soar 72%, underscoring investor excitement over businesses tied to the boom in artificial intelligence.\n\nReddit is taking a haircut from its private market valuation of $10 billion in 2021, a boom year for the tech industry. The mood changed a year later, however, when investors became concerned over rising interest rates and soaring inflation and exited high-risk assets. In response, startups conducted layoffs, trimmed their valuations, and shifted focus to profit over growth.\n\nReddit’s annual sales for 2023 rose 20% to $804 million from $666.7 million a year earlier, the company detailed in its prospectus. The company recorded a net loss of $90.8 million last year, narrower than its loss of $158.6 million in 2022.\n\nBased on its revenue over the past four quarters, Reddit’s $6.5 billion market cap at IPO gives it a price-to-sales ratio of about 8. Alphabet trades for 6.1 times revenue, Meta has a multiple of 9.7, Pinterest’s sits at 7.5 and Snap trades for 3.9 times sales, according to FactSet.\n\nIn addition to those companies, Reddit also counts X, Discord, Wikipedia and Amazon’s Twitch streaming service as competitors in its prospectus.\n\nReddit is betting that data licensing could become a major source of revenue, and said in its filing that it’s entered “certain data licensing arrangements with an aggregate contract value of $203.0 million and terms ranging from two to three years.” This year, Reddit said it plans to recognize roughly $66.4 million in revenue as part of its data licensing deals.\n\nGoogle has also entered into an expanded partnership with Reddit, allowing the search giant to obtain more access to Reddit data to train AI models and improve its products.\n\nReddit revealed on March 15 that the Federal Trade Commission is conducting a non-public inquiry “focused on our sale, licensing, or sharing of user-generated content with third parties to train AI models.” Reddit said it was “not surprised that the FTC has expressed interest” in the company’s data licensing practices related to AI, and that it doesn’t believe that it has “engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practice.”\n\nReddit was founded in 2005 by technology entrepreneurs Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the company’s CEO. Existing stakeholders, including Huffman, sold a combined 6.7 million shares in the IPO.\n\nAs part of the IPO, Reddit gave some of its top moderators and users, known as Redditors, a chance to buy stock through a directed-share program. Companies like Airbnb, Doximity and Rivian have used similar programs to reward their power users and customers.\n\n“I hope they believe in Reddit and support Reddit,” Huffman told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. “But  the goal is just to get them in the deal. Just like any professional investor.”\n\nRedditors have expressed skepticism about the IPO, both because of the company’s financials and its often troubled relationship with moderators. Huffman said he recognizes that reality and acknowledged the controversial subreddit Wallstreetbets, which helped spawn the boom in meme stocks like GameStop.\n\n“That’s the beautiful thing about Reddit, is that they tell it like it is,” Huffman said. “But you have to remember they’re doing that on Reddit. It’s a platform they love, it’s their home on the internet.”\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman is one of Reddit’s major shareholders along with Tencent and Advance Magazine Publishers, the parent company of publishing giant Condé Nast. Altman’s stake in the company was worth over $400 million before the stock began trading. Altman led a $50 million funding round into Reddit in 2014 and was a member of its board from 2015 through 2022.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/reddit-ipo-rddt-starts-trading-on-nyse.html", "id": "1bkbxrj", "created_utc": 1711041638.0, "score": 1161, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 497, "comments": [{"body": "Up 62% now at 55.27.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure if this will hold or be down come their first quarterly report.

I think it would be extremely hard to get a critical mass of users to switch if you even could build an alternative platform. After all, there have been countless “strikes” and “blackouts” not to mention the endless grumbling about this or that with regard to Reddit, yet all the users are still here. There is nowhere else to go. This is also crucial for the following point.\n\nSecond, I think there is huge potential for additional ad growth. Right now all we ever see is scattered general ads in the main feed. I see one for Toyota and one for Amway just glancing right now. There is so much more potential. The whole platform is built around segmented markets aka subreddits. The potential for much more targeted ads is huge. Sports teams advertising tickets and gear on team subs, local businesses advertising on city subs, selling firearm equipment on gun subs, gardening tools on gardening subs, etc. etc. Things could get really targeted and thus really valuable and accessible for tons of advertisers, from the current large companies to mom and pop shops. And, because of the lack of alternatives above, I think users will end up accepting it. They’ll grumble all over Reddit like they do about everything, but they won’t go anywhere. \n\nLastly, I see potential in the AI training. The fact that google paid 60m for it once and Sam Altman is the 3rd biggest Reddit shareholder is enough proof of concept for me. It doesn’t need to be the primary source of revenue (the advertising potential above is plenty), but as a supplemental source it’s very nice. \n\nAlso, just anecdotally, my 68 year old dad came to me asking about how to post on Reddit a couple weeks ago. A month before that my wife learned that her favorite yoga instructor has her own subreddit. These are people that were not conventional “redditors.” This just tells me there is room for more growth in users. This is not to mention the fact that it is heavily US-based with huge oversees growth potential.\n\nMore than anything, I just think the valuation is low. It’s the 3rd most trafficked site in the world. Despite that, the valuation is 1/100th of Facebook and 1/10th of Twitter. I’m not saying it will ever match either of those, but if it goes to 1/50th of Facebook and 1/5th of Facebook (again, we’re talking about the 3rd most trafficked site in the world) then I doubled my money. \n\nI think being a public company will cause for better oversights as well.

Conditions are coming out of an intersection into 35mph zone. Very speedy to get to that 35, best I've experienced where the car takes advantage of its acceleration like a human driver would. Then 55 zone starts and it just crawls up to the 55. Have had to tap the pedal a couple time, different roads, to get it to go. Cars behind me are crawling up my ass because it's not accelerating fast enough.\n\n\nAlso still has the issue of coming from 55mph to a 35 zone and it isn't slowing enough.  It gets a 35mph ahead warning sing but when it passes the official 35mph sign it is still going 45. I have brake and disengage or it's going to get me ticketed in the local speedtraps.\n\n\nFinally, Fuck the switch to the one tap to accitavate FSD and completely removing the option to have TACC & FSD both available to select from. FSD is not perfect yet and not allowing the driver to quickly use TACC, which is slightly more reliable in some situations we drive, without switching to a different profile as a workaround is stupid.\n\n\n5-8 inches of snow coming down soon.

No options.  Or you can choose TACC on one tap but you will not be able to get FSD on a 2nd tap, no option to set it up this way.\n\n\nThe modes are selectable in the menu screens but you have to be at a complete stop to make that selection in the menu.\n\n\nThe workaround is to save 2 different profiles, one for each mode. Then you can switch profiles on the fly when vehicle is moving. It's still cumbersome though as the profile name drops off the main screen to reduce clutter. \nSo on v12.3 you now have to select the vehicle icon to activate the menu screen and then click the current profile name that appears at the top, click the current profile name to get the driver profiles list, then click the other profile set to the other driving mode. That is the quickest way to switch between FSD and TACC in 12.3\n\n\nComplete and utter bullshit. Just trying to force usage on FSD.
