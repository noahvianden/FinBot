Right now it’s a question mark. I own VZ but it’s gone no where for 5 years, has a lot of debt and it has an unknown liability for the lead sheathing issue. The uncertainty means it’s probably fairly valued in low 40s but it’s a reliable dividend yield at 6.3%. Amgen looks cheap but they have a lot of drugs coming off patent and their pipeline has a lot of uncertainty. In other words they are past peak earnings and will see a slow erosion in revenue and earnings. MCD is not a cheap stock at all. Price increases have driven away a large part of the population and they sell low quality food. Competition is also an issue.
