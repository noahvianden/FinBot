{"title": "r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Mar 22, 2024", "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "1bkv6ej", "created_utc": 1711099809.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 200, "comments": [{"body": "Cathie bought RDDT yesterday.

Here's why I believe we've reached a peak and why taking profits now seems the most prudent action.\n\n  \n**The Market Has Peaked**  \nEvidence suggests that the market, especially the tech sector, is currently at or very near its peak. This assessment is based on several key indicators:  \n**Overvaluation of Tech Stocks:** Many tech stocks are trading at incredibly high price-to-earnings ratios, far beyond their historical averages. This overvaluation is a classic sign of a market bubble, where prices are driven by investor sentiment rather than fundamentals.  \n**Market Saturation:** The tech sector has seen exponential growth over the past decade. However, as these companies mature and market saturation approaches, the potential for future growth diminishes. This is especially true in sectors where competition is fierce, and innovation becomes incremental rather than revolutionary.  \n\n\nExit Strategy: I have not been selling all at once. I have been DCA-ing on the way out, but I strongly believe we are due for a market correction.

However, nVidia keeps improving and making new developer tools for DRIVE developers whereas Tesla created their own D1 and wrote the software stack to support it, which is a feat in itself.  It's likely Tesla did this because nothing was available to meet their needs at the time, but times have changed.  nVidia is no longer making the \"generic GPU\" that acts as a side dish for AI that Elon once touted in the past; its focus is now AI/data center with gaming on the side.  nVidia spent an estimated [$10B to develop Blackwell](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96987/nvidia-spent-10-billion-on-developing-its-next-generation-blackwell-gpu/index.html).  Can Tesla afford to keep iterating on D1, its own specialized data center and its own personal software stack?  Does it make sense to continue doing so?  I don't know.\n\nWhat we do know is that Elon thinks acquiring GPUs is [harder than getting drugs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-29/nvidia-s-ai-chip-stands-out-as-tech-s-hottest-product), and he's resorted to [begging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_(microarchitecture)#History) and [borrowing](https://www.thestack.technology/larry-ellison-oracle-gave-elon-musk-gpus-boy-did-they-want-more/) H100s for his companies.  The [head of Dojo has left](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tesla-s-dojo-supercomputer-team-loses-another-key-member-1.2009111) and in the last earnings call, Elon considered [Dojo a long-shot bet and not a \"sure thing](https://www.thestreet.com/electric-vehicles/the-6-craziest-things-elon-musk-said-on-teslas-earnings-call)\".  At this point, Tesla should give up the idea of [Dojo cloud services for AI](https://longportapp.com/en/news/99700151); nVidia and the CSPs own that now and Tesla is way too late in the game to penetrate this market.\n\nGiven how nVidia has invested so much on AI and the data center, maybe Elon/Tesla will flip and reconsider using nVidia's DRIVE platform because making your own chips and writing all the software to support your own platform with your own data center design that only Tesla uses is a very costly endeavor.  Heck, even [AMD can't get the software right on their own AI processor](https://twitter.com/__tinygrad__/status/1770510742007271545) and George Hotz has been working with them for [over a year now](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Lisa-Su-Tweet-OSS-Firmware) trying to democratize AI and reduce nVidia's stronghold.\n\nIt's too bad Tesla didn't collaborate with nVidia on autonomous driving, just like it's too bad Tesla didn't collaborate with OpenAI on Optimus.
