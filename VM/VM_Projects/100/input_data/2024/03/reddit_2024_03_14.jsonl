They argue that recent methodological shifts in government reporting have generally depressed the actual rate of inflation, changing the concept of the CPI away from being a measure of the cost of living needed to maintain a constant standard of living. Calculating inflation today based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) methodologies in place in 1980, the rate of inflation today would be significantly higher than the official rate reported. For instance, as of March 2023, instead of a 5% inflation rate, the inflation rate would have been closer to 14.1% using the old methodology (1980-based). Recent data suggests that the ShadowStats Alternate Rate of **Inflation for 2024 is around 9.07%**.\r  \n\r  \nPlease note that these are estimates based on the methodologies used in 1980.

But in reality, the US is now far worse off financially than in the 2008 financial crisis. With the real economy performing strongly, the US debt should be declining, but it's not. In fact, the US debt is starting to increase exponentially. Heck, even the Fed is losing money for the first time...\n\n**Now even the Federal Reserve is actually losing money**\n\nIn a stunning turn of events, the Federal Reserve is now experiencing losses. As of the end of July 2023, the Federal Reserve reported that it had accumulated operating losses of $83 billion. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign to prop up the financial markets has led to these losses. These losses are due to the Federal Reserve’s overly accommodative monetary policy, and the interest costs associated with its efforts to bailout the US financial markets.\n\nThe Federal Reserve accounts for its losses with an accounting measure it calls a deferred asset. The size of that shortfall now stands at nearly $6.3 billion year-to-date. The deferred asset account is likely to peak in the zone of $100-200 billion, and will likely take 3-4 years to recover.\n\nSince the end of World War II until 2021, the Federal Reserve never experienced any operating losses.\n\nJerome Powell is the first Fed Chairman to preside over an operating loss by the Fed. The Federal Reserve’s losses are expected to continue into the future. The Federal Reserve Board’s own estimates suggest that its cumulative operating losses could approach $200 billion by 2026. Moreover, the Fed projects that it may not resume making any operating profits until 2030 or later.\n\nSo, not only is the Fed losing money for the first time, those losses will increase, and some observers believe the Fed’s losses could eventually as much as double before abating. William English, a former top central bank staffer now at Yale University, sees a “peak” loss of around $200 billion or higher by 2025. Meanwhile, Derek Tang of forecasting firm LH Meyer said the Fed’s loss is likely to hit $200 billion by the end of this year.\n\n**The National Debt Just Hit $34 Trillion**\n\nAs of the latest available data, the U.S. national debt has surpassed $34 trillion. This is a record high and represents the total amount of outstanding borrowing by the U.S. Federal Government accumulated over the nation’s history. The world's largest economy is piling on more debt, with no end in sight as the stakes get higher, as the government continues to borrow to repay its ever-growing debts. In the last century, the U.S. federal debt has risen from an inflation-adjusted $403 billion in 1923 to $33.17 trillion in 2023. The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio surpassed 100% in 2013, and as of the third quarter of 2023, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was approximately 120.13%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, labeled the record debt as a disheartening “achievement.” Despite economic strength and low unemployment, the growth of the national debt is alarmingly escalating. The growing national debt is spiking, in spite of a strong economy, and this is defying conventional fiscal wisdom. Based on conventional fiscal wisdom, this growth in national debt should be impossible during favorable economic conditions.\n\nThe U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Fitch Ratings, one of the major credit rating agencies, in August 2023.

That’s good to know, since in his latest annual report, which was released late last week, Buffett credited his success with dividend-paying stocks as his “secret sauce.” His stellar knowledge of stocks might scare and intimidate you, but Warren Buffett wrote in his 2012 Annual Report that, \"We truly relish the dividends we receive from most of the stocks that Berkshire owns.\" **Buffett rakes in a collective $4.84 billion in annual dividend income** from the dividend paying stocks in his portfolio.\r  \n \r  \nThe Oracle of Omaha, who hosted some 40,000 investors last weekend at his famed annual meeting in Omaha, clearly likes receiving dividends -- nearly 90% of his portfolio is in dividend stocks. So why exactly does buy them? The answer lies in understanding optimal capital allocation, or simply just put your money to work for you. Your primary goal in investing should be to buy income producing assets. Instead of thinking that the burden is all on you, and that you yourself must perform admirably, and become a savant stock picker, why not boost your portfolio’s performance with dividend-paying stocks, just like Buffett.\r  \n \r  \nBerkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE: BRK.A and BRK.B) portfolio includes energy stock Chevron (NYSE: CVX), which is riding a 35-year streak of increasing its base annual dividend payout. Chevron gives a big boost to Buffett's bottom line with nearly a cool billion **($964,107,966) in annual dividends**.\r  \n \r  \nThe Oracle of Omaha and his investment team love bank stocks. In particular, they've really piled into Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), or BofA for short. Over the next 12 months, Berkshire Hathaway will collect almost **$909 million in dividend income** from BofA.\r  \n \r  \nLast year, Buffett and his investing lieutenants (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) oversaw the purchase of more than 194 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). While these common shares are netting Berkshire Hathaway $101 million in yearly dividend income, it's the $10 billion invested in Occidental preferred stock yielding 8% which is providing the bulk of **dividend income from this company ($800 million annually)**.\r  \n \r  \nAnother big-time income producer that should come as absolutely no surprise to most investors is tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding by a considerable amount, and Apple is on track to provide Buffett with **$842 million in dividend income** this year.\r  \n \r  \nBuffett and his team are also raking in a boatload of annual dividend income from beverage stock Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Coke is Berkshire Hathaway's longest-held stock (since 1988), and it'll likely be increasing its base annual dividend payout for the 61st consecutive year in 2023. Coca-Cola pays Buffett **$704,000,000 in annual dividend income**.\r  \n \r  \nConsumer staples stock Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) is one of Berkshire Hathaway's riskiest investments (and possibly Buffett worst stock, Kraft Heinz's balance sheet is weighed down by debt).

Then, in 1919, a group of businessmen led by Ernest Woodruff purchased The Coca-Cola Company from Candler for $25 million. Later that year, Coca-Cola made its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), for $40 per share.\r  \n \r  \nCoca-Cola’s long history of stability has positioned the company as one of the world’s most recognizable brands, with overwhelming consumer loyalty – not to mention consecutive dividend increases – which has helped the company remain popular with investors for decades. As of the 2016 annual report, Coca-Cola shares have risen so that the company’s market capitalization is roughly $180 billion, and has had 53 consecutive dividend increases. **At the end of 2015, one share of KO stock purchased in 1919 (with dividends reinvested and stock splits) would have been worth $12,748,802, an annual growth rate of 14.11%.**", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Good point and I make sure to own some of those too!

As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3½ on core. On a six-\nmonth annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent, though when you look at supercore and\nshelter, they are, of course, stickier. So when looking in the different components of the data,\nhow much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates?\n\n>CHAIR POWELL. I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates\nis that policy would be, it would be too late. I mean, you’d want to be reducing restriction on the\neconomy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot,\nif we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity. You know, it takes—it\ntakes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation\n\nWaller said rising real rates is enough of reason:\n\n>If inflation continues to cool “for several more months — I don’t know how long that might be — three months, four months, five months — that we feel confident that inflation is really down and on its way, you could then start lowering the policy rate just because inflation is lower,” Waller said in remarks at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. “It has nothing to do with trying to save the economy or recession.”\n\nRecent interview from 60 minutes:\n\n>Pelley: Why is your target [interest] rate 2%?\n\n>Powell: Why isn't it zero, I guess, is the question.  And the reason is 2% is interest rates always include an estimate of future inflation.\n>If that estimate is 2%, that means you'll have 2% more that you can cut in interest rates. The central bank will have more ammunition, more power to fight a downturn if rates are a little bit higher. \n\n>Pelley: Are you committed to getting all the way to 2.0 before you cut the rates?\n\n>Powell: No, no.

In Q4, CPI came in at 2.7% annualized and the GDP deflator only at 1.7% annualized. And the February year over year number came in at 3.2% for CPI and 2.8% for PPI. So you are maybe reading way too much into one month annualized numbers if you have it over ~3%. \n\nAnd at any rate, I don't think the market expectations have it over 3%, and if those expectations turn out to be wrong, and it does end up over 5%, I think you will see some pain in equities markets as they adjust to that reality. I think market valuations are as high as they in part due to expectations of low inflation and of looming rate cuts. \n\nIn general, I would agree that \"time in the market beats timing the market\".  But I don't like to ignore valuations, either. [Market Cap to GDP](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php) for example suggests that equities will underperform bonds over the next decade, if valuations tend to revert to the mean. \n\nI'm not quite as pessimistic as that, as I think there are some underlying reasons that valuations may remain relatively high.

Things like continued tightness in labor markets, potential for yet more strikes and labor unrest, plus a recent trend towards over-regulation (such DOJ blocking the Jetblue/Spirit merger, and proposed EPA regulations that could seriously squeeze the auto sector), as well as the potential for continued fiscal policy excess and inflation, all could weigh on profits. \n\nSo in the meantime, I think one of the best values available for small time individual investors right now are inflation protected series I Savings bonds, which currently are paying 5.27%, and which pretty much guarantee a *real* return of ~ 1.3% annually for the next 30 years.

Langan expects Tesla’s sales volumes to be flat this year and to fall in 2025.* \n\n*Elon Musk’s company is a “growth company with no growth,” Langan wrote. He highlighted that sales volumes rose only 3% in the second half of 2023 from the first half, while prices fell 5%.*\r  \n\r  \n*Tesla analysts are getting increasingly wary, and the share of bullish ratings on the stock has dropped to the lowest since April 2021. Sentiment deteriorated after the company in January said its growth will be “notably lower” this year, while other automakers, EV suppliers and even rental-car companies have sounded similarly cautious comments about the near-term demand for EVs.*\r  \n\r  \n*As a pure-play EV company with an eye-wateringly high valuation, Tesla shares have taken a serious hit. The stock has already fallen 29% this year through Tuesday’s close, placing it among the worst performers on the S&P 500 Index. The Austin-based company fell as much as 2.8% by 9:32 a.m. in New York.*\r  \n\r  \n*This year’s selloff has wiped more than $224 billion from the company’s market value through its last close, and pushed it off the list of the 10 biggest companies on the S&P 500.* \r  \n\r  \n*Even after the decline, the stock still trades at 55 times its forward earnings, compared to the average of about 31 for the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Price Return Index.* \r  \n\r  \n*“While an EV and battery technology leader, Tesla screens poorly relative to Mag 7 peers,” Wells Fargo’s Langan said, noting the valuation discrepancy. The analyst lowered his 2024 profit estimate for the company to $2 a share from $2.40. That compares to analysts’ average expectation of $3.03 a share for the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.*\r  \n\r  \n*Still, some analysts see a bright future for the company, and the drop in shares reflect an overly bearish outlook.*\r  \n\r\n\n*“The demand story for EVs globally has clearly moderated, however we believe Tesla is on the broader trajectory to see growth and margin improvement return to the story over the coming quarters,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Wednesday. “Now is not the time to throw in the towel on Tesla*.” \n\n***Ross Gerber on Yahoo finance***: \"*The original story that I think most investors bought into with Tesla didn't really include Elon and Twitter. And... for a long time, we all hoped that it really wouldn't affect Tesla and the demand for its products,\" Gerber says. \"We all know that that has now happened.

The rise and fall of share price values affects a company’s market capitalization and therefore its market value. The higher shares are priced, the more a company is worth in market value and vice versa. The market value of a company can be important when considering mergers and/or acquisitions that involve shares as part of the deal.\n\nShare issuance decisions can also be affected by stock performance. If a stock is doing well, a company might be more inclined to issue more shares because they believe they can raise more capital at the higher value.\n\nStock market performance also affects a company’s cost of capital. Companies must average the costs of both their debt and equity capital when arriving at a weighted average cost of capital, which is used for many analysis scenarios. The higher the expected market performance, the higher the cost of equity capital will be. As cost of equity capital rises, present value calculations lower because companies must use a higher discounting rate.\n\nCompanies may also have substantial capital investments in their stock which can lead to problems if the stock falls. For example, companies may hold shares as cash equivalents or use shares as backing for pension funds. In any case, when shares fall, the value decreases, which can lead to funding problems.\n\nPositive increases in stock values can also potentially generate new interests for a particular company or sector.

But the truth is they don't actually care about that, just about maintaining their power. So when musk bought Twitter and released the Twitter files (proving politicians have direct access to social media moderation) they went apeshit. Imo if (most) democrat leaders actually cared about solving climate change they would have invested in making nuclear safer decades ago instead of dismantling it. If billions will die and our plans keep missing deadlines/aren't working, why haven't we been building tons more nuclear for years? The answer is that they might literally just want to keep climate change around as a perpetual crisis to get people to vote for them. But they won't actually solve it, just act like they are very veryyyy slowly to get votes, and they'll also try to stop anyone who will solve it (like Musk and nuclear) because if it's solved then they won't have a crisis to run for office with. This, imo, is why democrats almost never get anything done. It's simple, they (again most but not all of the leaders) just don't care.\n\nAs an actual environmentalist, and a democratic socialist, I wholeheartedly support Tesla and Elon because they're simply making the most progress towards solving the problem.

Musk eventually relented on the conventionally driven vehicle because Moravy and von Holzhausen convinced him that it could be built on the same platform as Robotaxi.\n\nBy February 2023, von Holzhausen's team had completed NGV designs for both the conventionally driven vehicle and Robotaxi.\n\nIn mid-2023, Musk decided to move initial NGV production to Texas from Mexico.  The expansion of Gigafactory Texas has been under construction since early 2023.\n\n**Robotaxi, robotaxi, and robotaxi**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNGV is arriving in 2025 rather than 2023, because Tesla didn't even know exactly what they wanted to do after Model 3/Y", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I sure hope they have a road map to upgrade the model 3 and y by 2027, cuz it seems to me tesla has trouble working on more than one car at a time.

Not even near the peak, 24 years later.\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/09/23/cisco-stock-history-what-investors-need-to-know.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/09/23/cisco-stock-history-what-investors-need-to-know.aspx)\n\nOther established companies, like [EMC](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/delisted/EMC.//stock-price-history) and even Microsoft saw huge valuation bubbles based purely on hype and speculative growth estimates that could not be reconciled with reality.\n\nEven if you only attributed the dot com bubble to pre earnings or pre revenue companies, the segments where everyone is saying Tesla will grow are essentially pre-earnings and pre-revenue.\n\nTesla is is a microcosm of the dot com bubble.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "You provide an accurate account of history. And the Cisco bubble which - as I see it - shares parallels to NVIDIA today, though I am not convinced it applies to Tesla.\n\nThe Cisco of yore and NVIDIA of today design products using the same underlying technology and suppliers that everybody else uses. They used market dominance to enforce a near monopoly but it wasn't one people were happy with. Their moats were largely perceptual (or the result of anti-competitive practices) and once people realized much cheaper alternatives existed the bottom fell out.\n\nTesla is a more diverse and a more vertically integrated company.\n\nOthers can make attractive EVs with great specs but they are struggling very hard to make them at volume and for a profit. They simply don't have the same manufacturing prowess, the same integration.\n\nTesla was always headed for a correction following the COVID stock price spike (and hype). And we know this year will be difficult for them because it's a ramp-up period for new products which has tempered some of that hype. Probably a good thing this happened.\n\nBut the reality remains that Tesla has been growing, is projected to grow another 20% this year, and will accelerate in 2025/2026 once their $25k vehicle starts ramping. Contrast that to everybody else who isn't Tesla or BYD and they would *love* to see 20% growth and profitability this year.\n\nThere is no argument that the EVs will continue to expand. EVs will proliferate until eventually pushing ICE vehicles into obscurity. The EV market has a lot of room to grow and battery prices will probably drop by another 40-50% over the next 18 months which will push demand ever higher.\n\nAll the while Tesla will keep building out their charge network. Improving their software. Making their factories more efficient. Their home and grid energy storage business will continue growing (demand there is off the charts as well). \n\nAnd Tesla keeps pouring billions into fundamental R&D which I think is a good sign. R&D doesn't always result in new innovations or better products in the future, but a *lack* of R&D guarantees against it. Tesla is at the forefront of new technology. Everything from lithium refining, battery chemistries, motors and related electronics, and software.
