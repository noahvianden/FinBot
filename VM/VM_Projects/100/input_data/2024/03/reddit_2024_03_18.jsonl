Omniverse will be the holy grain of prototyping for any manufacturing industry from a small product to a whole manufacturing plant. \n\nThe nice part about Nvidia is that nothing Jensen talks about is new. The idea of drug discovery, robotics, digital twins, etc. are all decades old. But what Nvidia does is to unify them and to make them accessible for each industry. Nvidia creates platforms and environments to finally put all the ideas to practice. But the process is slow and will be slow.

My example of Mercedes above can be easily swapped with BMW, Porsche, BYD, GM, Ford and so on.

At the same time, Apple is working on offering its own on-device AI models and capabilities with the upcoming iOS 18 release.\nThe discussions are still underway, and it’s unclear how the AI agreement will be branded. This would be a significant expansion of the existing relationship — default search engine — between the two companies.\nLooking at the rest of the industry, Google announced a partnership with Samsung in February to have Gemini power summarization features in the Galaxy S24’s notes and voice recording apps, as well as keyboard. Samsung is also using Imagen 2 text-to-image diffusion for a generative editing feature in the photo gallery app. Those features all require server-side processing, but Samsung is also using an on-device version of Gemini.\nGoogle offers Gemini in three sizes, with Pro being used by most first and third-party apps.

{"title": "Lemon-Musk interview: Musk teases Tesla flying cars w/ SpaceX. Stock is up 6%. Are flying cars baked in the stock price?", "selftext": "\"*Billionaire Elon Musk has teased the possibility of producing a commercially-available flying car as the next generation of Tesla vehicles.*\n\n*In an interview with journalist Don Lemon released in full on Monday morning, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was asked about the new model of the Roadster—the car manufacturer's original design—which is due to be released next year. \"Look, I don't want to give away much more than what I've said publicly, except that the Roadster will be a collaboration between SpaceX and Tesla—so you can expect some rocket-y stuff there,\" he said.*  \n*Asked by Lemon if it could be a flying car, Musk responded: \"Maybe,\" before waggling his head and laughing. \"It's not out of the question. I've got to reserve the cool stuff for when we actually unveil it, but it's going to be really cool; it's going to have some rocket technology in it.\"*\n\n*He added: \"I think, really, the only way to do something that's cooler than the Cybertruck is to combine SpaceX and Tesla technology to create something that's not ever really a car.\"*\n\n*\"Then what would it be?\" Lemon asked.*\n\n*\"Something that's never existed before,\" Musk said, before agreeing with Lemon that it would have \"Jetsons vibes,\" a reference to the space age Hanna-Barbera cartoon which features flying cars.*\n\n***The Context***:\n\n*Tesla would not be the first company to attempt to build a commercially viable flying car. Several start-ups have been making use of advances in electric vehicle technology in recent years to design vehicles that hope to live up to science fiction.*\n\n*Most recently, San Mateo, California-based start-up Alef previously told Newsweek its prototype—which received Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) approval for testing last year, and operates using a hollow body and internal rotors—was in the works. The company said pre-orders for the $300,000 vehicle had surged since the start of 2023.*\n\n*However, no company has so far been able to secure regulatory approval for a flying road car, which would come with safety requirements and considerations that ground-based vehicles do not have to meet. For Tesla to bring a flying car to market, it would need FAA certification under the agency's adapted regulatory framework.\"*\n\n***What We Know***:\n\n*Musk has previously teased the collaboration between his two companies in a June 2018 post on X, formerly Twitter—a platform which he now also owns.*\n\n*At the time, he said the electric sports car would have a SpaceX-designed optional package that would include around \"10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around \\[the\\] car\" that would \"dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly...\"*\n\n*In 2019, he wrote that the new model would be able to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.1 seconds \"before adding \\[the\\] rocket thruster option.\"*\n\n*Then late last month, Musk wrote on X that he had \"radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster,\" adding: \"There will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car.\"*\n\n***Source***: [*https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-teases-tesla-flying-car-spacex-don-lemon-interview-1880275*](https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-teases-tesla-flying-car-spacex-don-lemon-interview-1880275)\n\n", "id": "1bhuhzh", "created_utc": 1710778205.0, "score": 374, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 383, "comments": [{"body": "Elon has spoken multiple times about how flying cars make no sense just because to stay up they have to basically be as loud as helicopters.

It’s pretty obvious that people a) didn’t read the article, b) *only* read the article, or c) only saw the 2 minute clip of the interview with no context stating the car “may be able to fly”\n\n\nIf you watch the full interview, it’s literally so obvious he’s joking. He stated multiple times on the interview that he can’t give away too much information but that it’ll be a really cool collaboration between space-x and Tesla. Lemon kept squeezing Musk for more info and Musk just sorta gave in saying “maybe the car will be able to fly lol 😉”\n\nLike c’mon, do people not realize this kind of talk affects stock prices? Elon obviously has to be careful with what he says & can’t give away too much info.\n\nThe Tesla share price went up 6% yesterday because the FOMC meeting is on Wednesday. Tesla is not down because of Elon’s mean tweets. Normal people don’t care about stuff like that. A reasonable person would recognize that he’s 1 person out of a company with 140k+ talented hard workers. Tesla is one of those stocks that has been severely held down by the interest rate hikes ever since they started Q1 2022. Buying a new car is a major financial decision for the average American, so obviously high interest rates are going to prevent a lot of families from buying a car during a period of economic difficulties across the country. That’s why Elon Musk has been whining about these interest rate hikes on Twitter ever since they started Q1 2022. Once the Fed starts cutting interest rates, the Tesla share price will recover just like majority of the rest of the market has.\n\nI’m genuinely baffled that people (and the legacy media) are running with this. How can something so simple be spun completely out of context? Like this is literally concerning & dangerous. Any sensible person that actually watched the interview would be able to tell that he’s just excited/passionate about the Roadster. My interpretation is that driving it will *feel* like you’re flying because of all the space-x collaboration stuff that will make the car unique. That’s literally all he said. If the space-x collaboration is some kind of GPS satellite stuff included on the touchscreen - that is more than enough for me. But even then, he clearly didn’t make any promises.

The introduction of a flying car is not just a leap towards advanced personal transportation but a testament to our relentless pursuit of reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and making travel more efficient and enjoyable. \n\n### The Vision\n\nAt Tesla, our vision has always been about more than just electric cars. It's about fundamentally transforming transportation. With our new flying car, we're taking this transformation to the skies, literally. The congestion on our roads today isn't just an inconvenience; it's a problem that affects our planet's health, our cities' livability, and our individual stress levels. By introducing a Tesla flying car with FSD capabilities, we're opening up a new dimension of travel, promising to make journeys faster, safer, and cleaner.\n\n### Technological Innovation\n\nThe key to realizing this vision is our advanced FSD technology. Developing FSD capabilities for ground vehicles has provided us with invaluable experience and data, laying the foundation for adapting these technologies for aerial use. The challenges are substantial, from navigating three-dimensional space to dealing with a far greater variety of obstacles and weather conditions. However, our progress in neural network training, sensor fusion, and algorithm optimization uniquely positions us to tackle these challenges head-on.\n\n### Safety First\n\nSafety is our paramount concern. The introduction of flying cars raises valid questions about air traffic, collision avoidance, and emergency protocols. Our approach is multi-faceted. Firstly, we're leveraging our advanced FSD technology, which integrates real-time data from multiple sensors to make split-second decisions with precision far beyond human capabilities. Secondly, we're working closely with aviation authorities worldwide to define new air traffic management systems that accommodate both traditional aircraft and flying cars. This includes dedicated flight corridors, automatic deconfliction technologies, and emergency landing protocols.\n\n### Energy Efficiency\n\nOne of the most critical aspects of Tesla's flying car is its energy efficiency. Our expertise in electric vehicles gives us a unique advantage in creating an electric flying car that is not only clean but also efficient. We're incorporating next-generation batteries with higher energy densities and faster charging capabilities, ensuring that our flying cars have a range and endurance that make them practical for daily use. Additionally, the design of the flying car maximizes aerodynamic efficiency, reducing energy consumption even further.\n\n### The User Experience\n\nThe user experience of Tesla's flying car with FSD will be unparalleled. Imagine commuting to work, not stuck in traffic, but soaring above it, all while reading, working, or simply enjoying the view. The interior will reflect Tesla's minimalist, comfort-focused design philosophy, with advanced connectivity and entertainment options. The FSD system will not only navigate the most efficient route automatically but also ensure a smooth and serene flight, making travel not just a means to an end but a delightful experience in itself.\n\n### Environmental Impact\n\nTesla's mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy is at the core of our flying car project. By leveraging electric propulsion, we're not just reducing noise pollution compared to traditional combustion-engine aircraft but also significantly cutting down on CO2 emissions. Our vision is for flying cars to be powered entirely by renewable energy, sourced from solar, wind, and other green technologies, making air travel a net positive for the planet.\n\n### The Road Ahead\n\nThe journey to make Tesla's flying cars a reality is undoubtedly challenging. It requires not just technological breakthroughs but also regulatory changes, infrastructure development, and public acceptance. We're committed to working with governments, communities, and other stakeholders to address these challenges collaboratively. Our track record of innovation and our commitment to a sustainable future give us confidence that we can, and will, make Tesla flying cars a reality.\n\nIn conclusion, Tesla's new flying car with FSD is more than a new product. It's a bold step into the future of transportation, embodying our commitment to innovation, safety, and sustainability. It represents a convergence of our work in electric vehicles, autonomous driving, and renewable energy, promising to revolutionize how we travel and, indeed, how we live our lives.

{"title": "Nvidia announces Blackwell AI chips that will launch later this year", "selftext": "Nvidia on Monday announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running AI models. The announcement, made during Nvidia’s developer’s conference in San Jose, comes as the chipmaker seeks to solidify its position as the go-to supplier for AI companies.\n\nNvidia’s share price is up five-fold and total sales have more than tripled since OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom in late 2022. Nvidia’s high-end server GPUs are essential for training and deploying large AI models. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have spent billions of dollars buying the chips.\n\nThe new generation of AI graphics processors is named Blackwell. The first Blackwell chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year. Nvidia is enticing its customers with more powerful chips to spur new orders. Companies and software makers, for example, are still scrambling to get their hands on the current generation of H100s and similar chips.\n\n“Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at the company’s developer conference in San Jose, California. “Let me introduce you to a very big GPU.”\n\nThe company also introduced revenue-generating software called NIM that will make it easier to deploy AI, giving customers another reason to stick with Nvidia chips over a rising field of competitors.\n\nNvidia executives say that the company is becoming less of a mercenary chip provider and more of a platform provider, like Microsoft or Apple, on which other companies can build software.\n\n“The sellable commercial product was the GPU and the software was all to help people use the GPU in different ways,” said Nvidia enterprise VP Manuvir Das in an interview. “Of course, we still do that. But what’s really changed is, we really have a commercial software business now.”\n\nDas said Nvidia’s new software will make it easier to run programs on any of Nvidia’s GPUs, even older ones that might be better suited for deploying but not building AI.\n\n“If you’re a developer, you’ve got an interesting model you want people to adopt, if you put it in a NIM, we’ll make sure that it’s runnable on all our GPUs, so you reach a lot of people,” Das said.\n\nEvery two years Nvidia updates its GPU architecture, unlocking a big jump in performance. Many of the AI models released over the past year were trained on the company’s Hopper architecture — used by chips such as the H100 — which was announced in 2022.\n\nNvidia says Blackwell-based processors, like the GB200, offer a huge performance upgrade for AI companies, with 20 petaflops in AI performance versus 4 petaflops for the H100. The additional processing power will enable AI companies to train bigger and more intricate models, Nvidia said.\n\nThe chip includes what Nvidia calls a “transformer engine specifically built to run transformers-based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning ChatGPT.\n\nThe Blackwell GPU is large and combines two separately manufactured dies into one chip manufactured by TSMC. It will also be available as an entire server called the GB200 NVLink 2, combining 72 Blackwell GPUs and other Nvidia parts designed to train AI models.\n\nAmazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle will sell access to the GB200 through cloud services. The GB200 pairs two B200 Blackwell GPUs with one Arm-based Grace CPU. Nvidia said Amazon Web Services would build a server cluster with 20,000 GB200 chips.\n\nNvidia said that the system can deploy a 27-trillion-parameter model. That’s much larger than even the biggest models, such as GPT-4, which reportedly has 1.7 trillion parameters. Many artificial intelligence researchers believe bigger models with more parameters and data could unlock new capabilities.\n\nNvidia didn’t provide a cost for the new GB200 or the systems it’s used in. Nvidia’s Hopper-based H100 costs between $25,000 and $40,000 per chip, with whole systems that cost as much as $200,000, according to analyst estimates.\n\nNvidia also announced it’s adding a new product named NIM to its Nvidia enterprise software subscription.\n\nNIM makes it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference, or the process of running AI software, and will allow companies to continue to use the hundreds of millions of Nvidia GPUs they already own. Inference requires less computational power than the initial training of a new AI model. NIM enables companies that want to run their own AI models, instead of buying access to AI results as a service from companies like OpenAI.\n\nThe strategy is to get customers who buy Nvidia-based servers to sign up for Nvidia enterprise, which costs $4,500 per GPU per year for a license.\n\nNvidia will work with AI companies like Microsoft or Hugging Face to ensure their AI models are tuned to run on all compatible Nvidia chips. Then, using a NIM, developers can efficiently run the model on their own servers or cloud-based Nvidia servers without a lengthy configuration process.\n\n“In my code, where I was calling into OpenAI, I will replace one line of code to point it to this NIM that I got from Nvidia instead,” Das said.\n\nNvidia says the software will also help AI run on GPU-equipped laptops, instead of on servers in the cloud.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/18/nvidia-announces-gb200-blackwell-ai-chip-launching-later-this-year.html", "id": "1bi129l", "created_utc": 1710793879.0, "score": 1214, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 255, "comments": [{"body": "Blackwell sounds like a code name for an evil ai from a scary video game", "score": 485, "replies": [{"body": "Like the Blackwall from Cyberpunk", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "It’s not the Blackwall you should be afraid of, it’s what lies beyond it.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Have no mouth", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You know what, that's probably why I thought of it.", "score": 22, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What makes you think it's not....", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "*insert dramatic music here*", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Dum dum....que Hans simmer......", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Its named after David Blackwell", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, it's named after the mathematician, game theorist David Blackwell.", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I think it’s named after David Blackwell.

Nvidia started making its own cards with 3090 and company. It built on this foundation for A100 with the Redstone chips selling heatsinks and GPU boards.

Another part is the power efficiency but that’s a minor part. \n\nAll in probably roughly the same jump as Ampere to Hopper.

{"title": "How Does TSLA Get to 20M EV Sales by 2030?", "selftext": "I'm doing an updated DCF analysis following TSLA's recent price drop and I want clarity on some assumptions.\n\nCurrently the maximum production for TSLA's factories are:\n\n||Model S/X|Model 3/Y|Semi|Cybertruck|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Fremount|100,000|550,000|||\n|Nevada|||(Pilot)||\n|Shanghai||950,000|||\n|Berlin||375,000|||\n|Texas||250,000||125,000|\n|**Total**|**100,000**|**2,125,000**|**0**|**125,000**|\n\nThis adds up to 2.35m. However, TSLA sold \\~1.8m vehicles in 2023, of which \\~500k were the Model 3 and \\~1.2m were the Model Y.\n\nCurrently TSLA has excess production capacity but since Model 3/Y sales have stagnated, this is being underutilised. \n\nTSLA currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 40. I believe this is pricing in the next growth phase when the next-generation vehicle is released. The current rumours are that it'll begin mass production in July 2025, and I've assumed it'll take 18m to ramp up to a \\~500,000 production rate (December 2026) with annual production of 1.3m by Dec 2027.\n\nSo by December 2027, I am assuming the following sales:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Model S/X|60,000 (slightly lower than now)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Model 3|500,000 (same as now)|\n|Model Y|1,000,000 (slightly lower than now)|\n|Semi|75,000|\n|Cybertruck|400,000|\n|Roadster|60,000|\n|$25,000 Vehicle|1,300,000|\n\nThis totals \\~3.3m and by this time, Gigafactory Mexico will be up and running so along with expansions of of other sites, TSLA should have enough capacity.\n\nI know I'm only looking 4 years ahead, but how is TSLA expecting to ramp up to 20m in the following 3 years? Elon Musk has commented the need for 10-12 Gigafactories by 2030 but that doesn't seem sensible with these assumed sales figures. I've only included TSLA's announced vehicles but they cover a large variety of market segments so I don't personally think the next major growth driver will be a new vehicle; it'll have to be something like energy storage or FSD.\n\nSo I want to discuss my assumed vehicle sales numbers. Am I not being optimistic enough? What are the predicted sales numbers for the next generation vehicle?  Baring in mind that the US is typically not a large market for hatchbacks and the top-selling hatchback of 2023 was the Toyota Corrolla, which sold \\~1m. Personally, I think the biggest wildcard is the Tesla Semi, since sales of heavy truck vehicles are predicted to reach 4.76m by 2030, which not only makes 75,000 seem very low, the margins are also likely to be greater. But even if you assume \\~2m Semi sales, that's still \\~5m annual sales, well off 20m.\n\nWhy would another 4-6 Gigafactory's be needed and what would they produce?", "id": "1bhqfj5", "created_utc": 1710767658.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 167, "comments": [{"body": "20 millions by 2030 Is very probably not reachable, we might see 10-12 millions by 2030 and 20 millions by 2035.\n\nThe model 2 won't sell 1 million cars /year, it will be like the Ford model T.

When you buy a car you cannot just return the car and get something else. You’re stuck with that car unless you resell it for a loss. That’s called switching costs.

Gm stopped making self driving tech. Hyundai stopped as well. Google waymo self driving tech doesn’t work unless it’s on specific streets only in half of phoenix arizona. Waymo cannot drive in the highway. Uber abandoned ev and self driving. There are massive barriers to entry that are killing multi billion dollar conglomerates from entering. That’s called barriers to entry. Even GM and Ford are having problems entering the ev industry and both have abandoned self driving tech. The robotaxi is viable today with Tesla’s 12.3 and 12.4 release. No one comes close including Google. Tesla will have a monopoly on self driving.

I agree with you, and while I tend to refrain from putting down numbers here, my own personal trajectory is reasonably similar to yours. \n\nSome notes: \n\n* There's very little chance of Gen3 reaching 'mass' production in 2025. Several engineering and supply chain realities make this... basically impossible. If it does reach production, it'll be in a massively cut down pre-production form. I don't expect mass production of Gen3 until late 2026 at the earliest. \n* Giga Mexico appears to be... basically abandoned at this point. We'll see if that continues to be true, but at this point I don't see it hitting stride until 2028 or so. My take is only Austin and Berlin can take the lead with Gen3 right now. The Chinese market is deeply in overcapacity, so any money put towards Shanghai is a profitability quagmire until at least the end of the decade. \n* Semi production is a weird one, as Tesla sits there stale while competitors (Volvo, Daimler) have already ramped up.

For instance, the Volvo FH is offered in 4×2, 6×2, 6×4, 8×2, and 8×4 configurations, and the FE comes as a day cab, short sleeper cab, sleeper cab, and low entry cab. You can get everything from a cement mixer, to a water tank version, to a street sweeper, to a vehicle loader.\n\nThink about this for a moment and how foreign it is to Tesla's current model and trajectory with the Semi, and the problem becomes a lot more... intractable for them.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Surely they can start with the Semi and expand offerings over time using the same platform?

Are they going to do it while already running behind Volvo or Daimler on production capability? They either need to hire new engineering resources, or divert existing resources from other projects. So far they haven't shown inclinations to do any of those things nor have they mentioned any of those things in reporting, and time is running out. \n\nThere are just so many real-world considerations I don't think people have given serious thought to with regards to Semi — the path for success is narrower and more complicated than \"ramp up\".

His statements are pure projection and reflects how he acts -- based on incentives. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the balance between free speech and hate speech:  \n\n* Musk's position is that Twitter allowing hate speech to be published on the platform (Tweets containing racist caricatures of Jewish and African American citizens are what Lemon showed Musk), is different than Twitter promoting hate speech.  Musk seems to think that racist and inflammatory tweets should be allowed, as long as Twitter doesn't push those tweets to a wide audience.\n   * I don't agree with this perspective, since the Twitter algorithm seems to feed people more and more of what they interact with.  Radicalizing even a small number of people to violence can have lethal consequences.
