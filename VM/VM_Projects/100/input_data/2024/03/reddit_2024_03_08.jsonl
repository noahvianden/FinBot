Below are the link and article:\n\nhttps://wccftech.com/nvidia-loses-almost-the-entire-market-cap-of-uber-as-call-options-get-monetized/amp/\n\nToday's price action has not been prompted by any specific news. Instead, this is a classic response to a call-heavy regime. With the end of the week approaching, traders began exercising their in-the-money call options on NVIDIA earlier today. This then prompted option dealers to unwind their hedges by selling the underlying NVIDIA shares, compounding today's selloff.\n\nNVIDIA closed at a market capitalization of $2.317 trillion yesterday. At the time of writing, the stock boasts a market cap of $2.18 trillion. This means that within a span of just a few hours, NVIDIA has lost $137 billion in market cap, or around 84 percent of Uber's entire market capitalization!\n\nAs we reported in a previous post, traders spent a whopping $20 billion betting on NVIDIA's options in the last week of February, eclipsing the rest of the \"Magnificent 7\" grouping of high-flying names by a wide margin. This options-heavy regime, however, is working against the bulls today.\n\nNonetheless, NVIDIA is likely to remain a momentum front-runner for the time being on the back of aggressive AI-related tailwinds. Consider the fact that the company's data center segment recently reported quarterly revenue of $18.4 billion vs. just around $3.6 billion in the comparable quarter last year. Moreover, the GPU manufacturer now expects to earn $24 billion, give or take 2 percent, in the ongoing quarter.\n\nWe noted recently that Nancy Pelosi had earned 10 years' worth of pay in unrealized gains in just 103 days by placing a smart bet on NVIDIA via deep-in-the-money call options.

{"title": "Costco misses holiday-quarter revenue expectations despite online growth", "selftext": "Costco on Thursday missed Wall Street‚Äôs revenue expectations for its holiday quarter, despite reporting year-over-year sales growth and strong e-commerce gains.\n\nShares of the retailer fell about 4% in aftermarket trading. The retailer‚Äôs stock had hit a 52-week high earlier in the day.\n\nHere‚Äôs what the retailer reported for its fiscal second quarter of 2024 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: $3.92 vs. $3.62 expected\n\nRevenue: $58.44 billion vs. $59.16 billion expected\n\nIn the three-month period that ended Feb. 18, Costco‚Äôs net income rose to $1.74 billion, or $3.92 per share, compared to $1.47 billion, or $3.30 per share, a year earlier.\n\nCostco‚Äôs revenue for the quarter increased from $55.27 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nComparable sales for the company increased 5.6% year over year and 4.3% in the U.S. Excluding changes in gas prices and foreign currency, the metric increased 5.8% overall and 4.8% in the U.S.\n\nSales of food and sundries, a category that includes snack foods and beverages, were up by mid single-digits in the quarter, CFO Richard Galanti said on the company‚Äôs earnings call. Fresh foods were up high single-digits and non-foods were up mid single-digits.\n\nAncillary businesses, which includes more service-related purchases like travel, were up by low single-digits, he said. Costco‚Äôs food court, pharmacy and optical centers were top performers in the quarter and gas was down low single-digits as the price per gallon fell.\n\nMore shoppers came to Costco, and they spent more on their shopping trips during the quarter. Traffic increased 5.3% across the globe and 4.3% in the U.S., Galanti said on the earnings call. Average ticket increased in the U.S. and worldwide, he said.\n\nInflation was roughly flat year over year in the quarter, which allowed the retailer to reduce prices for some items, Galanti said. For example, he said, it‚Äôs been able to cut the price of reading glasses from $18.99 to $16.99 and slash the price of a 48-count of Kirkland Signature batteries from $17.99 to $15.99. In the prior quarter, he said inflation was as much as 1% year over year.\n\nGalanti said many new items in categories like sporting goods and lawn and garden will also have lower prices compared with a year ago because of falling freight and commodity costs.\n\nCostco has 875 warehouses, including 603 in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. It also has clubs in about a dozen other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Japan and China.\n\nIn the second quarter, Costco opened four new clubs, including three in the U.S. and one in Shenzhen, China. That marked its sixth club to open in China, Galanti said. Two of the three new U.S. locations were Costco Business Centers, which are specifically geared toward small business owners like restaurant operators.\n\nAs of Thursday‚Äôs close, Costco shares have risen nearly 19% since the start of the year. The stock touched a 52-week high of $787.08 earlier in the day and closed at $785.59, bringing the company‚Äôs market value to nearly $350 billion.\n\nDigital growth\n\nCostco has made changes to its website to improve the experience for online shoppers, Galanti said Thursday. It‚Äôs also tweaked its business to be more digitally savvy.\n\nE-commerce sales grew 18.4% in the quarter compared with the year earlier.\n\nFor example, Costco rolled out a new mobile app homepage in February, which loads in less than two seconds compared with eight seconds previously ‚Äî a move he said was crucial since about 60% of its e-commerce business is done through its mobile app and mobile browser.\n\nIt rolled out Apple Pay last week to all members online. And it‚Äôs adding more merchandise to Costco Next, a seller platform that allows members to buy directly from some of the retailer‚Äôs suppliers at a discounted price. The marketplace carries a wide variety of items, including electronics, bicycles and apparel, he said.\n\nE-commerce sales have also gained momentum as Costco has gotten better in recent months at touting the value of its online merchandise, particularly for big-ticket items like appliances, mattresses and tires, he said.\n\nApp downloads were up 2.8 million in the quarter and and currently total about 33 million, Galanti said.\n\nMembership fees\n\nCostco has seen more membership sign-ups as the company has cracked down on membership sharing, Galanti said. During the pandemic, he said the warehouse club noticed more people using their mom or dad‚Äôs membership card and let it slide. Then, he said, the membership sharing grew because self-checkout became more common at clubs.\n\nNow, he said, Costco is requiring more checking of membership cards to make sure it matches the shopper.\n\n‚ÄúAre we getting some new you signups from it? Absolutely,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRelative to the 60 or 70 million members it‚Äôs not terribly meaningful, but it‚Äôs more fair and the right thing to do.‚Äù\n\nYet he said member sharing at Costco wasn‚Äôt as large of a problem as Netflix, another company that cracked down. Compared with Netflix, he said, it was harder for Costco members to share because they still needed to have a person‚Äôs physical card when they walked in.\n\nInvestors have been waiting for Costco to raise its membership fees for more than a year. The company has typically increased its annual fee roughly every five and a half years. It last hiked fees in June 2017.\n\nBut Galanti said the company is not hiking the fee yet. Though he added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs when, not if.‚Äù\n\nThe longtime CFO, who is retiring, has hosted all but one earnings call since Costco went public in 1985. He joked on Thursday‚Äôs call that the fee hike will be a task for his successor, Gary Millerchip, the former CFO of Kroger, after he takes over in mid-March.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve been joking with Gary, it will be on his watch, not mine,‚Äù Galanti said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/07/costco-cost-q2-2024-earnings.html", "id": "1b9c9ta", "created_utc": 1709863974.0, "score": 350, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "They goofed hard.

But again, eventually something major has to come out of it and not just be an instance of people hoovering up GPUs to keep up with everyone else who is also hoovering up GPUs.

IMHO LLMs like GPT 4+ are already immensely useful and would become even more useful when companies and products start fully integrating them into their products (and figuring out how).\n\nBut it's extremely expensive and doesn't scale that well, e.g. GPT 4.0 is already 20x more expensive than 3.5 for the same amount of text and hardly anybody would be willing to pay 20x more on top of that  for an even better model, so IMHO:\n\n* OpenAI/etc. will figure out ways to make their models more efficient and accomplish as much with less hardware (especially as  GPU performance keeps going up)\n* The market will just get more commoditized. Nvidia's margins are obscene and making GPUs is not exactly rocket science: If you want to train and sell access to a very complex model you only care about capital costs and power usage. So if AMD/Intel/etc. come up with products that are barely good enough (e.g. same performance for 2x lower costs but with 8x higher power usage in total) they should be able to massively undercut Nvidia forcing them lower their margins and bringing their future valuations back from the stratosphere.\n\nTo me on a very broad level NVIDIA seems to be in a somewhat similar situation Intel was during and after dot.com:\n\n* It grew even faster than Nvidia this time\n* They were basically in the same spot: can't build massive internet stuff without servers just like AI doesn't work without data center GPUs\n* Then reality hit when everyone figured out that they were putting the cart in front of the horse and valuations collapsed.\n* But then over a few years companies actually figured out how to commercialize the internet/etc. and demand started going up consistently.  AMD was hit even harder and basically collapsed so Intel was the only player remaining and controlled almost the entire server CPU market.

The company is now the most valuable in Europe, with a valuation larger than Denmark‚Äôs total gross domestic product last year.\n\nThe early amycretin data marks a fresh milestone for Novo Nordisk, potentially offering a more effective and less intrusive alternative to its already widely successful injection-based Wegovy and Ozempic drugs. Wegovy showed weight loss of 6% in a 12-week trial, while Ozempic is a diabetes treatment.\n\nA Phase II trial of amycretin will begin in the second half of this year, with results expected in early 2026, the company said Thursday.

On the other hand, it seems like Intel is undervalued and poised as a possible underdog to step up and take some market share. If the chip sector continues its rally then it seems like INTC could be a good bet.
