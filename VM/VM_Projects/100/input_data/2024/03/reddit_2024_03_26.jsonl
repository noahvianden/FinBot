{"title": "NVDA Double TOP $970", "selftext": "NVDA has formed a potential double top at $970 a share.  $841 represents the neckline and support.  A failure of the $841 support line suggests a downside target of -$129 or $712 a share.  This is standard technicals.  \n\nThe QQQ has rallied for 103 trading days without a 6% pullback.  The previous record going back to 2008 was 95-days.  The average is 70 days.  The NASDAQ-100 is far overdue for a correction.  When taken together with this NVDA double top, there’s an increasingly high level of risk of a massive downside correction coming to NVDA.  \n\nThis becomes invalidated if either $841 is tested and holds, OR if NVDA simply takes out its $970 resistance and pushes above $1000.  \n\nThe risk for an NVDA correction is now the highest I’ve seen.  Expect the stock to test $700 in a QQQ correction.  \n————————————\n\nApril 9th Update:\n\n-10:10 AM:  NVDA is currently testing that $840 support level.  We now have a full fledged double top completed and in play.   It remains to be seen if it ends up breaking to the downside.   \n\n———-\n\nApril 17 Update: \n2:00 PM EST\n\nNvidia has tested its $840 support for a third time now since peaking at $970.  So far so good.  The bulls are winning that battle.  The NASDAQ-100 is already half-way through a correction having fallen 5% form its highs and NVDA has held its $840 support throughout.  \n\nAs long as it holds $840, it’s setting up for an explosion higher.  \n\nIf you’re on the sidelines and want to buy, the key thing to watch is the QQQ (NASDAQ-100).  Once the QQQ hits the low $400’s ($395-$405 zone), NVDA will have bottomed.  Regardless of where it is.  NVDA is a strong buy when the QQQ hits $400.   It doesn’t matter if NVDA is at $700 or $900, once the QQQ hits $400, NVDA skyrockets in the weeks and months after that point.  Definitely goes far north of $1000 regardless of where NVDA bottoms.  \n\n—————\nApril 19, 2024 \n12:17 pm \n\nBad news everyone.  It looks like NVDA lost its key support at $840 today.  That means we have a double-top breakdown in effect. \n\nThere is some silver lining here.  First, the NASDAQ-100 is very oversold now.  So is NVDA.  Also, the $VIX is very overbought.  A very rare occurrence that almost always leads to a big market rally.  And the New York Stock Exchange McClellan Oscilator is also oversold.  \n\nAll very rare things.  So while we do have a double top breakdown at $840, the market and NVdA are overextended.  \n\nI could totally see a rebound all the way back to $900 in the next few weeks.  I’m almost certain next week we see a huge rally in the market.  NVDA likely gets dragged up with the market.  \n\nSo there’s a silver-lining here.  The bad news is the QQQ correction is only on its first leg.  So after a rebound, we’re likely to see more heavy selling at the end of April or beginning of may.

It discredits the argument by attacking the character or traits of the person making the argument, rather than the substance of the argument itself.\n\nFalse Analogy: You claim that the analogy between technical analysis in finance and the effectiveness of medical treatments is \"perfect in every way.\" However, this is a false analogy because the two domains have significant differences in how their effectiveness is measured, modeled, and validated. The comparison oversimplifies the nuanced differences between financial indicators and medical treatments.\n\nFallacy of Composition: You correctly identify the fallacy of composition, arguing that you cannot judge the whole based on its parts. However, the insistence that the analogy is flawless is misleading, as it overlooks other complexities.\n\nAppeal to Authority: The argument implies that because many professional fund managers, quant funds, algorithms, and medical professionals accept certain indicators or treatments, they are therefore valid. This can be seen as an appeal to authority, suggesting that the acceptance by these groups is sufficient to prove the effectiveness of the methods.\n\nStraw Man Fallacy: The argument sets up a simplified or distorted version of the opposing argument (\"You cannot take the effectiveness of technical analysis as a whole and then apply it to a single indicator\") to easily refute it. This does not engage with the actual nuances of the criticism that might be levied against technical analysis or medical treatments.\n\nThese fallacies undermine the argument's validity, making it less convincing and more biased in its presentation.\n\nLike pokemon, you can collect them all :)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Summoning u/Dieselcock", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What’s up?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ad hominem all you like.

Add some nonsense about QQQ having a bull run that is overdue to reverse as a distraction to further support your argument that NVDA is going to crater.  \n>  \n>ChatGPT:  Investors in NVDA (Nvidia Corporation) have recently witnessed a concerning pattern emerging in the stock's price action, as it appears to have formed a double top around the $970 mark. This technical formation typically signals a potential reversal in trend, suggesting that NVDA may be poised for a significant downward correction. Adding to the unease among shareholders is the remarkable bull run seen in the QQQ ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust), which many market participants believe is overdue for a reversal. While the attention may be diverted to the broader market dynamics, astute observers recognize the ominous signs within NVDA's chart, indicating a looming downturn.

It mean if the stock breaks down under $840, you can easily and will likely see heavy selling take it all the way down to $710.  How do traders get that number?

It depends on their time horizon.  \n\nIf you’re a trader, then you play it based on what happens next.  If the stock pushes through $970 resistance, it will absolutely explode higher.  A trader might buy at $980 and put a stop loss in at $960.  You risk $20 for a potential $100-$200 in upside.  Because that’s what likely happens on breakout.  \n\nAlternatively, one can short at $830 with a stop-loss at $850.  $20 risk for a potential $120 move down.  \n\nThat’s how you approach it.

This post isn’t about being right or wrong.  It’s about flagging a potential risk scenario in the stock.  \n\nLet me give you a scenario where I was wrong 6 times in row and made a shit ton of money.  \n\nBack in 2018-2019, the market underwent a pretty big correction.  The FANG stocks fell nearly 40% if you can believe that.  It was a mini crash.  Can’t remember the year.  I believe it started in Nov 2018 and ended January 2019.  Anyway; the entire time, I kept buying a mix of apple leaps and near-term apple puts.  The strategy was 80% long call-spreads and 20% short via 2-3mo expiring puts.  \n\nApple kept dropping and the puts kept off-setting the losses.  I’d sell the calls and the puts and repurchase a new set every $10 lower in the stock.  Until it eventually it bottomed and then finally rallied and raked it in.  \n\nI was way off on what I believed was the low point and bottom was in the stock but ended up doing well anyway because of the strategy.  \n\nThe idea here is the same.  You look at it from the perspective of being right and wrong instead of the action potential.  There are action points here.  \n\nGo long on a breakout.  Go short on a breakdown.

It's very similar to an analysis of \"I think the stock will go up, down, or sideways\", yours instead is very close to \"I think the stock will go up, down, or sideways, but not settle between $780-790 before going back up too far above $841\".  Therefore I'm saying your analysis is borderline being entirely meaningless.\n\nEdit: OK I did read your whole comment and I soften my stance, I hear your point about just because this analysis doesn't have a huge window where it can be entirely wrong about everything, doesn't mean it isn't pointing out a risk/reward unbalance.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It’s not similar at all.

It is largely because of this relationship that equities can serve as a potential inflation hedge in investor portfolios.\n\nEventually, however, money illusion fades as consumers wake up to the reality that real incomes do matter, and that’s when the economic cycle typically begins to deteriorate.

(2010 to 2015 as a matter of fact). Yes, the price per gallon of gasoline is an inconvenience but by no stretch does $90 per barrel indicate that there will be, or should be, a recession.\n2. I agree with the second paragraph of your comment, in general terms, however, I would add that significant amounts of job losses, taking for example the LAST two instances that we have seen (08/09 and 19/20) were responded to, by the fed and the US government, with very swift action and resolve. Yes, the markets dipped substantially, but, given the responses of the fed and the Us government, both of those instances proved to be 1. short lived pain (for investors) and 2. great long term buying opportunities, not only for individual stocks, but the general indexes as well.\n3. Time will tell on this one, however, there is the belief that 2022, effectively, was the \"recession\" as, in Q1 and Q2 of 2022, for consecutive quarters, GDP was negative.

I tend to believe that this was, in fact, the recession that most had been predicting and, given the relatively soft nature of it, was unnoticed my most OR wasn't necessarily as painful, why? Simple: The entire investment and media community was talking about how we are going to be in recession. When everyone is talking about it, and it happens, I think the pain becomes a little more tolerable because everyone is already planning for the worst.\n\nLastly, I tend to be optimistic in this particular case (yes, the dreaded \"this time is different\") why? Simple: The fed is acknowledging, even in the face of inflation over the past two months being, \"sticky\", that they are planning to cut rates. Sure, we can debate how many 25 basis point cuts (it started the year at 6 cuts and now, some speculate, may be 1 or zero cuts). Where it all ends, know one truly knows and, in my view, as I have said before, the April report (March CPI and PPI) will be a real indicator of if the inflation battle is still a downward trend OR if there is more fighting to do.

My view on this front is that there is, literally, zero reason to cut rates, especially given that the data is showing we are not at the 2% inflation rate number, hell, we are not even in the 2's at this point. Further, the argument that interest rates are prohibitive is laughable to me as well. Factually, I would argue that interest rates aren't even neutral at this exact moment in time. The economy keeps chugging along with no immediate, or apparent, issues. \n\nThe oil argument, I feel, is one that you haven't completely thought thru. Sure, in the short term, if oil prices go up, with the abundance of dollars that are still swimming around, it could be digested for a period of time by the consumer, however, in the mid-to-longer term, there is little doubt that higher oil prices will lead to decreased demand which, in turn, will lead to supply outstripping demand, thereby, creating a potential deflationary situation (depending on how much demand (consumers) would pull back on spending).\n\nThe fed, contrary to popular belief, is not in full QT mode. 1. They haven't raised rates in nearly 8 months. 2. Money printing, while paused for a period of time on the M2 side of the equation, has, in actuality, started up again, albeit, at a VERY moderate pace (hardly restrictive, however) and 3. The fed is, as of their last meeting, \"starting to slow their tapering of the balance sheet\". Those three tools, along with, very likely, more stimulus dollars in the event of need, sound like effective tools to me? Oh yeah, what about the government overspending to the tune of $1.6 trillion a year? Hard to go in a recession when the steroids just keep flowing, no?\n\nIn any event, yes, we will see a recession again, however, the severity of it (outside of a black swan event or major geopolitical event), in my view, make the depth of the recession something that presents nothing more than a buying opportunity.

Crude at $90 could be that external shock, and traditionally, spiking oil prices have been the most common external shock leading to past recession. 10 year rate above 5% is also another external shock.\n\nInflation at 3-4% is high compared to the Great Moderation period, which is where we are. If you want to compare with the 60s and 70s, the economy was quite different back then. neutral rate was vastly higher back then. You can argue what the neutral rate is, but NO ECONOMIST seriously thinks it's much higher than 4%, including the Fed critics like Larry Summers, and the most hawkish Fed members like Kashkari.

Biden cannot continuously let immigrants in forever, especially when Congress is fighting over border issues. If Trump gets elected, immigration is definitely gone. More immigrants, more workers, higher GDP, higher payroll.\n\nExcess savings is close to depleted and will likely get depleted within 2-3 months. It's been depleted for bottom half income group. When excess savings is gone, consumers will cut down on spending to build up savings, and that leads to the recession domino I described.\n\nThough consumers and corporates are currently sheltered from high rates, that cannot last forever. Homeowners have to move for familial or job reasons eventually. They have been delaying selling their house, but data shows existing home sales are starting to increase. And I seriously doubt if they lost their job, they could actually afford current rent prices, which would likely be more than double their current mortgage. Corporate refinance cycle will start later this year and early next year.\n\nThere's also no \"abundance of dollars that are still swimming around\".

Tesla has managed to find a way to massively vertically and horizontally integrate its products, it’s not being driven by external capital now, thus subject to less outside influence.
