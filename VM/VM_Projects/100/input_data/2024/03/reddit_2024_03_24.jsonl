Timing the market vs Time IN the market...", "selftext": "With the historical average return for the S&P being \\~10% per year, I'm just wondering how many people out there think we are on the verge of a major correction.  128% over 4 years is insane.  I'm a huge proponent of not trying to time the market, but with such insane gains the last 4 years, I'm starting to wonder if I should pull out for a while.  Income disparity at an all time high... inflation curtailed but leaving us with a cost of living higher than ever... housing costs taking huge %'ages of income... consumer credit and the national debt at ATH's...  I just am starting to wonder how long we can stave off the inevitable here.   I'm 10-15 years away from the typical retiring age (I'm 51), and even though I've only got about 50% of my net worth in stocks, I'm starting to seriously wonder if I should pull out completely and wait for the next crash before buying back in.  Typically the market declines shortly after interest rates start going down, so I'm thinking about timing my exit around that.  It goes against my whole \"time in the market vs timing the market\" idiom, but at this point I just feel like not cashing out is tempting fate.

Easy answer. Right now, there's a shortage of chips for everything (at scale). TPU all rented out. Nvidia GPUs all rented out. Customers just have to pick whatever is available.
