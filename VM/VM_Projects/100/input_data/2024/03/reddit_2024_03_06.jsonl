Like with specific examples including strike price, expiry, premium. Please :).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">How does selling calls lower the cost basis\n\nIt won't literally change the cost basis i.e. the number that's shown by your broker. But if you want to keep track of the premium you collect in e.g. an Excel sheet, you can think of it as lowering your cost basis that way. Getting some of the money back that you spent to buy the shares in the first place.\n\nObviously if you manage to do this enough times over the course of several years (for long term holders), you can get most, if not all, of your money back, meaning your cost basis of the shares will become \"zero\". The shares then become a risk free investment aka playing with house money. Or if someone really believes in the company, then they can simply reinvest the call premium into buying more shares each time.\n\n>The premiums you get from selling calls are subject to short-term capital gains. So you're still creating a taxable event, right?\n\nYes, but it will be negligible compared to taxes you'd have to pay by realizing gains on shares. Imagine someone has been holding NVDA for years and they're up 800%. Yes it would be considered long term capital gains, but the short term taxes for a covered call will be nothing compared to the taxes of realized gains on a hugely profitable share position. That's the beauty of option leverage. You can use small tax events to manage around (i.e. avoid) much larger tax events (i.e. shares)\n\n>How would you deploy covered calls in the OPs case to their benefit?\n\nWhen Google stock gets overbought, you sell an OTM call as sort of hedge, but it's not a true hedge obviously because the delta of the call will only decrease as the share price drops.\n\nIn OP's case it would have been at the end of January when Google stock was beyond the 2 standard deviation bollinger band and a whopping 78 on the daily RSI. That screams \"overbought\" and would be the time to start managing risk.\n\nWhen a stock is overbought there will be great demand for calls which means the call premiums will be juiced. In OP's case they could've sold a .30 delta OTM call for above average premium (due to juiced demand). And because the stock is overbought, OP can use this call premium to finance a long put (\"protective put\") that's near ATM as a way to lock in their gains, since overbought stocks tend to correct. This allows OP to protect their gains without creating a taxable event for their shares. This is actually known as an \"option collar\" and is a popular strategy for risk managers.\n\nIf your protective put does go ITM and is ITM nearing expiration, you don't have to let it get exercised and lose your shares. You can simply sell the put to close the position and lock in the intrinsic value.\n\nIf OP feels their OTM covered call is or will be threatened, that means call premiums are still juiced which will make rolling the call up and out much easier.. But it has to be done while the option still has plenty of extrinsic value. Preferably OTM altogether. If a covered call gets too deep ITM it will greatly increase the difficulty of managing such a position.\n\nIf I was OP I would not sell a call as of today. They did nothing to manage their gains in January and have since experienced a 15% downturn. Now is definitely not the time to sell a covered call, IMO", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, I understand all this now except for the option collar piece.

But because it's diversified, you're not likely to actually take advantage of the right tail (you can, but it's akin to flipping heads 50 times in a row, which is no different than any other portfolio of individual stocks you throw together).\n\nAt the end of the day, the risky side essentially falls into factor investing. You're purposely climbing further out onto the risk curve.  You expect 20% annualized returns from that side, and offset by the conservative side of the barbell, you get returns that might look like the S&P 500, but with maybe less volatility or much less of a drawdown in black swan events. \n\nThis is different from what I'm saying.

He is not suggesting to have 50% of your portfolio in stocks with 20% return and 50% of portfolio in bonds or 60-40 or 70 -30.\nHe is suggesting to have 80% of your portfolio in extremely safe assets and 20% max percent in insanely risky assets (like BTC or even more crazy).

That was me for a while, and I did have some resentment about not having enough free cash on top of retirement to try some single stock plays that I felt would work out. \n\nThis is the answer the answer to your problem, and I’m not trying to be facetious: make more money. I mean, you are doing the right thing. You should continue to put as much money as you deem necessary into your retirement. I had my 401(k) set with employer match and my Roth IRA set up. I feel like my obligation to my retirement is being met to the point where if I keep it like it is, I will have an OK retirement. Better than a lot of people. \n\nBut I also have the ego that makes me think I can do better picking stocks than Vanguard VOO or a general index fund. The next raise I got I had every other obligation met so I put that into Robinhood. I don’t have any expensive hobbies or collect anything major, so I kind of consider this hobby money. Now I put like $75 a paycheck in. I tested my theory. I’ve been smart with it. Biggest plays over last 24 months have been DraftKings (127%), Amazon(65%), and SoFi(54%). This is my staking account, and I try to beat the SP500. So I don’t take wild swings on crypto (out completely—feels too manipulated) or take any big moon shots on stocks. \n\nJust being in a place where you take swings but not feel bad if you lose because it was money earmarked for this frees you up. Having an outlet to make trades scratches that itch to see how good I can be at playing angles. I gotta say, I’ve made about 4 grand in draft kings and the same on Amazon and it feels really good to talk about it when others pull out their big win stories. i don’t feel any resentment, at all really. I celebrate everyone’s wins. \n\nTalking to a friend he’s been hanging onto a few whole BTCs and he is letting me know it’s back in a big way!

It’s when they make 100% and you are making the SP500 and it is in your retirement. You need to get that maxed out and the make even a little more money, then you can take a run at it, guilt-free.

{"title": "New York Community Bancorp tumbles 40% and is halted as troubled bank reportedly seeking cash infusion", "selftext": "Shares of struggling New York Community Bancorp. fell more than 40% on Wednesday amid reports that the regional bank is seeking a cash infusion.\n\nReuters and the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the bank was looking to outside investors for cash to shore up its balance sheet. NYCB did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.\n\nThe stock was halted for news pending when shares were down 42%.\n\nShares of the bank were already down sharply on the day before the reports. The stock is now below $2 per share after starting the year above $10.\n\nA cash infusion would be the latest development in a turbulent start to the year for NYCB. The bank disclosed in late January that it was dramatically raising the allowance for potential loan losses on its balance sheet. That was followed shortly by Moody’s Investors Service downgrading the bank’s credit rating to junk status, and NYCB naming former Flagstar bank CEO Alessandro DiNello as executive chairman.\n\nThen last week, NYCB disclosed that it had “identified material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls related to internal loan review” and announced that DiNello was taking over as CEO.\n\nThe questions surrounding NYCB are reminiscent of those that swirled around Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic before all three failed in the spring of 2023. They were among several regional banks that struggled as higher interest rates pushed down the value of older Treasury holdings and led some depositors to move their accounts elsewhere.\n\nWith the U.S. economy continuing to show surprising strength and inflation still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, traders have been dialing back expectations for interest rate cuts this year. Those higher rates could keep pressure on the banks themselves and on commercial real estate, which is a key business for NYCB and many other regional lenders.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/new-york-community-bancorp-tumbles-40percent-and-is-halted-as-troubled-bank-reportedly-seeking-cash-infusion.html", "id": "1b86tv0", "created_utc": 1709748908.0, "score": 644, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "JP Morgan Chase: \"This will make a fine addition to my collection\"", "score": 267, "replies": [{"body": ">JP Morgan Chase: \"This will make a fine addition to my collection\"\n\nUmm...

Some of you are greedy souls with heads in the sand or even worse aware of the situation at hand trying to obfuscate the economic understanding of these not educated in it to keep your paper net worths inflated. Anyone that works in banking know that you borrow against your assets as your assets rise in value so a drop in valuation has a house of cards effects as one is borrowed against the other. Literally there are so many textbooks that were the gold standard decades past that say everything about our current way of doing business economically is ultimately a Ponzi scheme. We will never pay back our debts, only way we go into a giant war to avoid paying or we enslave the middle class through austerity. See Germany WW1 and 2. That’s the only way this goes 10-30 years in the future. Just like we have laws that should stop illegal immigration already in place but not being enforced. We have fundamental economic guidelines that were adopted for our banking system which are not being enforced. And what happened with svb shouldn’t have happened and what did happen was it opened up a new emergency mechanism that they could use at free will till the program was ended. Look into it, the mechanism has a loophole that allowed the banks to borrow against their treasuries at the values they bought at and not what they had on hand and some were using that to buy more treasuries further increasing their ability to borrow more. It’s not talked about. Because unless you do your own research they do not tell you how they screw you. And yes I’m making my money in the markets. It’s getting easier and easier every day cause the corruption is so blatant and you just copy the corrupt. But again I care about the future of Americas children! I’ll leave this for food for thought, if you think that the Svb bailout was so innocuous then why even create the new cash 💰 injection mechanism for banks to borrow more cash based on treasuries on the values they were bought at and not currently at? Why open up the mechanism to all banks and not just distressed ones? Why not put limits so healthy banks couldn’t dip in. There’s a reason and the reason is money. If you’re an elite your properties are north of 20 million. You have dozens. You need this inflated real estate game to keep going. All the elites in America are colluding together.

Why is government finance positions just a revolving door to Wall Street?

If you thought I was talking conspiracy before I’ll give you a real one now. The prior is just facts. Dems want rate cuts so Biden becomes president. Powell and repubs want Trump obviously so they want to cut rates next year . They intentionally waited till today (Dems) to make the bank that absorbed SVC look like it was failing a year after the banking issue as Jerome was testifying to put pressure on him to lower rates.

{"title": "NYCB shares soar 30% after troubled regional bank announces $1 billion capital raise", "selftext": "Struggling New York Community Bancorp announced a $1 billion capital raise and a leadership shakeup on Wednesday, headlined by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nNYCB has agreed to a deal with several investment firms including Mnuchin’s Liberty Strategic Capital, Hudson Bay Capital and Reverence Capital Partners for over $1 billion in exchange for equity in the regional bank, according to a press release on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMnuchin will be one of four new members the bank’s board of directors as part of the deal. Joseph Otting, former comptroller of the currency, is also joining the board and taking over as CEO.\n\nReuters and The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Wednesday that the bank was looking to outside investors for cash to shore up its balance sheet. The stock was halted for news pending when shares were down 42%.\n\nShares of the bank were already down sharply the day before the reports. The stock is now below $2 per share after starting the year above $10.\n\nThe cash infusion is the latest development in a turbulent start to the year for NYCB. The bank disclosed in late January that it was dramatically raising the allowance for potential loan losses on its balance sheet, with its exposure to commercial real estate being a potential issue. That was followed shortly by Moody’s Investors Service downgrading the bank’s credit rating to junk status, and NYCB naming former Flagstar bank CEO Alessandro DiNello as executive chairman.\n\nThen last week, NYCB disclosed that it had “identified material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls related to internal loan review” and announced that DiNello was taking over as CEO, for what proved to be a brief tenure.\n\nThe questions surrounding NYCB are reminiscent of those that swirled around Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic before all three failed in the spring of 2023. They were among several regional banks that struggled as higher interest rates pushed down the value of older Treasury holdings and led some depositors to move their accounts elsewhere.\n\nWith the U.S. economy continuing to show surprising strength and inflation still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, traders have been dialing back expectations for interest rate cuts this year. The higher-for-longer rate environment could keep pressure on the banks themselves and on commercial real estate, which is a key business for NYCB and many other regional lenders.\n\nThe struggles for NYCB may have caught regulators off guard as well as investors. The regional lender acquired much of Signature Bank out of receivership from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last March.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/new-york-community-bancorp-tumbles-40percent-and-is-halted-as-troubled-bank-reportedly-seeking-cash-infusion.html", "id": "1b898d8", "created_utc": 1709754458.0, "score": 468, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 148, "comments": [{"body": "Who would ever think that buying stocks of bankrupt banks give best returns ever.", "score": 354, "replies": [{"body": "In ~2008 Mnuchin and co bought Indymac for ~$1B and then sold it for $3B in 2015, in part by kicking people out of their homes.", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Here, he will kick property owners out, too.

People overcome that by recognizing their limits and hiring someone instead who thrives in the environment that others just aren't suited for.\n\nAnd yes, there's a lot of frauds out there, so be sure to check people's backgrounds, look up their FINRA status, Yelp and Google reviews, and talk to clients to see what it's like to work with that advisor.

In a freshly post-covid environment, eased by QE, it made sense that these types of stocks were some of the strongest longs in the market.\n\nThe cumulative effects of transition from a covid-dominated to post-covid dominated era only recently surfaced itself: WFH having percussive effect (by way of technology/concrete changes), the centralization of data through tech, and the virtualization of things that previously relied on more physical means: bitcoin vs banks, ai vs workers, capital vs labor.\n\nI believe the effects of all these recent changes are the most relevant forces in play since the pandemic. \n\nAs a result, the thesis of capital deployment changed. Capital has rapidly dispersed itself into players that are poised to benefit from these dynamics: such as NVDA being catalyzed through the events of covid, cryptocurrency demand, and now machine-learning (chip manufacturers in general).\n\nWith AAPL being out of the trends, and GOOG having the (repeated) let down, it makes *some* sense that they are at beaten down levels.\n\nI think this will continue until either enough capital has flowed into the trending sectors that it no longer makes sense to deploy capital there, or dynamics shift in favor of 'defensive growth,' where market behavior has shifted such that it makes more sense to proceed in a cautiously optimist behavior.\n\nIf not, unless AAPL makes meaningful strides in the trending sector (by recognizing essential design philosophies and capitalizing on that; ie forfeiture of fighting giants of the industry such as NVDA and focus more on niche), or GOOG understands how to leverage their competitive advantages better (make stronger generative-machines by using their economic moat, relative strength in various industries, and access to highly rich data, better), I believe they will continue to struggle to keep up with the trends.\n\nThis does not make it a bad play.

We've seen more natural driving, but still many critical safety disengagements, especially when it comes to UPLs.\n\nThere are two ways to look at it, from a *Neural Scaling Laws* perspective, and from a more problem specific *Imitation Learning / Behavior Cloning* perspective.\n\n**Neural Scaling Laws**  \nThe average loss of a neural network can be predicted quite accurately using power laws. Neural scaling laws have separate loss terms for the loss caused by limited model size, limited data and compute budget, plus an irreducible loss. The coefficients are different for different problems and architectures, but for [LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556), increasing the model size will decrease the model-related loss by 55%, and 10x-ing the data 48%. Ideally, we should increase model size, data size and compute in roughly equal proportions. Now let's look at the situation with FSD:\n\n1. Compute is increasing very quickly, 30k H100s are coming online this year, and then there's Dojo\n2. Data is practically infinite. In July 2023, FSD had been trained on 10 million 30 second clips. At this point it may be 15-30 million. Another doubling or 10x is not impossible, and is bound by compute resources\n3. Model size is more complicated: HW4 increases the number of NPUs from 2 to 3, so a 50% increase (mostly to compensate for increased camera resolution), but even for HW3 there are many things that can be done to increase the effective model size:\n   1. Lower the inference frequency: The last we've heard, [V12 runs at 36 Hz](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/elon-musk-livestreams-teslas-fsd-v12-a4bede8e1482). This could potentially be lowered to 10-20 Hz, which would still be faster than the human reaction time. This could give an effective size increase by 1.8x-3.6x.\n   2. [4-bit quantization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17323.pdf). The model is currently quantized to 8-bits, which runs natively on FSD HW3/4. It's been shown that 4-bit quantization can be done without almost any reduction in performance. The question is if Tesla is able to emulate 4-bit quantization on their hardware. 1-2x increased model size.\n   3. Use both FSD chips: as we can see, FSD is still computing the visualizations using V11. Given that these visualizations are always visible, and how quickly FSD is switched to the old stack on highways, it's likely that V12 is running on a single chip, and V11 on the other. Lets say we can overlay the predicted path on the front-facing camera, much like [Comma's Open Pilot](https://www.comma.ai/images/Comma.ai-3X-front-screenshot-forblackbackground-1680x1120-nospace.3ed7928ec48f64bc83fe.png), we can fully utilize the second chip: let's say 1.5-2x increase in model size.\n   4. Camera attention: a large part of the inference compute is used by a convolutional backbone (probably ResNet) that processes each of the 8 cameras at full resolution. Humans can only attend to one direction at a time, it should be possible to limit processing to, let's say, 4 cameras a a time at full resolution, and perhaps reduce the resolution of the remaining cameras by a large amount, and learn which cameras are worth paying attention to at which time. We've seen effective routing of tokens using [Mixture of Experts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_of_experts#:~:text=Mixture%20of%20experts%20(MoE)%20is,problem%20space%20into%20homogeneous%20regions) for LLMs, and this would be something similar but a mixture of cameras. Something similar has also been done with attention within images with [Deformable Attention](https://medium.com/@jelkhoury880/introducing-deformable-attention-transformer-ddb8b5363c5c). 1.5x - 2x increase in model size\n   5. All in all, if we multiply the increases, we could see anywhere between 4-28x increase in effective model size. 10x is not impossible. For reference, the difference between GPT1, GPT2, GPT3 and GPT4 were all roughly 10x.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "**Imitation Learning / Behavior Cloning**  \nThe scaling laws perspective doesn't take into account that this is a particular kind of problem. Behavior Cloning works very well when you have training data coverage is exhaustive, but once the agent ends up out-of-distribution errors compounds quickly O(eps\\*L\\^2). We have seen cases where V12 is clearly OOD, leading to stearing oscillations or very dangerous behavior. But what we have with FSD is not pure Behavior Cloning (BC), but BC in combination with [Expert Intervention Learning](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/spencer2022eil.pdf) (EIL), i.e. whenever FSD ends up OOD, the driver intervenes and brings the trajectory back to good. Training on a mix of regular driving clips and interventions provably leads to a more manageable O(eps\\*L) error. So can we get enough of these intervention clips in relation to the amount of data FSD is already trained on? Well, once this is pushed to the 400k FSD fleet, and each driver contributes with, let's say, 10 interventions each, that equals 4 million clips, compared to the 15-30 million it's currently trained on. This, to me, indicates that there should be more than enough interventions to effectively train the model to correct for OOD problems. I recommed [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEpu-ZWuGIY) by a researcher at Aurora for a deep dive into EIL.\n\nThere is another way to more effectivey sample relevant clips from the whole (non-FSD) fleet, and that is running V12 in shadow mode and comparing the predicted trajectory and actions with the actual trajectory taken by the driver.

IMO the next level up is likely only possible with massive additional profitability from energy, AI, and robotics.  \n\nIn 2011-2012, AAPL market cap reached 500 Billion as sales of iPhone 4s and then iPhone 5 soared.  \n\nModel 3 and Model Y did much the same for Tesla in 2020-2021.  Sales numbers went crazy and I started seeing Tesla vehicles everywhere, much like I did iPhones a decade earlier.  TSLA went from 10s of Billions in market cap to 100s of Billions and then briefly over 1T.  \n\nI believe it is reasonably certain that Tesla can deliver 10s of millions of inexpensive EVs in the 2030s, and that they can have a large energy business as well.  But that will not deliver the kinds of margins that big tech generates.  It will take software to do that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf Tesla fails to deliver on FSD or AI products (and this is possible, there are no guarantees they will get there first, or ever have a viable product), I don't think there is any chance TSLA delivers another 10x for investors.  \n\nMy back-of-the-napkin math is that on 20 million vehicles/year @ ASP of 35k/unit, equal revenue from energy storage as automotive, and overall operating margin of 10% at maturity in 2032-2034 with respectable but unremarkable future growth, Tesla would be valued at somewhere between 1.5-2 Trillion, a bit over a 2-bagger from where we are today:  553 Billion market cap + (2 x 553 Billion).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "tap degree cautious familiar insurance unused reach weather many theory\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Worldwide passenger vehicle sales were 75.3 million units worldwide in 2023.\n\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/200002/international-car-sales-since-1990/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/200002/international-car-sales-since-1990/)\n\nFor Tesla to reach the midpoint of your estimate, 50%, they would need to be delivering close to 38 million vehicles/year, assuming the total market doesn't grow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor some context, Toyota delivered just over 11.2 million vehicles in 2023: [https://www.motor1.com/news/706562/toyota-record-sales-2023/](https://www.motor1.com/news/706562/toyota-record-sales-2023/)\n\nI don't see Tesla manufacturing and delivering close to 3.5x Toyota's entire global capacity anytime soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've estimated that at full buildout and 100% ramp, Gigafactories Texas and Berlin could support about 2 million vehicles/year each.  Shanghai tops out at 1.1 Million, and Fremont at 800k (optimistically, they're at 650k theoretical today).\n\nThat gets Tesla runway to about 6 million units/year late in this decade.  Assuming that Gigafactory Mexico breaks ground this year, add another 2 million.\n\nIf Tesla establishes another Gigafactory beyond Mexico, they'll likely be reaching the 10 million/year mark at the start of the 2030s at earliest.   \n Going from that to nearly 40 million/year is another huge leap.  It might take until 2040 or beyond to get to that level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, the numbers I have for 20 million vehicles/year (mostly NGV), almost 2x that of Toyota today, and an equal amount of revenue from Tesla Energy, at 10% operating margin, do not support a market cap higher than 2 Trillion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAI and FSD isn't the icing IMO.
