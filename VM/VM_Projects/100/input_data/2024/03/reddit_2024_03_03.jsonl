Despite significant growth in revenue, the company is currently operating at a loss with negative profit margins and gross margins. It also has a high level of debt, though this is somewhat offset by substantial cash reserves. The decision to invest will hinge on the investor's risk tolerance and confidence in Rivian's long-term growth potential.\n\n## Summary\nRivian is a company in the Consumer Cyclical sector and Auto Manufacturers industry. It has a high overall risk score of 10 and a beta of 1.894, indicating that the stock is more volatile than the market. \n\nRivian's market cap is $10,654,585,856. With float shares standing at 687,215,498, the company's stock price is more prone to volatility due to lower liquidity.\n\nThe company has negative profit margins (-1.22508) and negative gross margins (-0.45783), which is not unusual for a startup company in its early stages. Despite this, Rivian has experienced significant growth in revenue, increasing from $663,000,000 in Q4 2022 to $1,315,000,000 in Q1 2023. However, it's worth noting that the company's net income has remained negative, indicating that it is not yet profitable. Rivian's free cash flow is also negative (-$1,405,000,000 in Q1 2023), indicating that it is spending more cash than it is generating. \n\nAdditionally, Rivian has a high amount of debt ($4,919,000,064), which is 53.812 times its equity. This could be a potential risk in the long term. However, the company also has a significant amount of cash ($9,368,000,512), which could be used to finance operations and invest in growth. \n\n## Pros\n* Significant growth in revenue\n* High level of cash reserves\n* More than half of the shares are held by institutions (51.308%), which could indicate confidence in the company's long-term prospects.\n\n## Cons\n* High risk score and volatility\n* Operating at a loss with negative profit margins\n* High level of debt\n\n## Recommendation\nGiven the high risk associated with Rivian, we recommend a **Hold** for this stock for investors who are already invested. For potential new investors, the decision should be based on their individual risk tolerance and investment horizon. Those with a high risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon may consider investing in Rivian due to its growth potential. However, those with a low risk tolerance should consider other investment options.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for sharing this, I appreciate it", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Absolutely!

It was about $15.50 at the time.  Last point is one you really want to let sink in.  \n\nI think you‚Äôve missed a few things and made some erroneous assumptions:\n\na.  You‚Äôve stated that because Rivian can use the Tesla charging network people will not be concerned about range.  That is unlikely to be true.  People don‚Äôt like having to map out their fuel stops.  They want to get into their car and drive or if they have a schedule they will plan it around their own families rest/entertainment/food/refreshment needs.  They don‚Äôt want to be worried about getting stuck at the side of the road.\n\nb.  You did not address the concern of time required to recharge?   How long will it take?  What if all the charging stations are taken?   What if some are non functional?  Will that double the duration from 30 mins to an hour or more?  That‚Äôs not going to be acceptable in the USA.  This is the land of 1800 Mattress where even though you‚Äôve had the same mattress for 10 years, when it‚Äôs time to replace, it simply must be delivered the very next day!\n\nc.  There is a valid cost of ownership concern.  You brushed it off but it will impact sales.\n\nd.  Currently Americans prefer hybrids over EVs.  EVs are sitting on lots unsold.  Customers just aren‚Äôt buying.  That‚Äôs a situation that may not change in the near future.  It actually may never change.\n\ne.  Hertz are selling 20,000 Tesla EVs as customers don‚Äôt want to rent them and they‚Äôre too expensive to repair.  That‚Äôs not a great sign for the future of EVs. Who knows more about buying and maintaining cars than Hertz?  Why don‚Äôt their customers want to rent them?  If you don‚Äôt know you should find out.\n\nf.  You stated the government will accelerate the transition to EVs in the next 2-3 years.  In history that has never happened.  The government cannot change consumer behavior with incentives and mandates.  Their behavior charges when consumers recognize the benefits are worth the cost.  The behavior charges when people see value.  That is not on the horizon any time soon.\n\ng. Thinking that ice vehicles are just going to go away after being an American icon for 100 years is presumptive and wrong.  You underestimate Americans‚Äô love for their vehicles.\n\nh. How is Rivian going to service every vehicle in the country?  They would need thousands of service centers which they don‚Äôt have. They have less than 50.  You either  expect people to drive several hundred miles for a service or maintenance or you expect Rivian to add thousands of locations.  How much will that cost?\n\nI‚Äôll stop there.  You did your DD which is a lot more than most people do so congratulations on that.  But I think you‚Äôve misjudged the American car buyer.  They are not all hot soccer moms in California.\n\nEdit:  adding one more point.  I just reviewed an EV magazine today. There are at least 20 other really nice EV SUVs on the market.

This week, Waymo received approval to run their commercial service in Los Angeles. \n\nWhile most carmakers dabble in their own autonomous driving technology, many of them also have collaborations with Waymo. I see real potential for Waymo to become the de facto provider for most carmakers - the way that for years, many parallel charging networks existed, and very suddenly the majority of carmakers signed on to Tesla‚Äôs solution as the dominos kept falling one after the other. \n\nWith all the news around ChatGPT, most investors seem to use ‚ÄúAI‚Äù interchangeably with ‚Äúchatbot‚Äù or more generally ‚ÄúLLM‚Äù or ‚Äúimage generation‚Äù.

{"title": "I think this year and beyond, Amazon $AMZN will have record cash flow and record stock price, and here is why", "selftext": "Background: I am a 3rd party seller who sells private label goods on Amazon. I gross annually between $1-2mil in revenue. At first many sellers and I kind of brushed off this new policy change that was initiated on March 1st, 2024. However once digging deeper into it and making shipments to send into Amazon, I realized how much of a vulture Amazon truly is. As much as I absolutely hate these changes, and I hope FTC investigates the shit out of them, this is extremely bullish for Amazon's cashflow perspective.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/headlines.html?id=GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5&ref=nslp\\_at\\_33\\_GF5ST3HMAHRNW2K5\\_en-US\\_ttl\\_rf\\_recent\\_news\\_34https://www.ecomcrew.com/amazon-fba-big-fee-increase-2024/\r  \n\r  \nAnalysis:\r  \n\r  \nAmazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:\r  \n\r  \nExpansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.\r  \n\r  \n\"Voluntary\" Use of Amazon Warehouse Distribution (AWD) for FBA Sellers:\n\n\\- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.\r  \n\r  \nImplementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:\r  \n\r  \n\\- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean‚Äîto avoid excessive storage fees‚Äînow results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.\r  \n\r  \nThis policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of \"low inventory\" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the \"voluntary\" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*Overall Financial Impact:\\*\\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.\r  \n\r  \nAgain, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.\r  \n\r  \nBonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.\r  \n\r  \nExtra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.\r  \n\r  \nPosition: 20% of my portfolio is now in AMZN.

This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.*\n\nThat's absolutely bonkers. They charge extra fees for having TOO MUCH stock, now they're charging for having too little? Seriously, fuck that. We still sell on amazon but are already in the process of switching from FBA to a 3PL company - who despite being a bit more expensive - at least don't have policies that feel like someone is shitting in your mouth. Amazon has also just become such a pain to list on and get visibility. Most of our sales now come from our own website, which tbh is easier than managing an Amazon account", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Finally another seller who actually understands what we're going through and understand how this is just a huge win-win-win for Amazon no matter what.

Having too much inventory is a problem for Amazon, and a problem for sellers - incentivising sellers for something they have control over (i.e. they can either remove overstock from FBA or clear stock at break even or loss)\n\nPunishing sellers for being low on inventory however, is not natural. Sellers already have incentives to have top sellers in stock (i.e. they want to make more money!). Generally if you've run out of stock it's due to 1. bad planning or 2. supply chain issues. For me its almost always the latter. No way I'm gonna let Amazon charge me for the latter - they can go fuck themselves, I'm switching to another 3pl", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Don't take this personally, but you (by which I mean 'third party sellers') is why we went from spending high six figures per year through Amazon to zero.  Maybe not you specifically, but many third party merchants range from terrible to crooked.  Amazon became a crapshoot of what product or service you would get.  \n\nEarly on we could steer and filter to Amazon-fulfillment only, but they became so integrated with crummy third party sellers that it was impossible to stay clear.  And third party sellers were also infesting Amazon fulfillment, with returns and counterfeit items migrating from the third party side into the Amazon side.  \n\nFor perspective, we had direct access to people second to Bezos.  But seeing how Amazon was not only doing little to curb the problem but instead was enabling and expanding them, we went cold turkey.  \n\nSo in a sense, we'd agree.  Amazon's rapacious conduct and philosophy is not something I want to do business with, but is something I expected to show up as EPS, and thus grew the equity position.  \n\nAt times I've questioned if Amazon's 180 into anti-customer anti-partner anti-everybody practices would sabotage their growth.  But it seems like they've been able to ride that out with some assistance from the pandemic.  \n\nAmazon used to delight customers.  Now, customers just seem to tolerate them.  And most customers don't even know what you do, which is that most of the customer-aligned practices like returns or refunds are fully funded by the vendors and suppliers they strongarm, not by Amazon's generosity.\n\nI too have used awareness of a company's bad practices as a thesis for holding the equity.  The bitterness of Apple's terrible policies and corrupt practices was moderated by knowing I could pay for the warranties they wouldn't honor by using stock gains.\n\nI've said we'll go back to Amazon they day they end third party, but it doesn't seem like that's happening anytime soon.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "The thing is, I don't think Amazon will ever end 3rd party.
