{"title": "Google in Crisis", "selftext": "https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/inside-the-crisis-at-google\n\n\nIt‚Äôs not like artificial intelligence caught Sundar Pichai off guard. I remember sitting in the audience in January 2018 when the Google CEO said it was as profound as electricity and fire. His proclamation stunned the San Francisco audience that day, so bullish it still seems a bit absurd, and it underscores how bizarre it is that his AI strategy now appears unmoored.\n\nThe latest AI crisis at Google ‚Äî where its Gemini image and text generation tool produced insane responses, including portraying Nazis as people of color ‚Äî is now spiraling into the worst moment of Pichai‚Äôs tenure. Morale at Google is plummeting, with one employee telling me it‚Äôs the worst he‚Äôs ever seen. And more people are calling for Pichai‚Äôs ouster than ever before. Even the relatively restrained Ben Thompson of Stratechery demanded his removal on Monday. \n\n\nYet so much ‚Äî too much ‚Äî coverage of Google‚Äôs Gemini incident views it through the culture war lens. For many, Google either caved to wokeness or cowed to those who‚Äôd prefer not to address AI bias. These interpretations are wanting, and frankly incomplete explanations for why the crisis escalated to this point. The culture war narrative gives too much credit to Google for being a well organized, politics-driven machine. And the magnitude of the issue runs even deeper than Gemini‚Äôs skewed responses. \n\nThere‚Äôs now little doubt that Google steered its users‚Äô Gemini prompts by adding words that pushed the outputs toward diverse responses ‚Äî forgetting when not to ask for diversity, like with the Nazis ‚Äî but the way those added words got there is the real story. Even employees on Google‚Äôs Trust and Safety team are puzzled by where exactly the words came from, a product of Google scrambling to set up a Gemini unit without clear ownership of critical capabilities. And a reflection of the lack of accountability within some parts of Google.\n\n\"Organizationally at this place, it's impossible to navigate and understand who's in rooms and who owns things,‚Äù one member of Google‚Äôs Trust and Safety team told me. ‚ÄúMaybe that's by design so that nobody can ever get in trouble for failure.‚Äù\n\nOrganizational dysfunction is still common within Google, something it‚Äôs worked to fix through recent layoffs, and it showed up in the formation of its Gemini team. Moving fast while chasing OpenAI and Microsoft, Google gave its Product, Trust and Safety, and Responsible AI teams input into the training and release of Gemini. And their coordination clearly wasn‚Äôt good enough. In his letter to Google employees addressing the Gemini debacle this week, Pichai singled out ‚Äústructural changes‚Äù as a remedy to prevent a repeat, acknowledging the failure.\n\nThose structural changes may turn into a significant rework of how the organization operates. ‚ÄúThe problem is big enough that replacing a single leader or merging just two teams probably won‚Äôt cut it,‚Äù the Google Trust and Safety employee said.\n\nAlready, Google is rushing to fix some of the deficiencies that contributed to the mess. On Friday, a ‚Äòreset‚Äô day Google, and through the weekend ‚Äî when Google employees almost never work ‚Äî the company‚Äôs Trust and Safety leadership called for volunteers to test Gemini‚Äôs outputs to prevent further blunders. ‚ÄúWe need multiple volunteers on stand-by per time block so we can activate rapid adversarial testing on high priority topics,‚Äù one executive wrote in an internal email. \n\nAnd as the crisis brewed internally, it escalated externally when Google shared the same type of opaque public statements and pledges about doing better that have worked for its core products. That underestimated how different the public‚Äôs relationship is with generative AI than other technology, and made matters worse. \n\nUnlike search, which points you to the web, generative AI is the core experience, not a route elsewhere. Using a generative tool like Gemini is a tradeoff. You get the benefit of a seemingly-magical product. But you give up control. While you may get answers quickly, or a cool looking graphic, you lose touch with the source material. To use it means putting more trust in giant companies like Google, and to maintain that trust Google needs to be extremely transparent. Yet what do we really know about how its models operate? Continuing on as it if were business as usual, Google contributed to the magnitude of the crisis.\n\nNow, some close to Google are starting to ask if it‚Äôs focused in the right places, coming back to Pichai‚Äôs strategic plan. Was it really necessary, for instance, for Google to build a $20 per month chatbot, when it could simply imbue its existing technology ‚Äî including Gmail, Docs, and its Google Home smart speakers ‚Äî with AI?\n\nThere are all worthwhile questions, and the open wondering about Pichai‚Äôs job is fair, but the current wave of Generative AI is still so early that Google has time to adjust. On Friday, for instance, Elon Musk sued OpenAI for betraying its founding agreement, a potential setback for the company‚Äôs main competitor.\n\nGoogle, which just released a powerful Gemini 1.5 model, will have at least a few more shots until a true moment for panic sets in. But everyone within the company knows it can‚Äôt afford many more of the previous week‚Äôs incidents, from Pichai to the workers pulling shifts this weekend.\n\n", "id": "1b4d5mn", "created_utc": 1709346614.0, "score": 719, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 533, "comments": [{"body": "Not the point of the post but god damn was the Gemini image generation hilarious", "score": 684, "replies": [{"body": "Google really saw VLONEPREDATOR and went, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do that‚Äù", "score": 103, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "why is everyone downvoting this is literally the dude‚Äôs profile pic", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "https://www.axios.com/2024/03/01/meta-ai-google-gemini-black-founding-fathers\n\n\nApparently it's not only Google.", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "George Orwell was only off by 40 years", "score": 91, "replies": [{"body": "George Orwell was vehemently anti-Fascist. \n\nThe right wing nut jobs on Twitter bitching about Gemini are not acting in good faith.", "score": -37, "replies": [{"body": "Fascism is re-writing history.

A 95% solution isn't a solution. The reality is there are hardware limitations holding Tesla back. They don't have the full redundancy in safety critical systems required for a fully autonomous system. this includes redundancy in sensors, steering, braking, power, etc. They do have redundancy in compute. Commercial aircraft have double or triple redundancy in all safety critical systems. The players testing autonomous vehicles without test drivers satisfy the redundancy requirements for a \"fail operational\" system. This means the system will continue to operate safely and normally if a component fails. It's a step beyond \"fail safe\". Tesla's priority is selling more cars and maximizing profits. Their goal isn't to ship cars that can actually perform fully autonomous driving operations. They keep removing sensors and hardware. They simply don't have the hardware in the vehicles they sell to support fully autonomous operation.\n\nThe data argument is way overblown. I work in ML/AI as an applied scientist and I can tell you all of the self driving car companies are using synthetic data to train and test their systems. They use validated physics based game engines to simulate billions of miles of driving data in days or weeks using computing clusters. And it's way more valuable then more and more of the same old driving data. Beyond a certain point more normal driving data isn't useful. It's the \"long tail\" of the distribution that is the hard part. Accounting for the infinite number of potential edge cases and rare events that could occur. With synthetic data you can procedurally generate ANY situation you want. You don't have to have cars on the road driving millions of miles and hope these situations occur randomly in the wild. How do you think Waymo got so good with so few cars on the road? They have tons of blog posts about their synthetic data world used for training and testing.\n\nAnd the geofenced thing is by definition. An L4 autonomous system HAS to be geofenced. That does not mean the system can't operate outside that area if it was allowed to. Waymo uses machine learning in their stack just like Tesla. One example is the perception task which is seeing the world identifying and classifying objects, tracking their trajectories. They also use it for behavior prediction tasks which is about predicting the future course or trajectory of all those objects being tracked by the sensor suite so as to plan the best path forward at any given time.

Customer growth, strong metrics, and incoming Google exec hint at upside. I'm playing the rebound with call options but managing risk.
