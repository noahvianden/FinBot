{"title": "Rivian shares surge as company reveals new EV models, $2.25 billion in cost savings", "selftext": "Shares of Rivian Automotive surged roughly 10% Thursday as the EV maker unveiled three new vehicles and announced more than $2 billion in savings related to pausing construction on a plant in Georgia.\n\nTwo of those EVs came as a surprise to consumers and investors. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, in announcing the company‚Äôs upcoming R2 SUV, also revealed two additional crossovers called the R3 and R3X, a performance variant.\n\nThe R2 is expected to start at about $45,000 when it goes on sale during the first half of 2026. It‚Äôs expected to be the fourth product for Rivian following a commercial delivery van and larger, more expensive R1S SUV and R1T pickup for consumers. The R1 vehicles start at roughly $70,000 and can top $100,000.\n\nScaringe disclosed few details about the surprise R3 crossovers, but told CNBC‚Äôs Phil LeBeau that the R3 will be priced lower than the R1.\n\n‚ÄúThese represent our future,‚Äù Scaringe said during a livestreamed event from Laguna Beach, California.\n\nThe announcements come at a crucial time for Rivian as it attempts to expand its customer base amid slower-than-expected EV sales in the U.S. after automakers flooded the first-adopter market with pricey all-electric vehicles in recent years.\n\nRivian‚Äôs sales pace has slowed in recent quarters, and the company widely disappointed investors last month by missing quarterly estimates and forecasting slightly lower production this year compared to 2023 due to plant downtime.\n\nThe Amazon-backed company has been burning through cash to improve current EV production and narrow losses.\n\nShifting production of the R2 from the in-development plant in Georgia to the company‚Äôs plant in Normal, Illinois, will save $2.25 billion, Rivian said in a press release. It will also allow the vehicle to begin production earlier, it said.\n\nThe company said it will pause construction on the Georgia plant, to be resumed ‚Äúlater.‚Äù\n\nThe R2 will operate on a new EV platform but looks like a smaller version of the R1S SUV. It will be capable of more than 300 miles of all-electric range on a single charge and 0-60 mph time in under3 seconds, the company said.\n\n‚ÄúR2 represents the essence of our brand, while targeting the significant midsized SUV segment, a massive market with limited compelling EV options beyond Tesla,‚Äù Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told investors last month. ‚ÄúR2 has been developed with vertically integrated propulsion platforms, electronics and software to create an incredible user experience.‚Äù\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/07/rivian-r2-electric-suv-starting-price-performance.html", "id": "1b93jvo", "created_utc": 1709841224.0, "score": 668, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 163, "comments": [{"body": "bag holders unite", "score": 243, "replies": [{"body": "$22.37 baby!", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "$19.00 here", "score": 20, "replies": []}, {"body": "YIKES", "score": 27, "replies": []}, {"body": "Its okay, I am in at liek 8.80 on NKLA if that makes you feel better ):", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Fastest downhill electric vehicles on the planet", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "NKLA doesn't make electric vehicles they make hydrogen vehicles.

But bb_is_best, equity secures covered calls!  That's true, but the inherent problem with covered calls is that equity tends to rise over time, and if you are selling a covered call in something that you don't expect to rise over time, then you're stuck owning shares of that thing that isn't appreciating for you.  If it IS rising, you will eventually run into the problem where you either have to let them eat your shares, or roll the option.  Here you have a dillema...either you move the strike price up, or you keep it the same, but there's a chance it will never be under that price again.\n\nSo how does selling puts address this?   Let's theoretically say you have 2 million dollars in FSKAX (total market).  Right now, you can sell a May 31 $5,200 put for $129.90 or $12,990.  Now I chose SPX because it's a cash settled option meaning there are no shares that ever change hands.  A benefit to this is that you can never be early executed on SPX contracts.  \n\nThe cash you would normally need to secure this contract is $5,200 * 100 or $520,000.  Now, I argue that since I have $2 million in FSKAX, the only real way this goes sideways is if the total market drops more than 74%, because then I could \"sell everything\" and still not afford the total price of the contract (it's actually a little better, because SPX shouldn't ever be $0, so you have some intrinsic value offsetting that $520,000).\n\nNow the price of SPX on expiration has basically 2 options:  Either over $5,200, or under.  If it's over, you win, keep the money and pay taxes on it.  If it's under, you should be able to sell the same strike price but at a forward date and use those proceeds to buyback the May ones (the new expiration date will ALWAYS be worth more than the ones you're replacing as long as you keep the same strike price, so you should never have to come up with your own money to move the options forward).  As long as the S&P 500 continues to rise over the long term, SPX should eventually end over $5,200 at which point you just pocket the money and start over and figure out a new strike price.  \n\nNow obviously you need margin to do this, so you unfortunately can't do it in a retirement account, but I don't see why someone wouldn't do this if they have a bunch of index funds they never intend on selling.

Worst case is that it works for a bit then you get over leveraged doing this, selling more contracts than it's safe and a black swan event happens like covid and wipes you out completely. \n\nIn general this does work because the market trends up. Just have to keep liquid enough to not get margin called along the way. What if the US becomes Japan and market crashes and doesn't hit the level again for 20 years? Now you're leveraged up and waiting for 20 years for a recovery. \n\nThen calculate your numbers. Brokerages don't let you leverage your entire account, only providing a portion of the buying power.

If you rolled it into a 150c with the same expiry date, you could do two things:\n\n1. lock in profits and buy in identical number of otm options to your itm options (150c = $953 right now, so you'd keep $2092) and let the otm ride because you believe the stock will continue to go up. This is normally what people mean when they talk about rolling, and what I assume OP means.\n\n2. You could double down (150c = $953 right now, so you could buy three of them for the same amount as a single 120c, though obviously this has a completely different risk profile than something so deeply itm!)\n\nLet's see how either would shake out: right now, the preimum is such that anything under $159.53 at expiry is worthless, so let's say the stock can hit 180. \n\nIn case 1, assuming we don't roll any more and the stock doesn't go above 160 it expires worthless but we keep the 2092 we locked in. If we go to to 180, we get a 2047 return, so 4139 total.\n\nIn case 2, If we hit 180, we get 6141 total (so, 48% more gainz), but if we don't get over 152 we lose everything (-$2000, sucks).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing to call out, the numbers I've chosen above kind of exaggerate the way the curves work here-- case 2 sucks way more if the stock is closer to the breakeven price. E.g. if TSM is worth 160 on 4/19, even though your calls will make money, you make like $140 profit instead of the $2100 that you would keep from case 1.  \n\n\nI'm still trying to develop my strategy here, so, let me know if that makes sense!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "oh I forgot, obviously another important consideration: what if you didn't do anything.  \n\n\nIn this case if the stock was 180 on 4/19 you'd make $4000 profit.
