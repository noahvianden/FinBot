{"title": "NVDA - thoughts on next week?", "selftext": "Wow, what day and what an opportunity! I‚Äôm a big optimist and always see glass half full üòÄ\n\nNVDA just had biggest one day drop in its history. It reached record high $973 on Friday morning and then went down to $851 after hours. About 8.2% or $170B loss in market cap, including the $24 decline in after hours.\n\nSo far, I have not read a single article or analyst explaining what just happened - there are all kind of explanations like investor fatigue, bubble, Jobs report, profit taking etc, but I didn‚Äôt see any credible answer. None of these explanations except profit taking makes sense to me. \n\nIMO, nothing fundamentally changed in NVDA on Friday. \n\nBull case:\n- they still own 80% market with absolute monopoly, no competitor in sight (pls don‚Äôt tell me AMD or INTC) and there‚Äôs no way Fed can launch antitrust caseüòõ\n- they still can‚Äôt meet the demand, \n- they‚Äôre working expeditiously to increase the capacity, remember Jensen‚Äôs TSMC trip last month\n- Apple is finally waking up and joining AI race\n-  On 3/18, GPU Conference starts. I‚Äôm looking forward to some news from NVDA confirming H200 release date in early April\n- may be stock split announcement during GPU conference or before( last time they split stock in 2019 in $600s).\n- Dell, HPX and others ramping up NVDA server build aupplies\n- for PE lovers, NVDA‚Äôs Forward PE ratio is only around 36-37 while growth is explosive.\n\nIMO, a whole lot of good is going on at NVDA and I believe NVDA will surprise the market in next earnings again. I‚Äôve 2730 shares at about $755 average and I plan to hold them for next few years!\n\nWould love to read your thoughts on NVDA!\n\n", "id": "1baohvm", "created_utc": 1710008919.0, "score": 110, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 228, "comments": [{"body": "It went up too fast, too many gaps up at opening and at some point there were no more people willing to buy at that price.

{"title": "I messed up hard today.", "selftext": "There's so much to say, so thanks to anyone who reads this. I am a 28 year old male.\n\nFirst of all, I sold 10.6 Ethereum I had mined throughout 2020-2022 when it was $1800 USD last year. That netted me about 25k CAD. I then added 3k of my own funds to have 28k in my trading account. I had told myself I'd hold that Ethereum until the next bull run... right now 1 Eth is sitting at 3923 USD. So essentially if I just held like I intended to and didn't listen to youtube crypto influencers saying it would crash I'd have more than double the amount I sold for. So I feel super shit about that especially seeing the price of Eth keep going up the last few weeks, adds salt to the wound.\n\nSecond, my fiance and I broke up after 10 years together a couple months ago and it has left me absolutely crushed. I loved her and truly thought she was the one. Without going into much detail, I never cheated, I never abused her, I always tried to show her a good time. Yes I had some small issues and I regret not dealing with them promptly, but I don't think any of them were enough for someone to stop loving me. She also had some small issues but my love for her always prevailed and I'd never think about leaving her. Through thick and thin as they say. We moved out together about 9 months ago and it was an absolute shitshow because of her over protective, disobedient senior dog that had a personal vendetta against me. I couldn't hug her, kiss her, talk to her, or enter our bedroom without him throwing a fit and barking like crazy. I'd try to discipline him but she would get mad at me for raising my voice at him even when raising my voice was the only way he would ever listen. She left the apartment we got while I am still here, every where I look in this place reminds me of her.\n\nThird, you know that mined Ethereum I was talking about and the money I got from it? All gone. My trading account went from 28k to 7k to 15k to 0. I spent the last month getting that 7k to 15k with precision and accuracy. I lost 15k today from emotional trading and got absolutely destroyed. I know, risk management has clearly left the chat.  All that time spent mining and dealing with issues with my mining rigs, paying for electricity from mining, all for nothing. I also went through an online gambling phase where I lost 17k about 6 months ago. Yes I am a fucking idiot. I have lost more than 45k due to stupid financial decisions in the last year, and that's not including the extra 25k I would have had if I didn't sell my Ethereum. So some would see it as -70k. I feel like an absolute piece of shit. I now have 10k left to my name.\n\nLife has been fucking me really hard. I don't even know where I'm going with this post. I just felt like I needed to vent and I know this probably isn't the place for it. With all these things going on I honestly have no idea how to cope with it all. I feel like an absolute failure of a man and a shell of who I used to be a year ago.\n\nWhat the fuck do I do? How do I live with myself with all these regrets and pain? I would never off myself. I just feel so fucking shitty. There are so many things causing me pain right now. My head feels like it's about to implode.\n\nEdit: I want to thank every single one of you who gave me advice and shared their experiences. I have read every single comment and made notes about some of the important things I have learned from them. You guys have instilled a new hope into me and have given me a new perspective about my challenges. I am so grateful for the support I have received from you all.

I had the advantage of learning this by playing board games with friends and family. I realized I was always the person coming up with some crazy strategy. Most times, I lost because of it, but occasionally I won big. I was 29 at the time and I looked back at my course in life, and realized I had been making so many risky moves. Started many businesses that failed. Anyway, I changed course and asked myself \"what is the lower risk, high reward course of action?\" Then went back to school and became an engineer. I make great money today.\n\nAnother thing I did was rental property investment (and index funds). Rentals are kinda low risk for the RE market, as opposed to crazier strategies people do. And I have made good money in the RE market just following a boring get rich slow investment method.\n\nAnyway, my point is, look at your life and the risks you take. You are probably taking on too much risk. I am not saying you shouldn't take on any, because people too afraid to take any risks are almost guaranteed to lose, BUT RISK SHOULD BE MANAGED. Meaning, seriously consider how much risk you are taking on with any of your plans. How did you go from 28k to 0? You took on too much risk. That's okay with small bets, but don't bet the farm. Have some other investments going too. I like to joke about the 700k I lost on the stock market, but it wasn't my only investment. In other words, I took on too much risk with the 700k, but had more money as a backup that were in safer investments.

I had over 500k in the bank, I had some crypto, and I built up a well diversified stagnant dividend portfolio that my grandpa left the family from like 120k - 500k in a couple of years. It would produce around 18k a year at the time. I started the uptrend with selling some 1k -2k of shares of CMA getting into 220 shares of CMG at 272. I diversified the portfolio well and it seemed like 90% of the moves a made panned out quickly. I would always use CMG as my savings when it was on the up before a downtrend I would sell some shares to play around and make some money in a position and kept adding to chipotle. One day I saw the downtrend about to happen for chipotle and I now had 450 shares. I saw a good day trade opportunity on a stock I had some luck on in the past. They were expected to have a positive earnings report from a lot of good moves and their sales were extremely strong that quarter. Well I sold the CMG in its entirety because I saw the pattern of the downtrend (which I was right on) and went all in on this stock the day before earnings. Woke up, and instead of an earnings call they went Chapter 11. That CMG position is worth around 1.2mil right now. Had a couple hundred shares of TSLA that year too and I took my 25k profits on to pad the CMG that could have been worth 500k now. I bought into PDD and BILI early which at the heights would have been worth 750k if I held til then. \n\nNow to the crypto. I had a mentor that helped me in a lot of aspects of my life and mindset. I sold all of my crypto because he was convinced they were all a scam. If I held the BTC, ETH and DOGE I had then, at times together they were worth 4mil. \n\nNow we get to the cash in the bank.. was looking to buy a house. Found a perfect not dream home but perfect home for a single me to be set until I had a wife and 2 kids. Like a lot of people here, I was just waiting for that housing crash. Well the house I didn‚Äôt buy 2.5Xed in value and is worth 2mil right now. \n\nWhat I did end up using the cash for was a business opportunity that I was told I would just be needed a week a month and the person I knew a long time had a good track record and was fully capable. Well let‚Äôs just say my week a month turned into 3 years of staying there. He didn‚Äôt execute his side of the bargain didn‚Äôt execute shit. Night and day from the person everyone knew him as for years. Well then he died of the vid and I was stuck in a business that wasn‚Äôt mine/my forte that was fully built wrong, not profitable but had to be completely turned around while it was a running business and also by ran. Well I did all I could, my health was suffering and it was just time to call it quits or possibly die myself.

Trust me.\n\nA few years ago, I lost my ass on options. about 50k all said and done. What's worse, is it was a 401k loan (yeah, dumb!) The biggest loss days were days where I felt self-destructive about something unrelated. I still use that year as motivation. Since then, I've started a small side-hustle to earn extra cash, I set my goals higher in my day job and have gotten a promotion and several raises. I started working on a Master of Finance online degree. I am way more careful with my spending and was able to save more than I ever have, which I carefully invest in value stocks, index funds, and crypto (buy and hold). I still do some options plays, but they're calculated and small-scale. I'm up now way more than I lost just by being patient and diligent. There are days I'll spend hours doing research then decide, \"Nope, not today.\" Close my computer and go outside. I make a point to mostly ignore the market and get to the mountains as often I can for hiking and snowboarding. I take better care of myself and lost weight. I started seeing a councilor to work through my self-destructive tendencies. I even got married to a wonderful woman after 10 years of being divorced and broken-hearted, despite no desire to do so again for most of those years. I credit a lot of that growth to that bad year.

You turned a couple of electric bills into $25k.  That is fantastic! One thing you'll have to learn in any trading is that every decision you make will turn out to be wrong given enough time unless something extraordinary happens.  You have to learn that a position is over once it's back to cash and that cash is yours now, not the positions. \n\nI've told this story here before but I learned that lesson 13 years ago through BTC.  I turned $500 into a paid-off Corvette by selling at the then-all-time high, prices dropped the next week and I looked like a genius. 6 months later new ATHs were posting nonstop for weeks and I looked like an idiot.  My friends knew exactly how many I'd sold and would mention often how many millions I'd have.  Luckily for me, I got a bit of a reprieve in this lesson because 3 years later the exchange I had used, MTGox, lost all the BTC it had, including my fractional BTC, and I've been able to happily walk away from the lawsuit.  Some of the people I knew back in the early days have spent the last decade going back and forth to Japan and paying lawyers in the hopes of getting their millions back through the bankruptcy and restitution proceedings there.   \n\nSecond, that's a relationship issue and this is options advice so let's frame it as a trade, probably the best trade of your life.   You turned a decade of memories, annoyance, and dogshit into the opportunity to do it better.  Don't trade that opportunity for sadness and remorse now, go out and find whatever makes you happy then find someone new to share that happiness with.  It's hard, but you need to learn to separate life from trading and focus on you before your money.  If life is too much to manage, the markets won't make it any better.\n\nThird, you made some bad trades, good job, there are lessons in that too.  Spend the time to analyze why they were bad.  Why did you decide to put the money in, why didn't you take it out sooner, were there signs you thought you saw that weren't there, did you ignore something you shouldn't have? Then spend the time to analyze the month prior when you more than doubled your money. it's the exact same questions again: Why did you decide to put the money in, why didn't you take it out sooner, were there signs you thought you saw that weren't there, did you ignore something you shouldn't have?\n\nIf you have $10k left to your name that means you've weathered a $70k loss and are still better off than most of the country.  It sounds like you might be double-counting the stock losses and ETH money, but let's use $70k since you said it.\n\nThe main thing is that it seems you're living the life of a gambler without the mindset of a gambler.  You have $10k  and I'd bet a job that's allowed to have these funds in the first place. Reset, do not gamble (casino or market) for the weekend, on Monday evaluate any positions you currently hold, close the losers, move any cash to a HYSA, and consider yourself back at square one. Square one is your safety net, you can coast here as long as necessary.\n\nOnce you understand the winners and losers from the past month, evaluate yourself. Is the $10k to be used as trading funds or are you out of those right now and back to saving?  Should you be looking for more secure investments for now or are you ready to be on this rollercoaster again?  Is it better to be off the rollercoaster and eating a funnel cake right now?  If so don't get back into the markets, listen to what you need, spend a week doing something else, and reevaluate next week.\n\nWhen you feel secure and ready to jump back in, take all the lessons you've learned the past couple of months and make them make you a better trader.
