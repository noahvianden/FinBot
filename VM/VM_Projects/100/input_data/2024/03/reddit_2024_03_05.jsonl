However, they run into the risk of cutting too early, and then inflation gets stuck around 3%, and then having to raise rates again in the future. Cutting and raising rates again is almost guaranteed to create a recession. That will destroy any credibility they have left, and lead to a deep recession like the one required by Volcker to win back credibility. New homeowners are waiting for the Fed cut to refinance. Businesses are retaining surplus workers, holding out, and waiting for the Fed cut to reinvest, expand, and do capex again. That's all gonna get upended if the Fed reverse course. Then who's going to trust what the Fed says anymore.\n\nRemember the Fed is betting the farm, once again, on \"this time is different\". They are ignoring their economic model/theory, ignoring history. Growth is strong, unemployment rate is low, financial condition is loose. But they don't care, as long as inflation keeps going down. So they essentially have no framework, no forward forecasting. They think there's no playbook for pandemics, so they are just going month by month, observe the data, ask their business contacts, see if inflation keeps going down. If it shows any hint of not going down, like in Feb 2023, Sept 2023, and Mar 2024 if we get one more hot CPI, they are gonna panic and change their tone. Because inflation going down is the only excuse they have to justify letting strong GDP and low unemployment continue.\n\nNow what is the cost if they wait too long? We might slip into a recession perhaps. But likely not a deep one, because consumer leverages isn't that high yet. But at least now they have a \"justification\" to lower rates without losing credibility. Also, they have a playbook for dealing with recession. They've done it plenty of times. They don't have a playbook for high inflation. People like to shit on Arthur Burns for letting inflation get out of control, but the guy only started lowering rates 3 months after the recession started, and inflation still came back.
