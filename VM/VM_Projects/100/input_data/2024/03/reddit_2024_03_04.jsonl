{"title": "Apple hit with more than $1.95 billion EU antitrust fine over music streaming", "selftext": "The European Commission, the European Union‚Äôs executive arm, on Monday hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) antitrust fine for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\n\nThe Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.\n\nApple also banned developers of music streaming apps from providing any instructions about how users could subscribe to these cheaper offers, the Commission alleged.\n\nThis is Apple‚Äôs first antitrust fine from Brussels and is among one of the biggest dished out to a technology company by the EU.\n\nThe European Commission opened an investigation into Apple after a complaint from Spotify in 2019. The probe was narrowed down to focus on contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription services at lower prices outside of the App Store.\n\nApple‚Äôs conduct lasted almost 10 years, according to the Commission, and ‚Äúmay have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store.‚Äù\n\nApple response:\n\nIn a fiery response to the fine, Apple said Spotify would stand to gain the most from the EU pronouncement.\n\n‚ÄúThe primary advocate for this decision ‚Äî and the biggest beneficiary ‚Äî is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation,‚Äù Apple said in a statement.\n\n‚ÄúToday, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe‚Äôs music streaming market ‚Äî more than double their closest competitor‚Äôs ‚Äî and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognisable brands in the world.‚Äù\n\nApple said that a ‚Äúlarge part‚Äù of Spotify‚Äôs success is thanks to the Cupertino giant‚Äôs App Store, ‚Äúalong with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world.‚Äù\n\nApple said that Spotify pays it nothing. That‚Äôs because instead of selling subscriptions in their iOS app, Spotify sell them via their own website stead. Apple does not collect a commission on those purchases.\n\nDevelopers over the years have spoken out against the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.\n\nSpotify did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.\n\nThe fine will ramp up tensions between Big Tech and Brussels at a time when the EU is increasing scrutiny of these firms.\n\nLast year, the Commission designated Apple among other tech firms like Microsoft and Meta as ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù under a landmark regulation called the Digital Markets Act, which broadly came into effect last year.\n\nThe term gatekeepers refers to massive internet platforms which the EU believes are restricting access to core platform services, such as online search, advertising, and messaging and communications.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices from tech players, and force them to open out some of their services to other competitors. Smaller internet firms and other businesses have complained about being hurt by these companies‚Äô business practices.\n\nThese laws have already had an impact on Apple. The Cupertino, California-based giant announced plans this year to open up its iPhone and iPad to alternative app stores other than its own. Developers have long-complained about the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/04/apple-hit-with-more-than-1point95-billion-eu-antitrust-fine-over-music-streaming.html", "id": "1b6agqo", "created_utc": 1709557613.0, "score": 1687, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 411, "comments": [{"body": "Innocent question: where this money goes?", "score": 380, "replies": [{"body": "EU‚Äôs pockets.

I was impressed by its products and management which are largely due to Elon Musk‚Äôs ability to recruit and organise engineers of the highest quality. \n\nAmong other things, I invested because of the compensation package awarded to Mr Musk. I considered it to require the achievement of milestones which were extremely ambitious, but which would make worthwhile targets even if they were not met.

The plaintiff‚Äôs attorneys did not represent me or my views. I consider it to be frivolous at best and probably deeply malicious. \n\nI wanted Mr. Musk to have his 2018 compensation package when I invested. I would vote for it again now.  There was no benefit to shareholders from the lawsuit. \n\nLosing the compensation package might well remove any incentive Mr. Musk has to work for Tesla and this might well cause extreme damage to the company and its stock price. \n\nThe plaintiff‚Äôs attorneys have done nothing for me as a shareholder and in my opinion are entitled to nothing. I strongly feel that it is unjust that the plaintiff‚Äôs attorneys have asked for such an egregious payment in shares. This dilutes the voting power of the existing shareholders. They should have to justify a cash payment, if anything.\n\nShareholders‚Äô rights should remain paramount. \n\nI have made some money from investing in Tesla, but now I am potentially going to lose a large proportion of my money depending on how this case proceeds. This could cause extreme damage to the stock price and impact my savings very badly and I am worried about what you are going to decide. \n\nI thank you for considering my views as a small shareholder and I look forward to your response.\n\nYours sincerely,\n<my name>", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "LOL, how is saving shareholders 50B not a benefit?
