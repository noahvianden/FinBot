Options traders use delta, return on capital, buying power reduction (BPR), and look at their days to expiration to get a feel for their theta. You need to be weary of expiration risk because of gamma. As you approach expiration (especially 21DTE and under) you don't have any room for making adjustments. Being aware of Vega at trade initiation, during, and near the end of the trade is critical.\n\nIf you don't know what my above paragraph is talking about, you aren't ready to trade options. Watch the whiteboards until you do understand, then START SMALL, and always understand that every trade you put on could result in the max loss that you construct with your option strategy.\n\nStay away from low DTE options plays while you are learning.

The Greeks have a massive effect on the value of your options. I also second what another Redditor said that you should avoid single stock options. You should also look up and study all the different types of risk in the market. If you are trading single stock options, you have concentration risk.\n\nThere isn't the same concentration risk if you are trading index options. Another added benefit of index options is that they are more liquid, leading to better fills. Also, some index options like SPX or XSP are considered section 1256 contracts that have better tax implications where they are taxed at 40% short term and 60% long-term capital gains rates, much like futures contracts.\n\nWhat I meant by the profit target comment is that usually, you are targeting a percentage gain, not a kind of arbitrary number. I'm not sure how you got your target number, so I won't assume it wasn't a percentage.\n\nAnother critical thing to know when selling options is to monitor your risk reward. As time passes and you collect theta (time premium), your risk to reward ratio changes. For example, when I trade futures options, I always place GTC orders to buy back my naked put short option legs for 85% profit target. There is no reason to hold onto the outsized risk of the short option when you have already gained the majority of the profit you were looking for.\n\nAnother suggestion, something that blew my mind when I first discovered it, is to look up pictures of the difference in decay curves between at-the-money and out-of-the-money options. You will see that out of the money options decay very slowly nearing expiration.
