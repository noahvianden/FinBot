I personally don't have a stake on GME nor plan on ever having one. I think everyone here knows that b&m retail is a slow and dying industry so if you think GME is one of those rare ones to be able to excel, by all means, do as your money please. Here are my concerns with GME:\n\n1. It's b&m retail. And not the good kind. It's the kind where you can shop at hundreds of other competitors for. \n2. Physical copies is in decline. Gaming companies don't need GameStop to distribute games anymore. This isn't 2005 where you couldn't really shop online and gaming companies needed distribution channels. Why would they give up margin to GameStop when they can just sell it directly?\n3. A sign of desperation from GameStop was their NFT marketplace. I remember how highly touted that would be according to GME investors and GME themselves. To me, NFT's were just a pump-and-dump scheme so it seemed odd that a company would seriously market that as bullish. When you're looking to do an NFT marketplace, that doesn't mean you are innovative. It means you are desperate. And anyone with any sense of reasoning would have been able to tell you that it wouldn't survive which is why GME quickly realized and shut it down. \n4. There's talk about GME being profitable. Yes, because they're cutting operations massively. When you're shutting down stores and reducing overhead, you're going to be profitable. The issue with this is this is great for mom-and-pop stores but horrible for investors in a declining business. Why? Because while GameStop may record a profit, their revenues are down significantly. Just ask yourself: Would you invest in a company that will generate less than 33% the revenue it did 10 years ago and is projected to record lower revenues? GameStop reported $6 billion in revenue for 2023. In 2012, they reported $9.6 billion. But we're concerned about profits, right? How about if I told you in that same year, 2012, they reported $340 million in net income? So do the math for me, GameStop's business was far better in 2012 than it is today but the stock price today is double what it was in 2012? Again, make that make sense for me, anyone. Being profitable is amazing news for GME.... IF, they were also able to grow revenue. Why is this problematic? Look below:\n5. Declining revenue = declining business. Declining business = no growth. No growth = competitors eat into your market share, provide better service, and replace you. Eventually, what will happen is these declining revenue businesses end up becoming unprofitable again because they've lost too much market share and their costs become higher than their sales. This is how Amazon was able to destroy b&m retail. They seized market share, removed competitors, and many of these competitors ended up just having a few profitable stores but are no longer nationwide brands. To simple it down, just imagine if you owned a business. You're losing money so you shut down stores. Your revenue will continue dropping every year but you're able to be profitable. In your mind, you're thinking: \"Fuck, I'm eventually going to be screwed. I might be profitable now but I have to find a way to increase revenue and grow my business again.\" That's the spot GameStop is in. I guarantee you GameStop management would rather have growing revenues even if they operate at a loss than operating at small profits with a decline in revenue.\n6. \"But GameStop is working on creating new revenue lines by selling keyboards and computer parts.\" Again, this is where you see the desperation take place. Selling keyboards and computer parts might bring some revenue in but hundreds of retailers have a foothold here. This is bearish and not bullish. There needs to be a sustainable growing business here for GameStop to rely on. Selling keyboards/computer parts is what retailers have been doing for... 50 years now. What makes it bullish that GameStop decides to do it now?\n7. GameStop received the mother of all lifelines when their shares popped and they sold shares to fund the business. If that didn't happen, the bankruptcy of GameStop would have been imminent. Don't mistake them having cash as it meaning their business operations have improved. It's like giving a shopping addict a new line of credit. It'll last them some time but unless you're able to cure their shopping addiction, you're just delaying the inevitable.\n8. I think a huge part that goes unnoticed is GameStop management refuses and declines to do any earnings call. My inclination is they just have no clue what they should say at this point. Remember, they had no issues with an earnings call when share prices were high and they could still use the \"We're working on our groundbreaking new NFT marketplace that we believe could be the future of NFT's\" excuse. But when that ran out and share prices began tanking, it became a situation of it's better to not say anything and just leave everything ambiguous. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, I have no position of GME. I honestly have not shopped at a GameStop store since they bought EBGAMES. But I believe it's fairly obvious that by the end of this decade, GameStop would likely be bankrupt. People couldn't believe Blockbuster would go bankrupt... until it did. Remember how amazing Toysrus was until people realized they could just go to Amazon and have those same toys delivered for half the price? There's just not many b&m retailers that can survive unless they're offering products that are difficult to shop online or have better pricing such as what Home Depot, Best Buy, Target, Walmart, etc., can provide.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Ah.. megacorp companies! ‚ôæÔ∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èü§ô", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Profits are good.

While the rate cut may have impacted inflation, the recession began a month later.
