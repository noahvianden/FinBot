That said, it now sees actual speed bumps and handles them correctly so I can forgive that error as the road repair does vaguely look speed bump shaped. \n\nWife finds it is still going the wrong speed so she won‚Äôt use it. Like if there‚Äôs a red light in 500 feet, it will accelerate too fast and then brake too hard, where a human would basically coast at a lower speed more comfortably. Acceleration is too fast on some residential streets where it feels like it should be a slower speed. And like I said above sometimes the approach is too slow on some intersections where I‚Äôm making my a right turn. \n\nOne big improvement I‚Äôve seen is handling de facto right turn lanes. There are a couple of spots where there is a de factor right turn lane, where there is amount physical space for a right turn lane, but no lane marking (might be a bike lane and a parking lane for example). All the cars just create a right turn lane and use it that way. V11 would stay in the lane, v12 uses the de facto right turn lane! \n\nAnother example is this intersection where there is a right turn lane, but so many people turn right here that it backs up into a long line past where the right turn lane is marked (like maybe last 200 feet are a marked right turn lane but the line of cars extends 400 feet). V11 would stay in its lane, but v12 does get in the line.

{"title": "$TSLA market cap will never be under 1 trillion after this year", "selftext": "TL;DR I work in deep tech, I did not believe proper full self driving can be done, but it's happening for fucking real. v12.3 is genuinely close to the real FSD that Elon has been promising since 2016. There's zero reason why this won't propel $TSLA to trillion-dollar club.\n\nI'd originally bought $TSLA at $20 (adjusted for splits) back in 2018, sold most of it in 2021 (helped me buy a house), and started loading up again since last week. I work in tech, and deeply understand engineering. There were many reasons for selling my shares besides needing cash. For example, I did not believe in the business prospects of Cybertruck, Optimus, solar roof, and similar new products. But by far the biggest reason was I couldn't see FSD happening for real, because of technical limitations. Elon has himself said that Tesla valuation should be close to nothing if FSD does not materialize. Without getting into too many details, I studied the technicalities behind it, and my conclusion was it's just not possible. And it started to feel like Elon is trying to hide that reality and fool people (and himself).\n\nBut, a new technology arrived, and that conclusion became invalid. And I've been amazed how swiftly a large company like Tesla has taken full advantage of it.\n\nWe all know something changed in the technology space since 2022: large neural nets (built upon the transformer architecture) that power ChatGPT, Bard/Gemini, etc. This same technology has started powering Tesla FSD since last couple of versions of it. Similar to how first version of ChatGPT was very good, but with many flaws, all new FSD (with end-to-end neural nets) was very good, but with many flaws. Well, now v12.3 is out, as of last week, and it's now *extremely good, with very few flaws*. It's really just a matter of solving edge cases now; at least as far as launching it in the US is concerned.\n\nI actually believe now there is no technical reason why true FSD cannot be done. In fact I think it'll be fully achieved this year itself. And we all know Elon is going to demo the shit out of this ‚Äì¬†may be even dedicate an entire public event to this by end of year.

If I'm being honest, I'm not worried about flying on a Max, personally.  I didn't mention those two planes because I felt like people should avoid them, just that if I had to be skeptical about anything, those are the ones to focus on.  Why?  Well, that's my personal risk acceptance I guess, which is all that matters at the end of the day.  I know there's a crazy amount of safety carryover that goes on between designs.  Think about the issues that just came up.  They lost a door plug and safely landed the plane.  Tire fell off a 777?  It's fine, the plane just went around and landed safely...though I'm curious why it had to involve landing in an airport parking lot.  And now we're hearing frequent media reports any time a plane has a minor and totally manageable mechanical/control issue and the like because Boeing is under such heavy scrutiny.\n\nNow that said, there are the two fatal plane crashes a few years back with the Max due to flight control issues caused by one of the sensors.  Whoooo wee, those were real bad.  Catastrophic mishaps.  Those are the kinds of mishaps that concern me the most (I mean, all of them do, but death or permanent injury are rather high up on my list of things I don't want to occur).  Lot to unpack there, but my understanding (at the time because that's when I was working aero), was that US pilots would've had the appropriate training necessary to detect that hazardous situation and resolve it.  So, not only was it a failure of the design, but a failure of the necessary training that should've been provided to those pilots.  \"Don't worry, it's just like every other 737 you've flown\" wasn't the correct path there.  But the point is, in many cases having the pilot in the loop ends up enhancing the safety even more, and we have some pretty dang good pilots managing these platforms.\n\nIf the FAA or EASA decide to revoke the airworthiness cert for the Max and 787 (which I hear the EASA is already seriously considering no longer accepting the FAA's cert for the Max), then you'll see me actively avoiding those planes...but at that point they won't be allowed to fly anyway.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Bagholder spotted.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm not trying to tell people what they should and shouldn't fly.  These planes are incredibly safe regardless.  I mean the Max lost a door plug and still landed safely.  This wasn't a catastrophic mishap, and the fact that the plane was able to land safely was not a mistake.  There's a lot of system safety effort that goes into these designs.  Was losing the plug an oversight on the safety engineering group's part?  Or a quality team oversight?  Both?  No idea, but clearly the system safety effort allowed for that plane to return to the ground safely AND didn't result in a bunch of people getting sucked out the gaping hole in the side of the plane.\n\nSo, honestly, I don't have any reservations about flying on any of these planes.
