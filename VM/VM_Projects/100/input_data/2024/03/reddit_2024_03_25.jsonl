For nearly the entire bunch, share prices are trading near all-time highs.\n\nJeff Bezos sold Amazon shares worth $8.5 billion in multiple transactions this month. Meanwhile, Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, sold $150 million in stock last week, his first cash-out since taking the top job at the bank 18 years ago. Around the same time, Leon Black, cofounder and former CEO of Apollo Global Management, shed $172.8 million in stock—also a first-ever stock sale. \n\nIn dozens of trades since the beginning of February, Mark Zuckerberg unloaded about 1.4 million shares of Meta stock worth roughly $638 million, according to an analysis from insider stock sales data firm Verity. This latest batch of sales came after previously culling 588,200 shares in November, 688,400 in December, and 447,200 in January. He sold nearly $600 million worth in the three months leading up to February, and his proceeds from combined sales during the past four months have reached $1.2 billion. \n\nSimilarly, the trust for the Walton family, heirs to Walmart’s founder, sold $1.5 billion in Walmart stock this month.

{"title": "EU launches probe into Meta, Apple and Alphabet under sweeping new tech law", "selftext": "The European Union on Monday opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta, in its first probe under the sweeping new Digital Markets Act tech legislation.\n\n“Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple’s rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta’s ‘pay or consent model’,” the Commission said in a statement.\n\nThe first two probes focus on Alphabet and Apple and relate to so-called “anti-steering rules.” Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.\n\n“The way that Apple and Alphabet’s implemented the DMA rules on anti-steering seems to be at odds with the letter of the law. Apple and Alphabet will still charge various recurring fees, and still limit steering,” EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said during a press conference on Monday.\n\nApple has already fallen foul of the EU’s rules on this. This month, the company was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) after the European Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.\n\nThe third probe focuses on Alphabet. The European Commission said it is looking into whether Alphabet’s display of Google search results “may lead to self-preferencing in relation to Google’s” other services such as Google Shopping over similar rival services.\n\nThe fourth probe focuses on Apple. The  Commission said it is investigating whether the company has complied with obligations under the DMA to ensure that users can easily uninstall app on iOS and can easily change default settings on iOS. The probe also focuses on whether Apple is actively prompting users with choices to allow them to change default services on iOS, such as for the web browser or search engine.\n\nThe Commission said that it is “concerned that Apple’s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.”\n\nThe fifth and final investigation focuses on Meta and its so-called “pay and consent” model. Last year, Meta introduced an ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The Commission is looking into whether offering the subscription model without ads or making users consent to terms and conditions for the free service, is in violation of the DMA.\n\n“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.”\n\nThierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said during a press conference that there should be “free alternative options” offered by Meta for its services that are “less personalized.”\n\nGatekeepers is the term used to label large tech firms that are required to comply with the DMA in the EU.\n\n “We will continue to use all available tools, should any gatekeeper try to circumvent or undermine the obligations of the DMA,” Vestager said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/eu-launches-probe-into-meta-apple-and-alphabet-under-sweeping-new-tech-law.html", "id": "1bnaa9e", "created_utc": 1711362402.0, "score": 438, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "Didn't Google shopping already get sued for this and they changed their ranking algorithm as a result?

Steam is competing with GOG, Epic, EA, Ubisoft, Xbox, Blizzard, itch.io, and a number of smaller companies yet still manages to print an astonishing amount of money. Most sales on an open Playstation would still go through Sony purely by virtue of it being the default. Do you think the App Stores marketshare is going to suddenly drop just because people have options? Of course not.\n\nYou also haven't refuted my logical consistency claim. Alphabet (Google) makes Android, which is also used for cheap subsidized devices, yet no one is hesitating to argue that they should be forced to face additional competition. For that matter, do you think Nintendo should be compelled to open the Switch simply because it *isn't* being sold at a subsidized price? It's a line of reasoning that leads to nonsense.\n\nThe principle of hardware openness is not something that should be defeated simply by asserting that your business model \"requires it\". Subjecting companies to different standards based solely on their per-unit profit encourages those with lucrative exclusive software storefronts to price their device just low enough to qualify as \"subsidized hardware\". There would be absolutely nothing stopping Apple from doing so.\n\nPC is an entirely different ballgame, and the average console user absolutely is not going to seriously consider switching. Steam Deck might peel off users, but selling PCs as consoles has already been tried and failed. Operating a gaming PC is too much hassle for the average casual gamer, especially a Windows-based one.

Gaming consoles are not so lucky as they are not necessary devices, and most games generally do not have really high margins. As an open platform, sure playstation store would get most sales, but it would be way under 100%.

That's what Kimbal Musk told Walter Isaacson.  Shivon Zilis corroborated that to Issacson as well.  \n\nA lot of TMC folks simply assumed it would be business as usual, with Elon driving Tesla to repeated wins.

I reached that same incorrect conclusion.  \n\nI'd always kept a lot of investments outside of TSLA because I was concerned about Elon being pivotal to Tesla's survival.  Some in TMC community back in 2012-2014 saw a significant threat that the Russian government would assassinate Musk because of SpaceX, and Tesla would be derailed as collateral damage.
