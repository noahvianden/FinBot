I do think they will be a major automotive player, but I think the whole narrative, specifically about owning the future with their battery tech, is just fundamentally flawed. I think the market is finally starting to price the company properly and as such I think the price will continue to trend down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as my knowledge goes, there is nothing \"special\" about their batteries vs any other battery manufacturer. Maybe they use a cheaper manufacturing process, but from everything I've seen, the batteries are still made via a wet slurry process.\n\nTraditional car batteries are made of lead and sulfur because they don't need to be used intensively while the car is on, they just need to help with starting the car via the ignitor, and thus release a very high voltage current initially.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, batteries that are expected to be utilized in an energy cycling process are typically powered by one of four ECELL chemical reactions (either Cobalt, Zinc, Magnesium, or Lithium). If you look at a list of standard cell potentials, lithium provides the most voltage, and additionally its very lightweight. That last part is what makes it attractive for the EV industry. You get far more bang for your buck with lithium because you don't get the nasty diminishing returns because of weight creep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you can look up a standard cell potential chart - congratulations. You just acquired Tesla's secret formula for their batteries. Really. Its that simple. The real value of the company does **NOT** come from the fact that they figured out that -3V is better than -2V, but rather that they were the ***first*** company in the EV segment. \n\nTo me this has resulted in two major factors:\n\nHuge brand name for engineers at top schools, and thus, attracts good talent. The issue is, and you can find this on google pretty easily,  that Tesla has a horrible track record of work life balance. In fact in the long run, I think this could cause their business to shrink because they will no longer be able to attract said top talent, but thats a different discussion.\n\nCool design \"Wow\" factor for consumers, and reputation. Why would I buy an EV from a legacy maker when Tesla has been making them for way longer? (Not going to bring up car reliability because that we could argue for hours over. I hate GM and VW. Nuff said).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe real reason I think TSLA will continue to be a big player in automotive though is really because \n\n1. Their chargers, and network, will become industry standard and they will make a killing of licensing it\n2. Because they are building a lithium refinery. They already manufacture the batteries in house, but now they want to make the entire process a vertically integrated aspect. This will cause their batteries to be made way cheaper than say Ford, who would need to buy them from a refiner who would need to buy the lithium and other metals from yet another supplier.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "None of the stocks in your list are undervalued.

Some higher level margin accounts may only require a fraction of this amount, perhaps as low as $4,400 being held by the broker for 2 contracts. This is because the broker is allowing \"naked puts\" to be sold which have a higher risk in that more puts can be sold than the account can handle, and this is why only the most experienced traders can qualify for this approval level. These seasoned traders know how to manage their accounts and these trades to not take too much risk.  \n\nEven if the full $30K is being held, it is not all at risk as the odds of AAPL dropping substantially is low, or near zero odds of going out of business. \n\nYes, 30% of an account being risked in one stock is far too much risk. Limit risk to around 5% of the account in any one stock is a much better way to trade. If a stock does have a loss, which won't even be the full 5%, it will not have as large an impact. \n\nFind lower cost stocks you would be good own and make smaller lower risk trades on them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do you guys typically close out your positions much quicker?\n\nYes. I close for a 50% profit using a gtc limit order to do so automatically. This takes off the risk and frees up capital to make another trade. Rinse and repeat as they say which can see the premiums and profits add up.\n\nLet's look at another random stock for a better example. BAC is trading around $37 and the 17May 35 strike is selling for .52 or $52. The full cost of the shares would be about $3,450, or $535 if using a high level margin account. Assuming a 50% profit of $26 over 25ish days, this would be a .007% profit on the full amount, or .05% on the reduced amount held. \n\nIf these trades can be turned over a full year it would be 14.6 trades for a $379.60 in profits. Note that the \"locked cash\" in account is held and then freed up when each trade is closed, so it is not cumulative, meaning the same $3,450 can be used over and over for the profit percentage calculation. $379.60 / $3,450 = 11% return. Using the lower amount held, the $379.60 / $535 = 70.1% return of buying power used.\n\nOnce again, it is crazy rare for stocks do not drop to zero overnight, so while it is possible to be assigned shares that drop and need to be held, the chance of any significant loss is low.\n\nSelling puts is the first step of the wheel strategy that sells puts for profits, then if assigned the shares to sell covered calls which with time and patience can often see the position recover.
