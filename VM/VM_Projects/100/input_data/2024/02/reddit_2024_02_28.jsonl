The company expects its restructuring plan will be “substantially complete” by the end of December.\n\n“We are continuing to optimize our global real estate footprint to best support our business,” Wilson wrote in his Wednesday note. “We are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.”\n\nWilson added that the cuts will enable EA to focus more on its “biggest opportunities — including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities.” \n\nDuring the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month, Wilson said the company would focus on continuing to invest in its existing gaming franchises attracting large online audiences, including Apex Legends, Battlefield, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL and The Sims.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/ea-layoffs-company-to-cut-5percent-of-workforce-or-about-670-employees.html", "id": "1b2knaw", "created_utc": 1709161853.0, "score": 636, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "Pretty overvalued stock and I guess you don't need so many employees when you just reskin the same game every year and make all your money selling FIFA packs.", "score": 329, "replies": [{"body": "Now AI will reskin them.", "score": 41, "replies": []}, {"body": "Does anyone knows what are the revenues they are getting from selling those fifa packs", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "a lot of money", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Any number you can share", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "And AI", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Nope, they over hired.

Yet, the company is still here.

What happened in June with the seriously bullish skew.](https://preview.redd.it/gxoplwjdvclc1.png?width=1657&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c23c7215723f8520b20513bcc034dcab504b5aa)\n\nLets look at the chart around the time everyone became a bull in June.  \n\n\n[From June to July stock price rose roughly 100&#37;, how the hell.?](https://preview.redd.it/crr8r7dovclc1.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2c2da65832e2fa9d5f8f3c46b565ac632ef8a28)\n\n  \nLets revisit our financials page to see if anything significant happened in June 2023.  \n\n\n[Would you look at that, the company \\(still losing money\\) improved its overall Revenue and Income.](https://preview.redd.it/hav2i0vyvclc1.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ac1a2ca0d9338b9df468b8f1934b7120dd52232)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know what you're thinking. \"Hormozi, wtf is this, sounds like garbage, too long didn't read, what am I supposed to buy?\"   \n\n\nThe answer is, I have no fucking clue. But my take is any improvement this company can see in the near future and long term will absolutely skyrocket the price. And if it doesn't, well it was shit anyway.  \nI've seen the vehicles they produce, and they intend to market and produce a more moderately priced version for regards like you.  \n\n\nTLDR\n\n* Company financials bad, but improving.\n* Entering a more retail friendly market soon.\n* Can't really get much worse than it is and if this company can get its shit together, in my mind we see Tesla 2.0.

Anecdotally, I've lived in China for seven years and never felt things so flat. Shopping centers and restaurants are dead. The streets are quiet. Add to that, the media reports paint a dark picture. The numbers coming out of China itself aren't so great. Manufacturing is getting bad, and supply chains are slowly moving away. Youth employment hit 25% and then suddenly became an unreported figure.\n\nI'm all for new information and reassessment. But what exactly are you seeing that dispels so much data, news, and anecdotal observations?", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "What do you mean supply chains are slowly moving away? China has the most vertically integrated supply chain out of any modern economy maybe with the exception being Russia due to its immense natural resources. That’s why things like EVs and smartphones from China are so cheap compared to foreign competitors even though quality is comparable in many cases. Perhaps you are referring to investors moving away? That has less to do with the economy and more to do with CCP regulations and barbaric espionage laws. \n\nIn terms of raw data the PMI was 49 in December and 49.2 in January. That is a minor contraction but certainly not anything out of the ordinary for China. They constantly go through minor 3/4 month cycles of contraction followed by periods of expansion. If you look at raw PMI data prior to Covid you would see the same patterns we see now. You have to understand that China is super cyclical in nature due to the reliance on manufacturing output and foreign demand. \n\nElectricity consumption which is a great indicator for manufacturing health was up significantly in 2023. In 2023 it was 9,220 TWH (terrawatt hours) compared to 8,640 TWH in 2022. That’s an increase of 6.7%. That’s from the partial reopening and increase in energy demand and manufacturing output. \n\nIf you look at the largest e-commerce businesses in China revenue estimates for 2024 and 2025 are up 5-10% for 2023. That’s a great indicator of healthy discretionary spending within China. In terms of youth unemployment (ages 16-24) I would say that’s a terrible indicator for economic strength. \n\nReason 1. Is that China’s college enrollment rate has been hitting records post Covid. College enrollment was around 60% for 2022/2023 compared to around 30% in 2012. Higher college enrollment directly correlates with lower active employment within that age bracket. \n\nReason 2. That age bracket (16-24) is heavily reliant on the service sector for job employment. After the Zero Covid Policy and the barrage of lockdowns Chinas service sector was hit the worst and has not at all fully recovered. Chinese tourism is also down which negatively affects that sector. China is at least two years behind the US in terms of service sector recovery. Doesn’t mean it won’t recover. \n\nTotal unemployment is actually trending down currently at 5.2%. At the beginning of 2023 it was 5.6% and at the beginning of 2022 it was over 6%. That shows us that companies within China are still hiring somewhat aggressively. \n\nGDP in 2023 was +5% and GDP estimates for 2024 are +4.5%. I certainly wouldn’t call that a deep recession. The problem is that the western media has been cherry picking tiny data points and using that as a broad brush to paint a poor picture of the country’s economy. If you deep dive into all the data you’d notice that things aren’t as doom and gloom as everyone is saying. \n\nI never said it’s a perfect picture.

These countries and more are finding themselves producing more and more of the stuff that used to be made in China.

This is not simply service sector. It's also the case that unemployment figures obviously don't include people out of the workforce. In China, that means a lot as hundreds of millions are set to retire over the next decade. Those jobs don't have enough young people to fill them. What that means, is you can have a situation where unemployment is extremely low and yet the economy is sputtering because too few people have too many old folks to care for. This is more about China's demographic issue, but it affects unemployment statistics as well.\n\n**GDP**\n\n**\"**GDP in 2023 was +5% and GDP estimates for 2024 are +4.5%.\"\n\nA few things to say about that.\n\n1) GDP figures are dubious.

China has a massive GDP, but it is still a relatively poor country on a per capita basis. Again, what that means is there is a time not so far away where there will be 400-500 million retirees to care for at a time where life expectancy is high, and birth rates are low. This happened to Japan AFTER they became a rich country. China is going to experience that before they get their per capita GDP where needed.\n\nWe can disagree here. I think over the next decade I'll look a lot more correct than you will. Between supply chains moving, low birth rates, slowing of economic development, hostility toward China, influx of retirees, foreign capital moving away, an insane real estate bubble (literally 6 times as expensive as America on a average salary/home price basis), and no tolerance at all for immigration, China is in a tight spot. The figures you are throwing around absolutely pale in comparison to deeper problems in the country, unfortunately.\n\nIf I may ask: in ten years, where do you see China?

That’s what happens when you have two day shipping and a variety of products available on a single website. The same phenomenon happened in the US with Amazon. That’s not at all a reflection of the health of an economy. That’s rather a reflection of consumer efficiency and demand for more streamlined goods and delivery. Dozens of US retail outlets are going bankrupt simply because they can’t compete with e-commerce giants.
