{"title": "Sony cuts PlayStation 5 sales forecast to 21 million units after posting record revenue", "selftext": "Sony cut its sales forecast for its flagship PlayStation 5 console on Wednesday, after warning of weaker transactions in its key gaming division.\n\nThe Japanese gaming giant said it now expects to sell 21 million units of the PS5 in the fiscal year ending March, down from a previous forecast of 25 million units.\n\nThe cut in outlook comes after Sony posted record quarterly revenue in the all-important December quarter which encompasses the holiday season. Sony sold 8.2 million units of its flagship PlayStation 5 console in its fiscal third quarter, which runs from October to December. Sony has sold 16.4 million PS5 units so far in its fiscal year.\n\nSony also trimmed its fiscal year sales forecast for the gaming division by 210 billion yen to 4.15 trillion yen, saying it expects a decrease in sales of hardware.\n\nThe company‚Äôs challenge now lies in trying to keep up momentum for the PS5, which was released more than three years ago. In October, Sony made available a refreshed version of the console with better specs.\n\nRival Nintendo has been grappling with a similar issue, managing to keep interest in its near seven-year old Switch console thanks to new game releases and movies associated with its famous characters, like Super Mario.\n\nSales at Sony‚Äôs gaming business rose 16% year-on-year to 1.4 trillion yen in the December quarter, the company said on Wednesday. However, operating profit fell 26% in the division, due to increase losses from hardware due to promotions in the period as well as a decline in sales of first-party games.\n\nSony also lowered its sales forecast for the entire company to 12.3 trillion yen from 12.4 trillion yen for the fiscal year.\n\nSony beat analyst expectations by a wide margin in its fiscal third quarter when it reported results on Wednesday.\n\nHere‚Äôs how Sony did in the December quarter versus LSEG consensus estimates:\n\nRevenue: 3.75 trillion Japanese yen ($24.9 billion) versus 3.58 trillion yen expected\n\nOperating profit: 463.3 billion yen versus 428.4 billion yen expected\n\nSony said that it will partially spin off its financial services business via a public listing. The company plans to distribute slightly more than 80% of its shares of Sony Financial Group through dividends in kind as a result of the spinoff, in a listing due to take place in October 2025.\n\nSony‚Äôs financial services unit saw revenue in the December quarter rise more than 1,100% to 311.7 billion yen. The company said this was thanks to a rise in sales at its insurance business.\n\nSony also reported a 21% jump in sales in its image sensor business, which it sells to companies like Apple for smartphones.\n\nMeanwhile, Sony in January scrapped a planned merger with Indian firm Zee Entertainment. The deal, which was negotiated for more than two years, was seen as a way for Sony to get a foot into the lucrative Indian entertainment market.\n\nHiroki Totoki, Sony‚Äôs chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that India has ‚Äúgreat growth potential,‚Äù adding that the company will ‚Äúseek various opportunities‚Äù in the country and will look into plans to ‚Äúreplace‚Äù the failed merger with Zee.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/14/sony-posts-record-quarterly-revenue-on-playstation-sales-boost.html", "id": "1aqlc02", "created_utc": 1707912335.0, "score": 467, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "In the good old days, companies used to lower prices to increase sales.  üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è", "score": 287, "replies": [{"body": "I was in Canada and it was cheaper to buy a PS4 on release day than to wait a few years.¬†", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Same with the PS5 & XSX.

Iirc each atlas robot (Boston dynamics humanoid robot) costs like $10 million in hardware...? Optimus is intended to be $20k (I say intended to be because factories always start expensive until they get up to full production cadence).\n\nFailure after failure...? Bro, I watched this company go from a measly like 10k electric vehicles per year to 1.8 million per year (over 5.5 million cars out total). The best selling car in the world is an electric vehicle thanks to Tesla (the model Y). As an environmentalist, I'm absolutely thrilled. They even achieved the affordable electric vehicle they promised in 2016 (in 2016 dollars the base model 3 which costs $35k from inventory is actually $28k due to inflation, and also in 2016 the tax credit didn't exist so more like $22k now if you include that).\n\nThey've also finally released the cybertruck and it's awesome, Tesla energy has now replaced all coal energy in Hawaii (that one's a powerplant but I believe they also have half a million power walls installed now which is not insignificant), and the supercharger network is so large now that it is effectively ~90% as good as gas stations for EVs imo (which is why all the car manufacturers in the US switched to Tesla's NACS plug recently. *All* of them).\n\nI realize that some things Tesla has promised has taken longer than expected to pull off, but the affordable EV and insane profitability of Tesla are the main things I remember people saying were \"impossible\" back in the day. So today when I see people saying that FSD, the $25k EV, and Optimus are \"impossible\" that makes me even more excited for the future. As an investor I could not be happier with the job elon musk has been doing with the company. My investment actually got me through college debt free, and I bought a model 3 RWD last year for $29k (when you include the tax credit, $36.5k before tax cred). Best car I've ever owned. MSM likes to fearmonger and click bait negativity, but it's actually pretty difficult when there's so much good news surrounding Tesla.

The KES in has a capacity of 565 MWh, 185 MWh (about 33%) of which are the Tesla packs, and it is not replacing all coal, it is replacing the black out back up power plants which were coal. Currently 28% of the state's energy is renewable (good and growing), of which 1.1GWh was solar. So right now, Tesla can theoretically support about 5% of Hawaii's power demand.\n\nSupercharger accessibility varies depending on your location. Where you live maybe its great, doesn't mean it's the same everywhere.\n\nSwitching to NACS does not guarantee access to Superchargers.

High volume products have low profitability. Tesla cut profits to enable more volume at the current low prices. The low costs are supported by the incentives to enable consistent high volume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> So today when I see people saying that FSD, the $25k EV, and Optimus are \"impossible\" that makes me even more excited for the future.\n\nIt's not the these things inherently are impossible, it's the way Musk portrays it being, that is impossible. Cybertruck wasn't impossible, selling it for $40k was. FSD is not impossible, FSD at the end of 2023 was. $25k EV isn't impossible, what Musk wants it to do is.

AI is the internet plus the ability to reason and analyze anything you give it in fractions of a second. A new unequivocal boomstick to whomever wants to use it.\n\nThe true winners will be those startups in fields such as robotics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, space-aeronautics, aviation, protein synthesis, new materials and so, so much more who will use AI in new and exciting ways.\n\nBoston dynamics, set to boom. Self-driving robotaxis, set to boom. Flying taxis, set to boom. Job replacement/automation for legacy industry jobs white collar, set to boom. Personal AI agents for your individual workloads, booming. Healthcare change as we know it (doctors won't like this but too bad), set to boom.\n\nThe amount of industry that is set to shift and mutate and emerge from AI in the next 3 - 5 years will be astonishing.\n\nI can tell you, standing on principal, that OpenAI's next release will be so game changing that nobody will deny where AI is heading. There is not a rock you can hide under to be so oblivious as to not see where this is going.\n\nThe reason why I bring up the next iteration of ChatGPT, GPT5, is because they are initiators of this phenomenon. Other, such as Google (and others) are furiously trying to catch up but as of today the 'MOAT' may be upon us.\n\nThe reason to believe that one may catch up (or try like hell to) is from the amount of compute power from GPU's it takes to train an ungodly amount of data. Trillions of data points. Billions (soon to be Trillions) of parameters all simulating that of the synaptic neuron connections in which the human brain functions that in turn gives us the spark of life and consciousness. Make no mistake, these guys are living out a present day Manhattan project.\n\nThese people are trying to build consciousness agency with the all the world's information as a reference document at it's finger tips. Today.\n\nAnd guess what. The only way these guys can build that thing - That AGI/ASI/GAI reality - Is through Nvidia.\n\nThese guys believe and have tested that if you throw MORE compute at the problem it actually GAINS function. More compute equals more consciousness. That's what these people believe and they're attempting it.\n\nHere, let me show you what I mean. What the graph below shows is that over time the amount of data and parameters that are being used to train an AI model. I implore you to watch this video as it is a great easy to understand educational video into what the hell is going on with all of this AI stuff. It's a little technical but very informative and there are varying opinions. I pulled out the very best part in relation to Nvidia here. [AI: Grappling with a New Kind of Intelligence](https://youtu.be/EGDG3hgPNp8?si=L71CUbmqho3jhKEh&t=3768)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vk5twc041hic1.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3d2bdf42cf25e1c04e940b2f61d0219871f2334\n\nIt's SO RIDICULOUS that you wouldn't be able to continue to see the beginning so they have to use a log plot chart. And as you see we are heading into Trillions of parameters. For reference GPT-4 was trained on roughly 200 billion parameters.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6cq17n5i1hic1.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=830334aa7cdaddfa10d7f6512d10025f136076ed\n\nIt is estimated GPT-5 will be trained with 2-5 trillion parameters.\n\nSam Altman was dead ass serious when he is inquiring about obtaining $7 trillion for chip development. They believe that with enough compute they can create GOD.\n\nSo what's the response from Google, Meta and others. Well, they're forming \"AI \"\"Alliances\"\"\". Along with that they are going to and buying from the largest AI arms dealer on earth; Nvidia.\n\nNvidia is a common day AI Industrial Complex War machine.\n\n**Sovereign AI with AI Foundries**\n\nIt's not just companies that are looking to compete it's also entire Nation States. Remember, when Italy banned GPT. Well, it turns out, countries don't want the United States building and implementing their AI into other country's culture and way of life.\n\nSo as of today, you have a battle of not just corporate America but entire countries looking to buy the bullets, tanks and missiles needed for this AI fight. Nvidia sells the absolute best bullets, the best guns, the best ammo one needs to attempt to create their own AI epicenters.\n\nAnd it's so important that it is a national security risk to not just us the United States but to be a nation and not have the capability of AI.\n\nRemember the leak about Q\\* and a certain encryption being undone. You don't think heads of State where listening to that. Whether it was true or not it is now an imperative that you get with AI or get left behind. That goes just as much for a nation as it does for you as an individual.\n\nWhen asked about the risk of losing out sales to China on Nvidia's last earnings call Jensen Huang clearly stated he was not worried about it because literally nations are coming online to build AI foundries.\n\n**Nvidia's Numbers and The Power Of Compounding**\n\nThe power of compounding and why I think there share price is where it is today and has so much more room to grow. Let me ask you a question but first let me say that AWS's annual revenues are at \\~$80/Y Billion. How long do you think with Nvidia's revenues of \\~$18/Q Billion to reach or eclipse AWS at a 250% growth rate?\n\n15 years? 10 Years? 5 years? Answer: 1.19 years. Ok let's not be ridiculous perhaps it's 200% instead.\n\n5 years? Nope. 1.35 years.\n\nLet's say they have a bad quarter and Italy doesn't pay up. 150%\n\n5 years right? Nope. 1.62 years.\n\nCome on they can't keep this up. 100%.\n\nhas to be 5 years this time. Nope. 2.15 years.\n\n100% growth/2.15 years to 250% growth/1.19 years to reach 80 billion in annual revenues.\n\nThey're growth last year was 281%.\n\nSo wait, I wasn't being fair. I used $80 billion for AWS while their revenues last year where $88 Billion and Nvidia's last years 4 quarters where \\~$33 Billion.\n\nHere are those growth numbers it would take Nvidia to reach $88 billion.\n\nAt 279% =  0.73 years\n\nAt 250% = 0.78 years\n\nAt 200% = 0.89 years\n\nat 100% = 1.41 years\n\nFolks. That's JUST the data center. They are poised to surpass AWS, Azure and Google Cloud in about .73 to 1.5 years. Yes, you heard that right, your daddy's cloud company is about to be overtaken by your son's gaming GPU company.\n\nWhen people say Nvidia is undervalued. This is what they are talking about. This is a P/S story not a P/E story.\n\n[https:\\/\\/ycharts.com\\/indicators\\/nvidia\\_corp\\_nvda\\_data\\_center\\_revenue\\_quarterly](https://preview.redd.it/xa46amh0dhic1.png?width=1450&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9116e55235991b1113713b5b7cd7d30c58d515)\n\nThis isn't a stonk price. This is just Nvidia executing ferociously.\n\n|**Date**|**Value**|\n|:-|:-|\n|October 29, 2023|14.51B|\n|July 31, 2023|10.32B|\n|April 30, 2023|4.284B|\n|January 29, 2023|3.616B|\n\nThis isn't Y2k and the AI \"dot-com\" bubble. **This is a reckoning.** This is the largest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen.\n\nLook at the graph. Look at the growth. That's all before the next iteration of GPT-5 has even been announced.\n\nI will tell you personally. The things that will be built with GPT-5 will truly be mind blowing. That Jetson cartoon some of you may have watched as a kid will finally be a reality coming to you soon in 2024/2025/2026.\n\nThe foundation of work being laid now is only the beginning. There will be winners and there will be loser but as of today:\n\n**$NVDA** is fucking **KING**\n\nFor those of you who still just don't believe or are thinking this has to end sometimes. Or fucking Cramer who keeps saying be careful and take some money out and on and on. Think about this.\n\nIt costs you to just open an enterprise Nvidia data center account \\~$50k via a \"limited time offer\"\n\n>DATA CENTER NEWS. Subscribe.

The stock will split and rightly so (perhaps next year) but make not mistake this company is firing on ALL cylinders. The are executing S Tier. Fucking Max 9000 MX9+ Tier.

Ticker wasn‚Äôt born; he was algorithmically generated, a digital wunderkind with an uncanny knack for riding the volatile waves of AI stocks, surfing them like a cybernetic Da Vinci on a board made of pure speculation.\n\nTicker lived in a bubble, but not just any bubble. This was a speculative bubble, inflated by the hot air of hype and the exhalations of a thousand analysts predicting the next big AI breakthrough. In Ticker‚Äôs world, the S&P 500 was a low-score in a retro arcade game, and the real action was in the wild, uncharted territories of AI stocks, where fortunes were made and lost in the blink of an eye.\n\nOur protagonist, with a keyboard as his sword and a dual-monitor setup as his shield, embarked daily on quests not for the faint of heart. His adversaries were many: bear raids, short ladders, and the most dreaded of them all, the margin call monsters. Yet, Ticker fought them with the ferocity of a WallStreetBets warrior, his fingers dancing across the keyboard with a balletic grace, executing trades with the precision of a sniper.\n\nTicker‚Äôs legend grew with each trading session. They said he could forecast market movements with the accuracy of a crystal ball. Whispers in the dark web chatrooms spoke of his ability to commune with the AI entities that powered the algorithms of the market, persuading them to divulge their secrets. He was the chosen one, the bubble boy who could do no wrong, navigating through market corrections like a surfer dodging sharks in the great blue sea.\n\nOne day, Ticker stumbled upon the Holy Grail of AI stocks, a startup so revolutionary, it promised to turn the very concept of intelligence on its head. The ticker symbol? BRAIN. He went all in, pushing his chips to the center of the table with the reckless abandon of a poker player on a Vegas spree. The stock soared, doubling, tripling, quadrupling in value. Ticker‚Äôs bubble inflated to the size of a small country‚Äôs GDP.\n\nBut then, as all tales of excess warn, the bubble began to show signs of strain. Whispers of overvaluation, of regulatory scrutiny, began to circulate. Ticker, ever defiant, doubled down, chanting the mantra of the WallStreetBets: ‚ÄúDiamond hands!‚Äù He refused to sell, convinced BRAIN would bounce back, that this was merely a test of his resolve.\n\nThe bubble burst with the ferocity of a supernova, leaving a black hole in its wake. Ticker watched in horror as his digital fortune evaporated into the ether. Yet, as the dust settled and the trading floor lay silent, a smile crept across his face. For Ticker had learned the ultimate lesson of the market: What goes up must come down, but there‚Äôs always another trade, another bubble, just around the corner.\n\nTicker rose from the ashes of his portfolio, his spirit unbroken, ready to ride the next wave. For in the heart of a true WallStreetBets champion, defeat is merely the setup for the next big win. And so, our bubble boy set out once more into the fray, armed with nothing but his wits and an unshakable belief in the power of AI stocks.

AI is the only way to bridge the objective with the subjective, to truly automate systems such as \"is this comment angry?\", was this sequence of sound the word \"apple\"?¬†\n\n\nYou can try to program that stuff manually but it's so fuzzy, everyone says things differently, slurring, etc, that its a figurative wild goose chase. You'll never get it anywhere near perfect.\n\n\nLook at xkcd's classic comic of \"people don't understand the difference between what is simple and what is mind bogglingly hard in programming\" where they joke that task X is 5 mins, but identifying if a picture contains a bird is 10 years and a research team. Yeah that comic is out of date, thats a readily solvable problem now.\n\n\nSo where's the money? Everywhere, in small ways and large ways. We just used AI to discover the first new class of antibiotics since the 1980s. It can fight antibiotic resistant bacteria/MRSA.\n\n\nThe ability to spy on you just became INSANELY easier, which is technology every nation will fork over their cash hand over fist for. Live transcriptions of voice audio, interpretation of intent, etc. Scientists using wifi to map the inside of your house and watch you with AI, a thing our govt could already maybe do, but now its feasible for research team levels of funding to develop this kind of tech.\n\n\nNetwork security heuristics have an entirely new tool in their bag to identify malicious traffic and its way better than the dumb shit we used to do to identify malicious network activity. \"If a single address sends a message containing X and Y, flag it\" oh shit they split up the message, now we have to manually code logic to recompile messages and figure out their intent. Not anymore. Network security is a massive industry.\n\n\nAI was used to automate the discovery of new materials, recent article on it leaping material science \"600 years into the future\".

They've been using software to \"auto adjudicate\" claims for years, but anything that isn't dead straight forward goes to a claim processor. Being able to parse pdfs will gradually level up into huge swaths of simple claims being automatically processed. You could see operating costs(excluding payouts) shrink by more than half, and if you've ever reviewed business finance profit is a slim slice of revenue, so this can result in profit increases in multiples of 5-10x.\n\n\nApple successfully used AI to cold call and make sales with their vision pro headset, converting people who started to purchase and changed their mind into sales.\n\n\nThe ability for AI to process immense quantities of data is applicable in almost every information based field, and can even be used in simple ways like better targeted ads for lower cost to conversion ratios.\n\n\nThese are the things happening right now with AI being this expensive and slow to train while in its infancy, do you think that's everything we'll find a use for for a universally capable fully generic pattern recognization and generation system?

The big issue here is going to be how to generate districts in a legal(ie not overlapping/physically impossible) AND increasingly optimized way\n\n\nTypically how training AI works is you feed it a whole bunch of data with known answers, and then after it \"learns\" the data and identifies patterns you may not know exist, you can then feed it data with unknown answers and it will make a guess.\n\n\nWe then found out if you reverse the direction of input to output to be output to input you can make AI generate pictures which was a cool trick. If you input a picture and it says bird, you can then push \"bird\" in from the bottom up to get a picture of a bird because the internal process is fully reversible.\n\n\nThere's various forms of networks but they all revolve around those principles, and an AI is easiest to train when you can tell it \"no your guess is wrong, your output shouldve been X\"\n\n\nThe thing that makes AI a little rough for something like district generation is that AI is inherently \"fuzzy\". Its \"mostly correct\". Its basically impossible to train an AI to be 100% accurate and you'll notice this even in massive projects such as chat gpt, and we call them \"hallucinations\", where it just makes incorrect shit up out of midair.\n\n\nThis makes AI a little bit worse than conventional programming for anything that HAS to be right unless it can be verified after the fact by conventional programming and told to do it again but better, and in this scenario you likely could verify it using simple statistics in regular programming, so you should be okay\n\n\nSo one of the better techniques is probably to use conventional programming to assess whether a specific district drawing is legal, run a few simulated elections and assess the overall neutrality of the election and turn it into a percentage or bias score. Eg. Normally dems would win every time but national sentiment is -50% so if repubs win.\n\n\nSo with multiple elections what you'd probably wanna do is calculate a national bias score for each election to explain the deviating results within each person/region even when districts didn't change, this would be your key variation in the dataset\n\n\nYou would train a network to take in district mapping, a legality score, national bias, and then output predicted election skew as an offset for bias, eg 10% red bias, but 30% red skew = 20% offset\n\n\nMake up a whole bunch of districts manually, input historical biases, and when it predicts the wrong skew you feed the right skew as correctional data\n\n\nOnce that's done you flip the structure, pass in desired skew(0%) and then assess the networks outputted map legality and specified bias along with district map, validate it using conventional coding, and then feedback train the network by feeding it back its map with the correct legality and bias required to produce the results\n\n\nYou just keep repeating this until you get a pretty decent result verified by your conventional code\n\n\nShouldn't be too too hard but getting enough data about what valid possible district mappings look like could be expensive to have people create them", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": ">AI has some uses in optimising already existing processes, it doesn't add anything new.

It doesn‚Äôt become smarter the more we teach it or dumber the more we tell it incorrect data.\n\nIts dataset is iteratively fine turned by trainers that essentially teach it parameters and through further training have it adjust the weights and biases of each parameter.  Basically, data and the change each parameter may or may not be correct.\n\nWhen training is incomplete, when a vague or ambiguous question is asked and no parameter is biased as the obvious answer, it does its best  to draw on what data it does have.\n\nSo in the case of what a song title of a song with an obscure reference by a particular artist, it will draw on whatever possible song it may have been exposed to in training that vaguely matches the lyric asked about even if it‚Äôs by someone else, and if the matrix has insufficient weighting, it may assume the song is actually by the artist asked about, not the real one. \n\nwe see this in debugging or optimization where it can understand code but insufficient weight and biases of the coding language mean it sees the original code and possible debugged or optimized code as equally ambiguous.\n\nnone of this changes based on what version ChatGPT is as it‚Äôs an inherent trait of LLMs. it cannot learn. it has no concept of what‚Äôs correct. it‚Äôs trained. \n\ngoing forward, future versions or other LLMs will actually learn from our sessions.\n\nmoreover, they‚Äôll be able to seek data themselves.\n\nbut it will still face the 2 same core problems: either that data is restricted to make sure it learns correctly but this results in knowledge gaps, or data is not restricted so it can learn from everything but that includes incorrect information.\n\nultimately, it NEEDS input affirmation of what data is correct or it will always ALWAYS end up constructing matrices of incorrectly weighted/biased parameters. \n\nwith ChatGPT even up to now it still relies on manual training, and that means knowledge gaps or possible incorrect information, and thus it can make errors no different than us. \n\nwhat it truly needs is a single source of global reaffirming training in the way that, say, wikipedia is self-correcting, where if enough AI users teach it what‚Äôs correct and outweigh those who don‚Äôt, linearly it will eventually fill all knowledge gaps. or the AI itself can seek out affirmation but it ultimately has to be from a user experience that biases to correct data.\n\ni.e. learning from, say, your Office suite tools, your ChatGPT sessions, even your Teams. it becomes dystopian rather fast but manually training AI to protect user privacy will bottleneck AI far behind where chip hardware is in a year or two. \n\nand that‚Äôs actually where the hardware advances come into play‚Äînot in making it smarter per se (its input/output model) but making it powered by more data. millions more users across millions more devices all constantly ‚Äòtraining‚Äô its matrices perimeters and continuously reaffirm or correct all weights and biases to not just learn but retain data.\n\ni think there‚Äôs this misconception that AI advancement is purely a matter of computation. it‚Äôs not. it also one of purely of training and creating a big and reaffirming enough of an AI platform that daily general use leads to exponential training growth rather than relying on direct training.\n\nwhich is why the first future AI leader will not necessarily be ChatGPT but whatever platform first harnesses mass adoption and thus allows the app to train itself based on app use. \n\nsoon after, other AI will likely also just train based on that app and LLMs will likely reach a point of universal AGI where they all just teach each other based user data reaffirming what‚Äôs correct.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "That's the way our brains work too.", "score": -6, "replies": []}, {"body": "AI *currently* isn‚Äôt intelligence the way we understand it.

Then there might be more rules like ‚Äúsometimes I want you to treat an Apple as an orange, but it‚Äôs very important that all other apples go into the apple bin. It would be a really serious problem if any apples went into the wrong bin‚Äù\n\nThe downstream effect of this is you can never assume that the bin containing oranges only contains oranges and trying to develop rules for how apples detected in the oranges bin should be handled.\n\nAI can‚Äôt do shit about this. It‚Äôs a human problem. Humans never want to be told ‚Äúno‚Äù by a subordinate- whether a child, a pet, or a computer program they paid to have made. They also don‚Äôt typically enjoy coming up with a hard set of rules that are inviolable. \n\nA general intelligence could work with people and constantly re-develop, re-test, deploy etc but an LLM isn‚Äôt going to mind read any better than a human. It‚Äôs still a machine so you‚Äôll need to tell it the weighting of ‚Äúfight back on this change because it‚Äôll mess with clients or blow out budgets‚Äù vs ‚Äúdo as you‚Äôre told‚Äù. And who is the only one who can tell it that weighting? The bosses. The ones would never write up a list of specific job scope for an employee nor tell them exactly what their priorities are.\n\nAlso LLMs will be a commercial service. Non idiot business people know that the price is set at what the market will bear. Building an llm yourself means a cost center like pre-cloud businesses had to run big IT departments. Buying llm services means building a third party directly into the core of your business- a risk companies are beginning to realize with cloud. Companies can and will change subscription prices, api fees etc, and they will often make it difficult to easily swap to a competitor. A coding llm might be made to build in api calls from the llm company, so that they get more money.\n\nEg a Microsoft co-pilot type thing could have a bias towards using Microsoft entra. Right now if they went hard on that the still-present humans would call it out. But if you replace humans with machines- you won‚Äôt know any better. \n\nAmazon is famous for letting people sell on their platform, then using the knowledge of what sells to create their own competing product and use their platform to promote the ripoff. Let me ask you- do you really think Amazon would never bias an AI towards using AWS and would never use the business intelligence it learned from this embedding to gut their own clients? And it doesn‚Äôt matter if you think the ai companies can remain seperate. Amazon and Microsoft can just buy them out.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the thoughtful reply.

We call this human-in-the-loop. It's exactly as you're describing. Today, we know that the systems aren't super reliable even with herculean efforts to get them to where they have really good reliability let's say almost 100%+-3-7. \n\nThis is ok because how we can design the system is such that the operator is the observer / analyst to the system/task that is being automated. As of now, if the technology progressed no further this would be a massive productivity gain for that operator. In fact, the operator could handle more workload because while something was a task before now it is an observation check-in. \n\nThese enterprise processes are throughout each and every organization. The problem and slowness right now is that not many people are great at implementing such solutions, hesitation, grandstanding, etc, etc. So nothing is coming ultra fast, per se. \n\nYou then mention who does the AI do in certain situations. Well, the task/work process would need to be a thing where it can handle all needed situations and if it can't can call on a human operator. \n\nIn this, this is where I see jobs and work going. \n\nImagine being superman. You have all these tools and capabilities so your responsibilities are more but your toolset is much broader. \n\nInstead of handling 100 clients perhaps you can handle 10k with AI. This is a massive and distinct productivity boost. you would still need to be a SME and expert in your field but your workload would be handled by a personal AI assistant that is very good at its job. \n\nI think about this with Self-driving trucks. I don't want no truckdriver in the truck. I still want  that guy there. He does a hell of a lot on the way, loading and unloading etc. That driver can be in the self-driving truck. I don't see a reason why we should think he shouldn't be. \n\nHowever, now, The driver can do more work because he can sleep, handle invoicing, setup the next destination and shipment, etc. etc. \n\nThat's how I think about this.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don‚Äôt think anyone is saying AI won‚Äôt be a useful tool, just that the cost/benefit at the moment looks very much like a great new tool and not a paradigm shift. I expect a lot of benefit for small lean companies- I‚Äôve worked for a few and I know this will increase their capability quite a lot.\n\nBut the big multinationals? It‚Äôs really tough. Realistically a lot of people are employed that don‚Äôt need to be. Typically called ‚Äúbullshit jobs‚Äù but I personally don‚Äôt agree with some of the examples the original author gave. \n\nSo it‚Äôs kind of like a zero sum thing to me. Leaner companies will start drinking some of the bigger companies milkshake, and the bigger companies might do a few things better. But all the expensive stuff basically remains expensive. \n\nHealthcare isn‚Äôt expensive just because doctors are. Introduce an AI that can examine humans and I‚Äôve got no doubt it can diagnose accurately, quickly and for less cost than a doctor. Then it‚Äôll prescribe you a medicine that retails 5,000% more than it costs to make because a law was arbitrarily put into place to ensure that no generics could be made and sold. \n\nLlms can generate ads faster, but an ai can be developed to recognize and block ads faster.\n\nCode can be examined for bugs and security holes faster, but security holes and exploits can be developed faster.\n\nEven if self driving is achieved, liability laws might kill it dead for almost all use cases. Especially when there are competing interests. Eg say a car manufacturer wants to make liability the issue of the car owner. That would require that the owner owns the car entirely, that they personally are responsible for the underlying code. But are car manufacturers going to release their code, not do subscription models, not use license lease loopholes to protect their underlying systems? (The way MS does to prevent Xbox modding etc)\n\n\nTechnology is never the whole picture. Betting on AI as a concept is a safe bet. Betting on a particular AI company? Less so. Betting on a hardware company? Even less so.\n\nBut hey, you‚Äôre in it. Maybe that goes great for you.

Years and years and years of human intelligence has then been funnelled into this ‚ÄúAI‚Äù so that it looks ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù.

While advancements in AI are ongoing, predicting specific timelines for achieving AGI is challenging, and many experts in the field have varying opinions on when it might happen.\n\n2. **Nvidia's Role in AI:** The post emphasizes Nvidia's crucial role in AI development, particularly in providing the necessary compute power for training large models. While Nvidia is indeed a major player in the field of GPU technology, attributing the entire development of AGI to a single company is oversimplified. Multiple companies, including Google, Microsoft, and others, are actively involved in AI research.\n\n3. **Market and Investment Advice:** The post provides investment advice, suggesting to buy Nvidia, SMCI, and ARM. It's important to note that investment decisions should be based on thorough research and consideration of individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Predicting stock market movements and company success with certainty is challenging.\n\n4. **Data Center Revenues:** The growth numbers provided for Nvidia's data center revenues are factual, and the post suggests that Nvidia is well-positioned to surpass other cloud computing giants. However, stock prices and market valuations are influenced by a variety of factors, and future performance is uncertain.\n\n5. **AI Alliances and National Security:** The post discusses the formation of AI alliances and the national security implications of AI development. While countries are indeed investing in AI research, the geopolitical landscape and national security considerations are complex and may involve multiple factors beyond just AI development.\n\nIn summary, while the post provides some factual information, it's important to approach speculative claims with caution. Investment decisions should be made based on thorough research and consideration of various factors.

Or that the one other big short I did was COIN from 180 => 150 and this feels the same sentiment-wise. idk either way works\n\n**Positions**\n\n* (-20) NVDA @ 705 - 134% of that account, started on 02-06\n* 200 NVD @ 8.95 fifteen minutes ago\n* Other more reasonable choices\n\n**Afterword**\n\nWell in the time I wrote this it fell from 740 to 727 so never mind I guess, it's slightly less profitable of a trade but the point still stands (which is left as an exercise for the reader)\n\n**Edit**\n\n[This account](https://preview.redd.it/5spcopmb3lic1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6420b7f09a517d74c6dde2846422073376fd5ca)\n\n**Edit 2**\n\n* Closed NVD @ 9.27\n\n**Edit 3**\n\n* Y'all - It is just money guys and here's the thing: I don't lose when it is worth more than my account (cause it already is). I lose when the *losses* are worth more than my account. Just going to hold through earnings, any losses are offset by the money market interest anyways\n\n**Edit 4**\n\n* NVD is 1.5x inverse NVDA. I did not close the NVDA lol  \n\n\n**Edit 5**\n\n* My oh my the bullish comments have slowed down! What happened?!? \n* Anyways those were kind of proving my point. The price reflected something like 99% chance of maintaining zero competition and continuing the insane growth for like a decade. That's true that's what it looks like now, and I feel like the underlying facts are going to change soon for its valuation. The price reflected something like a 99% chance of absolutely demolishing earnings and didn't leave a lot of upside for if they even do. \n* Also, I felt like that was the reverse sort of effect happening - only people buying at that level were shorts capitalizing and it's kind of like how we hit a super-bottom in 2022 from margin calls. Shorts have already \\*been\\* getting wrecked which is why it was a better entry at 740 than say 500.\n* I can't even drink yet so stop trying to flex your buys from when I was in middle school lol", "id": "1aqqfv2", "created_utc": 1707926738.0, "score": 2299, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 1066, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|12|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|11 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I got tired of buying puts and losing money.
