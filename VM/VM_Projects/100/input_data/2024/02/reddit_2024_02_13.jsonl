So I am definitely interested in hearing everyone's thoughts!\n\nI have been looking at going into \n\nIndian ETF's: they are stealing so much business from China. I could go into why I think China will start to lose a lot of the world's business, but i won't. India is really the only country that is positioned to take over China's role as the world's manufacturing hub.\n\nAdditive Manufacturing Companies and ETF's:. Right now these companies aren't making much money, but they are slowly buying each other up to combine technology advancements. Now that the US is heavily focusing on shoring up our supply chain for national security reasons (and the government would drop every last penny we have just for national security reasons if they had to.).  We don't have the low pay labor to compete with traditional manufacturing, but if one person can do the job of 20 with these manufacturing techniques. Then that will be massive for bringing job and money back into our economy. There are tons of potential benefits from incorporating additive manufacturing into our traditional manufacturing processes!\n\nWaste management stocks/ETF's: recycling will finally become a profitable business model once we start running out of easily acceptable materials to mine the earth for. Eventually it'll be cheaper to recycle than mine. And these companies have literal dump trucks of free materials that we pay them to take. They have always been very profitable business and they are very recession and economic downturn proof.\n\nWaffer and chip manufacturing companies based in the US: kind of the same reason as additive manufacturing. We are dropping and will keep dropping massive amounts of capital to not only secure our supply chain, but also our countries national defense capabilities. Once we get these chip fabs up and running, we will be making massive strides in the technology, as well as manufacturing capabilities with innovations. This will be a governmentally backed sector, which means that the stability of the sector will essentially be a sure thing. So it isnt as risky of an investment.\n\nBio-tech: with the advancement being made in gene-editing as well and our greater understanding of the different systems in the human body. We will start seeing miracle treatments coming out. With the exponentially increasing tech advancements made in AI as well and computing capacities i.e. quantum computing. We are able to map and understand the functionality of specific biological systems. Which means we will have a much easier time identifying issues and finding potential solutions.\n\nAI: idk about this one too much, but some of these companies with solid algorithms that have potential uses by companies like Amazon and other e-commerce businesses. This will become a staple of any extremely successful company, without the algorithms, the competition without the tech will fall behind the ones with them. \n\nPlutonium and other limited materials used to produce clean energy: the radioactive materials needed for nuclear facilities is extremely finite due to the requirements to properly mine and store. With countries rushing to build more clean energy, whoever owns the majority of the materials will come out on top. The materials and tech for clean energy will be a massive catalyst for the next technological revolution. \n\nBattery and energy storage companies: Once a company is able to figure out he issues we are having with batteries, clean energy will become much easier to implement. Whoever gets this tech figured out and is able to produce the products at a fairly cheap price will be king. Plus our government will be shoring up energy storage production capabilities due to national security.\n\nClean water systems companies: we all need water and we will start to run out of clean water.\n\nWeed ETF's/stocks: it's a meme right now, but eventually it will be legalized, and there are some pretty big players ready to hop on the chance to smoke (pun intended;))the competition. It's not an if, but a when weed is federally legalized. Which could possibly open up the sector to growing hemp/utilize the waste produced THC plants for the production of daily products.\n\nThere are other stocks/ETF'S I will be getting so I can diversify my portfolio, but over all I have a strong belief that in my potential 50+ years left on this earth, if we do not make huge advancements in the above sectors, that it wont matter if I lost money in the market. We will pretty much exterminate ourself as a species of we can't get a hold on these things. And if we get a hold on becoming highly proficient in producing these products, then they will become staples of day to day life for almost every human on earth!\n\nI am also looking at possibly trying to get some exposure to fusion energy.

I see massive potential if they are successful\n\nOne industry I didn’t see on your list is real estate. I know it can be volatile as well but I think real estate will continue to get more and more expensive as parts of the world become more undesirable due to climate change. BUT commercial real estate is very confusing at the moment - I think we’re quietly coming to a point where these investment banking and large real estate firms will start to default on loans as commercial leasing has down spiraled so much over the past few years.

So I think I'll have enough exposure to property valuation. I'm also not 100% sure how bad it's going to get when these commercial buildings go under. I'm assuming housing will eventually be built there, or they will be retrofitted to accommodate housing. And I'm assuming that, that could lower housing prices. Then we have the fact that we may not see low interest rates again for a long while (I could be wrong, and I think it has a lot to do with how these foreign conflicts go.) If the world keeps fighting, our economy will be hella stimulated and may force the Fed to not lower rates. \n\nI think between Indian and US diversification in the portfolio will benefit if we all go to war, or if we go into a time of peace, as well as staying in a cold war era tension levels. \n\nI 100% agree with a lot of the other sectors.

The only exposure I'll have to it is an S&P 500 ETF as well as a mid cap ETF. I think people will start realizing within the next 5 years, that these massive companies won't be as prevalent as they are now for growth stocks/portfolios. Everyone thinks the stocks can keep going up and up, but there is a limit. I could go into the financial fundamentals as to why it can't go up infinitely, but the main point behind the fundamentals is that these emerging sectors will suck money out of the existing sectors due to societal changes as well as economic restructuring. \n\nHaha I love talking about this stuff! I wish I had a finance friend that I could have a few beers with and just go on about the intricately interconnectivity of finances and global dynamics. It's funny to think that the waste management sector could affect mineral collection companies which would affect EVs, phones, semi-conductors, and even space exploration economically as well as physically!

Sorry for the screed of text, I got a little carried away.\n\n\nSo for the entire history of mankind we've used abstracted tokens to record value. Money is one of our oldest technologies. We've used shiny rocks, beads, precious metals, statues and more. Not all of these tokens had value beyond the fact that they had qualities that made them good money, so they're fungible, easy to carry & transport, divisible, rare or hard to produce etc. Bitcoin is an attempt to use mathematics and cryptography to produce the perfect abstracted value token.\n\n\nTo a degree, you're right that it's value partly comes only from a shared belief that the network has value or will have greater value in the future. Given enough time and money entering the system the price has simply risen based on market forces, (or at least partly through price manipulation if you believe some of the rumours). Either way, the market decides.\n\n\nPart of the problem is that 50k USD sounds like a lot for 1 digital 'thing' but the concept of 1 bitcoin is entirely arbitrary. 1 BTC is just a unit of account that holds 100 million satoshis, the smallest unit of account. Framed this way 0.0002616 USD per satoshi perhaps doesn't sound expensive anymore?\n\n\nFor anyone who might be interested but doesn't really know anything about Bitcoin id say this:\n\n\nIf I described a monetary network the rules of which could not be co-opted or changed without consensus of the users of the network would that have value? What if the issuance rate and total number of units of account that could ever exist was set and could also not be changed? What about if we add the effect that the bigger the network got the harder it was to co-opt in any way? What if I said it was open source and that anyone could contribute and yet it has stood under constant attack for over a decade and never broken? What if I said you could send these value tokens anywhere and to anyone and that no one could steal, divert or hold those funds up? Would it have value to you then, even as an interesting experiment?\n\n\n\nYou might say when asked what value you put on that entire network, \"well.. it sounds interesting? Maybe a dollar a token if there are only ever going to be 21 million of them\", well, that's where bitcoin was a decade ago. It's still up, it's still growing and becoming stronger and less volatile.\n\n\nAt some point people tend to either accept that since this thing keeps getting more valuable that maybe, just maybe they've missed something or not understood and then actually make an effort to learn what it is. Or they double down and dig in their heels and get more and more annoyed when it continues to rise in value, cheering when it dips because it validates their belief that it wasn't that they didn't understand it, it's that those taking part are idiots.\n\n\nUltimately the naysayers may be proven right. Quantum computers could break SHA256 before the network has time to agree a fix through consensus, governments could move on mass to ban proof of work, It could be proven that certain stable coin issuers and unscrupulous centralised exchanges manipulated the price to make themselves more money causing a run and crash, or it could be that at this point the network has gotten so huge and the asset so legitimised that nothing can bring it down and it will continue to suck up value into the network in which case it could eventually become a world reserve of stored value and be valued at wildly higher prices than today (with several massive crashes along the way as is tradition in BTC).\n\n\nWho knows, all I'll say is stay open minded and do your own research into these things people.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "The thing is, traditional currency (fiat) derives value from the backing of the state and the value of goods and services denominated in it.

In the year to December 2023, prices paid for it, as measured by the consumer-price index, rose by 20%, even as inflation overall moderated. Prices are often controlled at state level, but regulators are approving the increases because the industry is losing money hand over fist.

Only 2 of the top 20 insurance companies actually made money.\n\nRepair costs have skyrocketed a out 20% a year.  This is largely due to tech in vehicles.  Say you have a Subaru and have your windshield replaced.  It used to be maybe $500, now they have their eyesight camera there which requires special glass and calibration after replacement so the cost is around $2k.  \n\nThe other side is large jury verdicts.  The average injury award has been rising at an unsustainable rate.  People think every auto accident is a payday which means rates go up for everyone.

The difference is that they actually make money and typically don't get reamed out the yin-yang by the market or their pissant brokers. They invest the unearned premiums (before claims roll their nasty asses in) and their reserves — I think the typical historical return has been ~5% except during the \"extra slutty\" years post-2008 when the Fed went 100% free use. The reason why it's not 50% or 100% or 150% is that insurance companies need to manage drawdown to pay claims (weirdly a concept that you idiots don't seem to understand).   \n\nSIDE POINT 2: A super-weird, fuck-all-dumb-shit artifact of the US insurance industry is that it's regulated state-by-state. The practical impact is that this structure has led to superconcentrated levels of risk for certain kinds of catastrophes.  For example, fire and earthquake in California; flood/windstorm all along the gulf and Atlantic Coasts most notably in FL — although FL's current crisis is one part fraud, many parts political ineptitude in Tallahassee—thanks Republicans, way to govern! \n\nThe reason why this is relevant is that insurance works on a concept called the law of large numbers, which means the bigger you make the samples, the sample means begin to converge with the population means. \n\nOr, if you imagine the insurance cos cooking up a big ass stew, when you throw one chicken bone (e.g., policy holder) into the pot the flavor is uneven—unlike what Carl Weathers claims (RIP dude).  When you dump a shit ton of chicken bones into the pot, all the flavors smooth out and you got a big, big, pot of profits (and fuckery!). \n\nWhat this means is that one solution for super high fire, and super high flood is to pool the risks between regions into a catastrophic pool.

We don’t have to have the same opinion. \n\nThe reason I personally don’t think it should be an investment vehicle is because it fucks the housing market up. We have multi-billion dollar corporations buying up single family homes and using them as an investment vehicle (Zillow, just to name one). Either renting them out or just sitting on them to sell at a later date, hopefully (for them) at a higher price. Having businesses view a basic need, housing, like it’s just an asset and not a place for someone to live, is kinda fucked up. Zillow, or any other company buying single family homes for that matter, doesn’t give a fuck if an average person cannot buy their home right now. They can sit on it FAR longer than you or any other “investor” in housing can, and they can also go without someone renting the fucker FAR longer than a normal person could. It’s a drop in their bucket of cash. They can also out bid any other person and/or just fuckin’ pay cash. \n\nI completely understand, someone has to front the money to build the fuckers, and they likely have to say “yeah, I own this house I built.” But that’s as far as I think corporations should get to go when it comes to owning a single family home in the housing market. Banks are fine, they “own” the home because they fronted the money until you pay it back. YOU keep the profits, and YOU make the sale, it’s one person to another, and banks don’t wanna fuck around keeping that shit on their books.\n\nIt would be like having a shortage of vehicles because we can’t make ‘em fast enough and letting carvana come in and go “I’ll take 15% of the stock you are making, and I’ll also go out and buy up as many used cars as I can.” Leaving an average every day person scratching their head like “Why the FUCK DOES A HONDA CIVIC COST 100K?” It fucks the market up.\n\nIf you, as a person wanna buy a house and later sell it for a higher price, fuck yeah man. Thats great, and I’m super stoked for you. You wanna buy two houses and rent one of ‘em out? Cool! That’s real slick and will make you some extra money. \n\nYou wanna swing your big multi-billion dollar corporation dick around and buy up a bunch of houses to sit on, hopefully drive the price up or to rent out as a way for the corporation to make extra money, and fuck over the middle/lower class?

Last year, investor purchases accounted for 22% of American homes sold. This is significantly down from the 80% number in 2020-2021, why is this? Mostly, debt has gotten more expensive over the last year, and many people are concerned about a looking major recession.”\n\n🤔🤔🤔 80% of homes sold in 2020 - 2021 purchased by investment firms. Only 22% in 2022, boy, what a difference.\n\nThats no big deal though, only 80%, I’m certain that a person just wanting to buy a SFH was fully capable of going out and grabbing at least one of the other 20% remaining. I’m also sure that the supply demand curve for housing stayed the same during that time and didn’t drive prices up. Oh wait, look at the chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eamg8szvsjic1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68057f1619db9fd637920a498760d8ac8a80347f\n\n“The U.S. median home price increased 6.2 percent in 2019, hitting an all-time high of $258,000.”\n\nNow it’s currently sitting at 417,000 for Q4, 2023. Only a \\~\\~ 60% increase.\n\n“Last year (2021)\\*, five states saw the highest percentage of investor purchases: Georgia (33%), Arizona (31%), Nevada (30%), California, and Texas (both 29%). These investment firms continue diminishing available inventory of houses that may otherwise be obtainable for younger, middle class households. This can lead to a kind of negative feedback loop where people cannot afford to buy because they are getting priced out, but because rent is incredibly high (and expected to keep going up), people cannot save enough money to get into the market even if rates do fall again.”\n\n🤔🤔🤔\n\nAnd when did the housing market go absolutely ape shit insane? 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe allowed this to happen because we let big business into the housing market like a person in the housing market. It would be like saying “no, it’s totally cool that Jeff Bezos bought 80% of the housing market in 2020-2021. That’s no big deal. He’s just trying to make a little extra money.
