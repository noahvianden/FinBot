INTC is like a high school team competing against the pros. So, don't bet the farm on them knocking out the 800-pound gorillas... \n\n**TSM and ASML have an unbreakable chokehold on the semiconductor industry**\r  \nTSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) and ASML (a Dutch company) indeed play critical roles in the semiconductor industry.\r  \nASML is the world’s largest manufacturer of lithography systems, which are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It’s also the only manufacturer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are required to produce the world’s smallest chips. TSMC, on the other hand, is the world’s largest and most advanced contract chipmaker. TSMC uses ASML’s EUV and older deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems to manufacture chips for fab-less chipmakers, like Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and AMD.\r  \n**Even with government funding, INTC won’t be able to compete against TSM and ASML anytime soon** \r  \nIntel is currently dependent on ASML and, to some extent, TSMC. However, Intel is indeed making efforts to compete with TSMC and ASML. Intel has placed its first order with ASML to purchase the semiconductor industry’s first TWINSCAN EXE: 5200 system, as the US chip giant aims to compete with TSMC in advancing to 2-nanometer process technology. This system is an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) high-volume production system that can produce 220 wafers per hour. Intel plans to start production with this new technology in 2025.\r  \nMoreover, Intel faces a grueling uphill battle against TSMC and ASML. Intel’s downside potential could be limited at these levels, but ASML has a lot more upside potential – especially as the global chip shortage drags on and highlights the importance of its EUV systems.\r  \nWhile Intel is making strides to compete with TSMC and ASML, it’s a complex and challenging endeavor. Success will depend on various factors, including technological advancements, market dynamics, and geopolitical considerations. Additionally, if Intel faces significant setbacks and delays, it’s possible that the company might not be competitive with TSMC and ASML until 2030. Here are some factors that could contribute to such a delay:\r  \n•\tTechnological Challenges: Intel’s efforts to advance its technology could face unexpected difficulties or failures. For instance, the company’s transition to 2-nanometer process technology could encounter technical hurdles that delay its implementation.\r  \n•\tMarket Dynamics: The semiconductor market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Intel could lose further market share to competitors like TSMC and ASML, which would weaken its position.\r  \n•\tGeopolitical Factors: Ongoing geopolitical tensions could disrupt the supply chain and affect Intel’s business. For example, trade restrictions could limit Intel’s access to necessary resources or markets.\r  \n•\tExecution Risk: If Intel’s strategic plans do not yield the desired results, the company could face setbacks due to poor execution. \r  \nUnder any unexpected adverse scenario, Intel could be forced to reassess its strategy and potentially start over in certain areas. This could push back the timeline for Intel to become competitive with TSMC and ASML to around 2030. However, it’s important to note that this is a worst-case scenario and not a prediction. The actual outcome will depend on a variety of factors, including Intel’s execution of its strategy, market dynamics, and geopolitical considerations.\r  \n**Intel faces stiff competition** \r  \nASML: Intel is dependent on ASML for its future. ASML is the key to Intel’s resurrection just like ASML helped TSMC beat Intel. Intel has placed its first order with ASML to purchase the semiconductor industry’s first TWINSCAN EXE: 5200 system, marking the next step on the path to EUV 0.55 NA (High-NA) introduction. This system is an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) high-volume production system that can produce 220 wafers per hour. Intel plans to start production with this new technology in 2025.\r  \nTSMC: While Intel is not directly dependent on TSMC, it’s worth noting that TSMC’s early adoption of EUV technology helped it pull ahead of both Intel and Samsung over the past few years. TSMC currently has 50% of all EUV machines manufactured at ASML for its leading-edge processes. Intel is a little behind, especially as none of Intel’s products in the market yet use any EUV. Therefore, Intel’s ability to compete with TSMC is indirectly influenced by TSMC’s current dominance leading-edge microchip technology.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Intel is a customer of ASML, not a competitor.

How can one be 100% dependent on another company, and also be independent?\n\n**US government is giving billions in subsidies to US semiconductor industry**\n\nThe U.S. government is providing subsidies for semiconductor foundries to strengthen the domestic supply chain and bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. This move is part of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. Strengthening domestic semiconductor production is also seen as a matter of national security. Semiconductors are fundamental to defense technologies, and having a robust domestic production capability reduces dependence on foreign sources.\n\nU.S.-based semiconductor foundries will receive billions in planned direct funding, as part of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. This investment will enable and create new manufacturing capacity and capabilities. Intel Corp is in talks to receive more than $10 billion in subsidies. Intel is one of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers with advanced manufacturing capabilities. The subsidies will help Intel build new factories and modernize existing ones.\n\n**The current top semiconductor foundries are:**\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): TSMC is the leader in the global semiconductor foundry market with a market share of 61.2%. TSMC has major companies such as Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices as its clients.\n\nSamsung Electronics: Samsung is TSMC’s closest competition with a 17% market share. Samsung began its foundry business in 2005 and established it as an independent business unit in 2017.\n\n**ASML's dominant role in the semiconductor industry**\n\nASML, based in the Netherlands, is the leading provider of advanced semiconductor materials lithography. The company designs and manufactures machines used to produce integrated circuits, commonly called microchips, for electronic devices. Some of the biggest chipmakers in the world, such as Intel, Samsung, and TSMC, use ASML’s products. ASML is the leading provider of lithography systems, which are used in the production of semiconductors. ASML’s machines are used by semiconductor manufacturers, including Intel, to produce their chips. ASML’s dominant role in the semiconductor industry is due to its leadership in lithography technology, its innovative solutions, and its significant contribution to the advancement of Moore’s Law.\n\nASML, a Dutch company, plays a crucial role in the global semiconductor industry as a leading supplier of photolithography systems used in the production of integrated circuits. Many semiconductor manufacturers, including those in the U.S., rely on ASML’s technology for chip production. While it’s true that U.S. semiconductor manufacturers rely on equipment from ASML, this doesn’t negate the benefits of increasing domestic semiconductor production. The aim of the U.S. government’s subsidies is not to eliminate this interdependence, but to strengthen the U.S.'s position within this global supply chain.\n\n ", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Unlike TSMC and like Samsung, Intel is both a foundry and a chip maker - they compete directly with their customers.

Remember, AMD used to have foundries until they became a design-only company. Intel still does both design and fabrication. In conjunction with an evolving economy, it is not a difficult observation to make that some may be successful at times more than others. We call this piggybacking.\n\nMy opinion is that Intel has traditionally taken a bureaucratic approach. With more patents than NVDA and AMD combined (not that patents are a primary indicator of success) and plenty of customer contracts with E///, MSFT, etc., we can say that Intel certainly has a diverse set of products which they design and/or manufacture that are outside of your analysis.\n\nI would appreciate a comparison between each sector of the three companies for a fair analysis. Additionally, I'd like to acknowledge that your observations are insightful, considering that Intel GPUs are lacking infrastructure for AI training. It was the same for AMD until they developed ROCM. Despite this, professionals still prefer NVDA for AI training. As you mentioned, there is a bad rep for Intel GPU drivers, but as far I know I buy NVDA GPUs because I don't think the AMD GPU drivers have a very good rep either.\n\nIn terms of gaming, AMD CPUs have been known for their multi- threaded performance, whereas Intel CPUs have been known for their single-threaded performance. That means the benefits of each depends on which software you are running. Furthermore, there is/was a period where AMD CPUs undercut the Intel CPUs with great value for both consumer chips and data center chips. But since then, the prices have snuck back up, and Intel has and is working to make even more competitively priced products. If Intel is so behind, I would be wondering why are they still getting contracts from aforementioned customers?\n\n\nMaybe you should go watch more gamers nexus.

The market believes in GenAI and from my miniscule tendie focused vantage point I don't have any reason to disagree.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfs7xvyeecjc1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc1620f4836cb6a92afae62b51d838c4057f5973\n\nA few very basic observations:\n\n* Who has the necessary IP to build chips needed for training and serving LLMs? Nvidia, Google, Apple\n* Who can produce the required chips at scale? TSMC\n* Who builds the machines to produce these chips? ASML\n* If LLM inference was further optimized to not require state of the art accelerator chips, who else could supply? Intel, Samsung, GlobalFoundries\n\n**Time for some hedge fund level deep market analysis:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f3rvkz0eecjc1.png?width=1339&format=png&auto=webp&s=31584d759387cd8b19ee3f0e7ed30edb4dd0b5e1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mqstz7kecjc1.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bd44cfca1cca5449872c7095bd88e0e604e8ff7\n\nWhat stands out:\n\n* We have multiple companies competing at the IP level and the Nvidia train already left the station - next stop bagholding town\n* We only have one dominant producer (TSMC) and enabler (ASML)\n* Alternative enablers and producers are not discounted\n\nWith competition at the IP level, the real gatekeepers are the producer (short term) and enabler (mid term). They can dictate prices, especially given the expectation pressure and demand the key IP companies have.\n\n**TSMC is offered at a massive discount compared to the rest of the market.**\n\nNow you will say that's because of Geopolitical risk.\n\nRight. But what if China actually attacks Taiwan? What if TSMC must stop production?\n\nAll of the IP companies will be royally skrewed. The US momentum on AI will be severely slowed down.\n\nSo 1) every single IP company above is exposed to the same risk re/ AI - especially Nvidia, and 2) the USA is highly invested in protecting Taiwan's production capabilities.\n\nChina has economical issues. They are again trying to increase trade with the USA. They are even trying to take a peacemaker role (see MSC). Going for Taiwan would be too expensive, maybe even detrimental to their economy. IMHO the likelihood is now at a new low.\n\n**That leaves TSMC priced at a \\~50% discount.**\n\nFellow wendy workers, we have an opportunity to go beyond YOLO-ing again.

{"title": "WAYFAIR (TICKER: W) PRICE INCREASE COMING", "selftext": "Mods keep on deleting my posts about Wayfair. I'm not quite sure why, perhaps it's the comments... I'll try again...\n\n**Wayfair (W)**\n\nWayfair, ticker symbol: W. Please hear my thought process out.. I am making this assessment based on the following factors:\n\n1. Growing Short interest - currently 26% of the stock is shorted. 5-6% is considered normal. 10% is considered very high. Current short term interest is 3x the amount of what is considered high, and could turn into a very lucrative short squeeze opportunity.\n2. Strong revenue growth and stabilizing costs. We’ll discuss this further in the DD below.\n3. I like the stock - Fortune favors the bold, it’s the first ones to jump in first who reap the best tendies.\n\nThe DD…\n\n**What is Wayfair:**\n\nWayfair is a leading e-commerce retailer in the home furnishings space - if you own a home, or furnished your apartment, chances are you purchased from Wayfair or stumbled upon their website at some point.\n\nWayfair Stock Price History:\n\n5-year trading range for Wayfair has been $31 to $340, reaching their all time high post COVID due to an incredible user acquisition and revenue growth while everyone was confined to their homes and renovating home offices for WFH. The decline came in the years following the COVID boom as aggressive management growth initiatives led to increasing overhead and their hockey stick revenue growth charts began to normalize after the COVID boom.\n\n**The Fundamentals:**\n\nBrick and mortar retail regained a large portion of the market share that online businesses originally captured while e-commerce could continue to operate their businesses during COVID and brick and mortars had to keep their businesses closed. I believe the COVID boom on e-commerce in general pushed the growing online shopping trend forward by at least 5-years, forcing many who felt uncomfortable with shopping online to adopt out of necessity. Wayfair seems to have only lost a portion of that COVID market share, we see this with Revenue growth that significantly outpaces pre-COVID 2019 revenues by 30%.\n\nI imagine there is far less home decorating going on tight now as interest rates have risen to cyclical highs and home buying has slowed down.\n\nThese two fundamentals describe a short term negative trend - from a peak to trough - and I believe Wayfair is currently in the trough and ripe for a correction soon.\n\nSeveral analysts have reported the bottoming out of the home furnishings industry - see article from Raymond James analyst dated 2-16-2024 where the stock was upgraded to a STRONG BUY with a price target of $65 for the year ([https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wayfair-upgraded-at-raymond-james-on-compelling-mediumterm-riskreward-432SI-3306362](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wayfair-upgraded-at-raymond-james-on-compelling-mediumterm-riskreward-432SI-3306362)).\n\nThe fed is planning to cut interest rates this year, which will trigger the beginning of the home buying frenzy.\n\nYOY revenue growth for Wayfair has been relatively stable in the range of +/- 5%, but still significantly surpassing PRE-COVID 2019 revenue of 9.15B with an estimated revenue target of 12.2B for 2023 if you account for the average analyst prediction for 2023 Q4 and annualize. This compares to a flat YOY 2022 in 2023, a good sign that the worst is behind us.\n\n**The Technical Analysis:**\n\nWayfair broke through their 200-day MA on 1/19 and then again on 2/12. It broke through the 200-day MA again on the intra-day trade on 2/16, but closed for the day just beneath it. There is a strong channel formation with support at the $48.25 range and resistance at the $55.25 range. I will be a holder of this stock so long as it does not trade below the $48.25 support level. I believe there is a lot of upside if it breaches the $55.25 resistance level and remains above the 200-day MA.\n\n**Important Events/Dates to look for:**\n\nWayfair reports revenue for the 2023 Q4 quarter on 2/22 and this is the closing quarter for the 2023 fiscal year. We are looking for revenues on par with 2022 Q4 estimated at 3.1B. Most analyst research I have read anticipate an earnings beat which would be very bullish for the stock. Their recent cost-cutting initiatives (13% global staff layoff resulting in $260M annual cost savings) will materialize in 2024 over the full year. We're looking to hear managements feedback about continuing these cost savings initiatives to return the company back to profitability over 2024 and 2025.\n\n**Additional Fundamentals:**\n\nWayfair's costs have held them back as large institutional investors and investment banks look for consistent stock profitability otherwise they punish the stock. We see this in Wayfair's largely miscalculated cost increases in 2021 and 2022 to drive market share expansion, leading to a peak loss of ($1.3B) in net annual income. This figure is projected to be around ($600M) for 2023 when they report on 2/22, and it represents greater than a -50% reduction in losses YOY. Coupled with their recent layoffs and cost saving initiatives from the start of 2024, I believe Wayfair is on course to achieve the range of ($300M) to potentially even net positive income on the highly optimistic end for 2024.\n\nWayfair has been in growth mode following in the early footsteps of their big brother Amazon. The key differences between Wayfair and Amazon is their assortment - Wayfair dominates in the home furnishings space as Amazon has significant challenges with large furniture items in their FC's - there is a reason why Amazon does not offer prime delivery on televisions with screens larger than 55\" - they rely on their suppliers to dropship these items along with similar oversized items like furniture that are usually not offered for sale through FBA or PRIME on Amazon. Wayfair is also much better than Amazon at selling premium/luxury brands through their AllModern and Perigold sales channels. Wayfair is also exceptionally better than Amazon with their private label initiatives - with dozens or private label brands that allow them to skirt around manufacturer's minimum advertised price policies.\n\nWayfair has a significant tactical advantage in the Home Furnishings space niche over Amazon. They invested significantly in a 3PL fulfillment model called Castlegate, which charges their suppliers to fulfill orders from Wayfair’s own FC’s but ensures speed, quality, service, and sales ranking - similar to the Amazon FBA recipe, but for larger, bulkier home furnishings items. Wayfair has 12 or more of these facilities in the USA that they were opened over the course of the last 5 years. These are not inexpensive to operate, especially in the beginning as Wayfair focused on expanding FC coverage incurring significant costs, while adding vendors to scale the model and reach profitability. I believe the worst is behind Wayfair on this Castlegate program as they have now reached a peak number of FC’s and strong vendor adaptation - it would be wise to look at Castlegate as a competitive advantage going forward that will lead to higher revenues and drive profitability as Wayfair turns to its vendors to foot the FC bills.\n\nWayfair advertising - they offer a very robust top shelf advertising program that allows their vendors multiple ways to fund advertising and interact with Wayfair base end users. Again, following in the footsteps of Amazon, digital advertising and PPC models generate at least 15% of Amazon's overall revenues. This is a very high margin business because it uses technology to scale revenue growth. I have personally used and engaged with Wayfairs digital advertising program. It is very good and on par with industry standards for a niche e-commerce retailer when you compare it to the likes of Amazon. Very few competitors in this space offer a similar platform: Amazon, Overstock, and Wayfair, and Wayfair's platform is on par.\n\nLastly, Wayfair added to the cost cutting measures by two rounds of layoffs - once in 2022 for a 5% global workforce reduction and then again at the start of 2024 for about 13% of their global workforce. In the most recent rounds, on January 19th, Wayfair laid off 13% of its corporate workforce which will result in an estimated 260M in annual cost reductions straight to their bottom line for 2024.\n\nI believe this recent round of layoffs will not impact revenue growth as we are seeing a shift in corporate culture across the board from a resource abundant environment to one that is more lean and mean. Their revenues in 2023 vs 2022 were unimpacted with the 5% layoff in 2022. We are seeing this type of cost cutting behavior all around us in our own places of business and/or by knowing someone who has been recently laid off from big tech.\n\nThere are several additional cost cutting levers Wayfair can pull if needed, such as reducing advertising expenses (TV ads, Google Adwords), additional rounds of layoffs, and more. Not to mention their recent switch to Vendor funded returns - meaning the vendor now foots the bill when there is something wrong with the customer's order - this is a new initiative they launched mid-2023 that will result in further savings to their bottom line.\n\n**So here’s my bottom line…**\n\nWayfair is expected to report revenue for the 2023 Q4 quarter on February 22nd. I believe revenue will beat analyst estimates as research shows this will likely be the case (I audited dozens of websites, including Seeking Alpha, and independent analyst reports). I believe we will start to see the positive effect to Net Income from these significant cost cutting measures coupled with further benefits from scaling Castlegate and Digital Advertising programs that will be hitting their bottom line. At the very least, these subjects will be discussed on the revenue call with some additional insight and cost-cutting feedback from management that will trigger further institutional buying.\n\nThe icing on the cake is the short squeeze opportunity. With 26% of the stock being shorted, we could see exponential movements to the upside if Wayfair delivers a robust earnings call on 2/22 as anticipated and the stock approaches $60+ as short sellers scramble to purchase stock in the open market to close out their short positions.\n\nOf course there are some risk factors - for instance, global macro economic conditions worsening, and the risk of a market correction triggered by negative earnings reports next week from the likes of behemoths like NIVIDIA, WALMART, and HOME DEPOT to name a few...\n\n**Edit 2/19:** \n\nChart is looking really good. I see a symmetrical bullish triangle with a price target of $80.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14vk1b5hxmjc1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c90e617f6d27e70f0c1f98c757bc60234da21ea\n\n**Hot off the press 2/19:** \n\nQ4 Outlook is looking really good for earnings.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unveiling-wayfair-w-q4-outlook-141556596.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unveiling-wayfair-w-q4-outlook-141556596.html)\n\n**Full Disclosure:** \n\nI own 80 April 19 calls valued at $40k and I fully intend to add to this position over the next few days and weeks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7knvoejsdjc1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fbf3da1e31e9a7ee56d53bb243dde597e857182", "id": "1atzwdd", "created_utc": 1708278348.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|57|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "**Your scorecard:**\n\n|Stock|Recommendation|Result|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|W|$60  04/19/24 Call|*TBD*|\n|[PLTR](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1anoan5/pltr_palantir_due_for_a_pullback_soon_25k_of_216/)|$24.50 02/16/24 Put|❌|\n|[PLTR](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/molpgy/pltr_fd_700_x_april_16_25_calls_will_pick_up/)|$25 04/16/21 Call|❌|\n\nGodspeed.", "score": 79, "replies": [{"body": "Lmaoo I'm gonna inverse his trade", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Good luck, I would not advise that as long as Wayfair remains above the support level of $48.25...", "score": -38, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I see a lot of words.

It’s evident that Wayfair’s media presence is built on paid fluff, attempting to manipulate public perception.\n\nThis company is on a downward spiral, evident from their repeated failures to get their product assortment and quality right. Their ill-advised venture into retail will only expose more consumers to their shoddy products. Let’s not forget their heartless decision to lay off nearly 2000 employees just to prop up their failing financials.\n\nWayfair’s actions are not just laughable, but also cowardly and despicable.

Up, down, sideways.\n\nIf you buy calls and it goes down or sideways, you are fucked.\n\nIf you buy puts and it goes up or sideways, you are fucked.\n\nIf you open a PUTS CREDIT SPREAD, you ONLY get fucked if it goes down and STAYS under your shorted put's strike by expiry. Sideways, you max profit. Up, you max profit even sooner. Hell, even if it goes down a little, anything over your strike at expiry is still max profit. Can't go tits up (unless it gets bombed to 600 or something)\n\nIf you short a put around the 700 strike and are willing to go pretty wide on the spread, you can set up a trade with a roughly equal max profit and loss, each of about $2k.\n\nCredit put spread is the move here.\n\nI will open this spread after earnings report on a dip which is likely to happen. From there it should have no problem staying over my selected strike, probably in the 690-700 range, the rest of the week. All NVDA has to do is survive above the shorted strike for 2 days and you max profit.\n\nChange my mind that this is the best way to play it.\n\nEDIT: as u/sharp-direction-6894 pointed out, if for some reason NVDA tanks after I open this spread, I can simply close the short put and keep the long. The longed put will likely recoup most of the losses or even put me back in profit.

In order to be successful in a trade, you must have enough powder(cash) to execute the trade forever without effecting your ability to pay your bills.\nTo put your future at risk is not something I would ever recommend, but I do understand when you are starting to trade it is very common to not have all the \"powder\" you wish you had. When I started trading in 1996 l often would use \"margin\" where they would allow me to leverage my small account by 2. In other words, if I had $1000 the brokerage would allow me to trade with $2000 for a specific period of time. Some brokerages allow you to leverage your account until the trading day ends, but if it falls under their set equity amount you must bring the account value up or be forced into selling your positions otherwise known as a\n\"margin call\".\nWith that said, before you enter a trade you must understand the \"difference between PRICE and Value\". For the most part the market is a forward pricing mechanism that generally looks 24 months out. There is much nuance to this rule and it is a moving target depending on secto v general economy, wars, terrorism, acts of God, etc.\n\nThere are several other factors why a stock will rise or fall, but most investors look to companies that have tremendous GROWTH opportunities.\nFinding these companies takes talent. This ability separates the men from the boys- but absolutely can be done with tremendous work ethic and deep dives into company financials and the products that generate their revenues.\nOnce I was able to understand and apply the difference between price and value and then filter it against growth opportunities-my trades became profitable at a much higher rate and I began to get a feel for the pulse of the market.\nI want to warn you of the old saying \"the market has the ability to stay irrational longer than you have the ability to stay solvent.\" But I also want to encourage you-you can do this-it won't be easy and it will take tremendous grit, patience, tons of research and intestinal fortitude- but if you work hard and stay disciplined you can change your families financial future forever. If I can do it-\nGod knows you can do it.\nOne last thing for now- the market is not a game or lottery. It is a MONSTER that demands respect.

Considering pretty much every Wall Street Analyst only makes bull cases for Nvidia, there aren’t any reputable sources I can read for the bear case.\n\nThe bull case seems clear: the rapidly growing demand for semiconductors with AI/ML-capabilities to use in Data Centers (DC). Pretty much every large tech company is buying up land for DCs, such as in Northern Virginia, and are releasing plans to buy tons of NVDA chips for their new DCs and to upgrade their old DCs. Congress is also choosing NVDA as their favorite chip-maker, forbidding them from selling premier chips to China, presumably to use NVDA for defense-related cyber operations, creating a future for significant government demand.

It's roughly the same cost, and the same margin as a GPU card.\n\nThey only sold 30m GPU. Meta, arguably one of the top 3 AI companies using AI at scale, is buying 500k cards. Compare this is with 223m Apple phones being sold (I realize that H100 is much more expensive, Apple is selling more than phones too).\n\nWhat this means is that it is not the customer being graphic cards, it is business trying to scale their business with AI.

Rest assured that a lot of effort will be spent to optimize for SW, so the cost is not getting crazy.\n\nSW companies cannot buy 30m GPU cards every year, at some point they will need some sort of ROI. At some point, there will be some companies saying that they have enough GPU cards for the moment. They will say that they don't need to splurge on GPU/AI card as much until they can absorb the current stock they already have.\n\nFor price to go up further, it means that NVIDIA will have to improve their margin and sell many more cards. A ton more. And then NVIDIA will be as big as Apple?\n\nThe risk profile today is more risk on the downside than on the upside. You just need a bit of some bad news or doubt to trigger a drop.
