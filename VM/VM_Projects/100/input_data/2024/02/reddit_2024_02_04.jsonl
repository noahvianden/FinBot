{"title": "Elon is bailing and so should you", "selftext": "I purchased my first Tesla shares in 2016, right after the announcement event for the Model 3. It was my first investment in something other than an index fund, but after the presentation that evening I couldn't NOT pull the trigger. It was the most optimistic I've ever been about a company. I continued buying more shares every month during all of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Even though I could barely afford it, a big part of every paycheck during those years went to increasing my stake in Tesla. Over time, I built up what was (for me) an absolutely massive position.\n\nThat obviously turned out to be the right move. By 2021, my initial investment had 30x'd, so I cashed out a small portion to buy a Model 3, the same vehicle I had fallen in love with all those years earlier. The cost of the car was tiny compared to the money I had made owning the stock, and the plan was to hold onto the rest until I retired. Then in November 2021, Elon started selling. It feels silly to say this, but I have to admit I felt a bit betrayed. Up until that point, his motto had always been \"first in, last out.\" While that clearly wasn't true anymore, I decided to hang tight.\n\nFuck me, that was a dumb decision. Elon perfectly timed the all time pico top of this thing. Ever since, it's been lower highs and lower lows, year after year, with no end in sight. I could put up with the twitter drama and cringey edgelord shit, but the most recent earnings call was the last straw. I've been listening to those calls for years, and you can tell in his voice Elon is OVER this company. These days, he's obviously more interested in railing against \"illegals\" and poopsocking Diablo than he is about clean energy or even space. He's sure as shit not sleeping on that factory floor ever again. My prediction is he steps down as CEO in the next 12 months.\n\nSo yeah, I'm out. It was a fun ride, but this is where I get off.

Imagine watching videos of your favorite movies from your couch any time you want!  Sure, these companies are not making any money now....but the fucking future is so bright!!!\n\n\\- Hype and vision - Like AI, the future was so blindling bright that you just can't comprehend the amount of profits these companies were going to make. All advertisement will be on the web! Holy shit...think about the TAM! Banking from home! You can even print stamps from home with [stamps.com](https://stamps.com)! No need for so many post offices. The world was going to change forever.\n\n\\- Optimism and euphoria - Some shit website like [globe.com](https://globe.com) was going to be the townsquare of the world, bringing everyone together. How could it possibly fail? It's growing by triple digits every quarter. CSCO is building out the plumbling for the internet world. There's so many more countries that it can enter. Woohoo.\n\nIt all came crashing down when valuations were stretched to triple digits P/S. Then growth slowed. Revenue misses by the big techs - yahoo, csco, 3com.  The thing is...there were casandras screaming that this was a house of cards...but they were ignored. Some  hedge funds shorted the hell out of Nasdaq in 1999 but couldn't hold on and liquidated. It wasn't like no one saw the crash coming. It was more like FOMO was so strong, you believed 1) you can get out before the music stops or 2) this time it's different.  Siting on the sidelines while stocks rocket 20-30% a day was too painful.\n\nThe web did change the world...but it took 2 decades. It didn't happen overnight. AMZN dropped to 9 bucks and without AWS would be barely profitable decades later. The market was just way too ahead of itself.\n\nI see the same euphoria in AI. It reminds me of self-driving cars, of crypto, of fiberoptics, of the web. Sure, AI will change the world and 10 years from now, we will look back at bastards entering units into Excel as if it was the stone ages.  But the AI stocks , IMO, are way ahead of themselves. It's driven mostly by optimism and hype.  forward PE is a bunch of assumptions. PTON CEO said we would all be riding interactive bikes in our homes. That narrative ended after Covid.\n\nThe only people making money from AI are the shovels and picks companies...NVDA, AMD.  META just said they don't see any material revenue from AI in 2024...and they have invested tens of billions.  The mania is still going and likely will last another year or two. When the bubble pops is when corps have to belt tighten and look at  their AI ROI.  Till then NVDA could hit $1500 pre-split and become the largest company in the world.

I'd be interested in the new Ramcharger coming out next year if it wasn't made by FIAT, I think extended range electric is the future of the pick up truck world. If my truck had a 50kw battery it would do 90% of my life off a charger and then I could still do stuff outside of city limits with my truck. \n\nTo all the Lightning owners who say they tow their boat to their lake lot that's an hour and half out of town and how great it works...blow me.\n\nThere are some considerations about the cybertruck vs the lightning:\n\nPro Cybertruck;\n\n•First and foremost the supercharger network lets you actually go on a roadtrip which is nice.\n\n•Cybertruck rear steer is a great day to day plus for cutting down turning radius, without having used it I think the steer by wire looks fantastic.\n\n•Video rear view, oh lord how I hate the legal team at Ford, 360 cams everywhere but I can't use the massive 12 inch display for a rear view mirror while driving in the event I have a tall load or my tonneau cover flipped up, I get a large pay attention black out bar right in the middle of the screen, so dumb, in fact...\n\n•Ford's done a decent job of the software but Tesla takes the cake among all vehicles right now, you know what happens when a Tesla fails an update? It reverts to a safe update. You know what happens when an F150 fails an update, you have a fancy new red neck lawn ornament on your driveway. Also the options are laid out better in Tesla, they give you more control over what you can change in settings without needing a Forscan tool and sketchy hex codes, and while the Tesla UI isn't as pretty as carplay or android auto it just works so much better. Also Teslas base included autopilot is way better than any lane keep assist from Ford\n\n•Adjustable air suspension 10/10, I've bottomed out my FX4 enough times to want a little extra lift but only when I need a little extra lift, I don't want a jacked up truck on the highway. 17\" of clearance 17!!! From factory. Superior approach, break over and departure angles. Once again EVs don't really go out much it's hard to count these points because I think both will be pavement princesses but lemme tell you on my '21 F150 I'm jealous.\n\n• 0-60 in fuck yeah\n\n•6ft bed standard, I have a short box because of the overall length of my truck but a little extra bed in the same overall dimensions is nice.\n\n•Factory tonneau cover, a nice one\n\n\nThey both have rust proof bodies so it's not a measurable point against these two trucks\n\nLightning Pros;\n\n•Pickup chassis instead of unibody. It's a bit of a double edged sword the CT unibody offers ridgidity, the pickup design is better for filling with a skid steer and you can replace a box a lot easier than a rear quarter panel on a CT.\n\n•Cheaper wipers and windshields\n\n•Nicer seats\n\n•More affordable base models although at similar trim I consider them price comparable.\n\nGiven choice if I had to pick an EV truck I'd take CT all day long.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "At least Teslas are cheap to build even if they are garbage.

Hertz also just sold their fleet because of these issues and people simply don’t understand / don’t want an electric car. Interest rates are also high and if trump wins election we could see a slower adoption of electric cars. I also think personally we’re quite far from all electric and think a hybrid car will become more mainstream in the short term future where the gas engine charges the battery so you never have to charge.

Now they don't, the margins are on similar level as Volkswagen\n\n\\- people were saying that there will be 30%-50% growth YoY. But it has slowed down dramatically.  \n\n\n\\- \"Tesla is not automotive\" - well, in energy sector the growth is tiny, and it's easy for competition to step in. In autonomous driving field - v12 was supposed to be the last one, but it's still not ready. In robotics - Tesla doesn't show anything that hadn't been already done 10 years ago.  \n\n\n\\- \"People will switch to EVs very fast and competition will not make it\" - turns out that switch to EVs can take more than 12 more years, and the competition is already on the same level technologically as Tesla. So even if Tesla will have more EV market share, big companies will be able to scale up quite fast when the time comes.
