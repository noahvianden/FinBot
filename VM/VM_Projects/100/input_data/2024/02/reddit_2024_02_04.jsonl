{"title": "Elon is bailing and so should you", "selftext": "I purchased my first Tesla shares in 2016, right after the announcement event for the Model 3. It was my first investment in something other than an index fund, but after the presentation that evening I couldn't NOT pull the trigger. It was the most optimistic I've ever been about a company. I continued buying more shares every month during all of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Even though I could barely afford it, a big part of every paycheck during those years went to increasing my stake in Tesla. Over time, I built up what was (for me) an absolutely massive position.\n\nThat obviously turned out to be the right move. By 2021, my initial investment had 30x'd, so I cashed out a small portion to buy a Model 3, the same vehicle I had fallen in love with all those years earlier. The cost of the car was tiny compared to the money I had made owning the stock, and the plan was to hold onto the rest until I retired. Then in November 2021, Elon started selling. It feels silly to say this, but I have to admit I felt a bit betrayed. Up until that point, his motto had always been \"first in, last out.\" While that clearly wasn't true anymore, I decided to hang tight.\n\nFuck me, that was a dumb decision.

I've been listening to those calls for years, and you can tell in his voice Elon is OVER this company. These days, he's obviously more interested in railing against \"illegals\" and poopsocking Diablo than he is about clean energy or even space. He's sure as shit not sleeping on that factory floor ever again. My prediction is he steps down as CEO in the next 12 months.\n\nSo yeah, I'm out. It was a fun ride, but this is where I get off.

It should also be said that the COVID bubble still lingers and the money which was printed hasn't been remedied. \n\nThe AI bubble's numeric signals in the media are not as readily identifiable, but could potentially be seen to be the layoffs. As with COVID, compared to the Y2K and dotcom panic, there is no specified date by which a fever pitch *should* come to pass or fruition. This means the peak may only be popped in conjunction with a secondary terminating factor such as a terror event.\n\nIn 2000, the economic center of America was seen clearly to be the World Trade Center.

Now they don't, the margins are on similar level as Volkswagen\n\n\\- people were saying that there will be 30%-50% growth YoY. But it has slowed down dramatically.  \n\n\n\\- \"Tesla is not automotive\" - well, in energy sector the growth is tiny, and it's easy for competition to step in. In autonomous driving field - v12 was supposed to be the last one, but it's still not ready. In robotics - Tesla doesn't show anything that hadn't been already done 10 years ago.  \n\n\n\\- \"People will switch to EVs very fast and competition will not make it\" - turns out that switch to EVs can take more than 12 more years, and the competition is already on the same level technologically as Tesla. So even if Tesla will have more EV market share, big companies will be able to scale up quite fast when the time comes. And legacy companies have the luxury to switch to ICE production when EV demand is smaller.
