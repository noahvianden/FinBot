I’m not looking to get rich. I am looking to get an extra 800-1000 a month though. Maybe I spend it.

A lot of what I’m about to say, depends on factors, such as how comfortable you are with risk, how much cash you have to play with, how much margin your brokerage let’s you use, those sorts of things… But to make decent money on the premiums, you need a stock that’s more volatile than Apple. People smarter than me know how to look at “implied volatility“ but what I do (to compare one stock to another, with regard to options) is take the sell price for an option 30 days out, at the money (meaning the strike price is the same as today’s price), then I divide that “sell“ price by the strike price and come up with a number (like 0.02 for AAPL.  0.02 is too low to justify putting shares at risk in my opinion. And the fact that I rely on a calculation like that, rather than figuring out what implied volatility numbers are all about, should tell you I am not all that sophisticated, a trader lol.  I look for a ratio that is higher than 0.035 before even considering options (not a magic number, just the number I use). For the past couple of years, I have made my income on  TSLA and NVDA calls, and have ignored the rest of the market.  I have gotten out of Tesla now so I am 100% NVDA (and its ratio, that I mentioned earlier, is 0.0634).  With 100 shares, one covered call generates about $1500 premium on a 30 day call, at the money (but you absolutely will have to sell the shares, or roll forward, because NVDA will keep going up - they are untouchable when it comes to AI chips).  It’s generally a bad idea to buy 100 shares in a single buy if you don’t have deep pockets, and when Nvidia does their earnings announcement in a couple of weeks, it would not be surprising to see it dip anywhere from $20-$100 (but it also would not be surprising to see it hit $900 in two weeks lol).  I have been buying another 5 to 10 shares every time it crosses a $5 mark, up or down but others would probably say it is smarter to sell a cash secured put and just keep collecting premium until it hits your price. My pockets are not deep enough to comfortably obligate myself to a $70,000 purchase, but it’s just psychological because I can always roll the option down and out (just like I’m having to do with my calls right now).  I need to get through the psychological barrier of thinking it’s OK to lose 100 shares where my cost basis is $330, but not OK to go risk buying 100 shares when I COULD always sell my other shares to cover, if I HAD to.  TSLA has good premiums, but I would not on Tesla right now, with sentiment, running against electric cars, and Musk looking increasingly unhinged.  I am slowly collecting ARM holdings and SOFI bc Last time I looked they had pretty good option premiums, but SOFI cleaned up being a meme stock a year from now and ARM is trading pet some absolutely ridiculous price to earnings ratio (ARM is 1,340 times earnings, compared to Nvidia, which is 94. AAPL is 29.)\n\nTLDR: AAPL premiums are too low to justify putting all those shares at risk. Take a look at doing it with a stock that has higher volatility.  NVDA, in my opinion, is about the most certain growth stock in tech, based on their monopoly, and long head start on high end, AI chips.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I use this exact same ratio calculation for my covered calls...fellow low brow trader!

Still do once in a while.\n\nLet me first say that I'm doing all my trading in a traditional IRA account. So it's not a taxable event when my calls are assigned. My strategy is this...sell weekly calls because they will yield larger premiums. I don't look at deltas or IV. I only look at the ratio of contract price to underlying stock price. I see this as the ROI for my money tied up in the stock. The way I see it, the contract price is derived off the delta and IV. It's just another data point to key off of.\n\nLet's take our beloved NVDA as an example. Say I bought 100 shares for the current price of 721. If I want to sell a call at the strike of 725 expiring on 3/8 (4 weeks out). I will make 4400 from the premium. That is a return of 6.1% (4400 / 72100). That's very good! But if I sold a weekly that expired on 2/16, the premium would be 1400. That's a 1.9% ROI. If I can do that every week, 1.9 x 4 weeks is 7.6%. Granted I might not be able to get 1.9% every week.\n\nLet me first say that I'm doing all my trading in a traditional IRA account. So it's not a taxable event when my calls are assigned.

I see this as the ROI for my money tied up in the stock. The way I see it, the contract price is derived from the delta and IV. It's just another data point to key off of.\n\nExecuting this strategy doesn't take too much time. I spend about 45 minutes every Monday morning buying my shares and selling the contracts.  Then I don't touch it for the week. I check in every other day to see how it's doing, but that's just out of curiosity. I have a spreadsheet to keep track of how I'm doing. I also wrote a program that lists stocks with the highest ROI. So that makes it quicker to pick the stock.\n\nBut like I said, NVDA is too rich for my blood. I prefer to diversify with other high-ROI stocks. My goal is to consistently hit singles, even if it means giving up the occasional homerun. Just this week, I lost a lot of upside on ARM. The stock went bananas after earnings came out. I had 100 shares that appreciated 3700. Instead, I made only 219 from the premium. But as I see it, if I make 1% ROI every week, that's a 52% return at the end of the year.\n\nThis whole thing is sort of an experiment for me. I want to see if this strategy will beat the S&P 500 in 2024. So I use half my money in the IRA selling calls and the other half tucked away in VFIAX. So far VFIAX is winning lol, but the year's still young. I plan to follow through for the entire year and then reassess. My dogs so far have been TSLA and RIVN :( Down 24% and 20% respectively.\n\nLet me know if you see any holes in this strategy. I have no one else to bounce it off with in the real world.

Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance. You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to 2 percent inflation. As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3½ on core. On a six- month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent, though when you look at supercore and shelter, they are, of course, stickier. So when looking in the different components of the data, how much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates? \n\n>CHAIR POWELL. I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates is that policy would be, it would be too late. I mean, you’d want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot, if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity. You know, it takes—it takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation.\n\nWaller said rising real rates is enough of reason:\n\n>If inflation continues to cool “for several more months — I don’t know how long that might be — three months, four months, five months — that we feel confident that inflation is really down and on its way, you could then start lowering the policy rate just because inflation is lower,” Waller said in remarks at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. **“It has nothing to do with trying to save the economy or recession.”**", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "That’s what’s baffling to me.

Let me take you down memory lane. \n\n1999 and the party was in. The dotcom bubble was about to hit. But why? Because for about 2000 years there was 2 main industries, farming and market trading. Since that time there was 2 additional hit in the past 200 years of capitalistic type market importance. Manufacturing/industrial age (including steel and chemicals) and transportation on land (rail). In the past 125 years there was an explosion of technology namely cars, rockets and compute. Everything here is encompassing. \n\nAll of those things pale in comparison to the past \\~50 or so years with the digital age and the personal PC. \n\nBut nothing has brought more human advancement and progress than the past \\~30 years and the advent of the usable internet. Google search launched in 1998. \n\nThe boom and absolute parabolic swing towards technology has never looked back. \n\nIn this time, over the years, we watched Rim create the blackberry and Apple rip it from their hands into the Apple we all know today. \n\nThe point is why was the dotcom bubble so painful when it hit but did nothing to impede technological growth. \n\nBecause all of the internet's glory was a play by everyone and anyone to invest in anything that was online related. \n\n1000's if not 10's of 1000's of those companies where PURE bullshit. \n\nThat's people wanting to invest in anything that doesn't have a purpose or take care to even inquire about what that company even does. If you do that then it is at your own peril. \n\nLastly, In the past 12 months we have witnessed something born that is arguably as important as the internet and will might have equally or more the same weight of importance as the internet itself. AI. \n\nIn this boom the same cautionary tale is there for you to behold and understand what it means for you and to you. Some companies will be complete dog SHIT and some will grow into infamy. \n\nNvidia is one of those company's that will grow into infamy. ARM is one of those companies.

Now he has another great ambition: raising trillions of dollars to reshape the global semiconductor industry.\n\nThe OpenAI chief executive officer is in talks with investors including the United Arab Emirates government to raise funds for a wildly ambitious tech initiative that would boost the world’s chip-building capacity, expand its ability to power AI, among other things, and cost several trillion dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. The project could require raising as much as $5 trillion to $7 trillion, one of the people said. \n\nThe fundraising plans, which face significant obstacles, are aimed at solving constraints to OpenAI’s growth, including the scarcity of the pricey AI chips required to train [large language models](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-new-jobs-for-humans-in-the-ai-era-db7d8acd) behind AI systems such as ChatGPT. Altman has often complained that there aren’t enough of these kinds of chips—known as graphics processing units, or GPUs—to power OpenAI’s quest for [artificial general intelligence](https://www.wsj.com/video/a-look-at-artificial-general-intelligence/2E45D924-EFBD-4480-BC1B-23EE98E2870D), which it defines as systems that are broadly smarter than humans.", "id": "1amof0w", "created_utc": 1707486163.0, "score": 794, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 337, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|819|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If Sam Altman can ask for 7T, you can ask that girl out.", "score": 1890, "replies": [{"body": "She would say yes.

At the end of the day arm produces a digital file, from a physical perspective ARM's product is no different than an animated porn video, a nft of a bored ape, or just a good ole instructions book on \"here is how you do this\"...\n\nAnyone that wants a computer processor capable of basic \"if this then that\" logic without having to actually wire up the 0s to the 1s and then have to implement a profiler, compiler, and debugger from scratch...\n\nagain... unless you know which switches to flip to make the connections necessary to do \"add this to that\" vs \"put this in memory\" vs \"go to this place in memory\"... the absolute minimum needed (RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer, ARM is an implementation of RISC, the implementation being at RTL level), you will want to have instructions on how to do it...RTL is literally just a computer file with those instructions. ARM sells RTL... they license a file exactly the way you license anything... your lawyers give handies to the other guy's lawyers... Along with the license, so you don't have to reverse engineer their 1s and 0s, they give you tools to write and read them, in most cases ARM will even let you edit your copies of their file (imagine fucking that, ever read the EULA on your computer, most of the software you buy prohibits you from modifying it or the DMCA or some shit will send you to jail)... compiler and debugger, smart people give those tools away for free to \"open source\"\n\nAMD, Nvidia, Intel, Samsung, Car makers, Apple... Raspberry PI...Google...

NVDA's own processor is typically presented at the OS level, so by that time... most of the \"Computer\" is make believe already... a few dozen separate logical processes are already running just so that Windows or Linux's core functions for memory management and task scheduling can make sense. Typically at that level the fan favourite is x86 (Intel and AMD) since most developers are lazy fucks and just want to re-use so CISC processing comes in with optimized hardware for more complex, a product like the H100 benefits from a higher level of abstraction than since very application specific processing is far better on Linux which has more robust support... Windows is a total pile of shit and takes 10 years to do whatever everyone else is doing... luckily they wrote their own Linux kernel so you can now run your Linux app in Windows... so they are getting better... like within last year I think they solved the \"where do I begin?\" problem and systemd finally works.\n\nThere is no longer a \"CPU\"... it is turtles all the way down, the \"if this then that\" logic is constantly being brought down as close to the data as possible.... that's why data-centres are so ... BIG... as are their processors and data caches.

{"title": "NVDA will fall on Monday to 700 because", "selftext": "1. We are facing resistance at 720 which signals a retracing with the decreasing volume. This has historically always been followed by a fall of 1-3%\n\n2. Anytime the stock has soared 15-20$ it is followed by a sideways movement in the market followed by a drop. Since institutional investors are aware we know this, they will sell off a day early on Monday instead of Tuesday\n\n3. There’s no more catalysts coming up. Today’s boom was brought on by the announcement of their custom chip segment which is now already priced in. They cannot have any more surprises ahead of earnings without risking a boost in price beyond analyst forecasts which causes their price to crater\n\n4. Institutional investors saw my last post listing a decrease in price and bought in droves to drive out what they perceive as the majority of WSB investors. Since the OG meme stock they have been scared of us and actively use the sentiment in our posts to bet against us. It had over 500k impressions meaning it was definitely on their radar\n\n5. Basic game theory: earnings will be nowhere close to the expectations of the guidance given by NVDA, and institutional investors know this. As such the usual approach where buying options 2 weeks ahead of earnings to capitalize on volatility is moot. It’s a race against time to see which big player sells first while they try to maximize their gains. Once one player sells, it will trigger a cascading effect causing the price to drop fast. We could see 690’s\n\n6. I bought calls expiring 2/16 at $690\n\n7. I want to double down on institutional investors being aware of this post. They will sell off/trade side ways to go against the trending posts in this sub\n\nEdit: my original post had 800k impressions \n\nEdit 2: after market is flat instead of gapping up which usually happens after a run up like this.
