The market doesn't care about price or valuation, it sees that it fell 1% and it's deploying the unlimited liquidity to buy ever dip in sight. \n\nMeta, they announce the smallest dividend and people lose their mind. lol. You can't make this stuff up. 14% rally. Why stop there. This should clearly be worth atleast 5 T.\n\nI'll be called an idiot, I'm sure someone will set a reminder, but every time I make a post you look a month out and this thing is up another 5-7%.\n\nKeep in Mind when QQQ finally hits 500 later this year the drop to 495 will be bought more aggressively than the dip from yesterday. \n\nEvery dip will continue to be bought, the market will still rally and there is actually not a single thing that can stop it aside for a few days here and there and guess what it will V and V again forever.

That was one of the most bullish A.I. conference calls we've heard. META will only get more profitable. \n\n> Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. One for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, I believe you'd shifted FAIR out of Reality Labs and into the Family of Apps. Can you just talk about some of the benefits there of moving that group as you pursue general intelligence? And then Susan, can you just walk us through your thought process on adding a dividend to your capital returns at this stage beyond the share repurchases? Thank you.\n\n> Mark Zuckerberg: I can talk to the first one. Yes. The whole reason why we moved FAIR is basically to be closer to the GenAI group. They're both research groups. The GenAI group basically builds our Llama launch vehicles and products, but also conducts a fair amount of research, too, especially things that are going to be coming into the upcoming versions of Llama. \n\n> FAIR is focused on more foundational work and longer-term work. So it's, I'd say, more things that might be a couple of years out to 10-plus years out. And as we -- I guess, here's one way to think about it.\n\n> A lot of last year and the work that we're doing with Llama 3 is basically making sure that we can scale our efforts to really produce state-of-the-art models. But once we get past that, there's a lot more kind of different research that I think we're going to be doing that's going to take our foundation models in potentially different directions than other players in the industry are going to go in because we're focused on specific vision for what we're building. \n\n> So it's really important as we think about what's going to be in Llama 5 or 6 or 7 and what cognitive abilities we want in there and what modalities we want to build into future multimodal versions of the models, we need to be doing that work in advance and to research those things.\n\n> And it helps to -- and even though FAIR and GenAI will continue to be two kind of\nseparate groups on different time horizons, I think to have some level of alignment\nbetween -- on the vision of what we're building between the two of them, so that\nway, the FAIR team can have in mind, hey, if we research this, then maybe it can\nintercept Llama 6 or something.\n\n> Then that, I think, is just going to be more helpful for increasing the ambition and\nfocus of all of the work that we do. It's one of the reasons why I talked about, we\ndid open-ended research in AI for a while. But having a clear product target with\nthese AI agents, I think, is really going to help focus the work and give us a feedback\nloop that's going to increase the productivity and output that we get dramatically.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Not reading all that", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I bought at 90 and sold 110 that was my plan and I was happy it worked out.

IAC has not had a great last few years and post Match spin off, what's left is a bit of a mixed bag. Management has talked up sum of the parts and how cheap the company is in its shareholder letters, but people want to see something more compelling than that. There is a good management team but it could continue to take a long time to play out. \n\nThere's other sum of the parts/NAV stories, too. Ferrari/Stellantis parent Exor has continually traded with a fairly sizable discount to NAV. \n\nSo, I think it's tough and this is not a market that rewards contrarianism in most cases. Or it takes a lot longer to pay off than one expects - too many people buy what appears cheap and it's mismanaged in the meantime and there's no apparent catalyst for change on the horizon.  Too many people looking at things like PFE that are big and down a lot yet aren't considering why it's lower than it was 1-5-10-20 years ago and what will make the next 5 years any different.\n\nIf anyone tries to get into contrarian/value/distressed I would make it a small part of the portfolio. Piling your whole portfolio into things that you think are out of favor could mean sitting in things that are not working for possibly a long time and that's not something that most people tolerate especially in this market where a lot of things that are good and working just continue higher.\n\nLastly, I don't think value investing is over by any means but it really has had a somewhat difficult decade+. It did well in 2022, but people rented value while they waited for the green light (AI) to run back into growth. What changes that/when that changes I don't know.

I have invested for some of that time, and currently hold almost 50 shares. I slowed my investment in Walmart about a year ago to diversify into other companies amongst the Dividend Aristocrats that pay a better percentage. I'll be increasing my Walmart exposure going forward for the reasons I outlay below.)  \nFirst of all, I think this presents a fantastic opportunity for all investors. There's a lot to unpack here, so this will likely be kinda long.  \nWalmart used to have a history of a share price cap. I'm not going to do the research into prior prices when Sam Walton and his successor David Glass split the stock, but it was very apparent there was a price cap which Sam, and later, David, did not want the stock to move past. Based upon my experience with the 1999 split, it was around $100. I could be wrong, and someone else can do the research, but it is clear Sam did not want the price going above a certain ceiling. After the 1999 split, the stock stayed stagnant for a long time (I know, I was holding!) and it seems the respect for the ceiling went away.  \nIf the ceiling is back, (and we do not know if it is, but the company claiming the split is primarily for associates indicates it may be) then the stock will see regular splits in the future. For dividend investors like myself, this should make you giddy. Walmart generally has a lousy dividend, and the new split will retain the old dividend divided by 3, so we are not about to see an astronomical jump.  \nExcept, maybe we are. Walmart is a Dividend King, which takes 50 years. For the uninitiated, a Dividend King is a company that has increased it's dividend every year for the last 50 years. It takes a long time - 50 years to be exact! - to get there, and once there, companies do not want to lose that status. It places you in the elite of elites amongst companies. So, Walmart will continue to increase it's dividend. With a 3 way split, that dividend now increases 3 times as fast, as I do not think they will decrease the amt they increase the dividend. We'll see. So the increase in the dividend alone will make this a fantastic opportunity. Again, they may drastically decrease the amount they increase the dividend, negating this plus, but I do not expect them to do so. Corporate is on the hook to keep increasing employee wealth after all the hype of this split - cutting the dividend increase would be antithetical to the spirit of the Walmart statement that this is to increase employee wealth. Since 2013, Walmart has increased the dividend by 1 full cent each year. If they maintain that rate, it will mean a 3 cent per (current) share increase instead. I suspect we may see it drop to .5 cents - still a half cent increase in the dividend taken across 3 shares. We'll know in August.  \nThe last time Walmart split, in 1999, the internet was in it's infancy. Nowadays, we have a number of companies like Robinhood, Public and others that allow the average intelligent idiot to build a portfolio online without having to go through an paid online or in-person broker. I remember my TD Ameritrade acct that cost me $6.99 to buy or sell a stock. This opening of the market allowed millions of people around the world to begin acquiring a portfolio, adding who knows how many millions or even billions to the market. Me personally, I shy away from stocks over $100 - it takes too long to acquire enough for the dividends to begin rolling over into new stocks every quarter. By lowering the price, Walmart has enabled those dividend investors like myself to add Walmart as an option. Further, I was not confident about Walmarts ability to keep increasing the stock price over $150 a share. But I know Walmart will more easily be able to go from $55 - $60 a share to $100 than from $150 to $200. So investors just looking for share price increase should be looking into the stock.  \nNow, a small downfall. Walmart is, as we know, extremely hostile to unions. By granting this split, they will increase the base of stock purchased by employees. This means the Board of Directors will have even more proxy votes in their pocket at the annual shareholder meetings. Silver lining - if an activist investor can get those shares on their side, perhaps change can be forced.  \nNow, for Walmart employee benefits. Touching back on employee engagement again, Walmart gives 15% free to each employee who buys stock. Buy $100 worth of stock, get $15 free. This immediately puts employees in the black on their investment from the start. This is not a new benefit, but, as the Walmart statement mentioned, many people are hesitant to own fractional shares. They want the whole enchilada. $60 a paycheck to get an entire stock, or even $30 per check to get a stock per month is a lot more palatable that the current nigh $170 at the moment. Again, employee participation should jump significantly, which will press the stock price upward.  \nI'm not going to go into the possibilities this opens up in options and calls, because that is thoroughly out of my knowledge and experience. I'll let someone more knowledgeable go into that.  \nI expect the number of Walmart associates purchasing stock to jump significantly, which will itself put pressure on the stock, and now that a stock cap is possibly in play, a lot of associates will increase their investment percentages. I myself will be going from $25 a paycheck to $50, and looking to make it $100. I'll have to look at the new returns vs the rest of the Dividend Aristocrats and how confident I am of a stock split trigger being in place in the future.  \nI'm probably being optimistic here, but I expect it to jump to $60 a share from wherever it opens after the split, and to $100 inside 2 years.  \nPros:  \nPossible increased dividend yield.  \nStock split trigger possibly reinstated.  \nStock growth is easier at lower prices.  \nPortfolio growth is better at lower prices. ie, 1 share gaining $10 is against 3 shares gaining $10  \nCons:  \nIncreased institutional control over voting issues at shareholders meetings.  \nI look forward to comments from the rest of you regarding things I missed, both pro and con.", "score": -9, "replies": [{"body": "> 1 share gaining $10 is against 3 shares gaining $10\n> \n\nIf I have one $100 share of something and it goes up 10% or I have ten $10 shares of the same thing that goes up 10% still $100 of value making 10%.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "A split doesn't do anything to the underlying numbers or fundamentals.

{"title": "Amazon stock analysis: Why it's my only holding in my portfolio", "selftext": "I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.\n\nLet's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.\n\nAWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.\n\nAdvertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.\n\nWarehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.\n\nAmazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here. Amazon has been in the Netherlands since 2014 but they are just now completely blowing the competitor out of the water. Since one year me and many others are only using Amazon and now we are seeing ads to subscribe to prime. Subscribing to prime is only valuable if you actually make use of the logistics side of things. But it helps if prime has other things to offer as well. That's where we get to my next point. Prime video is partnering up with lots of famous people here to make Prime content. And the content isn't bad at all. That prime content hasn't even been rolling out for 6 months. Prime is just in its infancy for many countries it has recently moved into. Like I said Amazon is here since 2014 but only now I'm seeing Dutch shows on Amazon prime and having lots of people ask me to share my prime account with them. I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.\n\nAdditionally Amazon International gets even less love. Understandable though it's less revenue and barley sees a positive quarter. But what people forget is that it took Amazon US 10 years to turn profitable. So why do we think that International will be any faster, especially considering there is less infrastructure in countries outside of the US. I'd say we might need to wait 15 years for those countries to start making a profit. So which countries have been operational for longer than 15 years? The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China and Canada. Which countries have been operational for less than 15 years? Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Poland, Egypt and Belgium. We don't only need time for Amazon to build out the infrastructure. The middleclass in many of these countries is still growing which will increase activity in buying. And lastly, we need to give Amazon time to make Amazon prime subscription a valuable subscription in these countries by adding local content to Prime Video.\n\nAmazon infrastructure, like I previously mentioned AWS has 6 times the server capacity compared to the next 12 competitors. Amazon is spending by far the most on renewable energy sources. They spent $2.5 billion on renewable energy, all to power their delivery vans and their servers. Although it may not seem huge but generating their in house electricity is bound to save them billions in the long run. Also Amazon is making their own chips for their AWS servers, they don't depend on a different party to be able to deliver. This in turn also increases their margins.\n\nLastly, Amazon is not sitting still. They have Amazon Gaming, Project Kuiper which has 3.000 satellites in orbit, they are making a plan to revolutionize the healthcare system and make it more cost and time efficient. They say in their call that they are still investing money to look for the next big pillar of Amazon, something that will be as big as AWS, advertising or Prime. They're not sitting still.\n\nOkay story wise, I might have convinced you by now. But you could say, this is all a bunch of promising words. What about their valuation? Due to the fact Amazon invests a lot of their cash flow Amazon has usually been valued based on their price to operating cash flow. If we take the current after market price of Amazon of $169. Their current price to operating cash flow is at 20.6. This is 15% lower than what it was 2 days ago and this is 35% lower compared to their historical median price to operating cash flow of 27. Now this doesn't per se have to mean they will ever get back to that median price to operating cash flow so lets look at some different valuation methods. Remember Paypal was attractive to many people because it was \"only at a PE of 30\" instead of the usual 60. So lets keep on looking.\n\nIn Q4 of 2023 alone Amazon produced $30 billion free cash flow. Now Q4 is always a record quarter so we can't multiply this by 4. Q3 of 2023 Amazon had a free cash flow of $10 billion. This was still a quarter where many of their cost saving initiatives hadn't yet fully come to fruition, so although it was a much better quarter than Q2 which generated 6 billion in free cash flow. I'm very certain that Q3 free cash flow will be more in line with upcoming quarter. If we multiply 10 billion by 3 and 30 billion once. That's a free cash flow of 60 billion. This would be their free cash flow in 2024 if they don't grow, don't further increase margins and don't continue to lessen their investing of cash flow. If we take a quite reasonable (in my opinion) price to free cash flow of 30 times we see that Amazon stock should be valued at 1800 billion market cap. That's pretty much where the marketcap is at right now. Although I'm a firm believer that Amazon will grow in 2024. Let's not forget they are giving all their prime members ads from now on, or the ability to pay more for no ads. This alone will generate around 2 billion free cash flow in my estimation. Other than that I'm expecting Amazon to grow it's already existing revenue streams further, increase its margin further and decrease CAPEX. Which should result in record free cash flow in 2024. I'm estimating 12 billion in Q1, 13 billion in Q2, 15 billion in Q3 and 38 billion in Q4. Now I would love to tell you that these estimations are highly calculated by me and a pack of mathematicians. But I'll have to disappoint you and say that it's not. I've been doing estimates on Amazon every quarter based on the trends I see in the numbers and the story I pair with it. I have been quite spot on with the numbers so far. If my estimation would be reasonably close it would mean a market cap of 2.340 trillion, an increase of 34% at a price to free cash flow of 30 or an increase to a market cap of 2.730, an increase of 57% at a price to free cash flow of 35. Do note Microsoft is valued at 40 times price to free cash flow. And although I think Amazon and Microsoft should be valued similarly I find it hard to justify a price to free cash flow of 40 or more if you're not growing cash flow above 20% YoY.\n\nWe could also disassemble the components of Amazon and value these components with the price to sales of a company that offers similar services. To some people this might be a bit more hocus-pocus but I like doing this to see where Amazon stands in the market compared to other stocks. I'm using price to sales in this example because sadly we do not know the operating income on Amazon advertising and on Amazon Prime.\n\nAWS had a total sales in FY 2023 of $90 billion. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Microsoft of 13 times. Resulting in AWS having a marketcap of $1,170 billion.\n\nAmazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.\n\nNext up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.\n\nLastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.\n\nIf we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices. And this is based on historic number, not forward looking. Similarly when using the price to operating cash flow Amazon had two days ago of 23 we see that Amazon's stock is valued at a 15% cheaper price now than just two days ago. Supporting the argument that Amazon is more less 15% undervalued based on current prices, not forward looking expectations. This is why I moved my Google position into Amazon. As Google is looking undervalued by 15% on forward looking prices, but Amazon is looking undervalued by the same amount based on historic prices. Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.\n\nTLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers. Forward looking though, I expect Amazon to be more less undervalued by around 30% - 50% based on end of on end of FY 2024 numbers. This is based on how well they execute increasing their margins, decreasing CAPEX and continuing their business trends growth wise.", "id": "1ah1ift", "created_utc": 1706873146.0, "score": 239, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 228, "comments": [{"body": "People who think that companies will \"just switch\" from AWS to Azure don't understand what they're talking about.

In the 1930s, they took up the size of a room and were (as far as I'm aware) completely focused on mathematical computation. In the '60s they were still unwieldy but becoming much more common; businesses were getting serious about adopting and adapting computing. Then some big updates came, like the microprocessor in the '70s, and you fast-forward to the '90s when computers were found in many homes (at least in the US). Jump another 30 years and now it's estimated that a majority of the entire world population owns a smartphone, and general access to a computer (smartphone or not) is almost ubiquitous.\n\nThis is to draw a comparison - it seems like Math is to the Computer what Gaming is to VR, it's a platform that is expanding on its initial usecase and I personally think we're in the '70s of VR: big strides are being made in technology and proper affordability will come after. More importantly, the way many think of the metaverse today is just applying existing concepts to a whole new modality. The same way that it was a reasonable criticism of the smartphone to say \"well, you can't do any meaningful work on it since it's too small,\" new forms of interaction were developed to address that gap. There are still applications best suited for larger screens + mouse and keyboard while new interaction styles have been created specifically for this relatively new device that anybody can take anywhere.\n\nWe're making steady progress towards what dream immersion in VR would look like, BeyondVR is so much closer to the form factor of glasses than most headsets and Disney's recent HoloTile debut shows natural(-ish) walking in place. And while it's a bit dystopian / Ready Player One, I see this progressing in the direction of social media - a new format for existing interactions. As tech/immersion improves, a mature ecosystem would mean you could do all the stuff you normally do: go for a hike, grab a beer (BYOB), go dancing, etc. (and who knows what the future of haptics holds) but do all of that stuff in the coolest ways imaginable e.g. grab coffee floating on a cloud looking over the Himalayas.\n\nTo your point on Reddit: each subreddit could be like a never-ending conference (but more fun) where each thread is a discussion room filled with people all interested in the same things you are, and you have live group conversations where you're seeing actual faces (or avatars or whatever).

Board members are elected by shareholder vote, meaning founders have the most power to get board members elected. Board members have the power to oust CEOs. Naturally, founder-CEOS place their allies on the board so they can maintain control of their company. No founder is going to put strangers on the board for the sake of independence and risk getting kicked out of their own company.\n\nCompanies with dual class shares, e.g. Zuck at Meta, have an even bigger problem with board independence because founders like Zuck can single-handedly elect whoever they want to the board with no opposition because he has >50% voting power.\n\nMeta's board is all hand-picked by Zuckerberg and has members such as:\n\n* Sheryl Sandberg, Zuck's former right-hand woman and COO at Meta\n* Peggy Alford, CFO of Zuck's charity\n* Marc Andreessen, Zuck's VC partner for Meta since its start-up days\n* Andrew Houston, CEO of Dropbox and well-known friend of Zuck\n\n[Alford, Andreessen, and Houston are all on the Compensation Committee at Meta.](https://investor.fb.com/leadership-and-governance/compensation-and-governance-committee-charter/default.aspx)\n\nIn addition, [Techcrunch details how shareholders have tried to oust Zuck several times but couldn't because the board, which is filled with Zuck's friends, protected him.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/drew-houston-facebook-board/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADzdmIu45rQibjWQb08wpHli28Ey31hueVtMsrpRZcxptueipumJ4vCruNZlxP8dnHApFrU8t200XR0skTvh5lBhCqK6Zqr2S13d0v6NMorhojFUuVz382e8jTsKceGOS9UwPhthRhdY4eiJM7MYDqSZXonUP0cAkNO-sf_1AvpI)\n\n2)\n\nWilliam Savitt, has played a leading role in high-stakes corporate governance and merger-and-acquisitions litigation in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the same court and judge as Elon's compensation ruling) and in courts around the country.

The court considered both his 21% percent stake, and his ‚Äúability to exercise outsized influence in the board room‚Äù due to his close personal ties to the directors and his ‚Äúsuperstar CEO‚Äù status.  She recounted the process by which the pay package was set, noting in particular that Musk proposed it, Musk controlled the timelines of the board‚Äôs deliberation, and he received almost no pushback ‚Äì board members and Tesla‚Äôs general counsel seemed to view themselves as participating in a cooperative process to set Musk‚Äôs pay, rather than an adversarial one.\n\nWhat about the stockholder vote?  That, too, was tainted, because ‚Äì McCormick concluded ‚Äì the proxy statement delivered to shareholders contained material misrepresentations and omissions.  It described Tesla‚Äôs compensation committee as independent when in fact the members had close personal ties to Musk, and it did not accurately describe the manner in which his pay package was set ‚Äì again, with Musk himself proposing it and the board largely acquiescing.

I have been unable to find an accompanying opinion.\n\nSince the first lawsuit is the only one with final opinions, that'll be what I talk about from here on out.\n\nSkipping past a bunch of stuff not related to board independence, in that lawsuit, the judge states that of the nine members of the Board of Directors, he assumes that Zuckerberg, Andreesen, and Sandberg were not independent. Of the remaining directors:\n\n- Zients: the plaintiff basically didn't argue that they were not independent\n- Chenault: No facts pled that undermine independence\n- Hastings: The pled facts are insufficient to support a finding of a lack of independence or a finding that Hastings faces a substantial likelihood of liability\n- Thiel: Similar finding as for Hastings\n- Bowles: Similar finding as for Hastings\n- Desmond-Hellman: questionable as to whether she is independent of Zuckerberg, but because 5/9 board members were not shown to lack independence there is no need to analyze further\n\nThe Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed this analysis. The plaintiffs apparently conceded on appeal that Zients and Chenault were independent, while defendants did not argue that Zuckergerg, Andreesen, or Sandberg could be independent. Of the remaining directors, the plaintiffs conceded on appeal that none of them had a personal interest in the reclassification or faced a substantial likelihood of liability, which left the question of whether they were independent of Zuckerberg. The Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Chancery that the pled facts were insufficient to support finding that Hastings, Thiel, or Bowles lacked independence from Zuckerberg.\n\nBecause a majority of the board was found to be independent of Zuckerberg for this transaction, the lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nSo while someone did sue, at least at a first glance it's not obvious to me that the courts failed to enforce the law.

Andreessen owns \\~20M in Meta stock.\n\nEither way, it's undeniable that Andreessen is not independent.

The lawsuit claims the directors are not independent from making decisions *that are beneficial to the company but harmful to shareholders' non-company holdings*. I think it's not unreasonable to claim that that is probably not a standard definition of independence, since the plaintiffs are not claiming that the Board isn't acting in the company's best interests.

That rule appears to be talking about consultants/advisors/etc. to the compensation committee, not the compensation committee itself. In addition, the rule doesn't seem to say that owning too much stock is bad; it states that stock ownership should be considered, no more, no less.

Andreessen already fails (B), but the lawsuit contends with (A) Source of Compensation. Board members are compensated with [annual equity grants ranging from 300-375k/year](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680123000050/meta-20230414.htm#id8aff64984c64035b3e93501af472b14_40). Chump change for some, but not necessarily for all board members. This is a common practice among all corporations. Stock-based comp is always going to cause issues with independence.\n\nI would also argue that a board director who owns a significant amount of the company's stock would be compensated by rises in the stock. [A substantial equity ownership is likely to impair a director's ability to act independently.](https://www.loeb.com/en/insights/publications/2009/06/the-case-against-stock-ownership-requirements-fo__) Tbf 20M of Meta stock is probably not \"substantial\" to Andreessen because he's a billionaire.

The issue is that the existence of the rule itself is questionable.\n\n>shouldn't owning stock make directors more aligned with the company, since they would theoretically be motivated to take actions that would benefit shareholders, including them?\n\nYes, but that still makes you non-independent per the rule above. \n\n>In addition, we need to ask whether the legal system can enforce those laws without initial third-party action.\n\n[That is what the SEC is for.](https://www.sec.gov/page/litigation)\n\n>whether a non-independent Compensation Committee is relevant for those lawsuits...he sued for breach of fiduciary duty\n\nThis breach was a result of the lack of disclosure of non-independent directors on the Compensation Committee.

Regardless of how the law can be enforced, it has to be enforced. Negligence of law enforcement is also a crime.\n2.

As I read it, the entirety of 240.10C-1 imposes requirements on *stock exchanges/associations*, not companies themselves.

In principle, you get a similar effect, but there can be differences in enforcement. A bar that does not institute such a rule would run afoul of the first law, while the second one would mean a person under 21 who enters a bar would be prosecuted. I'm not sure who would be prosecuted if the bar instituted a rule following the first law, but a person under 21 entered anyways, whether through deception, negligence, or something else.\n\nThis reading appears to be supported by the SEC. From [document describing the final rule that was adopted](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2012/33-9330.pdf) (emphasis added):\n\n> Section 10C requires the Commission to adopt rules directing the **national securities exchanges and national securities associations** to prohibit the listing of any equity security of an issuer that is not in compliance with Section 10C‚Äôs compensation committee and compensation adviser requirements\n\nIn addition, the SEC decided that each exchange can make its own determination as to what constitutes independence as long as it meets the minimum legal requirements.\n\nAs an example, the Nasdaq (where TSLA and META are listed, I think?) corporate governance requirements can be found [here](https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules/nasdaq-5600-series). Nasdaq appears to require compensation committees to be entirely made up of at least two Independent Directors (with a possible exception), where an Independent Director is:\n\n> a person other than an Executive Officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the Company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.\n\nThat feels... kind of broad? I'm not really sure how and where one would go about disputing this determination as well. [It appears there's a process for Nasdaq to enforce its rules](https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules/Nasdaq%205800%20Series), but it's not immediately clear whether there's a mechanism for a third party, private or public, to either start the process or enforce the rules separately.\n\n> A substantial equity ownership is likely to impair a director's ability to act independently.\n\nThis was an interesting article to read. Thanks for linking it! It brought up some edge cases I hadn't considered.\n\nThat being said, I still don't think there's a rule that automatically makes a director non-independent if they own stock. For example, the Nasdaq rules state \"Because Nasdaq does not believe that ownership of Company stock by itself would preclude a board finding of independence, it is not included in the aforementioned objective factors.\" At least according to Nasdaq, there would need to be something else in addition to stock ownership that would prevent a finding of independence.\n\n> That is what the SEC is for.\n\nI admittedly didn't think of the SEC when I originally replied, but that's because I was thinking about *Delaware's* laws since it seems the type of lawsuit involving the Delaware courts generally (always?) invoke Delaware's laws rather than federal laws. I don't think the SEC has jurisdiction over state laws, and I'm not sure it can enforce exchanges' rules for them either.\n\n> This breach was a result of the lack of disclosure of non-independent directors on the Compensation Committee. This issue with independence is detailed thoroughly in the Post-Trial Opinion.\n\nYes, I generally agree. But they key here is that the *breach itself* is the illegal act; the lack of independence is evidence towards supporting that a breach occurred, but is not in and of itself illegal. For example, if the board had fully disclosed the Compensation Committee/Board's potential/actual conflicts of interest and all details on the negotiation to the shareholders before the vote, and if Tornetta had failed to show the compensation plan was unfair, then the decision would have been that there was no breach of fiduciary duty *even though* the board was not independent, and so Musk would have kept his compensation.\n\n> That is is a violation. I think we agree on that.\n\nI think it's reasonable to consider Andreessen's presence on the compensation committee suspicious at the very least. No idea about Houston or other corporations, since I haven't read as much on them.\n\n> Do you agree the fault should lie with the law enforcement when the law hasn't been enforced or does it still lie with Tesla in this case?\n\nI'm not sure if there's any fault for law enforcement because as I described above I'm not sure what they *can* enforce, especially with respect to the types of claims here.\n\nBased on the decision I think it's reasonable to think that Tesla and/or Musk screwed up.\n\n> Regardless of how the law can be enforced, it has to be enforced. Negligence of law enforcement is also a crime.\n\nThese are two related but distinct statements. The first statement is generally incorrect given the long-standing (albeit controversial) existence of prosecutorial discretion. The second feels too general; I'd like to see specific citations before agreeing/disagreeing.\n\n> If your answer is Tesla above, then if the SEC/legal system failed to take action against other corporations going forward to enforce the law based on this precedent, wouldn't that be considered an unfair discriminate application of the law?\n\nI don't think that's necessarily the case. At least to me, unfair/discriminatory application of the law is usually associated with the government putting its thumb on the scale, e.g., by choosing what cases to bring/dismiss. This is because the government as an entity is (supposedly) required to be fair, but in this kind of case it's third parties that are taking action and there's no general legal requirement that arbitrary third parties act fair when suing or for the government to try to \"balance the scales\", so to speak.\n\nSo even if you assume everyone is breaking the law, the government not bringing cases against anyone is arguably \"fair\" - everyone is breaking the law, but the government is treating everyone equally by not taking action. On the other hand, you, me, and a bajillion other people can pull a ticker out of a hat and (assuming for the sake of example that we all win) sue that entity into oblivion; it's not fair, but it's perfectly legal (and questionably moral, the best kind of perfectly legal!).

When a company takes on more and more shareholders and especially if they go public the company, the board are held to higher standards. Auditing, disclosures fiduciary duty etc. The contract of capitalism, people can bankroll your idea and make you succeed and in order for this to work some set of rules have to apply, rules forged over a century through trial and error.

His last posting at Tesla was in Austin, Texas.  Much of the interview focuses on Tesla AI history, particularly Andrej Karpathy's tenure as director of AI vision, and the transition of the software stack from hard-coded to trained.\n\nThe opinions and observations I think most relevant to TSLA shareholders:\n\n* Tesla's AI efforts are impossible to value today, because they don't produce quantifiable economic benefit.  His guess is that Tesla might 10x its value from 600 Billion to 6 Trillion, with a time horizon of 10-20 years.  \n* He compares Tesla's \"startup\" culture to competitors like Alphabet/Waymo.  Tesla has a few hundred engineers working on AI and FSD software, while the AI groups in more established companies have thousands of engineers.  However, the Tesla people worth ruthless hours and often skip vacation.  Turnover is high.  New employees typically last 1-2 years before moving on.  \n* He has observed Elon Musk being angry and berating the AI software team for not accomplishing more.  However, he observes that Mr. Musk pushes people to accomplish things they might not have thought possible. \n* He states that he is an Elon Musk fan and says he would sell his TSLA stock if Musk left the company.  Context: he isn't financially independent, nor are most of the workers he knew at Tesla.  \n* The volatility in TSLA valuation over the past 2 years did have significant negative effects on some of his co-workers.  The co-workers received stock grants.  These are treated the same as cash income and the earner needs to pay income tax on the valuation of that stock.  Typically, a worker would sell some of that stock to pay the taxes.  However, many of the co-workers back in 2021 and early 2022 didn't want to sell any portion of their TSLA grants, even to pay taxes, because they were very positive about the direction of the company.  So to cover taxes, coworkers took out margin loans against their TSLA shares.
