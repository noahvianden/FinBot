{"title": "Two Big Differences Between AMD & NVDA", "selftext": "I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach.\n\nObviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. \n\nThe first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. \n\nSpeaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. \n\nI've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President.", "id": "1afxwfr", "created_utc": 1706748347.0, "score": 217, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 364, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty stupid when NVDA ceo is paid mostly in stock options which is worth hundreds of millions.\n\nEDIT: ok looked it, his salary is 95% from bonuses and stock options.

Amazon already does with Graviton. And there are manufacturers like Ampere who have been doing it for awhile. There is no differentiation there.

The industry standard was about 5 years from a brand new architecture to silicon and that was years ago.

Nvidia is also saying they are using AI to help them optimize and make the design cycle shorter. \n\nOf anything worth considering as a moat I would not consider CPU design to be one. You just have to be close but customers aren’t buying solely based on a few percentage points on raw performance. They are also looking at total lifecycle cost. Sometimes like what nvidia is doing bundling a CPU with their GPUs as a ready to go solution might make more sense depending on the customer. \n\nAnd you are considering performance now to last gen stuff.

This is compared to 3.35 T/s of H100. mi300x is a much more powerful solution.

They are 5x AMD’s size and they can afford it if they see there is a market for it. There is also no best CPU per se. Intel still wins single threaded but AMD still sells because they are more efficient and pack more cores. So this shows you don’t need to make a cpu that is the “best” since customers want different solutions based on the problems they want to solve. \n\nAnd I say this as a AMD shareholder.

Nvidia was the only company that cared and are seeing dividends from this today. This field has been my life and I cannot state enough how frustrating parallel computing has been for the last decade. \n\nThere was really no market for it. Apple doesn't make datacenter products, and when this stuff was starting to take off, AMD was struggling financially, and they concentrated on saving the company by concentrating on CPUs. AMD was actually pretty strong in GPGPU early on, but they had to scale back their R&D. \n\nEven today AMD would have been woefully behind if the new leadership didn't with great foresight bid on the government contracts for Frontier and El Capitan.

Think in mid-term we will probably see like a 40%:60% training inference split.\n\nAnd yes you can replace some compute heavy CPU scientific workloads and move them to GPU. But a lot of software still runs best on CPUs. There is a bit of a gold rush for GPUs since the LLM breakthrough, so right now everyone is trying to get GPUs for training.

Where each GPU node can be directed on how to route communications by some central switch or algorithm. \n\nThis is basically what Broadcom announced. Their Ethernet based switches will be able to link remote AMD GPUs to talk point to point over Infinity Fabric.\n\n> That's what made Nvidias gamble so crazy too.. there was no market for it, until there was. And amd GPGPU was dog shit at the time, I used it. Or tried to rather, half the instructions didn't work and performance was well below theoretical perf. Ended up on GTX 980s because it was so much easier, and in those days it was still a pain to get CUDA going on Linux (fortunately they fixed this about 7 years ago).\n\nNvidia was smart here, I have to give them credit. They funded the universities, and this generated enough demand to fund this part of the business. And it grew from there.\n\nMeanwhile AMD was busy scrambling to save the company by investing in the CPU business by cutting GPU research. AMD too did the right thing, because they knew Intel was vulnerable, and this did save the company. They also invested in the chiplet research, which lifts all boats, including datacenter GPUs.\n\n> no one knows how this will play out- people have been saying this for a long time now. There hasn't been signs of model development slowing down. I think what's more likely is we see a move away from transformers and into something less memory hungry. 6 years ago it was kind of crazy to think a model needed even 40GB of memory.\n\nYes there is Mamba for instance, which is supposed to be a bit more memory efficient, but the jury is still out whether it is better than Transformers.\n\nHowever I do think existing models are good enough for wider adoption. There will no doubt continue to evolve, but there is a huge rush to implement this technology. Companies won't just burn cash by training, they need to generate revenues.

Currently Nvidia has many more years of software development and support for their Hardware. However since AMD has open source software I'm betting that there will be more adoption if their Hardware is good and cheaper than NVIDIA. \nThe biggest limiting factor going forward is the power a chip can consume. Thermals become an issue as well as generally just powering the chips. Alot of the performance of a chip for a given size of silicon comes down to the density of the logic and SRAM transistors.\nSmaller transistors allow for greater efficiencies since they require less voltage to operate when compared to larger ones and they also allow for less parasitic when switching. Remember that capacitance is directly correlated to area, so a smaller capacitor has less capacitance. Capacitance limits the switching frequency of the IC and is a partial reason for the energy usage of an IC. \nThis is why intel isn’t competitive in terms of power when compared to AMD cpus. In gamers nexus’s review the 14900k draws about twice the power as the 7950x while providing a similar performance. Intel’s 10nm node is showing its age and so they physically cannot improve their designs without either shrinking the node or increasing the die size. Currently the The 14900k has a die size of 257 mm² and a zen 4 ccd has a die size of 70mm2. While not directly a fair comparison (since im ignoring the io die) AMD is able to provide the same performance as the intel cpu while using half the power and almost half the die area due to the process node advantage. \nWhy does this matter? Transistor scaling is slowing down significantly since we are reaching the limits of nature. If we look at the process node densities for nvidas gpus we can see that ampere had 44.56 million transistors per mm2 on Samsung 8, and 143.7 million transistors per mm2 on tsmc 4. However tsmc 3 only has a density of 173.1 million transistors per mm2. Furthermore SRAM, which is a significant portion of logic circuits on a CPU/GPU, is slowing down significantly. Tsmcs n3 node only provides 5% downwards scaling on SRAM when compared to TSMC 5. \nAs transistors slowdown in scaling downwards new packaging technology is required for Moore's law to continue. AMD is the only company who has years of experience designing chips around these packaging technologies and what they have created is incredible for how modular everything is. Smaller dies allow for better yields, they allow for them to use cheaper older nodes for the SRAM cells as seen in the x3d products. This is why hardware wise AMD currently is superior to NVIDIA.

Right now we are at the start of what looks like another bubble valuation. S&P500 valuation is over 26 and 200 day market average is over 56%. It may not be a full blown bubble but its certainly looks inflated right now. So its important to take that into account when looking at some valuations. Obviously, this wont hold unless earnings skyrocket across the board but it make keep climbing a while longer, because thats how bubbles happen.\n\nWingstop is a decent business. They take cheap cuts of chicken and turn them into something fat slobs love. Nothing wrong with that. I get the itch for buffalo sauced wings once per year. Their business is growing rapidly for a restaurant but as you point out, there are many reasons to not invest and I agree.\n\nI havent touched it for a few reasons and I probably never will even though its been on my radar for well over a decade. I dont like that they have no competitive advantages. I dont like that they are fast food but only dine in/take out and no drive through. I dont like franchisees at all. They tend to cut corners all the time and you have to spend tons to police them. Further, once automation goes full steam, you will regret sharing your profits with franchisees. See whats happening to the auto industry. They would give near anything to get rid of all their dealerships but they cant due to contract. When we have robots who can do 99% of the work, these restaurants will regret franchising.\n\nI am also shocked that people are eating so much of this cuisine in terms of health. Its just about worst food anyone can eat, right there with fried chicken and fries. Its horribly unhealthy and add in the ranch and other sauces and I just dont get why people hate their bodies so much (lol).

That may not compare with the $39.18 billion expected by LSEG\n\n\nWall Street will also be looking at these key user numbers:\n\nDaily active users (DAUs): 2.11 billion vs. 2.08 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\n\nMonthly active users (MAUs): 3.07 billion vs. 3.06 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\n\n\nMeta is projected to report revenue growth of 22% as the online advertising market continues to recover from a brutal 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates forced brands to reel in spending.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg attributes advances in artificial intelligence to improvements in the ad business, which is growing faster than rival Google. In Alphabet’s earnings report on Tuesday, the company said Google ad revenue increased 11% from a year earlier, slower expansion than analysts were expecting.\n\nPart of Meta’s financial recovery over the past year was driven by Chinese retailers, which have bolstered spending to reach users across the globe. Meta finance chief Susan Li most recently highlighted the significance of business from China in the company’s third-quarter earnings report in October. Li didn’t name specific companies, but fast-growing upstarts Temu and Shein, which originated in China, have been pouring money into ads on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nWhile Meta has a very diverse base of advertisers, some analysts say the potential for Temu and Shein to pull back spending poses a risk because every point of growth matters for a company that saw revenue shrink for three straight quarters in 2022.\n\nZuckerberg, along with the top executives at TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Snap and Discord, faced tough questioning from lawmakers on Wednesday. They accused the Facebook founder of ignoring the severity of child exploitation on the company’s family of apps.\n\nParents attending the hearing lambasted Meta and other companies for what they allege are insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and, in some cases, even resulted in their deaths.\n\n“I’m sorry for everything you’ve all gone through. It’s terrible,” Zuckerberg told the parents in an emotional scene on Capitol Hill. “No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.” \n\nInvestors will also be looking for signs that Meta’s pivot to the metaverse is bearing fruit. The company has been burning billions of dollars a quarter to build out a virtual world that Zuckerberg has said is the future of computing. In total, the division has lost about $25 billion since the beginning of 2022, shortly after Zuckerberg renamed his company.\n\nAnalysts expect Reality Labs to show revenue of $762.8 million for the quarter and an operating loss of $4.26 billion, according to StreetAccount.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/01/meta-earnings-q4-2024.html", "id": "1aglple", "created_utc": 1706821728.0, "score": 709, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 421, "comments": [{"body": "Also announced:\n\nMeta said it has declared its first dividend, which is pegged at 50 cents.

But putting something in the record that says not this time but maybe next isn't how things work at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Yes, its a fault but is a tiny fault. The judge still have power to make different rulling.\n\nThe Judge disagreed.  The problem is that Tesla didn't disclose the cozy relationship.  In fact, they claimed before the vote (in writing) that the board was independent.  You may not have a problem with that, and that in itself is fine.  But Tesla (nor any public company) is simply not allowed to lie when they make these filings.  If they'd have disclosed it, it wouldn't have been an issue (ok, it would have still been an issue, because directors are supposed to be independent, but it's quite possible the Judge would have said since it was disclosed and they had full knowledge the plan was ok). \n\nThe simple fact here is Tesla lied.  They're not allowed to do that.  They screwed around and found out.  And people are mad that they're not allowed to lie.  You can be mad about it.  That's fine.   You can disagree, that's less fine, but sure.  The screw up here is 100% on Tesla's side.  Don't lie in official filings.  Have independent directors (which you are supposed to already be doing).  \n\nSo you're fine with liars.  That's your choice.  But Courts don't work that way.  In fact, they tend to take a very dim view of people who don't tell the truth.  That's what happened here.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Again, not how the law works.

There are major differences.  For one, criminal courts are usually governed by either laws or sentencing guidelines.  That doesn't really exist for civil courts.  And in this case, it's not even a \"regular\" civil proceeding.  It's a special court (Chancery) which exists to deal with fiduciary matters in regards to corporations, and trusts, and other such entities that are under it's jurisdiction.  \n\nSo there isn't punishment here (though I'm sure you think that's what they did).  This really was a dispute between two parties, and the court sided with one of the parties and then agreed to a proposed remedy.  You're correct in that they can submit a different remedy, but I'll explain in another paragraph why they chose this one (hint:  it's because of the lying!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>fine they can consider the laws but they still have the discretion and power on how to interpret the law and what the punishment is.\n\nWhich is exactly what the court did.  It looked at what each party had to say, then the law (briefs submitted).  And then it ruled.  Again, this is a civil (Chancery) court, there are no punishments just decisions and remedies.  \n\nThe problem being here is Tesla majorly screwed up.  While there is a lot in the decision it really boils down to two things:\n\n1.  As mentioned, Tesla submitted (in writing) that their directors were independent when they weren't.  \n2. The compensation committee didn't negotiate with Musk.  The board is supposed to represent all shareholders, not Musk.  In practice, this isn't hard to do and the bar is low to show negotiation (I think there have been two other shareholder suits like this about compensation in the history of the Delaware Chancery Court, and both failed, because the board was able to show this).  But Tesla couldn't produce any evidence that they even tried to negotiate.  So the board couldn't show it was even attempting to work on behalf of shareholders, which is their literal reason for being board members.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Lying is bad but the situation and context also matter\n\nThe context here is that they lied in public filings.  You  can't do that as a public company.  Those disclosures simply have to be accurate.  If they're not, either by ignorance or intention, it's a form of fraud, plain and simple.  The public who invests in these companies is supposed to be able to rely on the disclosures when making investment decisions.   If they're false they can't do that.\n\nAnd you can't also say well I or lots of other investors don't rely on those disclosures at all, and we knew all of this already.  That's immaterial because not all investors do that, and even if it's a small number (even 1 share) it's invalid, because the company can't lie.\n\nThe other context is that the board members and Tesla simply new better.  These aren't unsophisticated people.   This was an easy thing to get right, and they didn't.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> In this case it doesn't warrant the current punishment.\n\nSo, again, this isn't a punishment.  It's a ruling for one party in a civil suit vs another party in a civil suit.  That context is important.  \n\nFor one, this is simply what civil courts do.  They rule in disputes between parties and grant remedies (also known as relief).  Here the dispute centered around the amount of compensation, and the manner which that amount was arrived at.\n\nCivil courts can rule in a variety of ways.  Often in civil litigation you can have claims and counter-claims between parties (and the Judge may rule for one party in certain claims, and other party for certain counter-claims) so that you can have judgements on both sides.  Here that wasn't the case, there was only one set of claims.  But you're right that the Judge has discretion here, but it's based on the factual rulings, not a whim.\n\nNormally, for example, if you claim no \"harm\" was done the counter-party will file that the remedy that is sought is out-of-bounds, or not administrable by the court, etc.  That's  done at the beginning of the case, and if the court deems the relief sought is not administrable for whatever reason, the whole case gets thrown out.  You don't generally have a case proceed if the Judge thinks that what is being sought.  Clearly didn't happen here. \n\nWhy that happened is multi-faceted.  The simple fact is that Tesla made this bed.  The claimants met their burden of proof and the Judge ruled in their favor.  Tesla didn't do what it was supposed to do in terms of Musk's compensation.  In fact, they didn't even pay lip service to what they were supposed to do.  They didn't even make a poor attempt, they made no attempt.  And then they lied.  The relief for that is rather simple, from the court's perspective.  Since you didn't do what you were supposed to, the thing that you did is null and void.   And that's a common concept in law.  If you do something wrong you don't get to \"profit\" from it.  The correct thing to do, according to the law, is to nullify what you did.\n\nAnd that's what the Judge did, since they didn't follow the rules in deciding on compensation, that compensation is null and void.  The analogue here is contract law (also a civil matter) - if you provide false information in a contract, and get sued, the contract will get nullified.\n\nSo when you say the punishment isn't warranted, it is, according to law.  The Judge did actually what you do when there is fraud, you nullify.  \n\nNow the other arguments you see on this are that look, Musk made investors a pile of money.  It shouldn't matter.  But courts generally aren't allowed to look at things that way.  They can't look at the result, only if what the claimant here said is true (which the court did).  The result of that is usually irrelevant.  So saying Musk made us a lot of money, who cares.  The law does.  And so does the Delaware Chancery Court.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">You're conflating criminal courts with civil courts (traffic court is usually a criminal court). \n\nIts just analogy/example, the point is the judge have the power and allowed to make different ruling \n\n>For one, criminal courts are usually governed by either laws or sentencing guidelines.

Bearish.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Here is what ChatGPT has to say about incorporating Texas vs Delaware.  \n\n\nIn the United States, Delaware and Texas are popular choices for incorporating businesses, and each state has its own set of advantages. The decision on where to incorporate depends on various factors, including your company's size, industry, and future plans. Here are some key points to consider for incorporating in Delaware or Texas:\n\n**Incorporating in Delaware:**\n\n1. **Business-Friendly Legal Environment:** Delaware is known for its business-friendly legal environment, with a well-established body of corporate law. The state has a separate court, the Delaware Court of Chancery, that specializes in corporate matters, providing consistency and predictability in legal decisions.\n2. **Flexibility in Corporate Structure:** Delaware offers flexibility in corporate structure and governance, allowing companies to tailor their bylaws to meet specific needs. This flexibility is appealing to investors and corporate leaders.\n3. **Tax Advantages:** Delaware offers tax advantages for businesses, including no state corporate income tax for companies that operate outside of the state. Additionally, there is no sales tax in Delaware.\n4. **Privacy:** Delaware allows companies to keep certain information, such as the names of officers and directors, confidential in their formation documents.\n5. **Access to Courts and Expertise:** Delaware's Court of Chancery is highly regarded for its expertise in corporate law matters. Companies often prefer the predictability and efficiency of this court in handling corporate disputes.\n\n**Incorporating in Texas:**\n\n1. **Economic Growth:** Texas has a strong and diverse economy, making it an attractive location for businesses. The state's economic growth, large consumer market, and access to skilled labor are significant advantages.\n2. **Lower Initial Costs:** Incorporating in Texas may involve lower initial costs compared to Delaware. The ongoing compliance costs are also generally lower in Texas.\n3. **Proximity to Talent:** Texas has a large and growing pool of skilled workers, and many businesses choose to incorporate there to tap into this talent pool. Major cities like Austin, Dallas, and Houston are technology and business hubs.\n4. **No State Income Tax:** Texas does not impose a state income tax on corporations, which can be advantageous for companies operating in the state.\n5. **Strategic Location:** If your business operations are primarily in the southern or central United States, incorporating in Texas may be strategically advantageous due to its central location.\n\nIn summary, Delaware is often chosen for its established legal system, corporate-friendly laws, and reputation, while Texas is chosen for its economic growth, lower initial costs, and access to talent. The decision should align with your company's specific needs, industry, and long-term goals. Consulting with legal and financial professionals can help you make an informed decision based on your unique circumstances.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Economic growth and access to talent are irrelevant if you're incorporating out of state.\n\nAlso relevant is that Delaware's back office processes are falling behind on efficiency, compared to other states (which also may be irrelevant to Tesla, but it's still true).

Pet care industry: Americans who can't afford to have kids will fill the need to nurture a living thing by having more pets. They will treat their pets better and therefore spend more money on them, causing growth in this sector.\n2. Video games/VR: Americans can no longer afford to live in the real world so they give it up to live more of their lives in VR. Gaming companies will benefit.\n3. Pharmaceuticals: Americans will continue to be more depressed because of the death of the American Dream and will need drugs to make them feel better.\n4. Property management companies: The rich and businesses will own all the housing.

In your scenario, you are hedging upwards move by selling puts. The problem is that options are higher leverage than shorting (x100 shares) so if you win the short bet, but the stock drops fast, you can lose money selling puts if it falls enough (acceleration on put x100 shares > say 50 share short). So you'd want to be short in lots of 100 shares to counter 1 put option. It gets very advanced and if you were to be a professional you need to understand the greeks and risks. \n\n>does a naked put also include when you have no short in a stock and hold no shares in a stock?\n\n[No](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedput.asp)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Not a bad idea to buy puts when the price spikes at the open", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Didn’t see at first what is your total position.
