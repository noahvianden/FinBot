{"title": "Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company", "selftext": "Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.\n\nNvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.\n\nThe symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.\n\nNvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.\n\nGoogle was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.\n\nNvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/14/nvidia-passes-alphabet-market-cap-now-third-most-valuable-us-firm.html", "id": "1ar26eu", "created_utc": 1707956054.0, "score": 2709, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 499, "comments": [{"body": "That’s crazy.", "score": 1082, "replies": [{"body": "Sometimes, I feel like the market is at hogwarts.

In 2020 we had the pandemic, and we had furlough where half the country watched Netflix while receiving 80% of their salary from the government. To pay for that and other measures in response to COVID, the government printed a lot of money. Besides furlough they also gave tax breaks to companies and things like that. When the government prints a lot of money it makes the economy run faster. The economy is like a car that you want to drive in a straight line but it always ends up heading more towards one of two directions: boom or bust (this is called the business cycle). You probably remember the inflationary panic last year and all the headlines about how companies had hired too many people and there was record low unemployment. When the government prints money it turns the car towards \"boom\". When it happens too fast this is bad because prices get too high, people see their purchasing power dropping and they spend even more (which makes it worse) and businesses compete for staff by raising salaries (which also makes it worse). Central banks have the responsibility for controlling inflation and the way they do it is by setting interest rates which slows the economy down by discouraging borrowing and spending, and encouraging saving. This turns the car towards the bust direction. The thing is that driving an economy is a lot harder than driving a car, so what tends to happen is they turn too hard in one direction or the other. So they turned too sharply towards bust and now we're in a recession. It's not that bad (as far as we know) as they can probably just turn the other way a bit (print more money or cut rates) and we'll be in the middle again. Your comment about other countries' recessions was inaccurate, we're just late to the party. Germany recessed last year. Japan is different as they never actually had high inflation but their purchasing power is evaporating anyway due to their weak currency snd stagnant economy (been that way for 30 years). The US is also different as, being the reserve currency they have monetary policy tools that we don't, but it's not a foregone conclusion that the US won't recess as a result of their rate hikes.

The company also reported fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nShares were initially up as much as 16% after hours but then gave back much of the gains.\n\nHere’s how the company did, compared with the consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: Loss of 7 cents per share, vs. loss of 11 cents per share expected\n\nRevenue: $1.04 billion vs. $1.02 billion expected\n\nToast’s revenue increased almost 35% year over year during the quarter, according to a statement. Its net loss of $36 million narrowed from $99 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has committed $250 million for share buybacks.\n\nThe pandemic lead many restaurants to adopt Toast’s tools for mobile ordering and payments, which helped double the company’s revenue. Shares debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021, in the midst of that uptick. Demand has cooled since then, down from 37% in the third quarter and about 45% in the second quarter.\n\nToast faces increasing competition from the likes of Block, Fiserv and Shift4, Bank of America analysts wrote in a December note as they reduced their rating on the stock from buy to neutral.\n\nDespite the competition, transactions using Toast products continue to grow. Gross payment volume, at $33.70 billion, was up 32%, higher than the $33.53 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.\n\nToast’s new job cuts should result in $45 million to $55 million in charges, mostly in the first quarter, and $100 million in annualized savings.\n\nThose cuts come weeks after Aman Narang, Toast’s co-founder and COO, replaced Chris Comparato as CEO. Under Comparato’s leadership last summer, Toast started charging a fee of 99 cents for each online order that totaled more than $10. Consumers and restaurant owners objected, prompting the company to eliminate the surcharge.\n\nNarang said on a conference call with analysts that management aims to report operating profit in the first half of 2025.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/15/toast-will-reduce-workforce-by-10percent-as-growth-slows.html", "id": "1arttut", "created_utc": 1708040109.0, "score": 690, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 197, "comments": [{"body": "CEO is presented with a screen that asks: how many will be layed off? 8%,  10% or 12%. 10% is the default", "score": 748, "replies": [{"body": "At the bottom it says 'How about you show your love for shareholders and pick 25%?'", "score": 90, "replies": []}, {"body": "*accidentally hits 12%*\n\nShit, oh well", "score": 129, "replies": [{"body": "Lyft move", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "It would've been 100% if they made a Lyft typo ", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Exceeds expectations!", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "HR: “The screen is going to ask you a few question”", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is great.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "and then afterwards asks if he wants to donate to $ to Toast and he says sure lets do a 250 million dollar buyback.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Does it do it before or after he knows what he's getting for his money?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "How could this company possibly have that many employees ", "score": 381, "replies": [{"body": "By boosting tip guilt across America", "score": 298, "replies": [{"body": "I never tip all this new crap.

Places like banks employ service reps but 99 times out of 100 the service is automated and you don't need to call your bank. I think I have a few theories:\n\n1) The NWTCs paid way too much for service reps (this includes overhead) because the VC money was flowing freely and as long as the growth metrics were there they could spend the money. If my engineering firm gave everyone a 100% raise then they wouldn't be profitable. \n\n2) The software produced is really bad but offered for cheap.

The amount of calories you have to cut out is highly dependent on the person, their lifestyle, and many other factors. But the general goal is to lose anywhere from 0.25-1lb per week while maintaining the same muscle mass. This is achieved by eating a high protein diet and cutting calories from fats and carbs. So while veggies and cardio is great for losing fat, it’s not great for maintaining your muscle.

This is why it’s always recommended to do both strength and cardio instead of focusing only on one because the sum of the parts can lead to a better weight loss experience than either can on their own.\n\nCardio can help feed your muscles better as it trains your heart and will make most exercise easier but it shouldn’t be alone if you want the best experience. \n\nPlus more muscle can reduce the chance of injury, especially when you get older.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "saving this thread for later reference - thanks dude :)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Word, been on mediterranean diet for a few months, down 20 lbs with that and cutting soda.

Maybe because of other market forces with prices already being high and shortages I could see but I just can't comprehend how they would be opposites like this long term? At the same time most stock recessions happen after rate cuts start, like I already said, so maybe this is the case but I really don't understand it if the government spending outside of it's debt paid through treasuries/bonds stays the same when it's a smaller percentage than what gets hurt by higher rates.\n\n Of course if stimulate spending is increased with rate increases they will cancel each other out, same with if spending is lowered during cuts, it would hurt the economy more on the way down in the short term...So what am I missing? too much to explain in a reddit comment?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": ">One thing is for sure: rates and stock return can't go up hand in hand\n\nUhhh....so what is happening all around us then???", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes sure, but it creates fundamental for future earning.

{"title": "$NVDA to $1500 via Gains, Trains, and AI-mobiles.", "selftext": "***Degenerates and regards,***\n\nIf you think its too late, its not. Everyone wants to see the stock plummet so their logical, \"Its too high, overvalued, definitely going down\" thought process can be validated. I can promise you one thing, nothing about this will ever make sense and everyone will reference this post 3 months from now. Bulls want hopium, Bears need copium, and Wall street bets is Dopium.\n\nBuckle up, because I'm about to re-iterate  some truths about NVDA that'll make your dopamine receptors light up like a Christmas tree.  NVDA is destined to hit $1500, pre-split. Ignore current prices, ignore ratios, ignore the media, and listen:\n\n1. **The AI Revolution (Obviously):** NVDA is at the forefront of AI, by sheer luck. As our world becomes more intertwined with AI, Nvidia's dominance in providing chips and stuff for AI processing will be undeniable.\n2. **Data Center Dominance:** NVDA's data center segment is ready to explode. Demand for cloud computing and data processing is up, Nvidia has data centers filling a need in the market.\n3. **Gaming Galore:** Let's not forget about the gaming sector. NVDA's GPUs are known worldwide. As gaming continues to evolve and expand, Nvidia will continue to shine. Potentially aided Apple in the push to the virtual reality frontier.\n4. **Autonomous Vehicles:** Imagine Nvidia in cars, and self driving technology. Its already advanced but there is plenty of room to grow.\n5. **Rising Revenue:** Revenue growth speaks for itself. With consistent revenue increases year over year, Nvidia can thrive in any market.\n6. **Profitability Powerhouse:** Not only is Nvidia growing its revenue, but it's also raking in the profits. With impressive profit margins and a solid financial foundation, not to mention the stakes Nvidia holds in other companies which will profit in this AI boom. Think $SOUN, $RXRX.\n7. **Innovation Incarnate:** Nvidia's commitment to innovation is unparalleled. From cutting-edge GPU architectures to breakthroughs in AI research, Nvidia is  pushing the boundaries of what's possible in technology. Look it up, and see how far we've come in such a short time.\n8. **Market Dominance:** Market dominance is undeniable.\n9. **Economic Expansion:** As the global economy rebounds from recent challenges, obviously NVDA stands to benefit. With increased business activity and investment in technology infrastructure, its tendy town.\n10. **The Wisdom of the Autists:** And finally, let's not discount the wisdom of the autists on Wallstreetbets. With their unparalleled ability to sniff out tendies from miles away, the collective intelligence (sarcasm here) of the WSB community is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nToo much hopium? Here is what could go wrong.  \n**Supply Chain Disruptions, Regulatory Issues (Pelosi wants to make money), Competition Intensification, Macroeconomic Factors (ie. the Crash Bears are praying for), and Technological Shifts (tech and companies come out of the woodwork all the time)**\n\nYou've heard this all before. But know this, NVDA isn't just a stock; it's a ticket to tendie town. Hedge funds, fellow WSB enthusiasts, and normal folk alike all want to be apart of this already meteoric rise . 🚀🌕 Don't miss out on the single greatest investment since BTC.\n\nNever learned how to read? Me either, Here's all you need to know. NVDA is undervalued and overvalued. People will tell you its going up and its going down. Bears, Bulls,  Battlestar Galactica.

I doubt it dips that much though. More likely, it will jump 3-5% the next day. Here are the clearest signs why this will happen:\n\n* Every dip in the last 2 weeks have been bought. It dipped to 699 the day hot CPI was released and now it's above 730. Look at the 5 day chart. It's an ascending triangle.\n* Analysts have been raising PT to above 800 in the last week. EVERY SINGLE analyst has raised PT. These firms will defend their positions by scooping up shares if there's a dip.\n* Whales (Druck, Bridewater, etc.) have not sold out of their huge ass positions. Druck has 500 mill in NVDA.\n* The sentiment from CNBC to WSB is \"I'll sell before ER and lock in gains.\" All those sells are happening this week and the stock hasn't folded. It's building a base above 700.\n* FB, MSFT, SMCI, TSM....all have guided higher capex and rev for next Q. There hasn't been a single \"We see slower build out for our AI stacks next quarter.\" Edit: AMAT just blew away their numbers on \"strong AI chip demand\".\n\nIMO: NVDA blows top and bottom numbers out of the waters (23B rev & $5 EPS) and guides much higher for next Q and full year.
