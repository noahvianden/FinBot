{"title": "What could actually destabilize the stock market right now?", "selftext": "I'll start. I want to read others opinions and ideas.   \n\n\nThe general consensus right now is we're going through great weather in the stock market, smooth sailing. Maybe even a lot of confidence to be surfing the big waves. There are some things I see on the horizon.  \n\n\n1. The AI transition, although has the potential to do great things, is not being adopted so fast and in the pertient areas for actual economic growth. Because of this, AI as a tool for economic growth will plateu for a couple of years. Even though it's great, it has serious limitations right now and can't help whomever do something beyond their own capabilities to a degree that makes them as competent as an expert human being. Coding wise I can tell that much is certain. So I anticipate a disilusion coming from the AI expectations that are out there soon to bring the market down. Specially Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, etc.\n2. There is a serious disconnect between low income and high income people. Low income being the vast majority. This is causing insecurity to rise and creep into areas where that wasn't a problem before. As a consequence... low income people will save instead of spend, and high income people will keep spending, creating an unrealistic measurement of how the economy is doing. This will keep inflation and the prices of goods from coming down, preventing economic growth to come from both low, medium and high income populations. Making the FED reconsider lowering rates as inflation numbers are updated.\n3. Slowly but surely companies will let go of staff and the unemployment number will go up. Adding weight to the idea that raising rates is a no go for now. High unemployment levels can lead to decreased consumer spending, further slowing economic growth and complicating efforts to combat inflation.\n4. Group monopolization: Tech companies and a relatively small group of companies are taking most of the pie. This imbalance will have an effect on the quality of goods being produced. Only a handful of options will be left to choose from and the will of entreprenours will be eroded from not being able to compete with companies who can keep financing the production of their products regardless of their bad quality. So a general lack of doing business motivation will permeate the air and consumers could attempt to simply stop purchasing and going the DIY route.\n5. Europe in general seems to be in a hole. Swiss banks will have some turbulence in the near, medium term future; the debt of countries like Greece, Italy, Spain, etc will just start adding up and making the Euro currency to continue to lose value against other currencies.\n6. Geopolitical tensions could escalate in different fronts and cause bottlenecks in production, transportation, travel, etc. You have the US-China relationship disputing technology and intellectual property rights and creating a competition with other countries for where goods are produced to be imported to the US. Escalation in tensions could bring about tariffs, sanctions, or retaliatory measures. There's also the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Gaza situation, Iran and Western countries over nuclear programs, other oil producing nations and the oil pricing situation.\n7. US elections coming soon.  \n\n\nConsidering this and the list below of what has triggered the US stock market to go down at least 20%, what do you see creeping up, potentially, as a catalyst for the market to flip to bear territory?  \n\n\n1. **1973-1974 Stock Market Crash**: Triggered by the oil crisis following the Yom Kippur War, when OAPEC (Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries) proclaimed an oil embargo. This, coupled with high inflation, stagnating economic growth (stagflation), and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, led to a severe bear market.\n2. **Early 1980s Recession**: High inflation rates, exacerbated by oil price shocks and aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker to combat inflation, led to a severe recession and a significant market downturn in the early 1980s.\n3. **Black Monday, 1987**: On October 19, 1987, stock markets around the world crashed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping by 22% in a single day. Factors included trade deficits, rising interest rates, and overvaluation, but the crash was exacerbated by the widespread use of portfolio insurance and automated trading systems.\n4. **Dot-com Bubble Burst, 2000-2002**: After years of speculative investment in internet-based companies, the bubble burst in 2000, leading to a significant market correction. Many tech companies saw their stock values plummet, leading to a broader market downturn and a mild recession.\n5. **Global Financial Crisis, 2007-2009**: Triggered by the collapse of the housing bubble in the United States, leading to a crisis in subprime mortgages and a severe liquidity crunch. This crisis quickly spread globally, leading to significant declines in stock markets worldwide, bank failures, and a deep global recession.\n6. **COVID-19 Pandemic, 2020**: The global outbreak of COVID-19 led to unprecedented economic disruption, as governments around the world imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions to combat the pandemic. The uncertainty and sudden stop in economic activity led to a sharp, but relatively short-lived, market downturn in March 2020.", "id": "1aoqfgz", "created_utc": 1707708676.0, "score": 228, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 231, "comments": [{"body": "NVDA miss on earnings", "score": 295, "replies": [{"body": "The true FED pivot.", "score": 86, "replies": []}, {"body": "The thing is, NVDA doesn't even have to miss for this to all come down. \n\nI think most are expecting Nvidis to have another huge beat and guide up significantly while maintaining current margins so if that doesn't happen... \n\nThe bar is super high now.  \n\nI'd guess they would need to do revenues of US 22 billion and net profits of at least US 11 billion for the market to be satisfied this quarter, with next quarter forecasting at least US 25 billion and net profit of at least US 13 billion.", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "This!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "People forget chips are a wildly cyclical industry and they can have big over supplies.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": ">People forget chips are a wildly cyclical industry and they can have big over supplies.\n\nOversupply situations can indeed occur, impacting market dynamics significantly.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes, but we are exiting a downturn and shifting to growth again.

I know that long term it is safe, but near term (next 1-3 years), am I making a better decision going with individual large cap tech stocks, and then once small and midsized caps start growing again selling and then re-investing in index funds, or spreading out my risk in an index funds now. I know this is all based on personal risk tolerance but I'm just looking to see how others are feeling \n\n*ATM= at the moment*\n\nSecond edit: I was corrected in that the SP500 is solely large cap. And that what I am really talking about is mega cap vs large cap. If I knew how to cross out text on mobile, I would correct it. But still my question remains, how can we include the performance statistics of stocks that are so far removed from the rest of the companies in the SP500? Are we putting too much emphasis on the growth of less than 10 companies when we are talking about the overall \"health of the economy\" ?(SP400 and SP600 are mid and small caps, respectively) \n\nThird edit: I was reminded that I should state my retirement timeline. At the earliest I'm saying 30 years conservatively (maybe 25 if im really lucky with investments and/or never have children) and 40 at the latest. I would also like to thank everyone for their advice on this as I have realized that I am letting past negative events cloud my judgement too much and that I am probably being impatient and I should just make continual investments in the market every month. And with looking at 20/30yr trends the market has always gone up so even if I had the absolute worst timing if I just keep investing in solid companies/funds by the time I reach retirement I will be set.", "id": "1ap470l", "created_utc": 1707755789.0, "score": 227, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 332, "comments": [{"body": "safe?  yes. \n\nall time high?  yes.  don’t be afraid of red when sell off happens.", "score": 631, "replies": [{"body": "Should one sell to beat the red?

{"title": "Why would the Fed cut rates?", "selftext": "Why would the Fed cut rates?\n\nIn the past, the Fed cuts rates when the job market or economic growth is constrained. Lately, the reasoning for ensuing rate cuts seems to be “because they can”. And the Fed in the FOMC notes and in JPow's subsequent release commentary seems to corroborate this. He noted multiple times that they are waiting for \"more, consistent data points\" referring to continued low inflation numbers, before cutting rates.\n\nThis doesn’t make sense to me. Everything I’ve ever learned about macroeconomic theory and the Fed’s levers note that the fed will increase its rate in times of high inflation and decrease its rate when the market needs an artificial economic boost. But if the Fed continues to nail this “soft landing” the market does not need a boost.\n\nI must be missing something:\n\nIs the macro economic market truly worse than jobs numbers indicate?\n\nAre there longer term risks that are being assumed regarding future macro economic conditions that will most certainly come into play if rates stay high?\n\n\n\nThe fed has even produced internal directives in the last 5 years declaring that they wanted to work to get to average of 2% inflation while maintaining higher normal rates so there can be more room to cut rates in case of economic weakness.\n\nWhy do they seem to be heading towards deviation from this logic?

The FOMC has been consistently cautious and done exactly what they have said they’d do the past 7-8 meetings but everyone else is so giddy to call it the top of the cycle and start seeing rate cuts. \n\n2. Probably the main answer to your question is the lagging effect. Even if the FOMC cuts rates in March, which is highly unlikely, there would still be some tightening effect in the economy from prior rate hikes and from the current fed funds range 5.25-5.50. Debt transactions don’t instantly refinance, some are fixed, some have lock up periods for an initial term, some have high costs not worth refinancing, etc. the FOMC has to look at the trajectory of the economy and the impact of further tightening, cutting, or leaving rates “elevated “\n\n3. So is 5.25-5.50% elevated aka restrictive? Probably. The debate is what is the neutral rate? Assuming everything is basically the same , what fed funds rate keeps the economy humming along at 2% inflation in perpetuity? No one knows even keeping all assumptions constant. But the estimate of the neutral rate is .50-2% implying a fed funds rate of 2.50%-4% (just add 2% inflation to the real rate to get the nominal rate). There’s plenty of cushion to cut and still be somewhat restrictive. \n\n4. Right now the FOMC is seeing a lot of announced layoffs, inflation trending downward, and this is in spite of serious global conflicts that can cause supply chain issues and put upward pressure on commodities. China’s economic numbers aren’t good. There are definitely signs of a slowing economy in the US and globally. If they keep in the 5.25-5.50 range a little longer and cut a little bit (not by as much as most hope/predict) we probably end up with a soft landing of some kind…still painful for many but definitely better than what could have happened in the midst of the pandemic and from the stock market perspective, which is forward looking, still presents optimism for a rally and/or continued opportunity. \n\nFinally I’ll just say I think housing stinks. Totally get home affordability and rents are painful. Probably requires a mix of time and policy solutions that interest rate adjustments can’t solve alone without totally causing a very hard landing. 08/09 crisis still setting us back…housing was underdeveloped for at least a decade due to the 08/09 crisis.

Here’s my thoughts as someone who has played college baseball and was am pretty athletic and also a dork.\n\n- don’t shit on others hobbies, not everyone has to get it\n\n- modern sport was primarily developed in late 19th century for the purpose of Prussian war readiness and than later pushed and adopted in USA when it was discovered that the majority of military aged men were 130 lbs and weak af. \n\n- it is emphasized today because of booze, gambling, and for a circus to distract the populace. Many crooked tax breaks and insider billionaire bs. Owning a professional sports team is a great way to get public funds into private hands.\n\n- playing sports is a great way to develop a child, physically mentally and emotionally. Each sport gives something different so I courage your kids to try multiple. Wrestling teaches toughness, golf teaches humbleness, etc \n\n- sports can be a great way to connect. For me the father son relationship was sometimes very very tumultuous. Baseball was always soemthing to connect back and something to fill the void in conversations. This allowed us to restore our relationship. \n\n- for many small town and urban poor families sports are a way out. I know a couple of guys who received scholarships to play ball who would have never been able to get an education which was their ticket to the middle class. \n\n\n-Males from the age of 12 to about 22 are not fully developed. Something needs to be the carrot to get them through this time, even if it’s just high school. Keeping grades up to stay eligible gets them through this period and hopefully at least a high school diploma.

Could’ve easily banked all your target gains if you bought calls on that dip. I had just gotten off a flight so I completely missed out on that opportunity.\n\nDepends on your expiration. If your 740 call expires next week just a few days after earnings you’re taking a really big gamble as in the option could be worthless if price reaction isn’t favorable. Also you should check the breakeven price at expiration bc if you’re that close to expiration and let’s say stock only trades up to $800 from earnings,  then you might not actually make a whole lot if you’re too close to breakeven, which means that’s a very unfavorable gamble where you’re risking the full position expiring worthless even on good earnings result.\n\nIt’s actually quite fascinating\n\nFeb 16 $725 call at 12.75\n\nFeb 23 $725 call at 43.50\n\nMar 1 $725 call at 47.00\n\nThat one week of earnings is leading to nearly 3.5x delta, whereas the week after earnings is just $4 more per contract, shows the insanity that’s already being priced into earnings, hence breakeven price is very critical to watch here.\n\nI’m always going to be more in favor of having longer expirations so that the option still has some value in case of a miss. And if earnings is a hit, the stock could continue trading higher or at least hold up in value assuming no other negative economic event.\n\nHowever, given how ‘expensive’ the calls are (1 call costing $5k), if you’re more risk averse you could buy 10 shares for $7.2k. If stock jumps $100 from today’s $723 price, that’s $1k in gains which really you should just hold to retirement. $100 jump is a 13% increase which isn’t abnormal for nvda since it’s been able to jump 14% and 24% in prior earnings. Any further gains is gravy.\n\nShares are nice bc if earnings r bad, u can still hold forever, it’s a solid lifelong profitable bet.\n\nIf this call position represents a tiny fraction of your portfolio (less than 10%) then go for the gamble bc it’s all probabilistic anyway and could easily be a 6x+ banger like meta earnings.\n\n— Now looking few months out, there is a chance the AI bubble bursts esp if cpi doesn’t continue trending down. historically the first rate cut in a cycle has preceded some major financial meltdown (dot com crash, GFC, COVID), this is purely an empirical observation, not insinuating any causation.\n\nFed funds history\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nrz7xuutkfic1.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=e77cfbaef6b724eb8df6ad58cb3a077d8879a5ec", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "consumer price index has legit zero to do with what is going on at the moment with the nvidia shares.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's already popped, I'd guess the stock sells off hard on earnings unless guidance is insane.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "nvidia twitter sitting with zero comments on posts and shilling the UAE.

Usually, companies with high P/E ratios are high growth companies that are earning revenue but sinking that back into growth.\n\nGrowth costs a lot of money that has to be raised. Where is the money coming from? There are very few high growth companies that have ever existed that can can fund their expansion through earnings. The stock market itself exists to provide companies with equity financing. Equity is exchanged for money to fuel growth. I.E, your ownership stake in the company decreases in order to fund the growth that you are buying into. You would be hard pressed to find a company that can fund anywhere close to double digit growth through earnings. Amazon has increased its outstanding shares by 25% since 2009. Companies with high growth require tremendous amounts of capital. These companies consume the capital that you provide them when you buy equity in the common market. Every company that exists earns revenue. By the way, capital expenditures (the purchases that fuel growth), are not immediately expensed on the income statement all at once. Its booked as as asset on the balance sheet, and the deprecation of this asset is reflected over a period of time as an expense on the income statement. Earnings are not going to suddenly go up if the company stops spending on CapEx. So that company that is seemingly \"earning\" some money, is actually losing money when you look at cash going in and coming out. Nvidia's price to free cash flow is over 140 now. Good luck with that. \n\n \n\n>No. Earnings could double, share price could double, and the P/E could stay the same if it's a high growth company that investors believe will continue to grow. When was the \"growth phase\" of Apple?\n\nHow many companies continue on a high growth phase for more then a decade? Apple itself hasn't grown much over the last decade vis a vi its stock price, and hasn't grown at all the last few years. Most of the appreciation in the stock price of Apple can be found in their gargantuan share repurchases through their massive free cash flow that they produce every year. I.E, they have no avenue with which to deploy this cash for growth so they return it back to shareholders. Apples stock price increasing far more then its revenue has since 2014 is a direct product of Apple returning money to shareholders.

At what point will this growth stop and how will this translate into money in my pocket? What if growth stops and the company cannot reduce CapEx because the nature of the business requires constant reinvestment to maintain operations? Amazon is a company with 32 billion in free cash flow this year on a market cap of 1.8 trillion. What is the point of owning a business which produces half a trillion in revenue if there is no money left after everything is paid? Amazons CapEx cost was 52 billion this year. Assume growth ceases, and CapEx costs are reduced by 50%. Now you own Amazon, a company that isn't growing, that produces 50 billion in free cash flow at a market cap of 1.8 trillion. Thats a price to free cash flow of 56. So if I buy the business I wont see my money return to for 56 years. Does that really sound like a winning proposition to you, or an extremely margin-tight company which is now grossly overvalued? Value investing isn't dead, its the only thing that works in the long run unless you plan on buying an index fund. Assuming the company is overvalued and its really a $70-$90 stock, which will put your cash flow multiples at a much more fair value, then you still got some tremendous growth since 2009.
