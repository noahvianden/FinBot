{"title": "Reddit picks New York Stock Exchange for delayed IPO", "selftext": ">Reddit is planning an initial public offering and the New York Stock Exchange won the listing, the Wall Street Journal has reported. The San Francisco-based social media company confidentially filed offering paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2021, it had said in a blog post back then. However, plans were put on hold amid a challenging business climate and aligning with the broader trend of delayed IPOs in the tech sector. It is expected to unveil the filing as soon as later this month and will name NYSE as its exchange, according to the WSJ report. The listing is a coup for the NYSE in its competition with Nasdaq for high-profile IPOs.\n\n>In 2023, the number of IPOs on US exchanges annually increased by 42 per cent, but IPO proceeds grew by more than 160 per cent, driven by several large high-profile listings, an EY report said in January. There were seven IPOs in 2023, which raised more than $500 million, compared with only four in 2022, it added. Technology and health care continued to lead the US IPO deal count. Across sectors, investor preferences have continued to gravitate towards companies with greater scale and profitability, EY reported. “The market backdrop for IPOs has improved significantly over the past few quarters: valuations are up, volatility is down, inflation may be corralled, and interest rates could begin ticking down,” the consultancy said.\n\n>Reddit is considering feedback from early meetings with potential investors in its IPO that it should consider a valuation of at least $5 billion, Bloomberg reported. The online discussion platform has been looking to capitalise on the attention it gained when its WallStreetBets forum became a hot spot for individual investors who rallied around GameStop and other stocks. Founded in 2005, Reddit has raised $1.3 billion from private investors so far, including support from Silicon Valley heavyweights such as Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Fidelity led Reddit’s Series F raise in 2021, at a valuation close to $10 billion, although it later marked down the value of its holdings in the company by 41 per cent. The company could potentially have been valued as much as $15 billion in an IPO then, Bloomberg reported in 2022. Steve Huffman, chief executive and co-founder of Reddit, acknowledged in a discussion with users last year that the company had stalled its IPO plans to move closer to profitability. Reddit had more than 70 million daily active unique visitors as of October, according to its website. It became a darling of the so-called meme-stock era after a forum on the site, WallStreetBets, jolted the stock market.\n\nSource: https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/markets/2024/02/03/reddit-picks-new-york-stock-exchange-for-delayed-ipo", "id": "1ahx1og", "created_utc": 1706969721.0, "score": 793, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 302, "comments": [{"body": "We have huge amounts of porn and an army of unpaid workers that make the site work: $15billion.", "score": 1324, "replies": [{"body": "15B was the 2021 valuation.

But that is not what is driving the stock so let's x gaming.\n\nIn world A) GPU and silicon technology evolves continuously and every 2 - 3 years major corporations will have to up their purchases to keep up with the latest and greatest.\n\nIn world A that is hard to swallow a bit. Think about what it takes to train GPT and specifically GPT5. In short, billions in hardware and months to train. And that's only the A100s not even the A100 successor H100's or the newer GH200's.\n\n[https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-5/](https://lifearchitect.ai/gpt-5/)\n\n>**29/May/2023:** NVIDIA Announces DGX GH200 AI Supercomputer ([NVIDIA](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-dgx-gh200-ai-supercomputer)). ‘New Class of AI Supercomputer Connects 256 Grace Hopper Superchips Into Massive, 1-Exaflop, 144TB GPU for Giant Models… GH200 superchips eliminate the need for a traditional CPU-to-GPU PCIe connection by combining an Arm-based NVIDIA Grace™ CPU with an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU in the same package, using NVIDIA NVLink-C2C chip interconnects.’  \n>  \n>Expect trillion-parameter models like OpenAI GPT-5, Anthropic Claude-Next, and beyond to be trained with this groundbreaking hardware. Some have estimated that this could train language models up to 80 trillion parameters, which gets us closer to brain-scale.\n\n**13/Feb/2023:** Morgan Stanley research note:\n\n>We think that GPT 5 is currently being trained on 25k GPUs – $225 mm or so of NVIDIA hardware…  \n>  \n>The current version of the model, GPT-5, will be trained in the same facility—announced in 2020 \\[[May/2020, Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/)\\], the supercomputer designed specifically for OpenAI has 285k CPU cores, 10k GPU cards, and 400 Gb/s connectivity for each GPU server; our understanding is that there has been substantial expansion since then. From our conversation, GPT-5 is being trained on about 25k GPUs, mostly A100s, and it takes multiple months; that’s about $225m of NVIDIA hardware, but importantly this is not the only use, and many of the same GPUs were used to train GPT-3 and GPT-4…  \n>  \n>We also would expect the number of large language models under development to remain relatively small. IF the training hardware for GPT-5 is $225m worth of NVIDIA hardware, that’s close to $1b of overall hardware investment; that isn’t something that will be undertaken lightly. We see large language models at a similar scale being developed at every hyperscaler, and at multiple startups.\n\nIf you remember Meta just bought billions of GPU hardware from Nvidia in the H100's variety and not the GH200's.\n\n**This is a key thing to point out here.**\n\nWhy would a company purchase H100's and not hold out for the GH200's?\n\nIn short they're not ready and the wait is not worth the loss of creation and productivity. We'll take what we can get thank you very much.\n\nBut why is Morgan Stanley reporting that GPT5 will be trained on A100's from OAI.

So in that, upgrades will be major purchases but they won't come for longer periods of time.\n\nIn world B this also takes into account what are these investments really getting for the purchaser. In a way, it could not bode well at all, and pay close attention, if OAI releases GPT5 while training on A100s and meanwhile nobody else can catch-up while paying billions more for newerish hardware.\n\nMeaning, OAI might be heading into a MOAT and there is nothing that can be done about it by anyone. Also, what would incentivize OAI/Microsoft to make larger purchases on the latest and greatest hardwares of Nvidia if they're doing just fine with what they got?\n\nEveryone is betting on scaling but it may not be JUST scaling.\n\nIf anything, I would SUPER pay attention to what OAI/Microsoft are buying rather than what people trying to catch up are purchasing. The purchasers believe it's scaling and Sam Altman is hinting that IT'S NOT scaling.\n\nThis would not bode well for Nvidia but it's not all bad. 3 - 4 months to train a model is not ideal so in the end even OAI may want to purchase more hardware justifiably to lessen that burden. But to what end.\n\nWorld C) would be the worst for Nvidia and that would be the release of a viable Quantum compute system. On that day it would be the end of Nvidia's KING reign of how things are done. Well, probably at least 2 - 3 years past that watershed moment.\n\nIs Nvidia overrated. As of now HELL NO.
