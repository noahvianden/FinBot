Tesla is training a neural network end to end to learn how to drive. The only reason they're able to do that is that they have millions of cars already on the road with a full suite of camera, along with an inference computer, and sensors to tell how you're pressing the accelerator and turning the wheel, a cellphone connection, etc. Nobody else has this currently...

Like I said, GM still needs to start producing and selling cars with said hardware, not instant. Nvidia needs the data and a lot of engineering to actually make it work. Ok, suppose they've done all that. Tesla still comes out ahead. Why? Because Nvidia is going to charge an arm and a leg for their FSD hardware suite, whereas Tesla makes it in-house, and takes all the resulting profit.\n\nAs far as being probably a battery player, they're in the process of ramping up production of grid-scale battery storage, and it's already a non-negligible profit center.

The stock tanked momentarily after the COVID-mania bubble popped in 2021, crashing around October 2022. From this valley, it has only rocketed 5x from that price point, which may be impressive, but not as impressive as it's overall 4 year gains. The current FOMO style market we are in also suggests that fewer and fewer people are along for whatever the longer ride is, because many lost out.\n\nTherefore, despite the needle-like structure of Nvdia's current stock chart, in order for anybody else to make money on it, there has to be a dip to buy. That will likely be off-set by another company which is deemed too big to fail, like Microsoft (which also is playing the AI bubble juggle game) or Apple, which keeps rising despite fewer vocal AI mentions. The more companies which use AI as justification for laying people off as a temporary bandaid on projecting more profits, the higher stocks like Nvdia or Microsoft stand to go, based on current mania sentiment. That can last until it is interrupted.\n\nWhen Nvdia invariably goes down to scoop up more investment, it will likely dip to slightly below $500, and may well do so on its way up to $1,000 as many have suggested, prior to a split which would make it appear more affordable and double or triple down on those who have invested already, as if they are trying to create another Apple, practically overnight.\n\nI've said it before and I will reiterate it here, that though our society is crumbling under the weight of these massively inflated equities, and they are not even justified with replacing the jobs they are being used to eliminate, nothing other than an unprecedented act of war on the United States is likely to penetrate the hype machine.

NVIDIA making the \"best\" GPUs and comptetition being a distant second? The competitive moat being large? Investments from ML demand not abating?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "You are projecting with respect to teenager-like insults or XBox online behavior, but you did highlight the evidence in your own comment that your opinion is based on gut without much basis, and given your anonymous user handle we should not take seriously your claim you currently (or ever) worked as a software developer.\n\nFor the record, my user name is my name, and the photo you see is actually me, a recently-turned 37 year old man who has been a market participant since I was born and an activist against anticompetitive fraud for the last several years with success in busting up several of them in addition to providing the government resources on how to regulate the unprecedented pace of rackets.\n\nNothing that you said is \"objective fact.\" Everything you have said was attempting to refute what I put forth based on careful analysis, and parsing through the hyperbolic media frenzy which companies like Nvidia pay for in order to convince people like you it's irrefutable when it takes very little to refute it in reality.\n\nOf the specific questions you've asked, I will answer.\n\n1) I think that the demand for computing power for the needs of a vast majority of people, and industries, has actually plateued, and the impression people have that it needs to advance is pushed synthetically by the companies like Microsoft which rely on this being believed even if it isn't necessary, and that the achievements that have been presented by companies like OpenAI are fraudulent, misleading, and/or achieved with seemingly inferior technology, making it all a lie.\n\n2) As with nearly every other type of technology, Nvidia does not have a product which is insurmountable by their competitors. They are merely owned by the same controlling elements as their competitors which enables them to pick & choose which company to inflate at any given time. For example, IBM Watson was a chat bot which was presented as capable of doing all or more than whatever Chat-GPT said, and Watson was first introduced in 2010. For the 2 years after this release IBM was on pace to double its stock, before investors realized their claims were untrue and/or not genuinely wanted or needed in the market. I caught wind of it much later, in 2017 or so, when the stock started its decline as Nvidia began its slow uprising. Go to any trade show in computing now and you will see dozens of companies claiming the exact same specifications of Nvidia's products, many of which are white labeled from the same factories in Taiwan. It was the same situation in the LED sector when I was in that industry. Same as the IT field when I worked with an AI gun-detection company who modified an IBM product which did facial recognition.\n\nNow departing from your questions...\n\n3) as was the case in the COVID-mania, everything right now is fueled by speculation, attempting to prove that tomorrow is more valuable than today, based on almost any evidence including bad news, good news, or even no news. As insane as these valuations seem, they are still tempered by an unwillingness to commit to any decision of valuation which would lock people and companies into something solid. That is because a solid decision or idea would cut off the \"possibility\" of more later. Let's say the AI industry were to be tentatively capped at a realized value of $100 Trillion, like Bitcoin claims to have a limited amount of currency to mine. Rather than Nvidia rocketing to its current value with no end in sight, people could decide if they want to wait until they're dead to pull out or if they want to take their marginal gains and live life. Or we could admit societally that we would rather invest in (10) other $10 Trillion industries instead, making for a more balanced world. This endless speculation is why people like you can argue however you wish, in a massive bubble that seems like it will never pop, until it either does pop or is replaced by another insulated space.\n\n4) I've been around long enough to remember the dot-com bubble, 9/11, housing crash, COVID-mania, and my grandfathers taught me about how the depression was caused by running up stocks like GE and the Phoebus Cartel which created planned obsolescence. I was put in the market from an early age and trusted with certain decisions because of my prudence and vision.

Given the functionality of \"AI\" in any context is dependent upon what the machine does, there is a brewing IP litigation debate about what would even be protected from a patent perspective anyway.\n\nIt would also be unwise for Taiwan Semiconductor to only allow (1) brand to have THE market leading product for too long, since they would stand to sell more if it even appeared others could be as capable as Nvidia, that is of course if there is actually enough demand - or even if they could synthetically create such demand - which may well happen here. Taiwan Semiconductor would likely have much more practical understanding of how to make these things compared to Nvidia, meaning they could engineer something to evade any patent issue for their other customers who, if Nvidia DID make something so outstanding and superior, could beg to have a copycat a lot faster than Nvidia could find another manufacturer.\n\nBesides the notorious IP theft claims made about Chinese and other Asian manufacturing facilities, Nvidia is a younger company than many of their competitors which (like in the case of the Intel product you want to deny out of existence) means there is nothing monopolistic about Nvidia now, nor will there ever be.\n\nIf you have put money into Nvidia, just know that you too have nothing competitively advantageous, and the moment this company has peaked in the pockets of those richer than you, they will dump it on your head as you cry out wondering why you didn't see it coming and some new or old company reaps the benefits.

It's the same story we've seen in the past with the dot-com bubble and also with other new revolutionary innovations like with Xerox, cable TV, the radio etc.  We don't learn because every time since the previous bubble, investors will have changed the way they evaluate companies, and they'll say that this time they are not making the same mistakes of the past. However, this then refers to the less important details.\n\nIn case of the dot-com bubble, there were many zombie companies that attracted a lot of investments. And companies with websites were valued based on website views rather than on earnings. We're not making that type of mistake today with AI. But we're still making the same more fundamental mistakes about assessing the future profits. \n\nInvestors can be correct about some company being able to make more profits using a new technology like AI. But if the entire tech sector is valued a lot more, so much more that the entire stock market goes up due to that, then that would require the income of consumers to go up significantly with that larger income to be spent mostly on the new tech products and services. And this is just not plausible. \n\nAI will in due course lead to more economic growth, lead to more wealth and more profits for companies. But the way this will happen involves a gradual adoption of AI systems in the entire economy leading to more productive work force. People will then earn more and spend more compared to today. So, before we get to the much larger profits of the tech sector, a huge amount of investment in AI in the entire economy will have to be made. Before this has been done, the profits cannot be as large as has been priced in because the profits must ultimately come from the end-consumer who in their jobs are not yet more productive as AI has not yet been implemented in their jobs.\n\nOf course, many investors do understand this, they do see that the AI-hype has caused the market to get overvalued and that the market will end up correcting. But fund managers will have to show performance, if the market is up, their portfolios under management must also be up, or else they'll be fired. This then causes the market to get pumped; investors are forced to participate in the bubble even if they fully understand that it's a bubble that will end soon.\n\nIt's difficult to predict when the bubble will burst. It can happen next week if NVIDIA's earnings disappoint. It can happen next month when banks start to face more headwinds. The Bank Term Funding program will end next month and the maturity wall of corporate loans of next year starts to become relevant from next month onward, because companies are required to factor in the costs of refinancing if the loans expire within one year. Given that the FED is not going to rapidly cut rates back to zero in the coming months, this amounts to a severe tightening of financial conditions. \n\nIt may then be that the Biden Administration will take measures to prevent too much trouble.

FED has always said \"higher for longer\" but nobody believes them\n3. PPI and other reports have hinted that persistent inflation still exists in pockets of the economy\n4. The U.K. and Japan have fallen into technical recessions\n5. Major layoffs in tech continue to be announced on a daily basis, and have started to spread to other sectors as companies continue to cut costs and trim fat due to constrained operating costs and reduced margins\n6. Geopolitical flashpoints with the potential to expand conflicts to wider regions, and major global economic costs associated with Ukraine, Israel/Hamas/Iran/Red Sea, Taiwan\n7. Seasonality weakness in February, and election year weakness is common historically, but both have yet to show face...so the timing is nigh\n8. Jim Cramer just said market is strong Friday\n9. Degenerate meme stocks like SMCI are finding favor and now plummeting/capitulating from max-hype levels\n10. VIX and vol products are holding their levels, rather than dropping\n11. Earnings in general are kinda lackluster\n12. NVDA will report earnings next week and spike initially, but then drop to unchanged and sell-off in the following days, despite good growth and strong forward projections...simply due to investor over-evaluation of actual realized profits from AI. Then, sympathy selling in tech will exacerbate the selloff for the overall market /nq especially and /es\n13. FED minutes this week will continue to waffle on rate projections and say \"higher for longer\" and \"data-dependent\" (go figure) because the FED is waiting on actual indications inflation is coming down to their target range before cutting rates, and it hasn't yet. This may not happen for a long time...and when the global economic crises hits, the FED will need to be able to cut rates to support growth. The FED can't cut too early, because then inflation won't be curtailed fully and they have no ammunition left if something goes wrong - but they also can't hold rates high for too long, otherwise they will stifle growth in the economy and increase chances of a recession\n\nSo how do you play anything I said above? Well don't buy options on NVDA (they are overpriced if you didn't pick them up weeks ago). Go buy some puts on tech or something expiring Friday or the following week. Anything /es /nq puts-related would also work. For you regards out there, that's SPY puts.

Look at the words you're using: \"technical recession\". They are REAL recessions. But when you hear 'recession' you think 2008; industries collapsing, massive unemployment, stocks vaporizing. We had a technical recession too, by the same metrics, and it was a nothing burger for the economy. And yet...\n\nWhen the COVID crash came I made good money picking up a few mortgage REITS at fire sale prices. A bunch of them were going at fire sale prices like 85-90% down and I took a cash advance on my credit card, multiplied it with margin, and made some 400% returns over the next year. This was, believe it or not, before I found you guys. I saw people reacting to 'recession' like it was 2008; \"Oh no, recession means mortgage collapse!\" and I said \"you fucking idiots\" and spammed the buy button.\n\nWhen it looked like the economy was tipping into recession again in 2022 (and it \"technically\" did), people started panicking again and the market declined 30%. But that recession was never declared, big business got back to making money, and we marched right back out of that bear market the next year.\n\nAfter 2008 (and the Dotcom bubble before it) the market is expecting a >50% crash every time things go sour. The last two times it's tried everyone who sold the bottom got royally fucked. We're conditioned now to buy the dip. No market participant, be they retail minnow or Wall Street whale, wants to be the first out the door or the last. \n\nSo what does the market do next? Expect an absolutely massive prop job. Look at the Nikkei and the FTSE. Bad data comes in, and they both say, \"Fuck you, we're rallying\". If we had a surprise quarterly GDP contraction, the S&P might lose a few percent in a day, then go on to rally back up. Because rate cuts are back on the table! Exactly the inverse of what just happened: a high inflation print means rate cuts are off the table (-2%), but that actually means the economy is still strong (+2%).\n\nI'm not saying the market can't drop ever. It's just going to take a hell of a lot to scare buyers away after how fucking badly sellers have been screwed the past ten years. Something would have to happen to literally make it impossible for people to buy the dip. Otherwise, they will.

{"title": "ANF continues to be the biggest shorting opportunity of 2024 - numbers don't lie", "selftext": "Short term, market can support any stupid valuation. Remember Peleton at $150, Snapchat at $80, Tesla at $400, PayPal at $300, Beyond Meat at $150, Virgin Galactic at $50, Nikola at $90... ok I'll stop.\n\nLong term, the price of something tends to reach it's realistic value. If your business has growing revenue and profits, it will be more valuable long term. If you are pumping numbers, building hype, it's inevitable that the stock price of the business will crash. Period.\n\nDespite this simple and plain \"quant\" rule, people often get stuck in complexity bias thinking they need some sort of nano-latency server attached to NYSE with 1000 GPUs running latest AI algorithms in order to beat the market, while most of the opportunity in the market is simple and literally staring at them.\n\nThis brings me to Abercrombie and Fitch. A company that for no reason started going to stratosphere on relatively flat revenue and net income numbers. All of you lady boys are getting wet looking at Nvidia, while a jeans reseller is literally beating your \"paradigm shift\" stock by a mile.\n\n[AI revolution or jeans revolution?](https://preview.redd.it/t2p7w5cyt7jc1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d1812b3ceb11f73862852e49ff48ed913fb24d9)\n\nSo what is proprietary about Abercrombie? Literally nothing, as with all other retail fashion businesses. Brand loyalty is weak, and shoppers usually go for better deals and whatever is the next thing pumped on social media.\n\nTo no surprise, ANF's numbers show that indeed, they did not invent anything new recently. Their revenue is flat to mildly up due to inflation over the years, while their profitability is inconsistent and generally flat as well.\n\n[Flat revenue since you were in high school.](https://preview.redd.it/s7830p1nu7jc1.png?width=2254&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f9c5d4461b61822349d727a9b4463ed6afccc33)\n\n[Inconsistent profitability.](https://preview.redd.it/knsmdrluu7jc1.png?width=2238&format=png&auto=webp&s=610a75539394ea055372ca5d48c35b04c68a7fbc)\n\nSo why the heck is stock pumping while revenue is literally flat?\n\n[Pump it baby.](https://preview.redd.it/sxk2ie20v7jc1.png?width=2334&format=png&auto=webp&s=37b00a0c4fa790d6e0d48600df1deaa3aa1c0727)\n\nThe answer is **I don't know**.

While we’ve been short it in the past, we think the set-up and asymmetry today is too good to ignore. Despite the stock’s YTD run, the skepticism towards this name and sector is still well-reflected in the price. The St is failing to give ANF adequate credit for near-term FCF generation (nearly 30% of EV by end of 2021), permanent cost savings that will support EBITDA above 2019 levels even if top line reverts back, and the best multi-year outlook the business has had in over a decade. We see manageable downside at these levels (\\~10%), with a wide range of positive outcomes. We pin our base & upside case to $69 (\\~55%) & $82 (\\~80%) over the NTM. \n\nNote: For purposes of this write up, all comparisons are vs FY19 unless otherwise specified.\n\nThesis:\n\nSimilar to our BIG write-up on 6/25/20, this is in large part a brute force math thesis whereby the St is failing to pro forma the capital structure for near-term FCF; the combination of incorrectly modeled FY21 EBITDA/FCF and low valuation creates a highly asymmetric opportunity.\n\n* We believe ANF will beat 2-4Q21 St numbers substantially:\n   * The market is applying a simplistic curve of fading demand (given 1Q21’s stimulus benefit) and a corresponding deterioration in operating margin expansion.\n   * This simplistic consensus fails to recognize several tailwinds ANF still enjoys this year relative to 1Q21. We expect top line trends to modestly improve (vs consensus decelerating) on strong flow-through, driving significant EBITDA upside.\n* We expect ANF will generate $600mm of FCF during the rest of FY21 (vs consensus of \\~$390mm and EV of $2.2bn). Pro forma for this cashflow, the stock is trading at 2.3x our FY21 EV/EBITDA (vs historical range of 3-5x).\n* 3 scenarios (12-month time horizon):\n   * Base case: Mkt applies current St multiple (4.4x) to our FY21 EBITDA of $700mm = $69 (+54%)\n   * Downside case: Mkt has line of sight to demand fading to 2019 levels; structural cost savings yield $425mm in EBITDA. Applying trough multiple of 3.0x = $40 (-11%)\n   * Upside case: Mkt applies 5x (a “full” multiple by historic standards) on FY21 EBITDA of $770mm = $81 (+82%) to reflect ANF’s improved positioning, a positive consumer backdrop & S&P’s all-time high multiple", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "What happened: COVID ironically created a structurally better business out of ANF\n\nGenerational supply & demand reconciliation: The curse of long supply chains (6+ months) in traditional brick & mortar retail ended up saving the day. COVID gave retailers the ability to cancel orders aggressively; as supply was drastically reduced, demand came back in following months much faster than anticipated and faster than the supply chain could catch up to. This resulted in rightsized inventory, thereby ending years of the death spiral of clearance cycles (lower demand, promote, customer learns to shop sales, lower full-priced sell-through, promote, & so on). While not specific to ANF, ANF’s pre-covid position as an ‘incremental’ player with a low margin structure makes the Company a disproportionate beneficiary of this dynamic.\n\n* Implication: ANF sold through old inventory and was able to start fresh. ANF is now putting product on shelves that consumers actually want; this ignites the reverse cycle: higher demand, better brand perception, more full-priced selling, & so on.\n   * Evidence:  The single best piece of evidence is pricing power. Typically, undifferentiated, secularly declining businesses have little pricing power; however, for the first time in the past decade ANF has been able to consistently raise AURs for an extended period of time. In 1Q21, the Company reported its best Q1 gross margin since 2013.\n      * “We saw demand outstrip our supply a bit, and that puts us in a nice position to raise AUR and take out markdowns.” – CFO, 3Q20\n      * “We realized higher year-over-year AUR for the third consecutive quarter driven by on-trend products, lean inventories and lower promotional intensity.” – CEO, 4Q20\n      * “After many years of hard work, we have made great progress in transitioning our customers away from a wait-for-sale mentality to a buy-it-when-you-see-it one.” – ANF CEO, 1Q21 Earnings call\n\nEcommerce ramps from \\~30% to \\~55% of business:\n\n* Implication 1: Mgmt took an axe to underperforming locations; store count reduced from 854 at end of 2019 to 731 today (15% fewer stores / 18% fewer sq ft.) Now, 90% of US stores are in A or B Malls (482 of their 533 US stores). Of the closed stores, ANF took flagships down from 15 in FY19 to 6 today. Cumulatively, the fleet is now of higher quality whilst the company stripped out \\~$100mm of occupancy expense.\n* Implication 2: ANF is in the strongest negotiating position it has ever been with landlords. As business shifts away from brick & mortar, ANF’s reliance on stores diminishes, whilst REITs face pressure from the combination of 2020 bankruptcies and lower foot traffic. Substantial negotiations took place last year and may continue to take place in coming years as stores continue to come up for renewal (\\~1/3rd up for renewal in FY21), which will likely result in incremental savings. We have not incorporated further contribution from future rent negotiations in our cases.\n* Implication 3: As ecommerce represents a greater share of revenue, business quality improves (revenue trend, asset light, more efficient inventory turns, etc.) As an example, ecommerce 3yr CAGR into COVID was +12% vs brick & mortar -1%.  ", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "What’s Next: 2021 FCF, Structural Cost Savings Buffering Downside and the Outer Years:\n\n2021: St model too conservative: significant cash flow heading shareholders’ way\n\n1. Revenue: St is taking 1Q 2yr revenue stack (+6.5%) and modeling a deterioration for 2Q-4Q (\\~3% on average). This is because 1Q in the US benefited from substantial stimulus and pent-up demand. However, this fails to appreciate the following:\n   1. QTD: We believe US 2Q21 QTD (through June) 2yr stack trends are similar to that of 1Q21, despite the lack of stimulus in the quarter and the US largely re-opened.\n      1. We’re a data-forward fund that uses a large ensemble of alternative data sources (as we reference in some of our previous write ups), including multiple panels of credit cards, debit cards, email receipts, web traffic, geolocation, social media, and multiple promotionality barometers, that cumulatively inform our analysis.\n   2. July & 2H could improve from 2Q QTD / 1Q21 Trend:\n      1. The QTD period does not reflect back-to-school, which represents an easier compare than the QTD period because the in-person fall semester was non-existent last year.\n      2. Further, beginning on July 15th, individuals with income <$75k and households <$150k are eligible for child tax credits that equate to $250 per child for children ages 6-17 ($300 per child \n      3. Europe is still in recovery, and 2Q & 2H should fare better than 1Q21.\n2.  EBIT margin expanded \\~1100bps in 1Q21 vs 1Q19. The St is modeling 3Q/4Q EBIT margin expansion of only 350bps and 0bps, respectively. We believe this conservatism is a function of lack of mgmt guidance in 2H and historical volatility in operating results.\n   1. SG&A: In 1Q21, SG&A was -7% vs ‘19. The St is assuming 2Q-4 on average will realize SG&A +2% vs ‘19, which we take the under on given the permanent reduction in fleet & personnel.\n   2. GM improvement in 1Q21 vs 1Q19 was 285bps and the St models 2H improvement at 216bps. However, our real-time analysis of promotional emails, online pricing, in-store pricing, order values, and item values gives us confidence that GM rate expansion is continuing to accelerate from 1Q into 2Q (we estimate a 375bps improvement vs 2Q19).\n\nStructural cost savings – new run-rate EBITDA substantially above pre-covid levels even if top line were to slow: We acknowledge that each year we look out has less & less visibility. So before discussing 2022 & beyond, it is important to appreciate the structural cost savings that bridge to structurally elevated EBITDA vs pre-covid levels, even on similar demand. This gives us confidence in debunking the bear case of “what if EBITDA goes back to $250-300mm seen in FY19-FY18?”\n\n* Mgmt took out $200mm of structural costs in FY20. While we take this aggregate number with a grain of salt, we estimate that half of this is due to rent reductions ($30mm reported due to closure of 7 flagships alone) which gives us confidence.\n   *  4+ more flagships closures on the horizon\n* In 2019, ANF generated \\~$255mm of EBITDA. On the same level of demand, the business would generate \\~$455mm of EBITDA today pro forma for mgmt’s stated cost savings. We give $10mm of credit for the next 4 flagships that are destined for closure, $0mm for further rent negotiations, $0mm credit for any potential gross margin (AUR) stickiness, and further haircut this consolidated number by an arbitrary $40mm (20% of the stated structural savings quantum) for conservatism.

This could drive a multi-year replacement cycle.

We believe online growth is likely to continue to fare better, and now that it’s a greater % of the biz we believe the business in aggregate has a better shot at combating secular threats.\n3.  New brand launch - Social Tourist: The biggest TikTok stars, Charlie & Dixie D’Amelio, partnered with Hollister to launch this fashion-forward brand. The sisters have a combined following of \\~165 million people on TikTok alone, and have their own reality TV show coming to market (think Kardashians). Mgmt is clearly serious about it, as indicated by airtime on transcripts, presentations, press releases etc. We aren’t attempting to model this precisely, but it could be a further multi-year demand driver with gross margins similar to rest-of-chain according to mgmt. The following are proof points we’ve noticed that Social Tourist is being taken seriously and finding early success:\n   1. Charlie & Dixie are wearing Social Tourist apparel with large obvious logos in nearly every recent post for several weeks.\n   2. Most of the \\~50 SKUs started running out of popular sizes online within days of launch\n4.
