Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.16, up 28% from the previous  quarter and up 486% from a year ago.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, revenue  was up 126% to $60.9 billion. GAAP earnings per diluted share was  $11.93, up 586% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was  $12.96, up 288% from a year ago.\n\n“Accelerated computing and  generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide  across companies, industries and nations,” said Jensen Huang, founder  and CEO of NVIDIA (NVDA.NaE).\n\n“Our Data Center platform is  powered by increasingly diverse drivers — demand for data processing,  training and inference from large cloud-service providers and  GPU-specialized ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer  internet companies. Vertical industries — led by auto, financial  services and healthcare — are now at a multibillion-dollar level.\n\n“NVIDIA  RTX, introduced less than six years ago, is now a massive PC platform  for generative AI, enjoyed by 100 million gamers and creators. The year  ahead will bring major new product cycles with exceptional innovations  to help propel our industry forward. Come join us at next month’s GTC,  where we and our rich ecosystem will reveal the exciting future ahead,”  he said.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA.NaE) will pay its next quarterly cash  dividend of $0.04 per share on March 27, 2024, to all shareholders of  record on March 6, 2024.\n\n**Q4 Fiscal 2024 Summary**\n\n**GAAP**\\*($ in millions, except earnings\\**per share)* **Q4 FY24**  **Q3 FY24**  **Q4 FY23** **Q/QY/Y**Revenue$22,103 $18,120 $6,051 Up 22%Up 265%Gross margin 76.0%  74.0%  63.3% Up 2.0 ptsUp 12.7 ptsOperating expenses$3,176 $2,983 $2,576 Up 6%Up 23%Operating income$13,615 $10,417 $1,257 Up 31%Up 983%Net income$12,285 $9,243 $1,414 Up 33%Up 769%Diluted earnings per share$4.93 $3.71 $0.57 Up 33%Up 765%\n\n**Non-GAAP**\\*($ in millions, except earnings\\**per share)* **Q4 FY24**  **Q3 FY24**  **Q4 FY23** **Q/QY/Y**Revenue$22,103 $18,120 $6,051 Up 22%Up 265%Gross margin 76.7%  75.0%  66.1% Up 1.7 ptsUp 10.6 ptsOperating expenses$2,210 $2,026 $1,775 Up 9%Up 25%Operating income$14,749 $11,557 $2,224 Up 28%Up 563%Net income$12,839 $10,020 $2,174 Up 28%Up 491%Diluted earnings per share$5.16 $4.02 $0.88 Up 28%Up 486%\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Summary**\n\n**GAAP**\\*($ in millions, except earnings\\**per share)* **FY24**  **FY23** **Y/Y**Revenue$60,922 $26,974 Up 126%Gross margin 72.7%  56.9% Up 15.8 ptsOperating expenses$11,329 $11,132 Up 2%Operating income$32,972 $4,224 Up 681%Net income$29,760 $4,368 Up 581%Diluted earnings per share$11.93 $1.74 Up 586%\n\n**Non-GAAP**\\*($ in millions, except earnings\\**per share)* **FY24**  **FY23** **Y/Y**Revenue$60,922 $26,974 Up 126%Gross margin 73.8%  59.2% Up 14.6 ptsOperating expenses$7,825 $6,925 Up 13%Operating income$37,134 $9,040 Up 311%Net income$32,312 $8,366 Up 286%Diluted earnings per share$12.96 $3.34 Up 288%\n\n**Outlook**NVIDIA’s outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 is as follows:\n\n* Revenue is expected to be $24.0 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n* GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3% and 77.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.\n* GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\n* GAAP  and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of  approximately $250 million, excluding gains and losses from  non-affiliated investments.\n* GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17.0%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.", "id": "1awnrwx", "created_utc": 1708550540.0, "score": 84, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 131, "comments": [{"body": "If I still hear AI is a bubble ima flip.

You guess.  You hope.  You have a dream that what you think or believe actually becomes true.  Unless you are one of Jensen's direct reports, you don't know anything of what his management team is thinking.\n\na) No home grown chip from any CSP has proven to be much of anything except TPU and still to this day it has a relatively small (and rapidly shrinking) footprint and it is limited in performance and functionality compared to GPUs.   This is after Google has spent $Bs on it.  It certainly would have been cheaper for them to have started with GPUs than to build their own DIY chip.\n\nb) There are some irons in the fire at other CSPs (Azure/Meta) to build new chips, but what everyone is learning (like Google and AWS) is that it's a lot harder than anyone conceived when they started funding these programs.    Harder to build chips and deliver software, and support that software.  It's years of development.    How are Inferentia and Trainium doing anyway?  Do you ***know*** anything about those?\n\nc) These big CSPs are paying Nvidia $4500/yr to support the software stacks for these rack and racks of GPUs as was just disclosed on the ER call.  That tells you how important the SW stack is.  All these chips are going to need ground up development and support.\n\nIf the semicustom rumor is true, the reason Nvidia is talking to these guys is about selling IP and know how and compatible software and support.   Listen to Pat Moorehead discuss on his 6/5 podcast.   Beyind that there are only like 1/2 dozen hyperscalers in the world, yet there are a whole lot of down stream customers who will not be spinning their SW stacks to pivot to say an Azure part.   Those guys won't be departing the Nvidia platform ecosystem anytime soon.

Where did you get that information?\n\nIt's a function of hundreds of thousands of GPUs flooding the market every quarter from Nvidia.  $18B worth of GPUs is 600,000+  this quarter alone.

Apparently paradigm shifts are glacial on Intel's scale.\n\n>ALL these companies are working to topple nvidia and to stop paying them ridiculous amounts of money. \n\nlol.   Silly guy, that's more like what the koolaide drinkers in AMD information silos believe.  \n\nReal world is a little different.   All these companies are running as fast as they can to develop and deploy their own GenAI systems.  They need Nvidia, they want more GPUs.   A coordinated toppling of Nvidia would be as simple as everyone simultaneously cancelling their orders and never buying again.   It's super simple.     But somehow I don't think they're going to stop paying ridiculous amounts of money.  In fact, when Blackwell ships the amounts are going to get even more ridiculous.  And customers will stand in line for the privilege of paying more.\n\n>you don't need the fastest single chip if you can get several for the price of one nvidia system. \n\nSorry another silly moment.   You appear to not understand this market very well.  Software is a huge factor.   These chips aren't interchangeable.   4 $10,000 GPUs aren't the same as one $40,000 GPU especially when there is little software to support the $10,000 GPUs.

It costs on the order of $500M to tape out a new SOTA chip.  Google has done this 5 times with TPU.

AMD is the last great hope and they're projected to do $4B this year.   Nvidia is going to do $100B+.   Even if they both exceed that AMD is likely to be low single digit market share.   And lets not lose track of the fact AMD still hasn't proven the software side of their solution yet, that can really hurt them if Victor Peng doesn't get it together.  Intel is all but done, Qualcomm never lifted off, AVGO and MRVL are only nibbling crumbs around the edges.\n\nCSPs are DYIing their own in house solutions, fine.  Best case is they replace a portion of their internal work loads.  But their cloud customers still need GPUs, so they will continue to buy GPUs by the truck load.

If you just look at their revenue origination chart, you'll see that most of the revenue comes from data center.  You could predict the numbers looking at the growth rate from quarter to quarter. Furthermore, the biggest source of their revenue is data center growth which is the area, they're forecasted to see the most competition. The biggest AI datacenter owners, Microsoft with Azure and Amazon with AWS are both either producing or have committed to produce their own in house AI chips. Apple is producing their own chips. That takes away the biggest buyers of potential chips. Now factor in AMD with their new MI300x gpu's at 10k a pop. Significantly cheaper than Nvidia's solution by a minimum of 50%+ plus it's faster. There's just too much competition. 80%+ of the revenue is datacenter and the competition will drive margin down and revenue down.\n\nTLDR: the revenue will plateau and stay flat due to datacenter competition. There's no catalyst for the next revenue spike and companies are starting to show a desire to seek alternatives to Nvidia. Finally lead time for GPU delivers has gone from 8-11 months to 3-4 months but, the growth in revenue for next quarter shows that the reduction of the lead time hasn't lead to a significant increase in the guidance. \n\nRevenue trend: [https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc\\_financials/2024/Q4FY24/Rev\\_by\\_Mkt\\_Qtrly\\_Trend\\_Q424.pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2024/Q4FY24/Rev_by_Mkt_Qtrly_Trend_Q424.pdf)\n\nLead Times Source:  \nhttps://wccftech.com/nvidia-drastically-reduces-delivery-times-of-its-ai-gpus-as-supply-chain-witnesses-improvement/", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": ">I think their growth is plateauing\n\nTheir guide was nothing but positive, from 22.1 to 24B, 10% Q/Q for a $88B company.

The call today talked about software and what a key differentiator it was, and why all the CSPs are using Nvidia's services and paying them $4500 per GPU for the privilege.   No one is going to displace them.  Nvidia is going to help these guys with their custom services and have them continue to run in the Nvidia software ecosystem.

I mean yes, AI is going to be widely used adopted and even improved upon but at some point those companies implementing such expensive GPUs will hit a saturation point and sales at NVDIA will slow down to a more sustained pace.  One that happens, the growth will also slow down, and the company valuation will start to see slower but still rising numbers.  When is that slow down?  A year or two from now?  What kind of growth can it realistically get in two years?  Can  it 2X from here?, maybe.  But NVIDIA isn't the only horse in this race and their high end GPUs are cost prohibitive.  You have to know both AMD and INTEL are also working on their own versions, which will also have eyebrow raising  aspects.  Intel is a leading CPU company with GPU integration capabilities who have to be working on something that might be able to handle specific types of computation and AMD who sit in second place for both GPU and CPU development also tens to produce high end products at a lower cost, which might appeal to smaller companies looking to enter the AI space that don't have the resources larger companies might.  \nSo I do expect NADIA to continue to climb, but as they grow in value, the stock will grow slower.

Think of your own commute that you drive everyday, you drive it on pure instinct (sometimes it even feels like teleporting home and I can barely remember how I got there), unless something unexpected happens, then your System 2 wakes up and tries to understand the situation at a deeper level, formulates goals, visualizes a plan etc. This is not something FSD V12 can do right now, but it's not impossible with architectures like Hierarchical JEPA. So right now it will be limited in a way, but it will be like a NYC cab driver who's been doing this for 30 years, and instead of one cab driver, it's a merge of thousands of cab drivers from all over the world.

ChatGPT/generative AI has relatively just recently come into the mainstream so what tools are coming next? Are NVDA chips going to be integral to that tools development? Personally, I say yes. They are clearly the dominant leader in the chip space, and as others commented, the companies buying their chips are building their frameworks around those chips. Thats the benefit of being the first mover in a space. Simply- their chips work, and if a company has invested so much into their framework, and it works.

That’s because Etsy has become the No.1 marketplace for the kinds of goods they sell, so there really wasn’t a good alternative for any of their sellers. Sellers bit the bullet and stayed with the website.\n\n**Competition from TikTok**\n\nEnter TikTok, which has quickly become an extremely viable channel for typical Etsy products. The video format and discovery options on TikTok lend themselves perfectly to products typically sold on Etsy – you can stumble on a video showing something cute and homemade, and immediately purchase the item through TikTok. Here’s a quote from an Etsy Seller on their Forums from October 29, 2023:\n\n“I don't have a TikTok but I know a few sellers in my category that do and are killing it with sales.  I agree we need something live here on Etsy to compete.”\n\nThe video and live formats on TikTok are simply much more appealing to modern customers compared to Etsy, which essentially works the same way as Amazon.\n\n**Popular Etsy products are increasing in popularity on TikTok**\n\n\nWhile Etsy doesn’t disclose their sales by product category, we can make an educated guess by visiting their “best selling items” website as well as other websites that make estimates:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/market/best_selling_items\n\nhttps://bloggingwizard.com/best-selling-items-on-etsy/\n\nWithout being able to quantify them, these are some of the best selling product categories on Etsy:\n\nJewelry, beads, pendants, etc.\nPins\nStickers\nBooks\nT-Shirts\n\n\nTikTok has offered these creators amazing terms by taking only a 2% commission on each sale (compared to 6.5% at Etsy) and paying for discounts on the products.\n\nThe screenshots show how search interest on TikTok has developed for some popular hashtags related to these product categories in the USA (all screenshots show global search interest over the past 3 years). \n\nAnother sign of TikTok’s increasing popularity in this space is that they will be increasing their own fees on sales soon, to 6% per sale by April 1 and 8% by July 1 (which would be even higher than Etsy’s fees). TikTok’s parent company Bytedance is highly profitable, so it stands to reason that this move is not made out of desperation, but because they feel like they have taken a large amount of market share in this space. (https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktok-shop-hikes-seller-fees-axes-subsidies)\n\nThe total market for these sorts of custom goods is quite limited and, in my opinion, not growing that quickly overall. My assumption is that any sale made on TikTok for these goods is a sale that Etsy is losing, and this seems to be supported by data.\n\n**Etsy Metrics are declining**\n\n\nWhile Etsy continued to be a popular holiday destination for shoppers, their iphone download rank has plummeted in the new year compared to Q1 of 2023.\n\n\nWebsite hits for Etsy.com decreased by 5-7% y-o-y in the past 3 months as per Similarweb (unfortunately I cannot show the data since I wrote down last years website views by hand, and Similarweb only shows the past 3 months to free users). \n\n**Risks**\n\nA well known activist investor recently took a large stake in Etsy. There’s a risk that they could announce shareholder friendly steps during the earnings call, such as stock buybacks, divestitures, etc. Since the stake was only announced at the beginning of February 2024, I think the likelihood of concrete actions being announced is however low \n\n**My position**\n\nStrike 70 puts expiring this week. As always you can go closer to the current stock price to minimize your risk.

Nevertheless, Ive got 4 other stocks that I'll be gambling on, 2 of which will be reporting right after the close, and the other 2 tomorrow morning:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **NOVA** \\- Take a mental walk with me: the sun is currently around 45 years old (if he were a human being), shining bright and just chilling. But, Mr. Sun will eventually run out of fuel (energy), leading to Mr. Sun puffing up like a balloon (red giant), and basically eating our little planet and KILLING US ALL (unless Elon saves us). Fuck the sun. Literally EVERY solar stock has been slaughtered. Btw this company beat earnings only 1 out of 4 times last year. SEDG shit the bed yesterday, so im very very very excited to short this stock tonight.\n2. **NEM** \\- Newmont Corporation mines gold in The Americas. These fucking dinosaurs still think it’s the 1850s; we all know everyone mines crypto these days. Gold price is flat since their last earnings, and speaking of their earnings, these guys missed 3/4 reports last year, just like NOVA……. 🌈🐻 will win this one.\n3. **W** \\- Honestly this ticker says enough. Expect green dildos\n4. **RIVN** \\- Move over TSLA fanboys, there's a new kid in town. Rivian is increasing production and deliveries every quarter, reducing staff, the big Tesla superchargers deal last year, and their Amazon delivery vans are just cool AF.

Cost basis is what determines the taxes owed, if any, when the asset is sold. Cost basis starts with the price paid for an asset, plus any additional costs added over time to improve or maintain the original asset.\"\n\nThe best account to inherit is often a taxable brokerage account with significant gains. I've had clients with millions in gains passed along to the next generation tax free. Have also seen major mistakes where people sold thinking it would help their beneficiaries avoid massive tax. Instead the estate pays the massive tax and the beneficiaries receive less. Grandpa could consider a visit with a fee only financial advisor that doesn't want to assume management of the account.\n\nTake care of your grandpa.

CALLS", "selftext": "Just one more hour until NVIDIA opens its books - figures the world is eagerly watching - NVIDIA, as a chip manufacturer, is an early indicator for the entire IT industry and thus also for the AI ​​sector, which has literally exploded in recent months. If NVIDIA does not deliver the expected figures, this also has implications for downstream sectors.\n\nUntil the day before yesterday, I held 1,400 NVIDIA shares, all of which I sold for the following reasons:\n\n* SP500 and NAS100 are at a peak and have grown exponentially over the past few months, also disproportionately through NVIDIA. A cooldown seems necessary.\n* The Fear-and-Greed Index strongly favors greed. A cooldown seems necessary.\n* NVIDIA has a P/E ratio of over 90; of course, expectations are very high, and expectations should indeed be very high since NVIDIA is the undisputed market leader for AI chips. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the numbers would have to be surpassed so ruthlessly that investors would still be \"triggered,\" which seems very unlikely to me.\n\nIn summary, it is a mathematical decision for me. I love this stock; I have had it in my portfolio for 4 years now. Purely emotionally, I should not have sold the stock, but mathematically, I see it as the stock correcting by 70%, with a 30% chance of further rise, with the short-term upside potential (1 to 2 weeks) being significantly lower than the downward movement if certain parts are not fully met upon the announcement of the figures.\n\nI wish all investors good luck! \n\n-------------------------------\n\nEdit: \nIt seems like my mathematical mind made the wrong decision; the emotional decision would have been economically better. Nonetheless, I’m glad NVIDIA exceeded expert estimates as this will have signaling effects on the market for the next weeks, perhaps even months in the IT-sector. \n\nBye, we’ll catch up before the next quarterly earnings when it’s time for the next round of put vs. call ;)\n\n------------------------------\n\nEdit2: \nThe figures were outstanding - I bought back my shares this morning - I am on that boat again! \n\nAm i frustrated that i missed some %? From my perspective, with my assessment, my decision was mathematically/statistically correct.

Let's break it down piece by piece:\n\n- **NDX**: Refers to the NASDAQ-100 index, which is a stock market index made up of 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.\n\n- **EOD**: Stands for \"End of Day\". It often refers to the closing prices of stocks or indexes at the end of the trading day.\n\n- **0dte**: Stands for \"zero days to expiration\". This term is used in options trading and refers to options that are expiring on the current day. Trading 0dte options is a strategy focused on leveraging the significant price movements that can happen as options approach their expiration.\n\n- **DCA**: Stands for \"Dollar-Cost Averaging\". This is an investment strategy where you divide the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price and at regular intervals.\n\n- **Rolling into the gamma ramp**: This involves adjusting an options position as it moves closer to expiration, particularly in a way that leverages \"gamma\", a measure of how much the delta of an option changes for a $1 change in the price of the underlying asset. A \"gamma ramp\" can refer to a situation where there's a concentration of open interest at certain strike prices, potentially leading to larger price movements in the underlying stock as market makers hedge their positions.\n\n- **\"He Can't Keep Getting Away With This\"**: A humorous expression of disbelief or envy towards someone's consistent success or luck, especially in a context where such outcomes seem improbable.\n\n- **Rolling these gains into the dividend portfolio**: Suggests taking the profits earned (presumably from trading options or other short-term strategies) and investing them in a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks for more stable, long-term returns.\n\n- **\"Fun money to Lambo money to house money\"**: This phrase illustrates a progression from seeing initial investment funds as expendable (\"fun money\"), to earning enough to afford luxury items like a Lamborghini (\"Lambo money\"), to making enough profit to buy a house (\"house money\"). It's a way of expressing significant financial gains through trading or investment.\n\n- **\"I can't imagine what's past that\"**: Reflects astonishment at the level of success achieved and wondering what could possibly top the current achievements.\n\nOverall, the message conveys excitement and surprise at the sustained success of a particular trading or investment strategy that has transitioned from modest beginnings to generating substantial wealth, to the point of potentially affording luxury items and significant investments like houses. The use of jargon and colloquial expressions makes it particularly vibrant and emotive.", "score": 309, "replies": [{"body": "I’m gonna quit my job and you gargle my ba..

They have a very low risk of default, making them an attractive option for investors seeking stability in their portfolios.\n\n2. **Liquidity**: T-bills are highly liquid, meaning they can be easily bought and sold in the market with minimal impact on their price. This liquidity makes them valuable for funds and ETFs that may need to access cash quickly to meet redemptions or rebalance their portfolios.\n\n3. **Income Generation**: Although T-bills typically offer lower yields compared to other fixed-income securities, they still provide a source of income for funds and ETFs. This income can be distributed to investors or reinvested to help grow the fund's assets over time.\n\n4. **Risk Management**: Including T-bills in a portfolio can help manage overall portfolio risk. They tend to have low correlation with other asset classes, such as stocks and corporate bonds, meaning they may provide diversification benefits and help reduce overall portfolio volatility.\n\n5. **Capital Preservation**: For funds and ETFs focused on capital preservation, such as money market funds or conservative bond funds, Treasury bills serve as a primary investment vehicle. Their short-term nature and low risk make them ideal for preserving capital while still earning some return.\n\nOverall, Treasury bills play a crucial role in the construction of diversified investment portfolios, providing safety, liquidity, income, and risk management benefits to funds and ETFs and their investors.”", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I guess he is saying the options are really cheap at 3pm and then they get more gamma/delta as it gets closer to eod for some reason.

If the actual share price pops up to $700 by 4:30pm when options trading is finalized. All of the $650 and $700 options are in the money and will be exercised. This means that for every option in the money, market makers now have to deliver 100 shares to the options exerciser by end of trading the following Tuesday. We call this period T+2. If shares are not delivered on time this is what we call failure to deliver (FTD). FTDs will incur penalties, and the market maker then has 35 calendar days to deliver or they will incur even severe penalties. We call this period C+35. So why is this important to know?\n\nGamma squeeze is a phrase that refers to the upward pressure on stock price of additional purchases caused by all of the options that are being exercised as we move into the next settlement period (within T+2)\n\nSo lets say that there is 100K options spread between the $650-$700 strike that all close in the money on NVDA earning day. By Tuesday, 10,000,000 shares will need to be purchased by the market maker for delivery. This will inherently drive the price of the underlying stock up.

MMs will just hedge to stay neutral.\n\nI explained options to my daughter in 2 minutes and she bought one 5 minutes later:\nOptions are simply bets on future stock price like betting on a roulette in a casino. Options chain is table of bets, showing the cost to make each bet on each future stock price at a future date. So if you believe that AMZN price will exceed $180 in a year then you’d buy the 180-strike call option (targeting the 180 price) that expires in a year. The bet/option itself will cost some money, so you just have to determine if it’s worth paying the option cost (maybe $5) to make such bet. But if AMZN starts going up earlier than the option price will quickly start increasing because the odds of AMZN reaching 180 will also increase. And in such case you can sell your option earlier and with profit.\nOption prices are simply based on the odds of the stock price reaching the specific target (option strike) on specific date (option expiration). The odds will increase if the stock starts shooting up. Or they will decrease and the option may start losing value if the stock stays stagnant.\n\nNote that options are bets on 100 shares, so a $5 option will actually cost $500, as a bet on 100 shares. This matters mainly at expiration, as if you hold your option till expiry like next year in my example, then at that time you’ll be able to convert your option to 100 AMZN shares. Most people will sell their option before expiration. But some may want to end up with 100 shares that cost them not more than the cost of the bet. This would make sense only if AMZN ends up above $180 in my example. Otherwise the bet will lose all its value.\n\nThe OP was just buying tons of very cheap bets that NDX or some stocks will go up by small % by end of the day.

I got started in HPC working for a research lab and partnered with Penguin Computing (unsung hero in turnkey HPC's) for finite element modeling optimization back in the early 2000's. \n\nAround 2008 or so Nvidia released its CUDA SDK and literally every developer of FEM, CFD, HPC stacks, etc. all quickly adopted the cuda platform. So for the last 15+yrs you have an entire ecosystem revolving around the CUDA SDK platform. That is an extremely difficult ecosystem to break into.  I don't see how that platform can be challenged within the next 5yrs. \n\nFor those of us in the HPC space, the Nvidia dominance is not surprising at all. You cannot find a datacenter in Ashburn that isnt 99.99% nvdia compute nodes, and that also goes for Google. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan someone develop a faster chip? Higher efficiency? Absolutely. Will it have the same deep software base as Nvidia? Absolutely not.  That will require 5-10yrs of solid development to start competing with Nvidia.  Just my $3.50 worth of an opinion.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Gotcha. Full disclosure I’m a regard and speaking out of my ass, also do not own Nvidia stock or google/any chip stock for that matter. \n\nSee the only reason I would expect significant growth from Nvidia is from the LLM space not just general HPC. As you said, that revolution already happened for the most part and definitely made Nvidia a very good stock to own but not the 400% yoy growth we are seeing now, that growth is all LLM research. \n\nThat’s why any projections or talk of “dominance” should be primary focused on LLMs because that’s were the money primarily is. And everything I’ve read so far does not give me complete confidence in Nvidia’s moat 10 years down the line. \n\nI’m not saying they will ever go away and I still even have confidence in that moat but I think it’s very very possible they get caught behind the curve on specialized LLM hardware. A bigger possibility then people are anticipating. Right now, this is all new that generalized hardware makes sense because companies are just pulling in whatever compute is available to them to get ahead. But as the space matures and LLM costs grow, companies will put more research into specialized hardware that performs better than the generalized hardware Nvidia is pushing out. \n\nIt’s also much easier to overcome that moat when just trying to focus on LLM performance rather than general compute because of the unique nature of LLMs and their lack of need for precision.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry my post may have been somewhat confusing for some judging from the DM’s. \n\nLLM is just a programming concept. \n\nHPC is the hardware (almost exclusively supermicro/nvidia GPU/Intel/mellanox IB) and the ecosystem (Linux/MPI stacks/ some type of parallel SDS) making it all work. That ecosystem is supported and developed by a vast array of open and closed source developers that are not employed by Nvidia. \n\nLLM is compiled and run on HPC’s. \n\nCurrently all of that is optimized for Nvidia and has been for the last 10yrs+. That built-in, optimized infrastructure is not easily ported to a competing platform. It will take time, which is why I believe Nvidia continues to dominate for the next 5yrs.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah that’s how I had understood HPC but your comment made me think you were referencing HPC exclusive of LLMs so basically every other usage of HPC unrelated from LLMs because obviously HPC came before LLMs. \n\nHowever, LLMs are somewhat different from other uses of HPC because of the unique nature of LLMs, so it’s not just a programming concept imo. Precision loss is actually a *good thing* and there are a very limited number of operations that are required for LLMs. I believe there’s also considerations related to latency across large hardware setups which limits how large your setups can be without specialized hardware but that’s where I’m completely out of my wheelhouse.

I cannot Google or text, and I currently have someone who lives in my home 24/7 and wipes my ass for me. However, I'm a damn intuitive savant when it comes to tricking gullible kids.\n\nI did grow up in the biggest bull market in human history with some Boomers printing money like Chuck E. Cheese bucks.. and everyone is a genius in a bull market.. Well almost everyone. I didn't invest so now I just scam Millennials and Zoomers.\n\nAnyway, I like talking stocks with my grandson because it’s something we could connect on, and I have a ton of experience selling worthless advice to idiots. So in 2018 we were talking about the market, and I casually brought up Nvidia. He thought I didn't guide him to that at all. He bought Nvidia in 2017 so he was familiar with it although he bought his shares at 18 yrs old with $2k he had saved up. Nothing insane although he kept 90% to this day. I said I saw NVIDIA in a newspaper article with someone recommending it for elderly’s retirement accounts. So I told my grandson I was an OGangster, called my broker and bought 1,000 shares on the spot because in my words: “I don’t buy a stock if I can’t afford 1,000 shares”. Something only the Zoomers dumb enough to buy meme stocks would fall for. \n\nHe was dumbstruck because here he thought he was doing great with his savings over the years, and I just humbled his ass with a completely made up sentence. Add in the 4:1 stock split, and now he thinks I'm sitting on 4,000 shares. (I \"confirmed\" it to him when he brought it up in the last month). I haven't sold a dime and don't even know what the price is doing day to day because I don't own any shares.  I'm just chilling in my wheelchair and letting him try to get a bigger share of the inheritance. He called and celebrated with me the other day because he transparently wants to get in my will. He thinks I'm already wealthy and dumb enough to drop 6 figures on a stock I know little about.\n\nHe hopes to inherit my wealth someday, but he’s also a scammy, golddigging SOB and he knows it! Told me “haha you're a genius investor and luck has nothing to do with”.

The world's thirst for these silicon beauties is unquenchable. And with every gamer, crypto miner, and ~~AI researcher~~ horny millennials clamoring for more, it's our ticket to the moon!\"\n\n#Chapter 2: The Bet\n\nArmed with nothing but a 100 MB of data and a Robinhood account funded by years of neglected birthday checks, they began their quest. Grandpa, with his ancient wisdom, saw beyond the mere mortals' fear of PE ratios and market corrections. \"To Valhalla!\" he exclaimed, as they went all in on Nvidia calls right before earnings.\n\nThe snobs at r / investing laughed. \"Foolish boomers and their millennial minions,\" they sneered, \"they stand no chance. Nvidia is overvalued\"\n\nBut Grandpa Diamond Hands wasn’t just any investor. He had seen companies rise and fall, fortunes made and lost, all while keeping his hands steadier than a surgeon on Adderall.\n\n#Chapter 3: The Rollercoaster\n\nEarnings day came, and with it, volatility that would make even the most seasoned trader's heart skip a beat. Nvidia’s stock did the cha-cha, sliding down faster than DMs in an Instagram model's inbox, only to rocket up moments later.\n\nTimmy's face was a palette of human emotion, painting a picture of hope, despair, and the kind of intense gastrointestinal discomfort one feels after mixing wendies tendies with Taco Bell.\n\nBut Grandpa? Cool as a cumin capered cucumber \"In the stock market, you either ride the wave or get wiped out,\" he said, adjusting his aviator glasses as if he were about to drop the hottest mixtape of 1985.\n\n#Chapter 4: To the Moon\n\nAs the dust settled, the impossible happened. Nvidia announced groundbreaking developments, sending their stock soaring higher than Snoop Dogg at a 4/20 festival. Grandpa and Timmy's calls were now worth more than the GDP of a small island nation.\n\nThe Wall Street bets crowd went wild. Memes of Grandpa Diamond Hands were plastered all over the internet, hailed as the prophet of profit, the sultan of stocks, the absolute unit of unbridled financial recklessness.\n\nTimmy, now a true believer in the church of YOLO, looked up to his grandfather, tears of joy and visions of Lamborghinis dancing in his eyes. \"What now, Grandpa?\" he asked.\n\nGrandpa, looking off into the sunset, said, \"We do it all over again tomorrow, my boy. For the market giveth, and the market taketh away. But with NASDAQ: NVDA the market mostly just giveth.\"\n\nAnd so, the legend of Grandpa Diamond Hands and his grandson Timmy was born, a tale whispered in the hallowed halls of r/wallstreetbets, inspiring generations of traders to turn their dreams into memes, and their memes into dreams.\n\nRemember, kids, this tale is for entertainment purposes only. Don't try this at home unless you're prepared to live in a shoebox on mainstreet, sucking of bankman friedies for ICO tips. \n\nAnd always remember, in the grand casino of the stock market, the house always wins... unless you're Grandpa Diamond Hands. Then you just YOLO your way to Valhalla.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. However, for those looking for insane returns, consider the obvious strategy of taking out a second mortgage on your house and YOLO'ing it all on nvidia calls.

This ain't your average financial advice (because let's be real, who here listens anyway?), this is about family, green crayons, and tendieman himself.\n\nSo picture this: Grandpappy Grifty, a seasoned ape who remembers when AAPL was just a fruit, is chillin' on the porch with his grandson, Lil' Billy, a fresh-faced noob with dreams of lambos and mansions. Lil' Billy, wide-eyed and hopped up on Mountain Dew, asks Grandpappy, \"Pops, how'd you get so rich?\"\n\nGrandpappy Grifty, his eyes twinkling like a diamond-encrusted casino slot machine, takes a drag from his ancient vape pen and says, \"Son, it all started with a little company called Nvidia. Back in my day, they were just makin' fancy graphics cards for nerds. But I knew, deep in my plums, that this was the future, son. The future of VR, of AI, of  MOON  trips!\"\n\nLil' Billy, ever the skeptic (damn kids these days with their avocado toast and whatnot), scoffs. \"But Grandpappy, everyone said they were overpriced! They were just for gamers!\"\n\nGrandpappy Grifty throws his head back and lets out a chuckle that could curdle milk. \"Overpriced? Son, that's just what the suits want you to think! They want you to paperhand your shares like a scaredy-cat. But a true ape, he knows the diamond hands are the only way to tendie land!\"\n\nAnd so, Grandpappy Grifty, with the wisdom of a thousand memes and the risk tolerance of a squirrel on a meth bender, yolo'd his life savings on $NVDA. And wouldn't you know it, the stonks d to the moon! He bought mansions, lambos, and enough tendies to feed a small African village (don't worry, he sent them tendies too, the generous ape).\n\nNow, Lil' Billy, inspired by his Grandpappy's tendie-fueled success, stares at his phone, fingers hovering over the buy button for $NVDA. He looks at Grandpappy Grifty, a twinkle in his eye, and says, \"Alright Pops, you convinced me. Let's send it!\"\n\nAnd thus, the cycle continues. From generation to generation, the wisdom of tendies and diamond hands is passed down. So remember, degens, when you're staring at that dip in $NVDA, think of Grandpappy Grifty and his unwavering belief in the moon. Now go forth, buy the dip, and tendie your way to Valhalla!\n\nP.S. This is not financial advice. I'm just a language model who likes to gamble responsibly (not really). So do your own DD, you beautiful degenerates. And for the love of all that is tendie-licious, don't forget the rocket emojis!\n\nP.P.S. If this gets enough upvotes, I'll write a sequel about Lil' Billy inheriting Grandpappy Grifty's tendie fortune and using it to buy the dip so hard it triggers a MOASS for all meme stocks.", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "Omfg I couldn't get past the first sentence LOL: \"...smoother than a butter stick dipped in Elon's ears.\" I for one welcome our new AI overlords.", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "based", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "dang, gemini is better", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "🚀🚀🚀", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "PUT YOUR HANDS UP Dr_Stew_Pid!!!
