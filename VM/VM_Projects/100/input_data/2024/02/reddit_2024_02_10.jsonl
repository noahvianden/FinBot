{"title": "Purely in theory, why would anyone ever buy a stock that doesn't pay dividends (in a perfect market)?", "selftext": "*Disclaimer: I am quite new to investing/trading and just recently learned about how to value a company and P/E and DCF and so on, so this question may be very stupid.*\n\nSo the reason one buys a stock, ignoring voting rights and other such immaterial gains, is because one expects a return on the investment that in a couple years will be higher than the initial investment.\n\nFor a dividend stock this is very easy: say the stock has a P/E of 10, so you pay 10$ today for 1$ of todays earnings. So to keep it simple, we assume the company's cashflow is the same as the earnings and the dividends are the same as the cashflow and that there is no growth, your investment will have paid off in 10 years just through dividends.\n\nNow add to that the fact that you usually choose a company that grows in earnings and the fact that you can sell this stock to someone else at a higher price and suddenly your investment will pay off much sooner.\n\nBut now take a stock where the company has publicly stated that they will never pay a dividend, such as ACM Research when I was going through one of their SEC filings. In this case no matter if you hold the stock for 1 day or 100 years, no matter if the company's earnings double every year, you will never see a cent of it. In fact, your investment will have lost money through inflation and cost of opportunity.\n\nSo why then do people buy these stocks? To sell them to someone else later. Okay. But why do those other ones buy the stock then? To sell them to someone else later. Okay, but... - you get the point? To me it seems like the greater fool theory at work. You always count on there being another fool to buy the stock off of you.\n\nBut if this were a perfect market (it's not) where everyone collectively agrees that non-dividend stocks have no value because they won't ever give you a single cent in returns, then nobody would ever buy such a stock off of you, and the stock's price would collapse. It doesn't matter then how much the company may grow in valuation because nobody will ever see a cent from it.\n\nNow this doesn't apply if you count on the company paying dividends in the future after the growth phase, or it doing a share buyback or such things. But that is why I took the example of a company that has stated that it will never do such a thing, such as ACM Research.\n\nSo then, why would anyone ever buy such a stock in a perfect market? What am I missing here?\n\n**EDIT: Alot of people don't seem to get that my question is purely theoretical in nature assuming a perfect market. I get that in real-life thongs work differently. That is why I have several non-dividend paying stocks on my watchlist, including the aforementioned one.**\n\n**But I have also been told that shareholders if they have enough voting power can overrule a company's management and successfully demand the payment of dividends. So in that case then that answers the question even in a perfect market.**\n\n**EDIT2:**\n\n**Another excellent point on why people would buy such a stock even in a perfect market:**\n\n> You need to understand that if you own 100% of stocks then you own the full company. If the company is profitable, there will be people interested in owning it, willing to pay a good price for the stock, pushing the price higher. The more profitable the company is, the more people will be interested in owning the company or at least some part of it. If you buy a stock then at some point someone will want to buy it from you because they will want to get their voting rights from 40% to 60%, something like that\n\n**I think my question has been sufficiently answered then. Thank you.**\n\n**EDIT3:**\n\n**Another reason:**\n\n> The one caveat to this would be the potential for a buy-out. Some small companies don't pay dividends, but are likely to be bought out at some point by a larger company for a price that will be returned to shareholders in cash or new equity.\n\nEDIT4: (last one lol)\n\nHonestly I had a \"conversation\" with ChatGPT about it yesterday and it didnt even give me one of those answers, only one of the many other answers I already got here that didnt really adress the issue...\n", "id": "1anmhm4", "created_utc": 1707588786.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 214, "comments": [{"body": "That is actually the view that Mr. Wonderful has, if it doesn‚Äôt pay a dividend it is valueless.

{"title": "Alright dipshits, the fun and games are over.", "selftext": "Well, well, well‚Ä¶you regards just think you‚Äôre a bunch of geniuses. Buying calls on the hottest stocks In the world for the last two weeks has paid you pretty well, eh? Where the fuck were you in October? That‚Äôs right, you were scared of a new bear market and calling for a break below $400. Here we are now at the coveted $500 level. Fuck you Tom Lee, you got one right after 2 years of being wrong. \n\nWell guess what, the fun and games are over. And just for that stunt, you‚Äôre going to get some extra homework. I‚Äôm going to name all the reasons why this party is nearing its finale and we‚Äôll soon see how this next 12-18 months unfolds. \n\n1. The amount of euphoria across all social medias, news outlets, and even word of mouth is insane. I have friends asking if it‚Äôs time to buy $NVDA calls up here. We are so absolutely fucked very soon\n2. Majority of bears have capitulated and gone bullish, I don‚Äôt hear any more $SPY $300 by March calls anymore, much less whispers of a recession. \n3. The economic stimulus pummeled up our ass for the last 3 years has kept the facade going. Trump pumped 4 trillion during Covid before leaving office which gave us our first bubble. Then Biden gave us an insane ‚Äúinflation reduction act‚Äù which pumped billions into infrastructure which has kept industrials like $CAT $DEERE reaching new 52W highs. All of that HAS to stop soon as we‚Äôve reached $34 TRILLION in debt which far our passes our current GDP estimates. Guess what happens when GDP declines? We‚Äôre Uber fucked. And no I‚Äôm not talking about that fat pig $UBER that‚Äôs also pumped for the sole reason they charge 25% fees on my Wendy‚Äôs delivery orders. Greedy cunts. \n4. Following up on the point above, very soon the market will have to price in that the charade is over with the debt ceiling and slowing growth will accelerate this bubble popping faster than you can hit the sell button. \n5. Majority of stocks aren‚Äôt really doing shit. Equal $SP500 is flat after 2 years, 39% of stocks are back under their 50 DMA. We are literally being pumped to new highs by a few monopoly stocks that aren‚Äôt even growing that fast. $AAPL is growing at ~3% trading at 35 PE lmao \n\nThe list can go on and we all see it but nobody cares because it‚Äôs fun to pump stocks and make shit loads of money off it. Believe me, I have too but it‚Äôs coming to an end very soon. My prediction for the next 6-18 months: \n\n1. We see a correction within the next 2 weeks begin to take us down 10%. By the end of March, we‚Äôll find our footing and small caps will pump hard into a potential rate cut in May. By this point, I think things will be very close to breaking if not breaking already. The fed will cut rates and that will be the trigger for Qs to start dumping. Your mag 7 stocks will decline 30-40% within 3-6 months of the first cut.\n2. Fast forward 3 months from the first rate cut and things are getting worse. More layoffs, slowing growth, more missed earnings. The fed will cut again and again and beg for the government to pass more stimulus. It won‚Äôt come. If they do, it will only fuck us more. See China for example \n3. Fast forward 9-12months from the rate cut and we may finally see our true bottom with the $NVDA bubble popped, tech back at reasonable levels, and many many people fucked.\n4. I predict the next bull market will begin in 2026 and be a very slow recovery. No more v shape bullshit\n\nIn the end, I‚Äôm staying patient but preparing for the inevitable. I‚Äôm raising cash, buying far out puts for the first dips coming soon and starting to go heavier into $CHYNA names. I think the money will pump there and India once the U.S finally goes in the shitter. Oh and btw, if you guys liked 0Dte call gamma squeeze on the way up, wait till you see it on the way down!

No company controls the entire supply of manufacturing & distribution. Quite the opposite.\n\nApple's \"engineered in Cupertino,\" but made in China, is a prime example. Microsoft machines aren't made here either. They are also not the only computers to exist.\n\nTherefore, their product lines are not sole provisions, and competitors are abundant, especially based on brands which are segmented in various ways.\n\nThe only actual \"monopoly\" present in our market is the market itself. As far as investment is concerned, no private companies stand a chance because at some inevitable point they grow to such a scale that they are either acquired, dependant on public companies for their sales revenues, or retirement plans like 401k's become invested in the major indexes which renders such a private company again, tied to the stock market.\n\nAll of the major companies on the market, and their competitors, are majority controlled by the same financial institutions, which is yet another anticompetitive measure of control, and those several capital conglomerates all own parts of each other.\n\nLook at the last several recessions and what the market has \"learned\" from them, in reverse, to see what would be required to cause an actual correction on this given course, without a serious societal change.\n\n2020, an \"invisible enemy,\" was falsified in order to induce several years of mania buying, and causes societal upheaval, but it only produced normal gains despite looking like all-time highs.\n\n2008, the last time a recession was caused by a 30 year long scam to force gigantic investments onto people via mortgages, which are a physical product (the house at least) which means it can't be falsified the same way things which are claimed to be invisible do.\n\n2001, the \"dot-com\" bubble burst, but wasn't actually recognized until a terroristic act of war occurred directly on American soil, at the heart of the economic center. A technological investment scheme was predicated here on 2 syllables - dot com - which brings us back to the potential recession (more likely depression, given a delayed economic onset from the other recessions unrealized losses) caused by another 2 syllables:\n\nAI. Not unlike the most recent 2 syllable \"cause\" of recession - COVID - the American public does not seem capable of awakening to the long-term necessity for a recess of perceived growth, especially when it is coinciding with real losses like jobs or savings.\n\nThat (war, as an economic downturn mechanism) is the only thing Americans seem to talk about believing in and it is the lowest resolution but highest impact event that can stun the public long enough to enact a correction.\n\nSad, but true.

NVIDIA is terrified of doing cost to performance comparisons for large cloud AI acceleration and their market share in this aspect will only go down as companies with better 1st party data center integration continue to improve their offerings.\n\nAnd you have to remember. Training is not where the vast majority of cost is. The vast majority of cost is inference over time, where NVIDIA is already getting crushed. Where NVIDIA shines is smaller local applications where it is more reasonable price and you may not need as much hardware. It is easier for NVIDIA to get to consumers early, but at scale... they are going to get swept in the coming decade.\n\nMy canonical example is this. AWS's Graviton instances. Sure AWS will still host Intel and AMD servers. But at some point they can begin offering their own products with similar or better performance at much lower cost. At some point their internal offerings will begin competing even more heavily and the price to performance ratio for going NVIDIA will not make sense.

In Zones 7 and 8, choose a shady site or one with morning sun only, as tulips don‚Äôt like a lot of heat.\n\nThe soil must be well-draining, neutral to slightly acidic, fertile, and dry or sandy. All tulips dislike areas with excessive moisture. Prepare the garden bed by using a garden fork or tiller to loosen the soil to a depth of 12 to 15 inches, then mix in a 2- to 4-inch layer of compost.\n\nTall varieties should be sheltered from strong winds.\n\nWhen to Plant Tulips\n\nPlant tulip bulbs in the fall, 6 to 8 weeks before a hard, ground-freezing frost is expected. The bulbs need time to establish themselves. Planting too early leads to disease problems. See local frost dates. \nA good rule of thumb is to plant bulbs when the average nighttime temperatures in your area are in the 40s.\nIn colder northern climates, plant in September or October. In warmer climates, plant bulbs in December (or even later).\nTo find the best dates, consult our fall bulb planting chart.\nNature never intended bulbs to loll about above ground, so don‚Äôt delay planting the bulbs after purchase.\nIn southern climates with mild winters, plant bulbs in late November or December. The bulbs will need to be chilled in the refrigerator for about 12 weeks before planting. (Bulb suppliers often offer pre-chilled bulbs for sale, too.)\nIf you miss planting your bulbs at the optimal time, don‚Äôt wait for spring or next fall. Bulbs aren‚Äôt like seeds. Even if you find an unplanted sack of tulips or daffodils in January or February, plant them and take your chances. See more about planting tulips in winter. \nHow to Plant Tulips\n\nPlant bulbs fairly deep‚Äî8 inches deep, or about three times the height of the bulb. Dig a hole deeper than that in order to loosen the soil and allow for drainage. In clay soils, plant 3 to 6 inches deep instead.\nSpace bulbs 4 to 6 inches apart.\nSet the bulb in the hole with the pointy end up. Cover with soil and press soil firmly.\nWater bulbs right after planting. Although they can‚Äôt bear wet feet, bulbs need water to trigger growth.\nIf you‚Äôre planning to raise perennial tulips, feed them a balanced fertilizer when you plant them in the fall. Bulbs are their own complete storage system and contain all of the nutrients they need for one year. Use organic material, compost, or a balanced time-release bulb food.\nTo deter mice and moles‚Äîif they have been a problem‚Äîput holly or any other thorny leaves in the planting holes. Some gardeners use kitty litter or crushed gravel. If ravenous voles and rodents are a real problem, you may need to take stronger measures, such as planting bulbs in buried wire cages.\nDon‚Äôt lose hope if you‚Äôre planting your tulips later in the season‚Äîjust follow these tips.\nYellow tulips in a tulip garden\nGROWING\nIf it rains weekly, do not water. However, if there is a dry spell and it does not rain, you should water the bulbs weekly until the ground freezes. \nRainy summers, irrigation systems, and wet soil are death to tulips. Never deliberately water a bulb bed unless in a drought. Wet soil leads to fungus and disease and can rot bulbs. Add shredded pine bark, sand, or any other rough material to the soil to foster swift drainage.\nApply compost annually to provide nutrients needed for future blooms.\nIn the spring, when leaves emerge, feed your tulip the same bulb food or bone meal you used at planting time. Water well.\nDeadhead tulips as soon as they go by, but do not remove the leaves!\nAllow the leaves to remain on the plants for about 6 weeks after flowering. The tulips need their foliage to gather energy for next year‚Äôs blooms! After the foliage turns yellow and dies back, it can be pruned off.\nLarge varieties may need replanting every few years; small types usually multiply and spread on their own.", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Fuck tulips, I play the gourd market", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Ornamental only", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "That‚Äôs where the dreams come true", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Looks like the latest on the TheEmperorOfJenks is he has a EU travel ban.
