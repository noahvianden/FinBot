As the US planemaker works through its latest crisis tied to manufacturing lapses, a new risk looms: a labor rift 10 years in the making.\n\nBoeing’s largest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, is still smarting over a 2014 deal that sacrificed pensions, locked in minimal raises and tied the hands of activists for a decade. Union leaders will demand a 40% pay raise over three or four years, emboldened by a resurgent US labor movement, a scarcity of qualified aerospace workers and pressure on Boeing to stabilize work in its factories. \n\n“Our goal is to negotiate a contract that we as a union leadership and our members can accept,” said Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, which represents 32,000 Seattle-area Boeing mechanics. “We don’t take going on strike lightly. But we’re willing to do it.”\n\nHolden sees a path to a successful deal with Boeing, he said in an interview. Even so, he’s prepared to follow the lead of auto workers in Detroit, writers and actors in Hollywood, and fellow machinists at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. in Kansas. Each emerged from walkouts last year with significant improvements in pay and other contract terms. \n\nA strike would shut down Boeing plants in Washington and Oregon, including assembly lines for its cash-cow 737 jets, crimping output after the current IAM contract expires in September. \n\nWith talks set to start on March 8, labor tensions will add to the scrutiny on Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun. He already faces questions from lawmakers and investors over a spate of manufacturing problems — the latest, an issue with holes misdrilled by Spirit — while the Federal Aviation Administration has stepped up its oversight and capped production increases for the 737 until quality improves.\n\n“We remain focused on working with our teams to strengthen quality across our operations,” Boeing said in a statement. “We believe there’s a path to a new contract that addresses the needs and concerns of our people while maintaining our ability to compete in the global market.”\n\n**10-Year Grudge**\n\nThe tactics Boeing used a decade ago to wrest pension concessions and limit pay increases to less than 1% on average loom large over the coming negotiations — they were still in place when inflation soared post-Covid. \n\n“There’s no loyalty because Boeing wasn’t particularly loyal,” said analyst Richard Aboulafia. “Now the labor markets have shifted radically, and they may stay that way for a long time.”\n\nBack then, the aviation titan held crucial leverage over its Seattle-area workforce: a hulking new jet program known as the 777X. The company’s commitment to its century-old base was in question after Boeing had begun assembling 787 Dreamliners in South Carolina a year earlier. \n\nTo force the IAM into contract talks that included freezing pensions, Boeing threatened to take the 777X program out of the Seattle area, inviting states around the US to compete for the factory. \n\nWhile local IAM leaders saw a bluff, senior union staff in Washington, DC, took over the talks and backed down. The narrowly approved deal that resulted preserved jobs, but the fixed-pension plan was ended, and pay raises totaled 4% over the next decade. \n\n“The anger that was experienced by our membership throughout that process in 2013 and 2014 is certainly palpable today,” Holden said. “I hear it any time I’m in the factory, and from all across the spectrum.”\n\nAs it prepares for the coming talks, Boeing doesn’t have a new plane to use as a bargaining chip, and with unemployment rates near record lows, it can’t threaten to shift manufacturing to the South. The company can ill-afford a work stoppage as it tries to steady its factories and suppliers, and return output to a steady, reliable pace. \n\nThe union holds the upper hand, said Ken Herbert, analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “If there’s really a time to strike a deal that works for them, it’s now,” he said. “They’re going to be very, very aggressive.”\n\nBoeing last week declined to give a financial outlook for this year, though it held to a target of generating free cash flow of $10 billion in 2025 or 2026, a goal at risk of being trashed by a prolonged work stoppage.\n\nA labor deal could also be costly. Every 10% increase in machinist wages will drag down 2026 free cash flow by an estimated $260 million before price and productivity offsets, according to Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst with Jefferies.\n\nThere’s further uncertainty with US regulators digging deeper into Boeing’s quality practices after the structural blowout on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 on Jan. 5. Its suppliers, who are gathered in the Seattle area this week, must also weigh whether to risk a continued ramp-up of production.  \n\nThe machinists intend to use their leverage to push for more than the usual economic concessions. Holden wants Boeing to reinstate thousands of quality inspections it suspended last decade. And he plans to press executives to commit to making planes in Seattle for decades. \n\nBoeing says it restored the inspections, and has increased the number of quality inspectors in its commercial division by 20% since 2019.\n\nThe union also plans to press for the return of defined-benefit pensions, lower out-of-pocket health costs and more flexibility around overtime. The IAM local has been studying the tactics employed last year by the United Auto Workers, including striking at selective locations, Holden said.\n\n“We need jobs for 50 years, not four years,” Holden said.\n\nThere’s a link between Boeing’s labor pains and the quality lapses that prompted US regulators and airline customers to send auditors into the planemaker’s factories after the Alaska Airlines accident, said Cliff Collier, a consultant with decades of aerospace manufacturing experience. \n\nBoeing’s recent struggles are rooted in turnover, he said: an influx of inexperienced workers and managers since the pandemic, and labor tactics that led to an earlier exodus of seasoned staff, Collier said.\n\n“People don’t get stupider,” Collier said. “People get overworked, people get pushed to do things they probably shouldn’t do.”", "id": "1akb16h", "created_utc": 1707229754.0, "score": 800, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 230, "comments": [{"body": "> The tactics Boeing used a decade ago to wrest pension concessions and limit pay increases to less than 1% on average loom large over the coming negotiations — they were still in place when inflation soared post-Covid. \n\n...

However they come up with this explanation:\n\n>It is possible that the household survey is giving the more accurate read on employment—that even though its sample size is smaller, it could be providing a better reflection of the job market than the employer survey is. But considering the strong job-market signals coming from other sources, such as the weekly initial-jobless-claims figures the Labor Department collects from state programs, that seems unlikely.\n\n>What might be happening instead is that the Census Bureau data that the Labor Department relies on are underestimating how quickly the population is growing, and that has led it to undercount employment in the household survey. In an update last month, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the U.S. population rose by 0.9% in 2023 from a year earlier, versus a Census estimate of 0.5%—a difference driven by the CBO’s much larger estimate of net immigration to the U.S. last year.

{"title": "Snap plunges 25% on revenue miss and light guidance, as Middle East conflict creates ‘headwind’", "selftext": "Snap reported revenue that trailed analysts’ estimates on Tuesday and issued a forecast that came in a bit below Wall Street expectations. The stock plunged 20% in extended trading.\n\nHere’s how the company did:\n\nEarnings per share: 8 cents, adjusted, vs. 6 cents expected by analysts, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.38 billion expected, according to LSEG.\n\nGlobal Daily Active Users: 414 million vs. 412 million expected, according to StreetAccount.\n\nAverage revenue per user: $3.29 vs. $3.33 expected, according to StreetAccount.\n\n\nSnap has struggled to rebound from the downturn in the digital ad market, and has now reported six straight quarters of single-digit growth or sales declines. For the fourth quarter, revenue rose about 5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier.\n\nFor the second consecutive period, Snap attributed some of the weakness to the war in the Middle East, which erupted in October beginning with Hamas’s attack on Israel.\n\n“While we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our ad platform and the improved results we are delivering for many of our advertising partners, we estimate that the onset of the conflict in the Middle East was a headwind to year-over-year growth of approximately 2 percentage points in Q4,” Snap said in a letter to investors.\n\nGrowth is expected to accelerate in the first quarter, but not quite as fast as analysts were expecting. Snap forecast sales for the quarter of $1.095 billion to $1.135 billion, representing about 11% growth at the midpoint of the range, which was $1.115 billion. Analysts were looking for revenue of $1.117 billion.\n\nDaily active users for the first quarter will be 420 million, Snap said, slightly topping analyst estimates of 419.3 million.\n\nEarlier this week, Snap said it would cut 10% of its global workforce, which equates to about 500 employees. A company spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the cuts were intended to reorganize staff and “reduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration.” In mid-2022, Snap eliminated about 1,000 employees, or 20% of its fulltime workforce.\n\nSnap’s net loss for the quarter narrowed to $248.2 million, or 15 cents a share, which represents a 14% year-over-year decrease from $288.5 million, or 18 cents a share.\n\nSnap said it expects an adjusted EBITDA loss between $55 million to $95 million in the first quarter, higher than analyst projections of $21.9 million. Last quarter, Snap issued an “internal forecast” for the fourth quarter instead of providing official guidance because of “the unpredictable nature of war,” referring to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nSnap on Tuesday disclosed sales its its Snapchat+ subscription service for the first time and said it had an annualized revenue run rate of $249 million in 2023. The service now has 7 million subscribers, up from five million in the previous quarter. Snap introduced the product in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to access early features. It came debuted that summer for $3.99 a month.\n\nSnap’s growth in the fourth quarter lagged larger digital ad rivals like Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, which all reported double-digit expansion in their advertising units.\n\nSnap and Pinterest are “much smaller companies that have struggled to build substantial ad businesses, Debra Aho Williamson, an industry analyst, told CNBC. “In this environment, the big are getting bigger,”\n\nLast week, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel attended a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and technology alongside Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,  X CEO Linda Yaccarino, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and Discord CEO Jason Citron. Lawmakers grilled the executives, accusing them of failing to properly safeguard their respective platforms from child predators, among other concerns.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/06/snap-earnings-q4-2023.html", "id": "1akkww1", "created_utc": 1707254213.0, "score": 467, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "snap always plunges on earnings. what a shitty stock", "score": 393, "replies": [{"body": "They used to go first and cause a selloff in GOOG and META, nice of them to go last now.", "score": 192, "replies": [{"body": "But I mean.

Go back 5 years in the past and observe the delta.  But do it with a sober, rational, critical think view.  Not a fanboy hype one.  \n\nThink of what we and the world were doing 5 years ago compared to now.  I'll tell you.  We were waiting for a very incrementally different camera lens on the iPhone.  People were claiming Apple is secretly developing a car.  People were using Netflix and bitching about it.  Netflix was fudging the numbers by obstructing sun numbers and pushing through price increases,  People were being ripped off on concert tickets.  An insane game host turned politician was pushing daily disinformation sourced from Russia propaganda farms, and he was being challenged by his septuagenarian institutional opposite.  Conservatives were trying to ban books and content creators for being w-one.  Nvidia stock had split because it rose so much.  Crypto was being hyped but nobody could articulate a real use for it.  Boeing executives were lying and failing to make safe planes.  News media was doing superficial stories for clicks.  Autocorrect was faulty.  Siri was a crapshoot. China was both a world power to fear, and yet a basket case that might submarine the economy.  Putin was invading neighbors, most of the world was just letting him, and he was killing his opponents.\n\nOk, now zoom back to the present day and be honest, truly honest: how much has changed in 5 years?  That's how much change you can expect to see by 2029.  \n\nDo the same delta check on a 10 year window.  Surprise, we were watching (checks notes) Netflix, fanboys were way too excited about their iPhones.  Phones needed to be charged every day.  GTA was the biggest video game, PlayStation was edging out Xbox for desirability.  Movie studios were relying on too many sequels.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Colbert and Seth brought us our news parodies.  Social media was a time suck of superficial and self-indulgent junk.  China and Russia were threats.  Middle East was unstable.  And so on.

My portfolio is now a bit unhealthy with >20% NVDA, at an average price of 360.  \n\nListen to Gerstner, he has his finger on the pulse. Listen to Altman… I noted in this post a week ago that he’s searching the world for Gazillionares to invest in fab facilities… believing there is not enough capacity for the expansion of AI without it. (He says). He’s talking into the 2030s!! \n\nOn Friday, finally, the press pushed out a more detailed story, noting that Altman is looking for “trillion$” to ensure the world will have enough capacity. Shoot, I’ve been hearing of TSMCs new factory in Arizona for years now. It’s still not in operation. How long would it take Altman to get new factories up and running? This story then, just shows the commanding position NVDA is in now. What if they loose half of their market? Then they will still have 80% of the market …that’s running a deficit in needed production for the next decade or longer!\n\nA week or two earlier, Bloomberg ran a short clip of Jensen Huang in Singapore where he noted that he’s received calls from “countries“ who wish to get advice on how the technology may help to manage their data. \n\nSo while I have a rather concentrated position (for me), I’m not sure I really have enough Nvidia. I’m sure shorts and funds will take it down sometime, and since it is now the bellwether, most of the rest of my portfolio will also suffer in sympathy. However, when countries are calling …and insiders are worried about chip shortages into the next decade; I am hard pressed not to think we all should be buying here too.  I think we will see 1000 before year end. I’m just not so sure we don’t see 500 before we see 1500 when they get the courage to pull the rug out. But when they do, we all should take advantage.\n\nOn this note, it sure would be nice if they split some of these stocks.

Our whole economy is riding on chip fabrication stability.  All the governments of the world know this.  That is why China would not dare invade Taiwan until at least '27.  AMAT, ASML, TSMC, and NVDA have a huge stake of the vertically integrated supply chain.

Further, Tesla still has plenty of room to drop prices if needed.\n\nNot expecting a huge production ramp for Cybertruck this year. Doesn't need to be. They only need a small bit of growth to hit 2.2M. And that growth still seems likely even excluding Cybertruck. CT just makes the goal easier.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "So far price cuts have overwhelmed any token price increases because Tesla is struggling to sell out their production. That’s why you see deliveries<production for 6 out of the last 7 quarters and massive price cuts.\n\nPeople think it’s all interest rates, but other automakers are selling well even in high interest rate environment. I’m not convinced there will be a huge bounce. Anyway, the Fed is projecting only 0.75% reduction in interest rates in 2024, the market projects 1.25% reduction starting in May. So we will likely only see rates come down in second half of the year and not that much.\n\n2.2M is 550k per quarter, which is 13% higher than Q4.

So that indicates that prices will not need to be cut drastically just to maintain sales. And with interest rates dropping, even by a bit, it makes purchasing easier. Plus they do have the ability to cut prices without sacrificing margins.\n\nTesla grew by nearly 40% last year. 2.2M is less than 25% growth this year. And as you pointed out, less than 15% over their current sales for last quarter. They don't need to do as much to grow just that little bit. Further, Tesla has maintained consistent daily inventory over the past few quarters, even bringing it down slightly last quarter. \n\nAnd again, this all excludes Cybertruck. Yes, I know it isn't expected to ramp hugely this year. But it is ramping up. Even 50k means they only need to grow 10-11% with the rest of their sales to hit 2.2M.

Plus, with the reducing interest rates, that effectively acts as a price reduction on its own.\n\nWill Tesla still need to have some price reductions this year.

They'll get through those that have the money and don't think twice if it is 80K or 120K then they'll get to the group that pre-ordered the tri-motor and will settle for AWD, then they'll reach those that pre-ordered based on the price range within Model Y pricing and those will cancel if the price is unable to be reduced.

Our focus will shift to groundbreaking ventures, leveraging technology and creativity that far surpass the simple joys of a theme park.\n\nSome may criticize this decision, but true visionaries will understand its genius.

I read the white paper and went online because I was thirsty for more info. It was quickly apparent that most people online had no idea what they were talking about. I remember one of the most popular crypto YT'ers at the time had a video claiming that he knew BTC was going to go up 30% next month. I had been investing a lot in Tech and was excited to hear his DD. He ended up revealing that he knew it would go up that much because it had gone up 30% the month before. I was dying laughing but people were eating it up in the comments like he was some genius. The guy ended up being correct that it was a great investment but the logic he used to get there was deeply flawed.\n\nThat's still how I feel about most of the community. Most people are unwilling to be skeptical or critical of the space and its future because they want to be rich so badly - and it's easier to believe whatever theory comes along and points the way they want.

Even brokers cant source the crypto fast enough to settle trades on their centralized order books.

Everything that's happening right now is bad for Taiwan.\n\nNobody said they *want* to move chip production out of Taiwan, friendshoring is a lesser of two evils, and a hedge against the CCP.\n\n>Taiwan's most important industry is bound to lose a big chunk of its market share.\n\nIt is, what is the alternative for Taiwan? A Hong Kong scenario?\n\n>Thanks to the sanctions, China is putting absolutely everything into building out its own chip production to compete with Taiwan.\n\nMoving chip production closer to the US isn't about stopping China from making chips, it's about denying China a path to monopoly. Obviously one of the benefits of a capture of Taiwan is that China would then control about 50% of the world's semiconductor production. Moving factories to the US is a no-brainer, both for the security of Taiwan, but especially for the West. By doing so they are removing one incentive of taking over Taiwan.\n\n>Once Taiwan's share of world chip production has fallen sufficently, the motivation for the U.S to help defend Taiwan's independence will be greatly diminished.\n\nNot really. There are more reasons why the US (and the West, should Europe seriously awaken to the CCP) needs to protect against the CCP in that region; not the least of which are existing allies like the Philippines, Japan, and SK. Taiwan holds great importance geographically as the gatekeeper of one of the world's busiest maritime shipping lanes through the South China Sea. There is a reason Japan is so invested in military deterrence against China. South Korea would be as invested if it were feasible. If the CCP gets Taiwan, they will effectively have a stranglehold on the SCS, and potentially the straights of Malacca if the CCP manages to sway Singapore (as they're currently attempting). \n\nThis is all part of Xi's much larger String of Pearls plan which began more than a decade ago. Between that and their Belt & Road Initiative, the CCP wants to either own or entirely influence connections between China, Africa, and Europe through sea & land trade—[hence their purchases of harbors all over the world](https://www.cfr.org/tracker/china-overseas-ports). This would also put a major damper on their strongest regional enemy in India. \n\n>I understand why we (US and Europe) have to diversify away from Taiwan. But for Taiwan this is catastrophic.\n\nThis is Taiwan's only remaining economic hedge against the CCP.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So your argument is that taking away the prize of capturing a chip manufacturing quasi monopoly weakens China's will to capture Taiwan.

It may even be Xi's personal ambition to bring about this so called reunification.\n\nWhat the sanctions and the geographic diversification of chip production do is weaken Taiwan economically and reduce Taiwan's importance to the West.\n\nEconomic decline caused by US sanctions and industrial policy could eventually turn the political tide in Taiwan and lead to exactly the sort of Hong-Kongification of Taiwan that we don't want to see.\n\nSome of this is inevitable. We cannot rely on Taiwan for 90% of high-end chip production forever.\n\nBut I think the chip sanctions are counterproductive.

That's your hedge.\n\nIt's a hedge, it's not everything. Again, Taiwan holds more than just manufacturing allure.\n\n>I don't believe this at all. China wants Taiwan for nationalist reasons, not to run some relatively short term extortion scheme against the West using Taiwan's chip fabs. It may even be Xi's personal ambition to bring about this so called reunification.\n\nXi has made it clear that capturing Taiwan and fulfilling the One China policy is his goal. Xi is not particularly interested in economic matters, hence the problems China now faces. But just because Taiwan represents a nationalistic goal for Xi doesn't mean that the economic and geographic consequences don't mean anything. Xi just sees economic capture as a nationalistic goal, where we see it as an economic goal in the west. They're the same to a communist autocrat.\n\n>What the sanctions and the geographic diversification of chip production do is weaken Taiwan economically and reduce Taiwan's importance to the West.\n\nAs opposed to what? They cannot survive without US military and economic support. They have no choice. There's no world where Taiwan is going to come out guns blazing and challenge the CCP militarily or economically directly, they haven't done so in the last 75 years. Even if they opted to do so, they can only do so as a de facto protectorate. They either find a strong ally anywhere they can, or they face off against China alone. Taiwan has tried to ignore the problem for decades, and with the emboldening of Xi the chickens have come home to roost. \n\n>Economic decline caused by US sanctions and industrial policy could eventually turn the political tide in Taiwan and lead to exactly the sort of Hong-Kongification of Taiwan that we don't want to see.\n\nThe Taiwanese are ultimately the ones making the decisions. They elected a decidedly anti-CCP president in December, so they've drawn a line in the sand. They are currently near-shoring industry to Mexico, the US, and elsewhere. There won't be a Hong-Kongification of Taiwan because the fall of Taiwan would be far more problematic for our allies in the region than Hong Kong was. A loss of Taiwan hurts everyone in the region, not just Taiwan.\n\n>Some of this is inevitable. We cannot rely on Taiwan for 90% of high-end chip production forever.\n\nWe could, if China and Russia would allow for globalization, but it is now very obvious that they have conspired to end globalism in pursuit of some \"multipolar\" vision where they can use autocratic ambitions to bludgeon an otherwise a more liberal economic environment into their ideal. Neither the CCP nor Russia actually benefit from a deglobalized world, neither China or Russia really gain much from a capture of Taiwan or Ukraine, but this is the reality of autocracies who lead with nationalistic goals in mind.\n\n>But I think the chip sanctions are counterproductive. They are needlessly damaging for Taiwan (as well as for Western tech firms) and help China wean itself off Western technology faster. They also escalate the situation and make it harder to muddle through until Xi is gone.\n\nChip sanctions will help Taiwan in the long run, aside from protecting US interests, they will benefit Taiwan in the longer term. Taiwan is still closely tied to China for production, but as they move away, so too do their compromised logistical chains. They're not needless, even if they are damaging in the immediate future.

You’ll end up -99% here.\n\nThough for a brief explanation of options is they represent 100 shares of the underlying security. They give you the option, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares at a certain strike price (Calls) or sell 100 shares at a certain strike price (Puts). Normal people usually use them to hedge their positions. Since you can, instead of using the option they give you, buy and sell them whenever the people here tend to buy them and sell them later (unless they expire worthless which brings us to the next part). The way they move/function is determined by the “Greeks” of whatever option/strike price you are looking at. One of those Greeks is theta, which is how much an options value goes down in a day (if the underlying stays at the same price but Greeks fluctuate as the underlying security moves). So when you buy you also choose an expiration date to buy and if you don’t sell it by then and it’s out of the money it’s value will have decreased and eventually goes to 0 expiring worthless.\n\nNow what’s attractive is it moves a percentage of 100 shares for a much cheaper cost. How much of a percentage? Well that’s your delta (another Greek). The more ITM you buy the higher the delta and the lower the theta. If the delta for example is 0.9 it’ll move 90% of what the underlying does. So say the underlying goes up a dollar and you have a call with a 0.9 delta. The call will gain $1 movement in the underlyingx0.9 deltax100 (the hundred shares it represents) for a total of $90 gain (if you don’t consider gamma which changes the delta as it moves as well). Of course if it goes down a dollar that call will loose ≈$90.\n\nBetween the huge moves and time decay it’s real easy to lose it all, but sometimes you’ll make over 1,000% gain in minutes if you pick the right option at the right time before a big move.\n\nBut yeah seriously scroll the page and scope options loss porn before even thinking about dipping your toes in.
