Companies can out whatever they want in their terms of service, and can sue for whatever they want to, but that doesn't necessarily mean they will win.\n\nI'm sure Nvidia's terms of service for CUDA is that it must be run on Nvidia GPUs. However, I don't think this requirement is enforceable, nor do I think it \"violates intellectual property\" (genuinely unsure what you're trying to say with that).\n\nThere are no actionable damages here. Nvidia doesn't have the right to say their software must be run on their hardware. They can say this, but they can't enforce it. They have a right to monetize their hardware and their software. They don't have the right to force you to use their hardware if you want their software. And it certainly doesn't create issues for the developer.\n\nLet's look at a very similar example: hackintosh. Apple says that OSX can only be used on Apple hardware. People can and do build machines that run OSX. Apple used to sell OSX separately, and if people bought their copy of OSX, there was actually nothing Apple could do if someone bought a copy of OSX and installed it on a non-apple machine.\n\nNow, Apple gives OSX away for free for Macs, there is no option to buy it separately. In effect, every copy of OSX is licensed for a specific Mac, so installing it on a non-mac would mean making a copy of OSX, which would violate copyright. And apple could potentially have a copyright claim . But that's it, apple has a copyright claim, not a claim based on their TOS. Apple could remotely disable a violators OS, and that violator could not sue Apple (as the action was taken within the terms of the TOS).\n\nAnd even if apple did take a lawsuit based on this, they can't go after people who post information or tools to help people do this. \n\nApple also has TOS rules against self repair, and yet there's an entire industry built around repairing things that Apple doesn't want repaired.\n\n>Knowingly giving away infringing software is just as illegal as selling it, and you will be just as liable for damages\n\nYou got a source on that?

If a stock is range bound and has low volatility, it is probably best to wait for a breakout of the support/resistance since the price action is random within the range. But too much volatility can be detrimental too i think. If it is gapping up and down all the time, i can't imagine it being an easy stock to trade.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> If it is gapping up and down all the time, I can't imagine it being an easy stock to trade \n\nExactly, but the gain is easily there, I'll research more into it as if there's people doing it, there must be at least something they use to help\n\nAbout the first part, yeah I suppose I'll study and get comfortable with the major indicators then, what would you list for those?

This makes it very comfortable to keep gambling even tho you are losing.\n\nWith risk-taking, you are traumatized into abandoning a winning strategy, as you can lose a bunch of trades very quickly and there is far too much contradictory information which makes decision-making very difficult. This combination, combined with the uncertainty of future price action, makes trading extremely traumatizing. Seeing as our brains are hardwired to avoid anything that has traumatized us in the past, a strategy that has a bad losing streak (which every strategy will do from time to time) will soon become to emotionally toxic to follow correctly.\n\nWhat's the cure for this nightmare, you might be asking? \n\nWarren Buffett sees it as one big game, where money is only there to keep score. He then focuses on not losing money. This combination of attitudes takes the trauma out of it, which then allows him to play a consistent game. \n\nThe challenge after that is to stop yourself from getting lost in the dreams of wealth, and keeping your life working happily without wanting (feeling like you need) more money to spend. Because, as soon as you start wanting to spend more money, your physiology will fire up and you'll become exposed to traumatic emotions once again, which will completely derail your trading.\n\nSo, the way is to not want to be richer than you are now. But, if you had that level of emotional maturity already, you never would have gotten into trading in the first place. \n\nSo, the most important lesson to learn from Buffett is to play a game that you love more than money, and let the money come naturally when it wants to. \n\nI'm not saying 'anyone can pull a $300 million a week dividend check like Buttett does', but trading can be a lot more enjoyable, with some nice upside surprises along the way.", "score": 81, "replies": [{"body": "Shut the fuck up nerd not reading all of that", "score": 109, "replies": [{"body": "😂", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Dis funny af but yur missing out, post is dope.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Second that.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Hear! hear!", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "TLDR:\n\nI’m not reading this nerd ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "Risk-taking = gambling.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "In the most surface-level way", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "will see when you lose it all", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "“Losing it all” is actually a pretty easy outcome to avoid", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "then you don't take the risk.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You can only 'lose it all' when you risk it all.

You’re giving yourself no room to be wrong, like maybe you’ve predicted the right trend in a stock, but a stock can easily break that trend for a day, and you’re fucked; even if you had the right bigger picture. When I buy options, I buy them at least a couple weeks out because I know I’m most likely not going to predict things absolutely perfectly, and I need some play room. I also follow what I call a “buy the ticket, take the ride policy”. Pretty much what this means is that I very rarely sell at a loss when trading options. Of course, this strategy isn’t full proof, but helps me manage my emotions and deal with the volatility that comes with options. For example, I bought Tesla puts last week and had to sit through a rather large loss before I made any profit. If my puts had an expiration a day out rather then a couple weeks, or if I had gotten scared and sold, I would have closed at a huge loss on them.

For example, the capitalization of all public companies in Germany is $2.3 trillion, France - $3.2 trillion, Italy - $0.8 trillion, Spain - $0.65 trillion, UK - $3.3 trillion, Russia - $0.65 trillion.\n\nNvidia, having created almost 1.5 trillion in capitalization since the beginning of 2023, has shown the fastest and most massive increase in value in the history of the global financial system. The stock has grown 200 times in 10 years!\n\nNo stock in the history of trading has had an accumulated trading volume of over $700 billion in a month by its own calculations.\n\nNo company has ever formed an industry trend of similar strength, bringing all related companies together in a frenzied and frenzied rally. Nvidia is the trigger, followed by all the others.\n\nThe sell-off in Nvidia since February 19 has led to a cascading collapse of overheated stocks in a tech sector awash in AI hype.\n\nNo company has burned through as much as 1/4 of the US national savings to sustain the insane bubble.\n\nThe US market is eating Nvidia and all the other companies.\n\nThe closing of positions in Nvidia by the first wave of speculators from October 2023 - organized a rally in cryptocurrencies (selling profitable positions in Nvidia and moving hot money into crypto), the second limited wave went from February 7.\n\nAbout 500 million bucks of daily financial flow into Bitcoin-related ETFs is money mostly taken out of Nvidia by those selling the bubble to a new wave of waits in perpetual growth.\n\nThere are two icons in the US market right now - Jensen Huang (Nvidia) or better known as \"black leather jacket\" and Sam Altman (OpenAI). All other infodumps and events are so insignificant and insignificant that they are unable to influence the market. The Fed together with Powell's speeches are declassified to children's amateur performance in the provincial theater, and nobody is interested in boring macrostatistics anymore.\n\nThe concentration of idiocy is so high that in order to maintain the Nvidia bubble, since the end of January they started to take cache from other stocks (most companies outside the technology sector went into a downward drift). Now the entire market, the entire financial system is working in the interests of Nvidia and a dozen other hypo-absorbers of AI.\n\nNvidia has created the strongest rally in the history of mankind with 10 trillion since the beginning of 2023 (major spurt since November), 1.5 trillion of which is sitting in Nvidia itself, it is Nvidia that will bury this idiocy.\n\nNvidia reported results that are expectedly strong, but don't justify the advance in the context of a capitalization run-up. A very detailed analysis of US company reporting will be given in March.\n\nNvidia is now generating 22 bln in revenue and 12 bln in net income per quarter, meaning it is well on its way to a potential of up to 100 bln in revenue and 50 bln in profit for the year (the actual 12 months are 61 bln and 29.8 bln respectively).\n\nHowever, even with these results (they still need to be realized), the current valuation is about 3.5 times higher than the industry average.\n\nIn order for Nvidia's 1.8 trillion capitalization to reach the historical average for its segment, it would need to show about 350-400 billion in revenue and 100-120 billion in profit, which is obviously impossible - there are not that many consumers of AI products.\n\nThe fact that with what fierceness the market eats up any mention of AI indicates both insanity and deep insanity (similar things were already seen in the late 90s, but on a smaller scale).
