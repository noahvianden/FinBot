{"title": "Disney beats earnings estimates, hikes guidance as it slashes streaming losses", "selftext": "LOS ANGELES — The Walt Disney Company reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, as the media giant slashed costs while revenue stagnated. \n\nThe company hiked its guidance, and now expects fiscal 2024 earnings per share of about $4.60, which would be at least 20% higher than 2023. \n\nDisney said it is on pace to meet or exceed its goal of cutting costs by at least $7.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. \n\nHere is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.22 vs. 99 cents expected\n\nRevenue:$23.55 billion vs. $23.64 billion expected\n\n\nDisney’s direct-to-consumer unit reported a $138 million operating loss in the quarter. Including the performance at ESPN+, losses for all its streaming businesses narrowed to $216 million, from $1.05 billion in the prior-year period.\n\nDisney+ core subscribers shrank by 1.3 million from the prior quarter due to price increases, but the company saw a rise in average revenue per user because of those subscription cost hikes.\n\nThe company posted the improvements to its streaming business a day after it announced Tuesday that it will launch a new sports streaming venture among ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery later this year. \n\nWhile no price has been determined, a logical starting point could be $45 or $50 per month with introductory pricing lower to entice signups, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions around the service have been private.\n\nDisney’s earning results come as its board battles again with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Blackwells Capital.\n\nWhile Peltz ended a previous proxy battle against Disney a year ago after the company committed to numerous cost-cutting initiatives, he revived his fight last fall, looking to shake up the board and earn himself and former Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo a seat.\n\nPeltz has cited the company’s stock plunge, a drop in consensus earnings estimates and disappointing studio content as he has pushed for a board shake-up.\n\nCEO Bob Iger has publicly addressed Disney’s theatrical release woes and vowed to rely less on sequels and more on fresh, quality films. Of course, production timelines are often in the ballpark of 18 months, so Disney’s box office haul likely will not change until 2025 or 2026. At that point, Disney is slated to release four mega blockbusters: an Avatar film, two Star Wars features and an Avengers team-up flick.\n\nAlso of note to investors is this is the second quarter that Disney is using its new financial reporting structure, which segmented the company into three divisions: entertainment, sports and experiences. Entertainment contains all of Disney’s streaming and media operations, sports includes ESPN and experiences includes the company’s theme parks, hotels, cruise line and merchandising efforts.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/disney-dis-earnings-report-q1-2024.html", "id": "1aldp6e", "created_utc": 1707340057.0, "score": 390, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 186, "comments": [{"body": "Finally.

Covid was great for them so it made sense. Post covid paypal has seen essentially no growth. Which isn't good. They have their core audience, but its an older audience (relatively speaking) and no replacements are coming in. Once they slowly die off(literally or figuratively) it looks like the company will follow.\n\nSo its multiple (pe ratio) has shrunken down to reflect that reality. By being rated with a lower multiple the stock price has dropped obviously, and this new perception is what is limiting its share price from accumulating back to its former highs.\n\nWhen I looked at a few qrts ago it was also seeing many of its payment processor customers switch from branded paypal payment services to its whitelabel Braintree services. The Braintree brand has a lower take rate, and therefore profit for Paypal.\n\nFinally their actions haven't given investors any reason to believe that things will change.

The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.\n\nHere’s how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:\n\nRevenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected\n\nEPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.\n\n\nArm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.\n\nThe company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.\n\nArm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.\n\nArm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.\n\nRoyalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.\n\nIn recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and it’s more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.\n\nArm’s license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.\n\nArm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple\n iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.\n\nArm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/arm-earnings-report-q3-2024-.html", "id": "1alek9u", "created_utc": 1707342208.0, "score": 604, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 193, "comments": [{"body": "I forgot that Arm was publicly traded.", "score": 257, "replies": [{"body": "If I knew I would have them in my portfolio", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Why?

The value growth is coming from the rock solid monopoly on a rapidly ballooning worldwide industry.\n\nMost AI is basically a gimmick, but there's legitimately incredibly useful new technologies that have come out in the last 5 or so years that was simply unthinkable before they showed up. I am a programmer, and something as basic as \"Take this scanned PDF and convert it to actual text\" was fundamentally impossible and a pipe dream, now it's just daily reality. You can do it on your phone.\n\nWe can scan that PDF, automatically classify it, and use it to auto adjudicate things like insurance claims. AI chatbots are passing the turing test and performing automatic high pressure sales calls, they're bulk calculating the odds of outcomes in chemical synthesis and discovering new materials in material science to build with and possibly break the barriers of battery storage capacity, they're also helping with drug synthesis and bringing us to discover the first new class of antibiotics since 1987.\n\nThe stuff you see online, art generation, ChatGPT, microsoft copilot, etc, they're borderline worthless gimmicks in my view, but the ability for AI to be used as a classification and pattern recognition engine has real capabilities of launching our scientific discoveries and ability to automate workloads decades to centuries ahead of where it otherwise would be, and all of it is being done on Nvidia hardware.

Why is that the public only sees the worthless gimmicks? Whatt's your take on that?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "In my opinion it's not due to lack of trying but more due to lack of relevance and general awareness in the population of things that aren't immediately relevant to them or that are absolutely revolutionary. Companies are constantly advertising their AI technology but to a large degree it falls into either the category of \"Will make a lot of money, is not interesting to the lay person\" or \"Kinda neat, will amaze folks, nobody really wants to pay for it though, so we built it to sell people stuff or steal their info(Alexa)\".\n\nTell an investor your thing uses AI and half the time they'll ask if you can use blockchain instead. Tell them you can now read and auto-classify paper invoices and they'll fall asleep. It's more lucrative to just talk about AI to pump your stocks rather than to actually build one to demo most of the time due to the cost.\n\nAI is simultaneously extremely expensive to train and also generally needs to be really specialized to be actually good at anything, so a lot of the stuff that can warrant the cost of training is either going to need to be able to be marketed to the world at large(and thus need to be extremely broad and kind of inherently less precise), or is going to need to be so specialized that nobody outside of that cutting edge section of industry really knows or cares about the issue, and the fundamental issue is that most of the things that consumers would really really care about are actually more of a hardware problem... I can remote start my car with a button rather than an AI, and an AI can't get me a beer or bring me dinner, and even if it could I could just likely hook that up to a button instead. AI kinda just becomes a \"speech to command\" hub for consumers, or a robot to google stuff for you, so most of the valuable capabilities of AI are just not relevant to the consumer.\n\nWe used to have a ton of low hanging fruit that applied to a majority of the world, speech recognition, text parsing, PDF scanning, text generation, but to a large degree those snuck into the market over the last 5 years and they're already fiercely competitive and honestly not that profitable now. No normal person got excited about the PDF parsing, but to a programmer it was magic.\n\nThere's some hybrid environments left, not applicable to everyone, but not fully specialized, but they're gradually being tackled. This is where you're seeing things like AI being integrated into windows, photoshop AI, AI writing code, forecasting AI, AI being built into insurance software, etc. These markets are significantly smaller and a bit too outside of the range of things laypeople care about, so they're moderately lucrative and just not that exciting.\n\nBut the really big value is more or less in industry, and one great example of why it's hard to advertise is what I mentioned in my previous comment, we legitimately just discovered the first new class of antibiotics in over 30 years, they can actually fight antibiotic resistant bacteria, and barely anyone has heard about that or even cares despite how massive that is.\n\nTackling information based limitation in industry is one of the biggest place to make your fortune, but finding something that is not labor based, could not be solved with conventional programming nor brainpower of thousands of people, and is simultaneously worth millions to billions of dollars to justify the development time? Well typically it's going to be so specialized and complicated that even when you produce an AI worth billions of dollars it's not transferable to other companies due to how specialized it is, or you might not \\*want\\* to share even if you could, and then sometimes it isn't even reusable as it's for a discovery and it found everything it can and would need to be entirely re-trained to find new stuff, so you've found your thing and then when you start going into details on \\*how\\* you discovered the antibiotic nobody knows what the heck you're talking about nor do they really care how it was discovered. \"You discovered it with AI? Got it. That's cool. What did you say it was worth?\" is what you'll get, and that's what'll make headlines with AI as a footnote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOutside of that the labor automations at your workplace are going to take years to gradually improve over time due to the wide range of what people do and the difficulty/expense of training AI, so it'll be like boiling the frog, you won't even notice them gradually change your way of life and the competition will be so fierce nobody is going to get hella rich, but the dude selling you AI software that is based on something that has been common for about 4 years but he tailored to your general industry might make a few million off your company and seem kinda cool if/when it happens.\n\nThe military will keep gradually building its weird dog robots and training fighter planes, and over time the military might be fielding fully AI driven robotic soldiers, but it'll happen so gradually you won't notice too much. Twenty years later we'll solve the \"get me a beer\" issue when the price of robotics have come down enough to justify slapping AI in them, but you'll be used to seeing robots, and your computer will gradually have more and more AI networks all getting tied together to make it seem like a seamless flow from receiving an email to having your computer auto-generate a basic estimate for you to amend. It'll be step by step, slow and steady, unnoticeable but constant improvement where nothing in specific stands out until it's crept into everything you do, just like electronics did.
