Audio version [here](https://open.spotify.com/show/28RHOkXkuHuotUrkCdvlOP?si=yZeLQKfzR2-wBnDYxp2oJg). Chris is probably my favorite investor to follow. In this episode he talks about my favorite company too. \n\nSo, for fundamentals Friday, I post this interview, most of which is about Constellation software and it's spin offs. \n\nThe fundamentals part I'll use constellation as an example. I feel that they are probably the most shareholder friendly company I know. The CEO, Mark Leonard, has written numerous letters to shareholders that can be found [here](https://www.csisoftware.com/category/pres-letters). They are masterworks of how to run a company. Leonard flies coach for all his trips (to save money) and insists all other executives do too. The company has never issued shares since the IPO. Executive bonuses are paid in cash however 75% of that cash must be used to purchase CSU stock on the public market. Those shares must then be held for 3-5 years at a minimum. Topicus and Lumine (the spinoffs) have adopted this policy as well. Leonard, and other executives at the companies, have talked about how they want to have their grandchildren holding shares of the company decades from now. He's even set up a trust with some shares for them so they are not able to sell. That's long term vision. \n\nAs a result, all three companies have a minimum target of 20% annual growth, and usually surpass that. And plan to continue to do so. \n\nDuring the interview, Mayer says this:\"And the way I think about it is I always think about things that kind of ten-year commitments. You look out and the basic math of it is if it‚Äôs twenty-five percent, let‚Äôs just say if it‚Äôs twenty-five percent CAGR over 10 years that‚Äôs nine X think about that. Nine x.\"\n\nThe host, later adds: \"So what I did is I spanned it out over five years and I said, what multiple could you pay today to get a 10% return? And then say you sell at a multiple of. 25. Many people would be surprised to hear that you could pay a multiple of forty-seven and get a 10% return over that period.\"\n\nThe point of this is, if you find a company that can put up high returns for long durations....it's really hard to overpay for it. That's why companies like constellation, Microsoft, and visa, trade at high multiples and aren't overvalued. \n\nBuy great companies with long runways.....And just hold. It's a great strategy.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hard to overpay for it‚Äù is the justification that so many quality investors use and it‚Äôs becoming tiring at this point. It‚Äôs actually pretty easy to overpay, especially when everyone is crowded in the same stocks like MCO, SPGI, MA, CSU, FICO, LLY, and MSFT. We already had the Nifty Fifty bubble in the 70s. Multiple expansion has supercharged returns over the past decade for many compounders and multiple contraction will be a real headwind going forward.\n\n‚ÄúIf all you had to do was figure out which companies were better than others, an idiot could make a lot of money. But they keep raising the prices to where the odds change.‚Äù\n\n- Charlie Munger\n\n‚ÄúThe notion that the desirability of a common stock was entirely independent of its price seems incredibly absurd. Yet the new-era theory led directly to this thesis... An alluring corollary of this principle was that making money in the stock market was now the easiest thing in the world. It was only necessary to buy ‚Äògood‚Äô stocks, regardless of price, and then to let nature take her upward course. The results of such a doctrine could not fail to be tragic.‚Äù\n\n- Benjamin Graham & David L. Dodd, Security Analysis, 1934", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "They go over the math in the interview. Using an exit multiple of 15 (so significant contraction) you could still pay 48x and get a 10% CAGR. That's how powerful compounding is. \n\nSo it's not regardless of price, but you can pay a higher multiple than you might think, even with contracting multiples. I don't think it's easy either. There are not many companies that can grow that fast and that long to justify that price. \n\nI'm also cautious with Ben Graham. The man was a genius and deserves every bit of respect he gets, but we've spent the last 90 years further improving on his work. Even his protege Warren Buffett has adapted.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The 25% CAGR for a decade is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Very few companies can grow at that rate for a decade. Far fewer can do so for another decade. To expect a repeat for Constellation Software strikes me as incredibly optimistic. The challenge for many serial acquirers is that eventually deal multiples go up due to competition from other bidders and returns on incremental capital drop.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, that's always the key. In the case of Constellation their minimum is actually 20%, they've just overachieved on that. So even if they slow down, 20% is still massive growth. As with anything, the future is unknown, but if any company can do 20% it's CSU. They've done it for over 2 decades and no one has really mounted a serious challenge (though people have tried). Their biggest obstacle is their size, it just takes more to move the needle. That's why I find topicus and lumine so enticing. Same business model, smaller companies. \n\nEven 15% growth has a huge payoff over duration though. At 15% growth, earnings will double in 5 years. So an exit multiple of 15x would yield 0 returns. However, if you find a company with a 15% CAGR and a 15x multiple....it's a steal. I'd buy a ton more.

The Fed's Leading Indicator Hasn't Been Wrong Since 1966, And The Answer Is Clear.**\r  \nWhen viewed over long periods, Wall Street's three major stock indexes -- the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average, the broad-based S&P 500, and the growth-stock-heavy Nasdaq Composite -- have risen in value, without fail over time.\r  \nHowever, it's a far different story when viewed from a narrowed short term lens of months, or even perhaps a few years. The Dow Jones, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite can be completely unpredictable over shorter timelines. In fact, all three stock indexes have alternatively traded in either bear or bull markets in each successive year since this decade began.\r  \nTruth be told, there is no perfect forecasting tool or ideal blueprint that's going to provide 100% accuracy. There are no indicators that are going to perfectly tell investors or economists what stocks, or the U.S. economy will do next. Nevertheless, there are a couple of reliable predictive tools and money-based metrics that have, over extended timelines, correlated strongly with moves in the stock market and/or U.S. economy.\r  \nOne of these reliable indicators, which happens to be a leading economic indicator tool used by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has an uncanny track record of forecasting downturns in the U.S. economy.\r  \nAt the moment, the U.S. economy is humming along nicely. U.S. gross domestic product is growing positively on an annualized basis, and the labor market appears healthy, with the unemployment rate clocking in at a low 3.7% for January. But there are storm clouds on the horizon.\r  \nEvery month for the past 65 years, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's recession probability tool has utilized the spread (difference in yield) between the 10-year Treasury bond, and three-month Treasury bills, to determine how likely it is that a recession will occur over the next 12 months.\r  \nNormally, the Treasury yield curve slopes upward, and to the right. This is to say that bonds set to mature in 10 or 30 years should generally have higher yields, compared to short term Treasury bills maturing in one year or less. Normally, the longer your money is tied up in fixed term, interest-bearing securities, the higher the yield should be. Generally, longer-term debt carries higher risk, and thus higher interest rates than shorter-term debt. The most recent inversion between the 10-year Treasury bond and the three-month Treasury bills occurred in late October 2022. Since then, the yield curve has remained inverted.\r  \nBut when things get out of kilter, and investors are clearly concerned about the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy, the yield curve tends to invert. And just as the term implies, a yield curve inversion occurs when short-term bills spike to higher yields than long-term bonds. The greater the yield-curve inversion, typically the higher the probability of a recession occurring. Also, the economy has typically fallen into recession within six to 24 months after an inverted yield curve.\r  \nThat being said, a yield-curve inversion doesn't guarantee a recession is imminent. There have been inversions where a recession didn't take place. However, every recession that's occurred since World War II was preceded by a yield-curve inversion. It's been a telltale harbinger for every economic downturn since World War II.\r  \nOver the past year, we've witnessed the steepest yield-curve inversion in roughly four decades. Not surprisingly, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's recession probability tool now indicates that there to be a 61.47% likelihood of a recession taking place by or before January 2025. Although this isn't a guarantee, nor is it the highest recession probability on record, it does mark the one of the highest probabilities for a recession to take place since the early 1980s.\r  \nThe Fed's leading recession indicator doesn't have a perfect track record of forecasting downturns -- but it's pretty darn close. Despite a recession probability of over 40% in October 1966, no economic downturn occurred. But since this incorrect prognostication in 1966, any time this recession probability tool has surpassed a 32% likelihood of a downturn, one has taken place not long thereafter. With a reading of 61.47%, the writing would appear to be on the wall that a recession is very highly likely in 2024, based on this predictive indicator.\r  \n\r  \n**Equities and Recessions:**\r  \nSince 1955, equities have peaked six times after the start of a yield-curve inversion.\r  \nHere are the years when equities peaked after yield-curve inversions:\r  \n\r  \n**1955:** Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) reached its 52-week high after the yield-curve inversion.\r  \n**1988:** Another instance where the DJIA reached its peak following an inversion.\r  \n**1998:** DJIA reached its 52-week high during an inversion.\r  \n**2000:** The dot-com bubble era saw the DJIA reach its 52-week high after an inversion.\r  \n**2006:** The DJIA reached its 52-week high once more after the yield curve inverted.\r  \n**2019:** Most recently, the DJIA again reached its 52-week high following an inversion.\r  \nAlthough the U.S. economy and the stock market act independently of one another, corporate earnings often suffer when U.S. economic activity slows, or shifts into a recession.\r  \nIf the NY Fed's recession tool proves accurate, and a recession comes to fruition in 2024, a sizable pullback in equities can also be expected.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Market ded", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just a hard reset on stupidly high salaries tech workers.

The same debunked bullshit over and over about the government meddling that has already been debunked. Yes, there are conspiracies, yes, the main stream media gets things wrong and has lied. NO, not everything the main stream media says is a lie, NO, not everything is a conspiracy. Something Musk can't accept.\n\nThe same people who believe this shit are still going on about Hunter Biden's laptop but don't have a problem when a congresswoman shares PRIVATE EXPLICIT PICTURES with the world. She is the one violating an insane amount of rules and has shown she has no basic human decency, but in everything she does, she gets support from the MAGA shit-stain on humanity. It's not only pathetic, it's downright demoralising for the rest of humanity to share the planet with garbage like that.\n\nThe government didn't control twitter, it's debunked bullshit, the same thing goes for Hunter Biden's laptop and so many other conspiracy theories. Insanely enough the same people who believe this support a convicted rapist that tried to overthrow the government. The biggest conspiracy that has happened in a long time and people defend those that stormed the capital while screaming bloody murder over what some insane idiots are spouting on twitter from the toilet.\n\nMusk has let people back on twitter that were banned for good reason, like Trump and Kanye West. He is endorsing the worst public voices, those that support genocide and want to overthrow democracy to help a rapist seize power.\n\nThis is, again, not some conspiracy, you can see who Musk is actively promoting, it's the MAGA crowd and Russian propagandists.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You are wrong on the law.

Since IF Metall went on strike at Tesla on October 27th, questions have been raised about how many of their members are participating in the conflict. The union issued warnings to 120-130 people but has refused to disclose how many of them have actually stopped working, citing members' privacy and freedom of association. With Tesla's workshops continuing to operate, albeit at reduced capacity, it has long been evident that the willingness to strike is not one hundred percent. Just before Christmas, IF Metall also announced that 20 members had been expelled for strikebreaking. But other figures have been missing. Until now. The fresh annual report from the state-owned National Mediation Office reveals that 1,936 days were lost in the Swedish labor market in 2023 due to the Tesla conflict. This corresponds to 44 full-time positions and means that only about one-third of the potential strike force actively participated in the conflict. \"It's certainly disappointing,\" says Marie Nilsson, chairman of IF Metall. \"When we entered into conflict, we had organized over half of the workers at Tesla and naturally hoped that everyone would participate. But some probably didn't understand that they actually needed to leave the workplace, and others were strongly pressured by Tesla. It's human, but really sad.\" What does it say about the legitimacy of the strike? \"We don't have such a principle in Sweden. It's enough that a single member wants a collective agreement, and then we are obliged to assist with that. But of course, we would never have gone on strike if we didn't believe that we would get a majority of the members to join us.\" So it's a failure? \"It's disappointing,\" says Nilsson.\n\nhttps://www.dn.se/ekonomi/tva-av-tre-strejkar-inte-pa-tesla-en-besvikelse/", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Get skullfucked retard unions", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "its like a small dog barking", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Small dogs have the most annoying high pitched barks", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hmhrom5y2ljc1.jpeg?width=741&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9fc1b83eb57827ec78be565b64b2ea81cf7327fd", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "V12 rolling out!

You can keep on lowering, the percentage yoy increase, while still getting to the S-shaped adaptation curve.\n\nThe 'three kinds of lies' applies here.\n\nI'm not claiming there's not a decline in increase happening right now, but the way this has been framed is always as if it's a demand problem. Imagine if Tesla produces a 25K vehicle, that gets government incentives AND Chinese OEM's get full access to EU and USA markets. (I don't think the USA and EU will allow to let the Chinese to flood the markets, but if the Chinese OEM's build factories in North-America and Europe, there's not a lot they can do to stop it, but this will take years.)\n\nI'm saying that the claim that there's a great slowdown happening, is bs, their is still a substantial increase and there's a bunch of levers to be pulled in the next two years, that can make things explode by 2030.\n\nTesla dropping their prices has significantly hurt all OEM's (Chinese ones seem to be propped up by the state, so they have a layer of protection but are not free from harm) which has partially led to the current situation.\n\nTesla was a major driver of the BEV share increase in the USA and EU, Musk holding back giga Mexico and next gen model, seemingly at least two years away now, is to blame for the current slowdown in increase (importantly it's not a slowdown, slowdown in increase is something very different).\n\nI know many disagree with next gen model not being ready, I wholeheartedly believe if you listen to what he said during the 2023 earning calls he was intentionally holding back growth out of fear of a recession. Combined with the (reported) fact that he wanted the next gen vehicle to not have a steering wheel, which must nog have helped development, my only conclusion is that Elon is sandbagging Tesla, HARD.\n\nNo matter what, we would have been in a lull right now, I don't think next gen could have been ready realistically, I do believe giga Mexico could have been ready Q3-Q4 this year, with start of sales to customers and ramping up happening somewhere between Q1-Q2 2025, while Elon time now is end of 2025, which means best case scenario more likely end of 2026 and more likely somewhere in 2027. I sincerely hope to be proven wrong.\n\nThey promised two giga's announced by the end of 2022, they only announced giga Mexico, we're Q1 2024 now and where's the progress?\n\nI also believe Musk and co saw the idiocy of what they were doing and that's why they are now going to start next gen in Texas.

SMCI was the second most traded stock yesterday, despite an only then 48B market cap. Over 40% of its outstanding shares were traded in a single day. Why ? Because rate cuts are coming, and the street wants growth assets. NVDA has already a 1.8T market cap, SMCI has a market cap in the 50B as of today, a PE of 72 and a forward PE under 40. That's still very attractive for a growth stock if their models suggest strong growth for the next 5 years. As long as NVDA earnings are good, SMCI is going to a 100B market cap in the next 3 months. \n\nHere's a newer review of the stock.

(ticker: SMCI) with a Buy rating and $1040 price objective. We think this provider of server and storage solutions will be a beneficiary of AI-driven demand growth (>50% of revenues now tied to accelerators like GPUs). We believe the market for AI servers is much larger than is factored in Street models. We expect the market for AI servers to grow, on average, 50% CAGR over the next three years, vs. historical growth of the overall server market (5.5% CAGR over the past 17 years), and we expect Super Micro‚Äôs revenue to grow even faster driving market share gain (see our ests in Fig 2). Super Micro has a growing backlog and is expanding capacity to support strong revenue growth. It has established itself as an early launch partner for companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for CPUs and GPU accelerators. And we think its ability to work with multiple new designs and technologies will serve it well as myriad AI-related processors debut in the next several years (Fig 1).

RMA it via snail mail or throw it to the shredder. Still cheaper than Dell\n\nThe only time you should buy Dell is when you're regarded and need your internet explorer compatible web GUI with pretty JPEGs and buttons for your server management. \n\nBut you are right about it being low margin. Even if Supermicro does make some good margins in its servers that they sell nowadays, there's no fucking way they will EVER be worth anywhere NEAR >$10 billion dollars. \n\nInstitutional investors are either stupid as fuck or they know this is an easy-to-hype stock because they can claim it has \"huge potential\" because of \"AI\"\n\nAnd like you said, there's no competitive advantage there. It's a commodity manufacturer, not ARM, AMD or Nvidia.\n\nThere's no long term value in Supermicro.

A 400$ call says that the owner (buyer) has the opportunity to buy a stock at 400$ per share. If the share price is 380 by the expiry, the contract is worthless (why exercise 400 when you can buy from the market at 380). On the other hand, if the shares trade at 420 by the time it expires, you make a 20$/share profit.\n\nThe real gambling comes from the fact that a contract represent 100 shares. If you buy a 400$ call for a premium of 1$, it means that you pay 100$ now (premium is per share) for the opportunity to buy 100 shares at 400$ each later in time. If the share price by the time the call expires is 420$, you made a 19$ (20$ diff - 1$ premium) profit PER SHARE, so 1900$ profit or 19x what you invested.\n\nPuts are the reverse, it lets you sell shares at a predetermined price. So you essentially want the stock price to lower so you can buy at market price and exercise the contract for profit.\n\nCalls and puts are a thing in Europe too. The main difference is that, iirc, you can only exercise at expiry whereas American options can be exercised whenever.\n\nMy 0.02$ is that you shouldn't put any meaningful amount in them if you don't understand them well, you can see it as a more-likely-to-payout lotto ticker", "score": 794, "replies": [{"body": "I am going to read this several hundred times and probably still not get it", "score": 698, "replies": [{"body": "Here are some non-stock analogies to understand calls and puts.\n\n\n### Buying/Selling Calls\n\nYou own a house worth $200k and are putting it on the market.\n\nI think your house will be worth $400k+ in a month. So I say, \"Hey buddy, give me first right to buy your house for $200k. If I don't get a mortgage together and buy it from you in a month, then you can put it on the market. In exchange, I'll pay you $2k for keeping you off the market for a month.\"\n\nYou are selling a call option and I am buying it. Essentially, I'm paying you to lock in your house for $X by Y date.\n\nIn your mind, this is a win-win for you. Either you sell for the $200k you thought the house was worth plus another 1% ($2k) for the contract. OR you pocket my $2k and sell it on the open market in a month's time.\n\nIf I have the money, I'll execute the contract and buy your house for $200k and flip it myself. As a broke WSBer, I cannot afford a $200k down payment / mortgage. So on day 20 or so of the contract when the house is appraising for $300-350k, I'll approach a local investor or real estate flipper and say, \"Hey, I have this house that's worth $300k as-is under contract for $200k. I'll sell you my contract rights for $50k.\" The investor takes a cut, but I still make a 50k profit and only used $2k of my money. That's how WSBers can make money on options with smaller accounts.\n\nIf you decide to let meth-head Mike party in the house all month long, I can walk away,  lose the $2k in contract fees, but leave you stuck with the meth house. \n\n\n### Buying/Selling Puts\nPuts are paying the buyer to lock them into an obligated buy, if you - the seller - choose to force them. So, in the last example, I paid the seller to lock them into a contract: \"sell me your house for $X before Y date.\" This time, I can sell you my obligation to buy. In essence, \"Pay me $500 and if you need me to, I'll buy your house at the drop of a hat for $200k for the next month.\"\n\nIf you think your house is about to fall into a sinkhole tomorrow and be worthless, this is a great way to pay $500 \"insurance\" to get a check for $200k for the rubble. \n\nIf I think your house is going to be worth $300k in the next month, this is a great way for me to get paid for the opportunity to buy it. \n\nOr, turns out it's a gold mine, not a sinkhole. Your house is now worth $500k. You can choose not to force me to buy it for $200k. I'll make $500 for doing nothing* and you can sell your house + gold mine for $500k on the open market. * - $200k of my account balance would be locked up for the duration of this put contract.\n\nThese numbers are totally arbitrary", "score": 278, "replies": [{"body": "In the words of the wise /u/Jazzlike_Farmer_636 \n\nI am going to read this several hundred times and probably still not get it", "score": 169, "replies": [{"body": "**Alright, picture this:** You're at the store with your friend, eyeing a super cool skateboard that's priced at $50. But here's the twist - you think the price might drop next week because a new model is coming out, while your friend thinks it's going to go up because it's the last one of its kind.\n\n**Call Option Analogy:**\nYou say to your friend, \"Hey, I'll give you $5 right now if you promise to let me buy that skateboard from you for $50 any time I want in the next week.\" Your friend agrees. That $5 is like buying a \"call option\" - you're paying for the right (but not the obligation) to buy something at a set price within a certain time frame. If the skateboard's price goes up to $70, you can still buy it for $50, making a neat profit if you decide to sell it. If the price drops, you can choose not to buy the skateboard, but you've only lost your $5, not more.\n\n**Put Option Analogy:**\nNow, let's flip it. You own a skateboard that you bought for $50, but you're worried its price might drop. You say to your friend, \"I'll pay you $5 to promise to buy my skateboard for $50 any time in the next week, no matter its current market price.\" Your friend agrees. This is like buying a \"put option.\" You're paying for the right to sell something at a predetermined price within a certain timeframe. If the skateboard's price drops to $30, you can still sell it for $50 to your friend, avoiding a bigger loss. If the price goes up, well, you can sell it for more in the market, but you've still lost the $5 you paid your friend.\n\nThis way, \"calls\" are like securing a future shopping deal with a little deposit, and \"puts\" are like getting an insurance policy on something you own, with a small premium.

Sorry I really have no clue about that kind of stuff üòÖ", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Absolutely, you've got the basic idea spot-on: when you buy a call or put option, the most you can lose is the money you paid for the option (like the $5 in our skateboard example). However, the wild rollercoaster rides of gains and losses you've seen on forums like WallStreetBets often involve a bit more complex strategies, like \"selling\" options or trading on margin. Let's break it down using our skateboard analogy to understand these high-risk moves:\n\n**Selling Options:**\nImagine if, instead of buying a call or put option, you're the friend who *sells* the promise. So, you collect $5 in hopes that you won't have to buy or sell the skateboard at a loss. But if the price moves against you (say, the skateboard's value skyrockets or plummets beyond your expectations), you might have to buy it at a much higher price or sell it at a much lower price than the market rate. This could lead to losses much greater than the $5 you initially got.\n\n**Margin Trading:**\nNow, imagine you don't actually have the $50 to buy the skateboard upfront, but the shop owner lets you \"borrow\" the money to buy it, hoping you'll sell it for more later and pay him back. This is like trading on margin. You're borrowing money to amplify your potential gains. But here's the catch: if the price of the skateboard drops, not only do you lose your initial investment, but you also owe money to the shop owner. This can lead to losses that far exceed your initial investment.\n\nThe \"huge loss posts\" you see are often due to these kinds of strategies. Traders might be selling options (which can require them to buy or sell assets at unfavorable prices) or trading on margin (where they borrow money to amplify their trades). Both methods can amplify gains *massively* but can also lead to equally massive losses, sometimes even more than the trader's initial investment.\n\nSo, while buying calls and puts has a \"cap\" on the loss (the premium you paid), selling them or using borrowed money (margin) can lead to the heart-stopping financial rollercoaster rides you've seen online. Always remember, with great power (or leverage) comes great responsibility (and risk)! üòÖüé¢\n\n\n[Disclaimer: I used AI to help write these, if that‚Äôs not obvious!

It's strange. A lot of people I know anecdotally and myself won their first (or even first few) options play(s) with flying colors. It gets to your head real-quick. \n\nWe have a joke around here that everyone's \"All-time\" chart is a straight line at-first (the deposit), or a bumpy line going up slowly (longs, typical investing), and then there is a massive spike upward for a few days/weeks, followed by them losing half of their net-worth in one day. \n\nYou'd be amazed by how many of people fit this trend. It's basic psychology, you make smart plays at first because you don't know what you're doing ‚Äî so, you err on the side of extreme caution. \n\nYou realize you're making more money than you are per-hour than your job, so you start trading weeklies instead of quarterlies or \"leaps\" (years out). You don't stop winning. You may lose one here and there, but your confidence is at an ATH and you forget you're in a bull-market. It all blows up.\n\n> Thanks for the additional info though, not sure if I'm ready to dip my toes into weeklies and certainly not 0dte (if I'm using that correctly).\n\n0dte means \"zero days to expiry\". So it means your options contract expires at market-close. I've never traded a 0dte in my life because it is absolutely hell mentally and you will almost always lose. If you win, since it's a 0dte, it's technically the highest profit typically ‚Äî as long as it's OTM. Steer clear.\n\nI'd avoid weeklies till August-ish. Quarterlies are either 2 months out OR, in some cases, considered to be a contract that's at least 1-month to expiry (1mte) and will pass over said companies earnings call (extra risk). \n\nAlways try to avoid holding it over earnings. Safe quarterlies are only ones that don't have an earnings-call unless you know something you shouldn't (i.e., priced-in). Sell at least one full trading day before the earnings call, as the day before or the day-of tends to be the most speculative, and obviously, the day after is reactionary. \n\nPlaying earnings calls is called \"playing volatility\", and can be an extremely profitable and safe strategy for weeklies once you have the experience, but will cost you without said experience.\n\nWhich platform do you use? It's important to understand that your broker may exercise the contract or sell it. Most will sell it.\n\n> As for going in the other direction 3x, I could have lost $300? (As it was a gain of $100) or something else I hadn't considered?\n\nYes, that contract could have easily went -$300. I checked it when you mentioned it and it's IV was very high for SPY, likely because of the AI-bull-run below it. \n\nPlease, please, watch IV before you buy. A good goal is to stay under 24% (that's what I aim for when I buy-in). From what I can piece together I think you bought yours at 44% which is very high ‚Äî but not ridiculous.\n\nPlease DM me if you need any help with this. I have been trading options for 7 years weekly (but not always weeklies). I am up-overall, started with $5k and have options profit over that period of $125k. \n\nI could have done that quicker if I knew these things before I jumped in blind.

The point here is that having an investment vehicle where your original investment is safe, and you **can only make money, or miss-out on possible gains, while knowing your initial investment is relatively safe**, is so much more safer when you're starting. \n\nThe only potential loss you can incur is future unrealized gains (so this won't hurt your initial investment, you're just \"missing out\") and un-leveraged losses. Aka you can take a very minor loss (but if you're even reasonably smart, you can avoid this too), and make a steady income off it over time.\n\nIt is quite literally how the rich get richer, and **it's called covered calls**. So please look into that NOW if you have the cash.\n\nLastly, don't buy PUTs till you're comfortable with CALLs, as it's much harder to make money on PUTS. \n\nHigh IV on a call literally means **the stock can go up and you can/will lose money**.

Buying say a call that expires the same day you buy them makes them very cheap, but they lose value really really fast unless the call goes In the money. \n\nAs an example. Say you bought a call OTDE and it cost you 500 dollars at 930am and you bought it At the money (100). By the end of the day, the price of the stock would need to reach 105 dollars (5x100) to be the same value as when you bought it. \n\nOne thing some gamblers do is they buy a call and sell it in only an hour or less later.

The remaining amount of loss can get rolled over into following years until you've claimed all your losses.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111315/deducting-stock-losses-guide.asp#:\\~:text=If%20your%20net%20losses%20in,and%20interest%20for%20the%20year.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111315/deducting-stock-losses-guide.asp#:~:text=If%20your%20net%20losses%20in,and%20interest%20for%20the%20year)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "thank you!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Seeing this makes me think I can do the same, but then I realize i am way too regarded for such greatness", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Teach me fam I got 1.5 k I wanna turn it to 100k", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "What are the odds he gives it all back???", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "‚ÄúNot an entirely smooth ride but overall happy‚Äù I should hope so lmfao.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/idbzu7pjcfjc1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=075e508d2c9c0d442cb63cfaaa23210554b87a2e\n\nI ain‚Äôt scared $BTC $MSTR", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Congrats and fuck you", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Teach me.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is very motivational however would you be kind to share the all time screen?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/t61ah1j7bzic1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3e5f6b7709940afa046c76c5d89eef8fc45e709\n\nLost 15k on fidelity at one point so my record is slightly worse than this", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "nice, so you started with -$16k, right?", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow!
