For me, earnings season ends with NVDA and I will probably again be zero percent cash with the next earnings season starts in earnest. There will be positive news stories between now and then, but I feel this rally was mostly driven by positive earnings reports given by a select group of companies, though it kicked off with more dovish Fed speak when small bank stocks were approaching lows. I know that I'm not the only person who has to pay a bunch of 2023 capital gains taxes (though I do have a separate broker for buy-and-hold stocks that only has dividend earnings but doesn't get messed up by taxes on FIFO buys and sells of the same ticker). I think tax season, given the incredible strength of 2023, is one reason why there is a risk of pullbacks and corrections. I am happy to hold through lows, but I don't want to be forced to sell at any potential ST lows mid-April, where I would ordinarily take on risk and buy. \n\nI'm still a long-term bull. But, the list of short-term risks I'm worried about is long. I'm worried about inflation, and the odds that huge rallies can continue at pace without inflation seems low. It's not part of the official Fed mandate to keep the stock market from huge gains, but I don't see them easing and lowering rates while stocks are ripping to new highs. I'm worried that the House of Representatives has inexperienced and dysfunctional leadership and they need to pass a budget eventually. I'm worried about the large gap between small caps and large caps, and usually the small caps catch up while the large caps sell off. Some people are saying that this time could be different because AI will empower companies to do more with fewer employees, which presents its own risk, since this is a consumer-driven economy. Also, alarm bells start going off when people start saying this time is different. I have never lived through a time when it really was different. Finally, I'm worried about the appearance of froth and eye-popping gains then sell-offs then gains of smaller AI-related stocks. I'm not calling an AI bubble right now. I think we will have more than one genuine AI bubble in the next 15 years. But, when bubbles happen, great stocks do great, then stocks with worse and worse fundamentals have huge rallies and reason goes out the window. \n\nFor me, there is more risk right now than late last year, [when people were screaming fire and I was excited to assume risk](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/17g0upg/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_oct_25_2023/k6fs1xy/?context=3) and I'm starting to lock in gains.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Personally I don't believe in trading in and out in such a short time period like the few weeks before earnings start up again.\n\nIt's a waste of mental energy and ultimately a fool's errand IMHO.

I even have LT underperforming index funds and a break glass in case of emergency treasuries that used to be 40% of my LT portfolio.\n\nThe purpose of my trading account is to 1) serve as an alternative to a savings account and 2) to take on more risk and I took on a lot of risk last year and this year.

The reasoning here is that the field of Deep learning moves so quickly. Every WEEK, there are multiple new implementations and algorithms that come out, and these new algorithms are firstly implemented in cuda (nvidia's gpu programming language), because 1. cuda is the industry standard, all researchers use it, and 2. cuda only works on nvidia gpus, but there are way more nvidia gpus in circulation. So the researchers on the front lines and the open source community are going to be first and foremost impelementing the best and fastest optimizations to model training + inference on CUDA. The reason why no one else (AMD) can compete with this, is that although they have their own rocM language and are trying to supportit better, the whole community uses CUDA because that's just simply what everyone uses. As a researcher, you will not use rocM because you will have to reinvent the wheel for a lot of utility functions or methods that your research builds on top of. So in this sense, Nvidia's established software ecosystem guarantees that model training/inference on nvidia gpus will be faster and more efficient than other competitor accelerators. It will continue to be that way since all of the SOTA developments are implemented in CUDA first, since it's the industry standard!

These results prove that Tesla has a giant lead in making electric vehicles at scale that are both affordable AND profitable, with the kicker being these same EVs could become next-generation transportation units with the advent of AI-powered self-driving technology.  \n>  \n>This transition is slated to have the same impact to the car industry that the iPhone had on mobile telecommunications and computing - yet most are still dismissing that this is a possibility.  \n>  \n>Let me walk you through why most people are in for a giant surprise as we reach the end of this decade, and it all starts with Tesla‚Äôs ambitions in entirely rethinking what a car should be, versus what it is today.  \n>  \n>Tesla believes it can get many of the cars in its over 5 million unit fleet, and all new cars being sold today, to become self-driving ‚ÄúRobotaxis‚Äù by leveraging the existing 8-camera + on board computer hardware suite that is shipped with every Tesla car today. A software update, potentially with its v12 iteration, will upgrade these cars from manually driven cars to cars that can drive themselves without the need of an attentive driver. The company is beginning to trial this software with its customer base, hoping to have a finalized version by the end of the year.  \n>  \n>On top of this, Tesla has been on a mission to dramatically bring down the cost and affordability of an electric vehicle. Thus far, this strategy has allowed Tesla to have the best selling car in the world with its Model Y. With EV tax credits in the US, the Model Y starts at $35k, which is $10k less than the average new car price in the US. This is quite an achievement, especially since Tesla unveiled its Model 3 sedan in 2016, which was slated to launch with a $35k starting price. 8 years later, Tesla is offering the same starting price, with EV incentives, in an SUV form factor and 8 years worth of inflation.  \n>  \n>Even with30% inflation over the last 8 years, and a larger form factor, Tesla still makes upwards of 20% margin on its EVs, while offering some of the most affordable EVs on the market. Both the Model Y and the Model 3 can be leased for under $400 per month. In that same period, gas cars are becoming more expensive, as legacy automakers continue to prioritize profits over affordability. EV prices are coming down, while gas car prices are going up. Not a good sign for the gas car industry.  \n>  \n>This means that the strategy Tesla is deploying of having affordable, profitable, and self-driving EVs that will eventually become the next generation of transportation, which many have thought is overly ambitious and downright pie-in-the-sky thinking, is beginning to bear fruit.  \n>  \n>This becomes quite obvious once we start looking at Tesla‚Äôs competition, especially in the US.  \n>  \n>Starting with Legacy Automakers, we are already well aware that these companies are pausing, delaying, or canceling their EV plans for the foreseeable future, including brands like Ford, GM, VW, and others.  \n>  \n>Once we look at their financials, it‚Äôs clear to see why. If we take Ford‚Äôs Q4 2023 earnings results, their EV division has stalled at 34,000 units sold per quarter for the last 3 quarters, while their average selling prices have dropped by 12% and their losses increased by 50%, from $1.1B lost per quarter, to $1.6B. On dealer lots, Ford EVs have days of inventory of well over 100 days. Dealers ideally want to have inventories of 60 days or less. The story is the same with other legacy automakers and their EVs.  \n>  \n>On the other hand, if we look at Tesla‚Äôs results, the company was able to grow their sales over the same 3 quarter period by 5%, while generating $2B of income in the fourth quarter. While Ford lost $1.6B from selling 34,000 EVs, Tesla made $2B from selling 484,000 EVs. Again, the story is the same across every legacy automaker.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">\n>But this continues to get more grim for Tesla‚Äôs competitors if we look at EV startups like Lucid and Rivian.\n>\n>For the fourth quarter of 2023, Rivian reported deliveries of 13,972 which is a 10% increase over the same period, but loss per car accelerated to negative -$113k per car. That means that for every car Rivian sold in Q4, they lost about $113k. The story gets worse when we look at Lucid, with deliveries of 1,734 in the same quarter, but losing about -$377k per car.\n>\n>In either case, Rivian and Lucid are both guiding to flat sales in 2024, which means that the levers they need to pull to lower costs and become profitable will not be available to them for the next 12 months. Even though Rivian in their Q4 filing said they are looking to reduce costs by as much as 50%, it will be nearly impossible without increasing volumes.\n>\n>Auto manufacturing is heavily dependent on scale. If Rivian is already losing more than $100k per car, and they are not expecting to grow much in 2024, then they will not be able to spread out their costs over more cars in order to increase their profits per car. The company is already planning to lay off 10% of its staff to try and reduce costs, but it is difficult to see how this will be a big enough step in order for the company to become profitable.\n>\n>Another issue arises when we look at how much cash both of these companies have on hand. Rivian has about $8B of cash on hand, while Lucid has a little under $1.4B. At current cash burn rates, Rivian has about a year and a half of cash left, while Lucid has roughly 6 months. Without raising money for their operations, both companies will be forced to either liquidate their assets, dramatically slash their production capacity (further increasing their cost per car), or file for bankruptcy.\n>\n>In Rivian‚Äôs case, it could be likely that they are able to raise cash in order to make it to the release of their next generation, more affordable vehicle, while Lucid‚Äôs only real hope is to be taken private by the Saudi fund that owns 60% of the company. To be clear, I‚Äôm a big fan of both company‚Äôs products, but if you can‚Äôt make money selling stuff, you‚Äôre not going to be around for very long.\n>\n>But in all cases above, the biggest issue facing all these automakers is that their scale of production for electric vehicles is not quite there yet. Tesla is making about half a million cars per quarter, while its competition is making less than 10% of that amount.\n>\n>While almost all of Tesla‚Äôs competitors are struggling to enter the EV space, Tesla has reached a 2 million per year run rate of EVs with only 4 models - the Model S, 3, X, and Y. They‚Äôve been able to achieve this with little to no advertising, and up until very recently, with above average prices relative to the broader markets.\n>\n>A notable exception here is BYD, which has surpassed Tesla in pure EV sales per quarter. However, it is important to note that BYD primarily sells its cars in the Chinese market, sells its cars at a much lower price point than Tesla, and has yet to prove it can make a profit on its EV line up. However, because of the company‚Äôs ability to offer EVs at very affordable prices (the company‚Äôs Seagull, its compact car, sells at about $11k US in China), BYD has already taken massive market share away from Legacy car companies, especially players like Volkswagen.\n>\n>What‚Äôs of note here is that Tesla is selling about the same number of EVs per quarter as BYD, but without an affordable compact car, and up until very recently, its Cybertruck pick up. However, for Tesla‚Äôs ability to reach Monopoly status, it is much less about the Cybertruck and much more about the compact car.\n>\n>Based on Tesla‚Äôs guidance, they are aiming to build an EV platform that reduces costs by as much as 50% by revolutionizing the manufacturing process. This should allow the company to build an EV that‚Äôs somewhere around the $25k starting price, before any federal or state EV incentives, that will be sold in the millions of units per year, with the company having a long-term target to reach 20 million cars sold per year.\n>\n>This means that for the first time in a long time, a US buyer could have access to a brand new car, that happens to be electric, that is under $25k with loads of software-driven features, high safety scores, and driving dynamics that are far superior to comparable gas vehicles due to its EV drivetrain.\n>\n>Even with this product in the wings, the biggest piece that will virtually secure Tesla‚Äôs monopoly is not solely due to its ability to make a very affordable car - but make a very affordable car that can drive itself.\n>", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">If we look at the auto landscape, there are no players that exist that are solving for self-driving technology that are low cost and high scale. With BYD‚Äôs claim in August of 2023 that full self-driving is essentially ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù, we are only left with players, outside of Tesla, that are solving for self-driving technology with very expensive hardware. Players like Waymo, Baidu, Zoox, and others rely heavily on LIDAR, Ultrasonics, and a bunch of other sensors that very rapidly increase the cost of admission for self-driving manufacturing.\n>\n>As impressive as these technologies are, the cost of manufacturing a self-driving car with these sensors runs somewhere in the six digit range, with estimates varying between $120k per car, upwards of $300k. This is because the companies have decided to solve self-driving cars with brute force - throw every sensor you can at the problem, map every road that the cars operate in, and figure out how to make it all work without running over people. Miraculously, many have figured out how to make this work, but at the expense of scale.\n>\n>It is MUCH more difficult to build many self-driving cars that are this expensive vs a company that can make the same car for under $20k, including all the hardware that‚Äôs needed to operate said cars. In addition, the roll out of these vehicles becomes increasingly difficult as every road that‚Äôs meant for these cars to operate in has to be mapped, and every little change has to be recorded so the cars don‚Äôt accidentally end up in ditches.\n>\n>This approach sets an artificial cap on self-driving technology. Regardless of how impressive the technology is, if it‚Äôs too expensive to make, and too cumbersome to roll out, it is not a viable business in the long term. The breakthrough needed is not the self-driving technology itself - but the manufacturing system that allows you to make self-driving cars that can be a viable business in the long term.\n>\n>This is Tesla‚Äôs bread and butter - creating manufacturing systems that convert state-of-the-art technologies into mass-market realities. And this is precisely what Tesla is achieving with the development of its Full Self Driving technology and its compact car.\n>\n>The previous 4 models, the S, 3, X, and Y, have allowed Tesla to build up enough data and expertise to make an 8 camera + onboard computer system. This likely costs no more than $2k all in, and the kicker is it‚Äôll drive just as good as a Waymo car at a fraction of the cost and at 1,000x the scale.\n>\n>If we fast forward to the end of the decade, and we assume that Tesla‚Äôs execution has allowed them to achieve autonomy at the level of a Waymo (or higher), which they can then beam to a fleet of at least 30 million cars, Tesla will easily have the most autonomous miles per year out of anyone in the world by a factor of at least 1,000. And it is the marriage of affordable EVs, that happen to drive themselves, that will allow the company to achieve this.\n>\n>For a competitor to get remotely close, they would have to do the following:\n>\n>\\- Come up with a self-driving system that will cost around $2k\n>\n>\\- Put these in cars that cost no more than $20k to produce\n>\n>\\- Make millions of these per year\n>\n>\\- Make them profitably\n>\n>Thus far, we have little data that points to any other player being able to make an EV profitably, let alone millions of them per year. The only player that can make many of them, BYD, has concluded that self-driving is impossible. In the meantime, Tesla has launched its v12 self-driving software that is navigating US roads at the level of a Waymo car. Tesla achieved this with about 1 year of development by offloading the code to an AI instead of a team of humans.\n>\n>As Tesla‚Äôs data collecting capacity grows as more and more Teslas populate the world, and as they ramp up their compute capability at its headquarters, the performance of their self-driving vehicles will only get better from here on out.\n>\n>Given all of this, is it really that unlikely that Tesla will have a Monopoly on transportation? Especially when:\n>\n>\\- They are the only player that can make self-driving cars profitably in the millions of units and‚Ä¶\n>\n>\\- Because their self-driving cars don‚Äôt need a human to drive them, which will remove the most expensive thing from a car today, making per-mile cost of transportation plummet to pennies on the dollar.\n>\n>The clue here is that Tesla is already beginning to offer licensing partnerships for its self-driving system. The company is clearly confident that they have what it takes to solve for self-driving in a very cost-effective manner. No one is taking them up on that offer, probably because most players are skeptical something like this is even possible. It surely sounds like pie-in-the-sky when a company claims that they‚Äôve figured out how to make cars drive themselves at a fraction of the cost than anyone else can.\n>\n>Time will tell who is right. I‚Äôm willing to bet on the company that has continually achieved feats that most thought impossible. This company probably knows a thing or two about making impossible things a reality.

My intention was to exit the position before the earnings release yesterday. Like a greedy moron, I did not make it a put spread to cap my downside.\n\nUnfortunately, as many of you know, the stock whipsawed like mad this week and suddenly I was down $10k on Tuesday. Not wanting to lock that in, I sold additional puts (560 strike) and closed them out within the day to lock in a roughly $1,000 profit.\n\nYesterday, is when the real stupidity began. I sold 745 Calls for $15.20 and 725 Calls for $14.60 to collect more theta ahead of earnings. As the day was coming to a close, I bought some 615 Puts to cap my downside on the 637.5 Puts. I then sold the 745 Calls for a $4k profit. My next step was to close out the short 725 Calls for a c. $500 profit and wait for the earnings release. However, as I tried to sell them with a few minutes in the day left, Thinkorswim notified me that if I did the trade, I would be classified as a pattern day trader. This hasn't happened to me before as I rarely do many day trades but what I've done this week triggered it. As time was winding down, rather than pulling the trigger on the sale and figuring out the pattern day trader stuff later, I panicked and bought some 760 Calls at $8.25 to reduce risk.\n\nThis morning, Nvidia was bouncing around and reached its prior high around $775 per share but it fell down to the high $750s. I saw I had a profit on the long 760 calls and that they also had a high rate of decay so I decided to sell while I still could and not deal with the uncertainty around the price. This was around a $5,500 gain on that option. However, I forgot that it was there to partially hedge the risk of the 725 Calls, which now **left me uncapped on upside risk**. Fifteen minutes later I noticed when the stock was in the mid $770s. I immediately closed out the short calls at $48.63.

The Little Book of Common Sense Investing is a decent read and probably his most highest selling. Recently picked up Clash of Cultures and skimming through it when I find down time. So far it seems suited here and highlights these scenarios of volatility around short term speculation. \n\nOP, sorry for your loss but thanks for sharing the mistakes. These are things that wisdom is built on. Sharing a couple lessons from my own experiences:\n\n1) Consider moving to a cash account to avoid being flagged a pattern day trader if you don‚Äôt have the funds to qualify. While margin can be useful it also comes with greater risk to your own capital. This is where the notion of a casino comes to play and how [margin calls](https://www.finra.org/investors/investing/investment-products/stocks/day-trading) come about from brokers who lend the margin. Do some reading on the history of how FINRA rules on PDT came to be. It‚Äôs important to understand the history so we don‚Äôt repeat it. Once I moved to a cash account I never went back even long after crossing the PDT threshold. \n\n2) Premiums for options are higher before earnings because of the risk of volatility. It‚Äôs important to remember your own personal evaluation of the company before selling options. Especially selling PUT options. Is NVDA something you‚Äôd want to own at X price point even if it‚Äôs currently a loss? It seems like your time horizon maybe wasn‚Äôt inline with a strategy. Were you chasing extremely short term gains and scalping off the volatility or interested in buying NVDA at what you thought was a good price and implementing a wheel strategy? Two different strategies with two different risk profiles.\n\n3) Remember what theta is! As a buyer of options theta is a risk. As a seller it‚Äôs advantageous. Try researching large changes in open interest before making big decisions. \n\n4) Learn how many positions or legs you‚Äôre capable of simultaneously managing. For me it‚Äôs 3-5 max with expirations at least 3-8 weeks out and calculating variance for each strike at different price points of the equity. \n\n5) [Tilt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_(poker)) is real and learn to recognize it and walk away. That‚Äôs exactly how you go from being down $1k to $29k. Slooooowwwww down. There are algorithms and big money that hunt this kind of thing. \n\n6) Remember (with very few exceptions) you can‚Äôt trade options after hours. This is a feature of the market.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I find #6 to be incredibly helpful at times, and incredibly hurtful at others. When you sell puts, and a stock continues to move up overnight and pre-market, it can benefit you from closing too early since you literally can't close.\n\nJust to add to point #6, though, for buying options:\n\nIf you buy options for earnings, and you think a large move up or down is short lived, you can use capital to lock in gains by shorting or buying shares of the stock. \n\nExample NVDA was 660 before earnings, lets say you bought a 600 put, stock falls to 550 in after hours. You think it will recover, but you can't close your long put because the market is closed. What you CAN do, is you can buy 100 shares @ 550, and if it comes back up, then you're making a capital gain on the shares that offsets the loss of the put by open. If it does not come back up, you can exercise the put to sell at 600.

To be clear, I was not looking for sympathy or support either. I had already written about it in my personal journal and thought it was worth posting.\n\nI've never said my mistakes were simple. They were just stupid. While I regret not entering into a put spread in the first place, it was on purpose. As you know, there are strategies when an option trade goes south.

I knew it was a mistake right after executing the trade but ran out of time. Why I bought a 760 call instead of a 730, I don't know.

It's impossible to grow output enough to be competitive while being profitable the entire time. You need to invest too much, and sell at lower prices and volumes than when you're established, and have to compete with well known brands.\n\nSo there's going to be a period where you're growing, you're trying to attract mass market buyers, and you're losing money. And those buyers are going to worry about you being around to provide service and warranties and parts down the line. Because if you go bankrupt the resale value of every car you've sold is going to plummet. Someone might buy a car that turns out to be a lemon, and they won't be able to get it fixed and they won't be able to sell it without losing a ton on resale.\n\nAnd of course your competitors are going to use this against you. Every car salesperson for an established brand is going to warn you against buying from a new company because \"they might be bankrupt next year.\"\n\nTesla faced this problem too, with the Model S. They were trying to convince people to buy a luxury EV instead of BMWs or Audis and people were worried that it might not work out and their expensive luxury car might end up being worth very little. \n\nSo Tesla offered a buy-back guarantee. If you wanted to sell your Tesla down the road, and couldn't get a decent price for it, Tesla would buy it back at a guarenteed price (taking in to account normal depreciation for miles, etc.) So customers knew that if they bought a Tesla they wouldn't be any worse off financially than if they'd bought a MB or Audi or something.\n\nBut what if Tesla went bankrupt, there'd be no one to honor the buy back? So Musk personally guaranteed the buy back program with his own money. If you wanted Tesla to buy back your car, Musk would make sure they had the funds to be able to do it.\n\nAnd it seems like it worked. People bought the Model S in high enough numbers for it to be profitable. Tesla's financials held up even with their huge growth, and the resale values held up too. I don't know if anyone ever actually had to use the buyback guarantee, and Musk certainly didn't need to bail out Tesla. But the company and Musk were willing to stand behind their products and give customers the confidence to buy, which helped the company succeed, and let people have a bit more piece of mind when making a big purchase.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "NVDA 3x went from ¬£5 in October 22 to ¬£500 now lol\n\nA casual 10k bet back at the low would have made you a million now.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Hindsight is w0ke", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "So is being poor", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I considered liquidating my Roth IRA and going all in on NVDA March 15 $700.

It doesn't have to try and keep going \"with the flow of traffic.\" And if it gets stuck somewhere and doesn't know where to go next, that's fine, at least it's not a safety issue\n* A bot will probably be working mostly with people who are trained to work with it. They'll know its limitations, where it might need help, what to do if something breaks, etc.\n* In a factory or warehouse or something similar, jobs can be split up between humans and bots so each can do what they're better at.\n\nAutonomous cars don't have any of that leeway. To be widely useful they really need to be able to handle any edge case at least well enough to keep going and find a safe place to stop. They're going to be working with the general public, who are mostly untrained and unpredictable. And they need to handle all the driving tasks, at least for L4 and L5, they can't share the work with humans.\n\nBots do have areas that are much harder. Making them compact and not too heavy, with decent battery life and having the balance to walk and dexterity to handle things with their hands are all big problems. But they're problems lots of people have been working on for decades. And the steady improvement in computing power, efficiency, battery density, etc. all help make these problems easier.\n\nThe big break through for either is Tesla's training data, data pipeline, compute, occupancy network, etc. It's possible that we'll look back and see that Tesla was able to build the infrastructure for making bots work by working on FSD. They were able to collect data with a stable and easy to make platform, cars, that could easily carry a bunch of cameras and compute around the world to collect data.

Throwing more GPUs at an LLM requires increasingly better communication to actually use more resources effectively.

Currently Nvidia is rising because it gets expanded in a major way. For now people focus too much on ChatGPT or Gemini and such tools. In my opinion after while it will become more like infrastructure where people build on top of it and bring their own monetization ideas.\n\nIn many way if you look at it big tech often does build the new things and then let other build on top. This in the end will cause that small caps and mid caps will use large cap infrastructure for everyone to make money. This is also a big reason in my opinion why indexes will still be top heavy and mid/small caps will underperform because the market basically pays fees to use the new things. Look at Windows, Azure, YouTube, AWS, Amazon or Facebook. They don't really build something they sell they just provide something hard to build and get fees from people using it.\n\nI personally don't think the whole AI is taking our jobs will actually manifest in any way. Some people will lose their jobs like in the past people at Nokia when smartphones arrived but I think the AGI is further away then many people think and the big ones just use it to hype it. Currently the result is very much limited by scaling and you can't scale into infinity. \n\nIn a theoretical world were todays work is worthless because of robots and things I also don't think people arguing for UBI are thinking much about it. Imagine right now people would get UBI (something like unlimited unemployment benefits) and people that own the robots. This will just create a system of the poor and the extremely rich. Great you don't have to work but you also have no way of getting more if robots do the job. \n\nIn my opinion the more realistic thing that will happen is that work will massively shift when robots take our jobs to creative and entertainment. Right now people already pay more to see a live concert instead of just buying the song for example. Right now people already pay more for hand made things instead of the cheaper factory made. Right now people watch sports instead of watching a machine hit every shoot.
