This sub has the attention span of a goldfish, so I won't delve into their spending plans of $355m in remodeling efforts for storefronts they don't even own, or that 40% of their online sales are store-pick up, yet they are closing 20-30 stores a year, and that those online sales have decreased 25% since covid vs their competitors whose online sales continue to rise steadily... etc.\n\nLet us just focus on their Q4 earnings for Feb 29th.\n\nEstimated EPS is **2.51**\n\nAvg estimate for Holiday Sales by Wall St is 14.5b a 1.3% decrease vs last years 4Q Sales.\n\nYet, in their last 10Q, Best Buy themselves estimate a sales decrease of 3% (14.3b) up to 7% (13.2b) for the holidays vs last year.\n\nTheir Non-GAAP Diluted EPS guidance for 2024 is in a range of 6.00-6.30, to reach this range their Q4 EPS would need to be 2.34-2.64 (currently 3.66). Avg estimate is 6.16. It is very likely they will be able to keep their EPS well above 6.00 with Non-GAAP dilution. The question is how much  will be needed to do so? And the greater that number, the weaker their EPS will look regardless if they beat 2.51 or not.\n\nThe stock didn't move much after their previous Q4 report last March despite a beat on earnings by +0.50 -- 2.61 vs and the estimate 2.11. But over the next 2 months the price dropped from $80 to $69 before heading back up. I expect something similar to happen after this Q4.\n\nThe Price drifted down to a 52week low of $62 in November before their most recent earnings report. In this report Best Buy decreased their yearly revenue guidance from a $43.8b-$44.5b range to a $43.1b-$43.7 range. Despite this, the stock rose back up to $78 riding the winter bull wave.\n\nBasically, I think this stock is shit and currently overpriced in the $75-$76 range. If Best Buy has poor holiday sales this year, it will only add to their already declining image in the retail industry.\n\nTheir stock price is propped up on a 5% dividend yield and $5 billion being spent over the next year in share repurchasing. They are showing symptoms of a falling company in multiple facets.\n\nI can't see how they can have an impressive earnings report with an 8% decrease in sales so far this year. They are banking on holiday sales to save them, but with the negative holiday spending sentiment reported so much throughout Nov-Dec it will be hard for them to win. This earnings report could be what drives their stock price down to the $60s where it belongs.\n\nSomething that will really hinder them this year is an increased Income Tax of 24%. To beat an EPS of **2.51** They will need to have at least 14.29b in Holiday Sales, an exact 3% decrease vs last years sales. With a generous operating margin of 5% (roughly their Q4 AVG) they will receive $714m in EBIT which will equate to $543m after taxes or a 2.52 EPS for around 215m shares. All of these numbers are totally rough and are merely meant to give an idea of what they'd need to have a successful earnings.\n\nThat is the most lowest sales decrease percentage given by Best Buy in the their guidance anything lower than 3% and they will miss earnings.\n\nOne Note: Apple's Device Sales for Q4 are up 0.1% compared to last year:\n\n$96,458 in 2024 vs $96,388 in 2023\n\nThe entire economy is vastly different post pandemic, yet Best Buy is returning to pre-covid numbers. They are losing against Walmart, Target, and of course Amazon.\n\nI have around $3k in puts so far and plan to add a few thousand more before earnings. I'd suggest the April 70s on account of the delayed drop in price after their previous Q4 report.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zs39ai3mtpgc1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=3422caa078463ccc137f909f8037815739fa5820\n\nIf you want to make real money, inverse me and buy calls. I will most definitely get fucked on this position and curse the day I ever bet against Best Buy.\n\nEDIT - There's also subreddit for the people that work there.

She saw the surge in e-commerce during the pandemic and thought that’s the basket BBY should put all its eggs into. Every year since there has been surges of mass layoffs, and remaining employees were heavily understaffed to deal with the amount of customers that came into the stores after things started opening back up. Customers became impatient and angry very quickly.\n\nOn top that in a market where brick and mortar was already dying off former CEO Hubert Jolie (the CEO that saved BBY from bankruptcy and made BBY one of the last profitable brick and mortar retailers) knew BBY would have to offer a customer experience that online couldn’t provide. He did this by investing a lot into training the employees to being highly specialized within their departments so employees could give expert level advice within their departments. Corrie got rid of most those highly specialized employees in the waves of layoffs, those who remained no longer are specialists in one department but generalists in every department, with very little training on the product. So the expert advice customers came in for was no longer a thing either. She moved the focus of new hires to learn about selling the credit card and whatever new membership they’re trying to push. They stopped investing in their Geek Squad department especially in the in home installation for products in favor of cheaper third party labor that do a lousy job, and took away the customers ability to call the store directly when the third party botch the installation. \n\nThe memberships have been changing every year offering less and less benefit, but with little to no price drop. Employees have a conspiracy theory that she’s intentionally ruining the retail experience to push customers to the e-commerce site instead, not realizing that if most customers had a bad experience at Best Buy they’re probably not gonna buy from bestbuy.com. Corrie has shown evidence to being that kind of tone deaf often through communications with employees and press interviews, including one where she blamed Taylor Swift and the “funflation” as to why sales were down in 2023.\n\nI worked for Best Buy since 2018. The pandemic hurt, but 2021 we had a store full of customers on the regular. Then each year less and less of those customers came back, and I don’t think it’s just cause brick and mortar overall is dying. I think under her leadership BBY has been eroding consumer trust. I personally heard angry customers shout “I’m never coming back here again” at increasing amount last few years, and that sentiment has proven to be true.

Also they seem predatory on extended warranties but I'm sure they need to sell them to be profitable. \n\nI would guess their biggest money makers are selling computers, appliances, and TVs. Not sure how they do on smartphones. Appliances are a rough market between Costco, Lowe's, Home Depot, Menard's, and smaller local retailers. For computers, they have to compete with the other companies I mentioned. Geek Squad was probably a decent revenue stream but IDK how long people keep TVs and computers these days. A decent chunk of the computer userbase has probably moved on to tablets and smartphones anyways, which are easier to use and maintain.

Games like Roblox or call of duty have their own digital storefronts, and BB can and does sell gift cards, but it's not the same margins as selling physical games. Most of the profit goes back to the publisher or it goes to online distributors like Steam, Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox live, etc. I assume that when movies went to streaming, companies like BB lost revenue when streaming services ate up the userbase that had existed for physical media. \n\nThis is subjective, but I find the store layout to be depressing now.

Hence, while the $900 mark might seem optimistic, the combination of these factors can make a $900 call option a strategic, if speculative, investment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcq29hkz8ugc1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bc8ce33f0f5286a4818f6e63d6cb8eef52e78d3", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Also made a quick 900$ for today", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I made 1,300 yesterday.
