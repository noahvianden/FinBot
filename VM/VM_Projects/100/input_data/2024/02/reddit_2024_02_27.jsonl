The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.\n\nThe two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the team working on the car — known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG — will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.\n\nThe Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and car designers. It’s possible that they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it’s unclear how many.\n\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.\n\nThe decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation.\n\nBut the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team’s leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took over the undertaking a few years ago — following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor Co.\n\nThe decision to wind down the project was finalized by Apple’s most senior executives in recent weeks, according to the people. It comes just a month after Bloomberg News reported that the project reached or a make-or-break point. The most recent approach discussed internally was delaying a car release until 2028 and reducing self-driving specifications from Level 4 to Level 2+ technology.\n\nMost recently, Apple had imagined the car being priced at around $100,000. But executives were concerned about the vehicle being able to provide the profit margins that Apple typically enjoys on its products. The company’s board was also concerned about continuing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a project that may never see the light of day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsources;\n\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai?srnd=homepage-canada](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai?srnd=homepage-canada)\n\n[https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/apple-car-project-canceled-report.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/apple-car-project-canceled-report.html)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project-titan/](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project-titan/)\n\n[https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-apple-car-project-moves-team-to-generative-ai-projects/](https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-apple-car-project-moves-team-to-generative-ai-projects/)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-cancels-work-ev-moves-staff-ai-project-bloomberg-reports-2024-02-27/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-cancels-work-ev-moves-staff-ai-project-bloomberg-reports-2024-02-27/)\n\n[https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/](https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/)\n\n[https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/apple-cancels-electric-car-generative-ai-1235924288/](https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/apple-cancels-electric-car-generative-ai-1235924288/)\n\n[https://www.macworld.com/article/2249497/apple-car-project-canceled-generative-ai.html](https://www.macworld.com/article/2249497/apple-car-project-canceled-generative-ai.html)\n\n[https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/hybrid-electric-vehicles/apple-is-done-with-building-an-apple-car-according-to-a-report-and-everything-ive-been-telling-you-for-the-last-nine-years](https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/hybrid-electric-vehicles/apple-is-done-with-building-an-apple-car-according-to-a-report-and-everything-ive-been-telling-you-for-the-last-nine-years)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/technology/personaltech/apple-ends-electric-car-plan.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/technology/personaltech/apple-ends-electric-car-plan.html)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/apple-car-project-canceled-ced2b626](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/apple-car-project-canceled-ced2b626)\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancellation-of-car-effort-boosts-urgency-of-bets-on-ai-headset-1.2040140", "id": "1b1klxa", "created_utc": 1709062199.0, "score": 1099, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 301, "comments": [{"body": "They did it you bastard, they said AI!\n\nCALLS", "score": 237, "replies": [{"body": "LMAO, they are really going up.

We have orders of magnitude more computing power in our pockets today.\n\nLCD screens are \\_massive\\_ computer chips. They were outrageously expensive for many years. Now, we have 75\" being sold at a discount at Walmart. A VR screen is tiny and has similar economic issues as high end CPU dies(wafer yields, factories able to manufacture at small process sizes, etc).\n\nDisplays are indeed the main expense. Sure they have a bunch of sensors but they are quite cheap(since they are used for other applications)  and getting cheaper – that's for newer headsets that are relying on cameras and accelerometers instead of \"lighthouses\"(those are pretty specific to VR and a dead end). Displays still have economy of scale issues; production ramp up will be required to make them significantly cheaper. The pixels in the Vision Pro are around the size of your red blood cells. That's expensive to do (today!). But the LCD screen in the first iPhone was considered 'giant' (and it was really expensive).\n\nHigh resolution, high refresh rate video are just a matter of processing power and that keeps improving. Those aren't even the main constraints anymore. The main constraints are: weight and power(which is also related to battery weight). The Quest 2 processor is underclocked for that reason(haven't checked the newest). You don't want a heavy hot thing with poor battery power in your face. That is also the reason the Vision Pro makes you look like an Ood (https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zarbi/images/1/1f/Possessed\\_Ood\\_Group.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101021182020)\n\nI would argue that many headsets aren't even that expensive anymore; see Meta's offering. It's a full computer, it just has software that restricts what it can do, much like a tablet. You could even say that it's a tablet in a different format.\n\nEveryone still needs a laptop \\*today\\*. If I had a laptop-class CPU/GPU in my headset (and we have that on the Vision Pro today), why would I even \\_need\\_ a laptop(assuming the headset is comfortable and the apps are there)? And we wouldn't need large monitors anymore for most uses. Next time I'm on a trip there's a pretty high chance I'll take the Vision Pro. There's zero chance I'm lugging my monitor around. I may or may not carry the laptop (same criteria when choosing a laptop vs a tablet).\n\nIs a Vision Pro a luxury today? Most definitely, and it's out of reach for most people on this planet. Are VR headsets \\_always\\_ going to be luxury devices? I am less convinced – they are computers, sensors, screens and lenses, all of which we know how to do and there's still room for incremental advances. Portable, personal, wireless phones were also a luxury reserved to the ultra rich and business people, and they were incredibly bulky and power hogs.

This came as a shock to Kane and the larger San Francisco community, at a time when sensitivities towards septic services are at an all time high. San Francisco mayor London Breed weighed in: \"The downstream effects of this anti-septic attitude displayed by Tesla should be worrisome to all Bay Area residents. A risk to our septic service members is a risk to everyone.\"  The news was a jolt to Kane (whose pronouns could not immediately be identified). Xhe said, \"We have already seen the septic community in the Bay Area taken to new lows, with increased public acceptance of public sewage deposits. Now, some of our largest contracts are being canceled. We are circling the drain here.\" Experts noted that this is an especially difficult time for the septic industry, once a proud stalwart of the world's fifth largest economy. If San Francisco based X (formerly Twitter) joins into the septic boycott, the resulting chaos could send California into a tailspin. Kane noted that Bay Area Septic Diver Services recently had to close their wine bars and sell their nap pods to stay in business. Xhe fears the psychological effects on the septic divers may be irreversible. Septic divers  require extensive expensive training, and a migration to cleaner pastures would be catastrophic. \"We are looking at the potential to create an enormous vacuum within the Bay Area septic community. Tesla is the first domino to fall, but a year from now, we may be reading about a community of 7.8M people living in a septic desert, with inadequate access to septic services.\" UC Berkley Septic expert Silas Timber noted that there are no government protections for the septic industry, and no programs to support Californians in a septic desert. \"We really haven't seen enough effort from Sacramento to address this stuff. We are teetering on the rim of an enormous public health catastrophe.\"\n\nThe backlash also reached national levels. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts held an impromptu press conference. \"We need to regulate irresponsible corporate septic evasion. We've had enough crap from billionaires like Elon Musk and his stinking attitude. My colleagues and I will fight for septic justice for all Americans and American identifying people around the world.\"\n\nTesla did not return multiple requests for comment, and does not have a PR department.
