Spending decreased 0.1% versus the estimate for a 0.2% gain.\r  \n\r  \nJanuary‚Äôs price rises reflected an ongoing shift to services over goods as the economy normalizes from the Covid pandemic disruptions.\r  \n\r  \nServices prices increased 0.6% on the month while goods fell 0.2%; on a 12-month basis, services rose 3.9% and goods were down 0.5%. Within those categories, food prices accelerated 0.5%, offset by a 1.4% slide in energy. On a year-over-year basis, food was up 1.4% while energy fell 4.9%.\r  \n\r  \nBoth the headline and core measures remain ahead of the Fed‚Äôs goal for 2% annual inflation. While the Fed officially uses the headline measure, policymakers tend to pay more attention to core as a better indication of where long-term trends are heading.\r  \n\r  \nWall Street reacted little to the news, with stock market futures up slightly and Treasury yields slightly higher. Futures markets where traders bet on the direction of interest rates also indicated little movement, with pricing tilted toward the Fed‚Äôs first rate cut coming in June.\r  \n\r  \n‚ÄúOverall, \\[the report\\] is meeting the expectations, and some of the worst fears in the market weren‚Äôt met,‚Äù said Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist at Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale. ‚ÄúThe key is we‚Äôre not seeing the broad nature of increases that we had been more fearful of.‚Äù\r  \n\r  \nThursday‚Äôs BEA report also showed that consumers are continuing to dip into savings as prices stay elevated. The personal savings rate was 3.8% on the month, slightly higher than December but off a full percentage point from where it was as recently as June 2023.\r  \n\r  \nIn other economic news, a Labor Department report showed that companies are still reluctant to lay off workers.\r  \n\r  \nInitial jobless claims totaled 215,000 for the week ended Feb. 24, up 13,000 from the previous period and more than the 210,000 Dow Jones estimate but still largely in keeping with recent trends. However, continuing claims, which run a week behind, rose to just above 1.9 million, a gain of 45,000 and higher than the FactSet estimate for 1.88 million.\r  \n\r  \nThe reports come as central bank officials mull the future of monetary policy following 11 interest rate increases totaling 5.25 percentage points. Running from March 2022 to July 2023, the hikes came as the Fed battled inflation that peaked at a more than 40-year high in mid-2022.\r  \n\r  \nOfficials have said in recent days that they expect to begin reversing the increases at some point this year. However, the timing and extent of the policy easing is uncertain as recent data has indicated that inflation could be more stubborn than expected.\r  \n\r  \nJanuary‚Äôs consumer price index data raised fears of persistently high inflation, though many economists saw the rise as impacted by seasonal factors and shelter increases unlikely to persist.\r  \n\r  \nWhile the CPI is used as an input to the PCE, Fed officials focus more on the latter as it adjusts for substitutions consumers make for goods and services as prices fall. Where the CPI is viewed as a simpler price measure, the PCE is viewed as more representative of what people are actually buying", "id": "1b31nk9", "created_utc": 1709217037.0, "score": 264, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 136, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

For instance, if the AI is primarily shown white swans, it learns to associate swans with the color white, leading to a predominance of white swan images. In an effort to counteract such bias, Google may have overcompensated, inadvertently introducing a new bias by over-representing black swans to counteract the perceived white bias.\n\nEhhhh, the way it was behaving I'm almost 100% for sure what you describe above is NOT what was happening.  In fact I'm pretty sure that Gemini itself is NOT 'woke', but it is actually Google or somebody at Google that is 'woke' and what was actually happening was PROMPT engineering.\n\nBasically Gemini was probably producing during Goggle's internal testing, by default, a lot of white people in images.  Like Google testers probably said \"american family\" and then 19 out of 20 images would be all white people or something like that.  Which would actually be a bad result for \"american family.\"  Google, as you said, was in a HUGE RUSH, so instead of actually taking the time to train their AI properly (ie to teach it that America, unlike a lot of countries, is diverse, while places like Norway or Sudan or China are not as diverse) instead took a giant REALLY STUPID SHORTCUT - they programmed their system to CHANGE YOUR PROMPTS invisibly to ask for diversity, when you didn't ask for diversity.\n\nSo, what is essentially happening, is that you are typing in:\n\n\"American family\"\n\nand the system is inserting EXTRA WORDS into the prompt to make sure Gemini doesn't give only white people, and so the prompt is secretly altered to:\n\n\"**diverse** American **multiethnic** family\" ...or something like that.\n\nYou don't see that on the front-end, it is behind the scenes.  This is not an alteration to the AI itself, which Google thinks is racist, but instead just a SECRET alteration to YOUR INSTRUCTIONS.  And in that example it works properly. It then gives you a mix of white and black and asian and hispanic families... America!\n\nHOWEVER, Google is idiots, so they are doing this WITH ALL POTENTIALLY \"white\" or non-diverse prompts.\n\nSo yeah, you prompt for:\n\n\"photograph of a viking\"\n\nand the shit system CHANGES that to:\n\n\"photograph of a **racially diverse and multiethnic** viking\"\n\nAnd you get what you get.\n\nOr you ask for\n\n\"picture of George Washington\"\n\nand secretly your prompt is changed to\n\n\"picture of **multiethnic diverse intersex** George Washington\"\n\nThe prompting system is likely programmed to NOT alter prompts it detects are not \"white heavy\" or \"male heavy\" already. Which is why if you type \"African Family\" you still get all black people.\n\nAnyway.... TLDR: I strongly believe Google was just altering everybody's prompts.  I don't think Gemini itself is \"woke\".  I actually think Google thinks Gemini is racist, and that is why they felt the need to alter the prompts.\n\n(To be clear, this isn't like my theory... this has been hashed out by a lot of people.

If you are in the money, same thing, you still have the intrinsic value of the option. The problem can come up if you bought an option when IV is high and it is not in the money...so the value of the option is purely speculation.

That's 400%+ gains, good enough to exit even if you leave the potential of money on the table. Could it moon tomorrow and be worth a lot more than 3.60? absolutely. Whether or not it is worth the risk is up to you. One thing you could do since you had two of them was sell one, keep the capital, and gamble the other one and see where it goes...at least you won't be in the red that way...but again, up to you and your situation. $720 might not seem like much to some but it can mean paying rent for others. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember this with options: if the trade does not go your way, you lose everything.

{"title": "Nvidia has peaked, time for Warner Bros", "selftext": "üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\nLet‚Äôs analyze the S&P 500‚Äôs best performer, and their worst. \n\nI truly think NVDA is as great of a company as they say. That‚Äôs why I invested at $150 a share when they were down off crypto (couldn‚Äôt hold it as it went down to $120 and I was full ported $6k in shares on margin, I do belong here I‚Äôm not the best at dip buying). I just think the other semiconductor companies like TSM haven‚Äôt yet enjoyed the catch up growth, and we‚Äôll soon find that NVIDIA‚Äôs moat is not as big they say it is.\n\nIn any case, WBD is now down ~90% due to the combo of the possible death of cable, theaters, the strikes, the (now reduced) debt etc and it‚Äôs had their investors depressed like those longing BlackBerry, but me entirely seeing dollar signs because they have the one streaming platform that can by itself face off against Netflix and Disney‚Äôs offerings (who have been doing great), a streaming platform which somehow beat Disney and Hulu to profitability this last quarter.\n\nNot to mention, the release of Sora AI should drastically lower the cost of film production. I hear them say $30 million is a small budget for an animated film? Psssh‚Ä¶. uh, buddy, Dall E charges $0.04 a picture, that‚Äôs ~$4,500 for the number of frames in Toy Story. Where are you getting your frames. \n\nAnyways Sora is developed by OpenAI, which recently worked out a deal with CNN, Warner Bros‚Äô subsidiary, for training data for GPT:\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-10/openai-in-talks-with-cnn-fox-and-time-to-license-content\n\nWhich by the way, should be telling of what‚Äôs to come. A sufficiently large library of training data is required for all AI to achieve performance. For LLM‚Äôs like GPT, that‚Äôs well written text. For image AI like Dall E, that‚Äôs well composed pictures and art. For video AI like Sora, I imagine it‚Äôll be well composed video content. Specifically, pre ai-tainted data, as we‚Äôve found AI in AI training data taints the batch: https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/07/17/llm-data-contamination/amp/\n\nWhere am I going with this? Well obviously as OpenAI is facing lawsuits due to using copyrighted data for training, they‚Äôre increasingly realizing they‚Äôll have to pay to license that valuable data, as they are with Warner Bros at CNN.\n\nAnd who has the largest (pre-AI) library of owned,  well composed professional video content in one place? (Alongside evaluation ratings data for said video content)\n\nDisney and Warner Bros.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if they realize it, but those two likely have the highest potential for firm ownership or licensing for higher quality performance video AI models. I heard Zaslav though is a cable obsessed old head so he might need to be swayed by a more modern tech affiliated type to realize this.\n\nThis is why I also support the possible merger with Paramount, that sinking ship, even though it‚Äôll result in possible short term debt/chaos, as they say that‚Äôll include DreamWorks and a generally large enough media library to match Disney no question if they don‚Äôt have that already. Plus I think Zaszlav seems like he can handle debt. Owning the most pre-ai media content will soon be king.\n\nAnyways, just my thoughts. Sora AI comes out this year and already exists so the paradigm shift is happening. If it can make even 50% of the movie frames pre-photoshop, it‚Äôll be wild. WBD moon üöÄüöÄ etc\n\nEDIT: Sora transition shot video: https://youtu.be/TAflTfPckQs?si=tEFHP6y3VEFoeDYj\n\nEDIT 2: Tech companies in particular are often valued for the quality of their data. The simple explanation is this: if I have superior data for instance of your internet traffic, I can make a trading AI that trades superior to the market and you. This is a real tactic employed I won‚Äôt say where. Superior data = superior AI performance. For these reasons, data is like Silicon Valley gold, in case you want to know why Google hates your privacy. Conveniently enough, I was an AI Specialist at one of the big tech companies you guys talk about here I won‚Äôt say which one. Recently laid off, which is why I lately have the time for this post.\n\nIn any case, if I had to pick one asset to own if I was a machine learning engineer tasked to develop a model to compete with Sora, I‚Äôd pick Warner Bros no contest with their 12,500+ well made films, labeled by production, and tens of thousands of tv shows, etc.\n\nDisney could do well too, with their well stored 6,500,000+ art pieces for their media, however I know for a fact their video content and data skews family friendly. Which might mess up your AI generated concept broody Viking or War film for making it look too much like Frozen. For the more varied and diverse data all in one place, I‚Äôd definitely say Warner Bros wins no question.", "id": "1b37byx", "created_utc": 1709231067.0, "score": 372, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 269, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 7 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 48 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Dune Part Two is amazing.

WBD predicted a domestic opening of $65M vs. $80M+, close to a +20% beat. Note: these opening figures are studio estimates made on Saturday and are likely higher if you factor in a stronger Sunday due to reviews / word of mouth.\n\nFull box office: The only two sequels rated higher than Dune 2 are the The Dark Knight and LOR Twin Towers, which did \\~5x their openings weekend in total box office. Which would imply Dune 2 will gross close to $1B, roughly a 30% beat.\n\n‚ÄúThe only reason it wasn‚Äôt higher is we ran out of seats,‚Äù said Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX (([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-4.html)](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-4.html))).\n\nAdditional: I‚Äôve never known anyone that‚Äôs gone to see a movie twice in theaters.

In addition, Dune 1 / 2 are based on book #1 out of a series of 6, which leaves the door open for a decade of blockbusters, etc.\n\nNow if you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre probably thinking ‚ÄúWBD has revenues of \\~$40B, how would this make a big impact or be a strong positive catalyst‚Äù.

In a few years it might be able to reduce the amount of time it takes to make an animated movie, which reduces costs in that way, but it'll still take the staff it requires today. They'll just be using AI tools integrated into the tools they're using today. Right now, AI tools work well sometimes, sometimes they don't.

They all have strict language about the use of AI and its only going to become more restrictive every time there are new deals to be negotiated. Every sector of the industry has a union and every union will be protecting its workers. \n\nThe issue with licensing the WBD library for AI training is another issue. We know that the stuff AI creates is just a reassembly of everything it has ingested. Well the union deals involve writers, directors and other creatives getting credits and payments when their work is used. So it opens the door for piles and piles of lawsuits and audits. Either way, if they do pull of the licensing, it won't be at a price big enough to move the scale against the massive amount of debt WBD is under. Just like how AI tools decreasing the time it takes to make a movie will save SOME money but won't be a game changer.\n\nBest case scenario, a mutual AI relationship allows WBD to crank out more content but that doesn't increase the value of the product. You like HBO because of specific shows, not because of their entire library. \n\nAnd on a personal level, we like movies and shows because they touch our soul in some way. We develop a connection with the story and characters on a personal level. It was all fine crafted by passionate people who put their soul into making it. If they start cranking out stuff that was made by a machine with no soul and no connection to the human experience than we're less likely to connect to it.

{"title": "$ESTC is going to disappoint on earnings", "selftext": "Elastic is reporting earnings AH today, and I believe they are going to heavily disappoint and dump.\n\nPositions(Will add more right before close):\n\n3x ESTC 3/15/24 130 P  \n4x ESTC 3/15/24 125 P  \n5x ESTC3/15/24 120 P  \n\n\nFor those who don't know, Elastic and Snowflake are used for similar purposes, I'll let chatgpt summarize it:  \n\n\n>Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehouse solution designed for storage and analytics, offering a powerful SQL engine for handling structured and semi-structured data. It scales compute and storage independently, allowing for flexible and efficient data processing.  \n>  \n>Elasticsearch, part of the Elastic Stack, is a search and analytics engine optimized for searching, analyzing, and visualizing large volumes of data in near real-time. It's particularly strong in search scenarios, log and event data analysis, and providing insights across large datasets.\n\nNow, we all remember what happened to SNOW this earnings - they beat expectations, but they were still not profitable (non-GAAP does not count). Additionally, their future guidance was low.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wo4jfled2llc1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf65bc653a51e5aecaae467e7fa2051d52f89aa5\n\nWe've seen what happens to other tech companies that are focused on growth and report poor guidance this earnings season like DDOG, ANET. Additionally, Elastic is **not yet profitable**. They crash. Hard.  \n\n\n# Why do I know Elastic is going to disappoint on guidance?\n\n**Tl;dr I don't know, but I think its very likely**  \n Snowflake and Elastic are competing in similar spaces. Additionally, there is also databricks, a private company that competes in this space as well and has been gaining market share.  \nAs a software engineer, I've seen lots of companies recently start focusing on optimizing spending on cloud, internal tools recently, which would include stuff like datadog, elasticsearch(for logging), AWS etc..  \n\n\nWhile elastic is easy to use, there is  simply too much competition and cost cutting going on for them to have good guidance. I cannot see a reason why companies like DDOG, PANW, SNOW would give lower guidance and expect ESTC to have good guidance, given that they are in highly related spaces.  \n\n\n# Options Chain\n\nAfter the SNOW crash, I decided to take a look at the options chain for ESTC, as options chain data is sometimes helpful in predicting earnings(You can check these messages on WSB discord)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3mzib45v3llc1.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=46d9ad3b749f298e6761b524f7fca0b9ed88fa83\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/649t459x3llc1.png?width=454&format=png&auto=webp&s=d926133d97726de6adf4db330670a8d2f27da317\n\n[EXPE crashed after earnings too.](https://preview.redd.it/mntcm6dh4llc1.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=c051689f675582cc53dc509dd17432ae4b6e2da8)\n\nNow, the options chain for SNOW was only slightly bearish, maybe around 55% bearish vs 45%. However, I saw this massive order block on ESTC for around **2 million USD** in PUTS that are OTM, and expire soon. This means that someone is betting a huge amount of money that a drop will happen soon, that is significant enough to breakeven on these contracts.   \n\n\n2 million dollars on OTM puts that expire soon is extremely rare on non-etfs/mag7, and although we cant confirm its the same trader, the sizing, timing and repeated buys make it highly likely\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37egeocq3llc1.png?width=2535&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbc5f51255b1905b8d87f817c75512a71efd23cf\n\nNow, this put buy was NOT BTC so it was someone opening a position, because we can see that the OI has stayed on the options chain till today. This means that whoever is in their position is holding it over earnings. They haven't closed out their position yet, and if they do before market close I will update this post.  \n\n\nTL;DR   \n\n\nESTC will disappoint on guidance, similar to SNOW.
