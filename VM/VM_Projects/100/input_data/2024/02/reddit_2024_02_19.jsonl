Of course, since demand continues to be strong and judging by prior earnings reports across the tech and semi space, it would seem demand is still strong for Nvidia's chips and the valuation behind the price isn't that ludicrous if their earnings keep going up so there is risk of missing out on what could be further gains ahead.

But when the cycle turns, it turns hard. \n\nTo be honest, I like all the mega-cap tech stocks right now (except for maybe Tesla, but it had long-term potential) because of the AI tailwinds and also the improvements we've seen in their core business following the pandemic-related inflation reset. And if these companies become the leading Kickstarter for companies outside of tech to improve their earnings - think how Facebook and social media during the pandemic helped non-tech companies attract sales - then imagine how AI and the core businesses of big tech can be a bigger opportunity. This is why I'm long mega-cap tech for the most part - Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple. I think there is a risk that these companies develop their own chip ecosystems for AI and will rely less on Nvidia while their tailwinds continue and Nvdia could drop as a result.

Now this is a tricky and high risk thing to invest in - because someone could be wrong - like  investing in a former star like Sears when they should have been investing in Walmart.   I actually prefer to invest most of my money in index funds like $VOO and $SCHD instead because of the high risk of individual stock investing.\n\nWith that said here are the beaten down tech companies I think have a good future:\n\nIntel ($INTC) - Intel used to have most of the server and PC market.  They lost a lot of their business in the last decade when they could not keep up with the rapid technology improvement of other players like AMD, TSMC, etc.   Even some of their biggest customers like Apple fired them recently for better custom designed ARM chips built by TSMC.   I think their latest CEO has recognized the problems and has a good plan to get those customers back.    This plan even involves making some of their competitors as potential future customers (AMD, Nvidia, etc).  What is this ingenious plan you ask?   To regain their status as the most advanced and best foundry in the world and to allow everyone to build custom chips in their advanced foundries.   If successful - this could be a huge gain in the stock in the next few years.  If you believe the AI hype - then you should also be bullish on all the world's chip foundries.  We will need all the foundries working overtime to build all those AI chips.\n\nAli Baba - ($BABA) - While I don't invest in $BABA - I think they are the Amazon of China.

Like Amazon - $BABA is a technology company that just happens to have a large retail web site as well.   I would not be surprised if $BABA goes 10 times higher in the next 5 years.   The main risk for owning $BABA (or any Chinese stock) is if China and the US end up in a conflict.  If this happens your shares will be destroyed by that situation (like most Russian stock was) . It is my belief that $BABA is down now because of the massive recession in China. China has had it's version of our dot com crash and financial crisis happen at the same time in the last couple of years.  If you think China will soon get out of this recession -$BABA is one of the better stocks to own (in my opinion).\n\nNote:  I don't have any shares of $BABA - since I don't trust owning any Chinese stock right now.

They just think that fad didn’t work for them and move on to the next one. They weren’t going to fail with their Peloton then suddenly pick it back up again. They would say “well, Peloton didn’t work for me. Maybe I’ll try this new fad” and the fad dies. \n\nI hedged that thinking with a “what if Peloton somehow does maintain popularity” thesis… If I was wrong and demand for Pelotons remained high, there was still going to be a HUGE number of people who bought bikes, gave up and would be selling them. The resale market would eventually cannibalize new Peloton sales. People exiting the peloton market to people entering and Peloton being cut out of the transaction. \n\nI’m really hoping some new exercise equipment blows up under a publicly traded company.

Someone that started getting into buying Lulu to hit the gym might keep buying matching, comfortable Lulu for years after that 6-week period they were hitting the gym. Sometimes I feel like people buy the gym accessories as a proxy for feeling like they made progress. (“Maybe buying 6 new gym outfits will motivate me”) once someone gets settled in on a brand they love they may never let go of it, even if they never work out again. It becomes part of their identity and it’s sticky. \n\n2) Lulu diversified from gym clothing until basically all casual clothing, for men and women. I don’t own a pair myself because they are ridiculously expensive but the number of times I’ve heard how comfortable and amazing the men’s Lulu khakis are is enough to make me not short the stock alone.

([Yeah, you know that douchy look](https://www.instagram.com/midtownuniform?igsh=NmVqODQ2MDUyc2F6)) \n\n3) I would bet that Lulu might go broader and cheaper as they lose their premium status. If alo comes in and takes the “it girl” crown from Lulu, I’ll bet Lulu just starts trying to play the value brand game and shifts away from the premium brand game. You’ll start seeing cheaper products and they will partner with a store like Target then eventually JC Penny and Marshalls/Ross for wider distribution to different classes that weren’t buying Lulu previously. They have brand recognition and a premium aura. This is basically what we saw happen with older premium brands like Polo/Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfigger, Calvin Klein, Guess, Nautica, and Nike. In the 90s and early 2000’s it didn’t get any more premium than those names.

You might not have qualified for these simply due to the amount of money you held in investments. \n\nAside from aid that you may not have qualified for, or may not have asked for -- well it seems to me that you were engaged in trading stocks, options, or securities in a market that is regulated by the government in values expressed in a fiat currency that only has value because of the government.

Oh yes, you betcha, even some of the things that are on my list could be done better.

Everybody wants to stop climate change but solar, wind, and hydro are not effective enough to do so. People are also now realizing that Nuclear is debateably the safest of all the energy sources, especially if you measure it by number of casualties per kilowatt.\n\nI worked in the nuclear field for some time and have a very good understanding of nuclear physics, and can tell you with 100% certainty that the \"dangers\" of nuclear power are all either overblown or outdated. Modern reactors are nothing like the reactor at chernobyl. \n\nPeople may want to mention fukushima, however fukushima is an example of how safe last gen nuclear plants were. They faced an incredible fight with a massive earth quake and a tsunami that made it over the sea wall which was there to protect from tsunamis, they went through flooding equipment issues and through all of it they kept the plant and the surrounding area safe.\n\nYou may want to say that \"they had to evacuate the surrounding town and radiation levels are higher\" I'm here to tell you that its just fearmongering by the news, the approved exposure rates are so small its absurd. You are far more likely to experience the effects of radiation by going to the beach on a sunny day, or by taking a lot of flights than you are by living your entire life outside of fukushima or three mile island.\n\nNuclear plant workers actually experience less radiation than the average person. Smoking, taking flights, spending time in the sun, etc all increase your exposure rate significantly.\n\n\n\nNuclear power is the future and this is the start, we have finally left the age of ignorance. With the new gen 4 reactors, and Small modular reactors being approved we have the safest, cleanest, and most sustainable energy source at our fingertips. The US government has also actively decided to invest in nuclear power again.\n\nRisk and fear have caused the nuclear sector stocks and etfs to suffer but this year is a big year for nuclear, westinghouse is finished with its latest gen reactor and it is set join the grid in 2nd quarter.\n\nURA is currently kangarooing which means big money for anyone who knows that it will be ending up and the option prices are extremely cheap for how much you can make off of them.

If you understood economics you would also understand that the solution to existential issues like climate change is government subsidy, government subsidy incentivises change without disrupting the economy. Whereas taxing oil or limiting oil hurts the consumer amd consumer spending. The issue is that fear of nuclear power has cause legislation to limit nuclear expansion and inflated the price of nuclear plant construction.\n\n3: if you understood economics you would also understand that there is explicit cost and implicit cost. Implicit cost is not shown in charts. Implicit cost of using other forms of energy is much higher. Solar panels require huge amounts of space, are only useful at certain times of day and year, and produce a fuck ton of waste when they need to be replaced. Wind plants are only useful during certain weather conditions and are incrediblg vulnerable to storms.

Renewables have been more then nuclear ever was by 2022 and the expansion of renewables increased significantly in the last two years which are not shown in the graph above.

This is completely contrary to any fiscal policy principle where basically everyone says to spent in a downturn.

I assume you just haven't actually looked into the history so let me fill you in. \n\nYour graph literally illustrates my point. Nucelar was doing what it was supposed to up until Gerhard Schroder showed up. The reason the share of nuclear kept going down was not because solar and wind are some life saving measure, it is because you guys stopped expanding and actually started closing plants. The leader of that was the aforementioned, Gerhard Schroeder. During that same time he heavily pushed bringing in Russian gas to power the country. What did Schroder do after he left the German government? Oh yeah he went and became the chairman for Nord Stream 1 and then did the same for Nord Stream 2. He also joined the board of Rosneft (Russian oil company) and then Gazprom (Russian gas company who owns those two pipelines). He sold you a lie so he could personally profit. Energy consumption came down in Germany last year due to having to reduce manufacturing capabilities with an unstable grid. Here is your country \"moving towards renewables\": https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-05/germany-paves-way-for-major-expansion-of-gas-fired-power-plants \n\nYou see the spikes and uptrends in oil, gas and coal as it gets closer to 2022? You are making up the baseload power lost by non-CO2 emitting nuclear with CO2 emitting sources because renewables are intermittent. Renewables are good for supplementation. But they cannot and will not be able to power an economy. It is a fallacy. The world has spent trillions on renewables and has barely made a dent on fossil fuels. It is an expensive way to destabilize the grid. \n\nThe vast majority of nuclear's costs come in building the plant. Your plants that were shut down in 202 could have operated at least 20 more years, if not more. Plants around the world that are just as old as Germany's plants are being extended for decades to come. If nuclear is such a dud, then why is China building nuclear plants like crazy? They have 55 running now, 22 under construction and another 70 planned. Why is Japan turning back on all of their plants and looking to build more even after Fukashima? Korea, France, Finland, UK, Taiwan, US, Belgium, Ukraine, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey are just some of the countries building new nuclear plants or extending the lifespans for old ones. The long and the short of it is that if nuclear power was discovered today, people would hail it as a savior.
