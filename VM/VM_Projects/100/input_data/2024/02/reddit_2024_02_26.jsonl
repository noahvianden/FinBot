I completely understand your sentiment here, but there seems (to me at least) to be a lot more that drives trading/wallstreet than just fundamentals. Technicals may not be as 'reliable' to the main amount of posters here, but they can still make a big difference with the right setups.\n\nThat said, Nokia does have a gigantic float, but their fundamentals and financials are quite solid. The issue with the float was proven to be for the most part a non-issue in January 2021. Granted it would obviously take some volume to move it, but if you look at the amount of shares that move the stock, it actually doesn't really take much at all. The biggest problem for an actual sustained increase in share price is people constantly taking profit at every resistance.\n\nNokia has gone sideways for quite some time, we all know that. BUT. As an unquoted poster on here once said a few months back, Nokia is one unlikely catalyst away from mooning. It may take forever, it may not, but January 2021 proved that this thing can *move* if volume shows up. Consider how long it has gone sideways. Also consider how many traders out there will only engage in a trade if there is a clear indication of strength/breakout. Especially consider what can happen to a beaten down stock if it truly catches momentum. Rubber-band effect. The harder you pull it back sort of thing. EVERYONE KNOWS all this stock does is go sideways. What happens if that dramatically changes upwards?\n\nAll you have to do is draw one (resistance) line on Nokia's chart on the NYSE and you'll see why January 2021 even happened in the first place and the opportunity it is now presenting and staring everyone who actually looks in the face. A *major* resistance trendline was broken. The most recent drop Nokia had down to $2.94 tested that line for buying support which, so far, has held. \n\nIf you draw just one more (support) line starting from the 2012 low and connect the covid low, Nokia tested that in after hours trading as well. That support line holding was a *very* major technical development. If you're not aware of charting patterns, Nokia is in a GIGANTIC decade long consolidation (pennant) pattern. \n\nEverything I have learned about trading so far has led me to this very stock as arguably one of the biggest opportunities a person may ever get in trading. Nokia has the chart setup of a literal generational buying opportunity at the moment. It just needs volume.\n\nTrading is about making money, right? Wallstreet wants to make money. WE want to make money. To do so, we need to find opportunities. 2 Very simple lines on Nokia's chart tell me that this is the most slept-on opportunity in the entire market. I may be a noob but I know for a fact I'm not the only one seeing it. In fact, my personal theory is that Nokia is bashed and SUPPRESSED as hard as it is because of that. In regards to justification of a much higher share price...Bro this is trading. There are tons of stocks out there that had/are having insane runs that are nowhere near justified. TSLA was the OG in that respect.\n\nWHEN volume shows up on the buy side, Nokia is going to shock the world. This is a perfect setup if I ever saw one. Disclaimer: I am a poor and literally all-in on $7c 1/16/26 bought on 12/5/23.\n\nThis thing is LITERALLY going to the fucking MOON.\nMark my words.\n\nEdit: Act of God here we come.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "What we're seeing here is bagholder denial, you're still poor after NOK's last run and rugpull in 2020 for a reason", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/3qf0gvictwkc1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd7afed7e65d80288a96dfb6c90a09b5781ba2ff", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "What a time that was to be alive", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I miss the Iron Condor memes, best part of 2020 along with the PLTR memes", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Fuck this shit im in", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "tld", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Basically 100% of stocks I tracked on wsb  recs have been a loss over an extended time range.

I'm slowly climbing out of the trenches, my account balance is the highest its ever been, but the season's not over yet guys\n\nIm starting the week with gambling on these 2 stocks: Unity Software and CarGurus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **U** \\- This company is fucking dogshit, apparently they're a video game software development company, but I was born around the same year Unity was founded, and I can't name a single game they've ever created. Btw CEO is a greedy üîîüîö, every employee and developer hates him, which is why he stepped down. These fellas have only beaten EPS 50% of the time, and revenue 38% in the last 2 years. Open interest is looking reel reel juicy at $25 puts too. Don't forget Unity IPO'd at $52 and peaked at $196; bag holders will be crying tonight. I can‚Äôt see a reason this wouldn‚Äôt go tits up tonight.\n2. **CARG** \\- Last week, I called CVNA to show some big green dildos after close; I even doubled my position after seeing you guys inversing me. We all know Carvana cooks the numbers, I'm surprised Hindenburg Research hasn't even made a hit piece on them yet. But all that noise doesn‚Äôt matter, because they‚Äôre up 700%, looking at their 1Y chart. This brings us to CarGurus. Again, all car manufacturing companies have beaten earnings; cars are booming again. Sure, us dgenerates cant afford that F150 Raptor brand new, so we go to Copart/Carvana/CarMax/CarGurus. WE ARE THEIR TARGET AUDIENCE!!! Little reminder: Carvana earnings told us they actually went profitable for the first time ever. Look at CARG‚Äôs past earnings; they've only missed earnings ONCE in the last 2 years. These guys are even profitable when Wall Street expects a loss. Expect green dildos again tonight folks\n\n[disclaimer: this is not financial advice, you will lose money by following me, do not sue me, do not follow me, and do your own research](https://preview.redd.it/zc0nhoqfrxkc1.jpg?width=350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe8d6127fd3ca89ba1bac1098deb320296aa9050)\n\nLots of economic data coming out this week (ISM manufacturing, PCE, durable goods, GDP, pending home sales, eurozone and japan CPI, personal spending), so be cautious when opening early positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: CARG goes up, U goes down**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy positions:\n\nCasino still closed, I will be opening a 5K position per stock using 5x leveraged CFD‚Äôs (eurotrash).

I'm not a big time investor, but so far I use AI to type out shitty emails and that's about it. Until they start using it to replace Google Ads, I'm not seeing what else it can do that will generate billions of dollars to a business, and I feel like that's just moving from one part of Google/FB to another, not creating something new to buy.  I'm not saying its not impressive, I'm just saying I can't visualize a day where I'm paying for an AI car or an AI house cleaner, AI cell phone, or AI lawyer or AI airline pilot or an AI subscription service of some kind etc. Take a driver for example, yes you could use an AI driver instead of a truck driver, but there are still costs involved with the AI driver, then there's the social costs that the industry has to overcome which is an insane proposition to societies working man/woman. Or an AI chef, it's like, that's already a thing in a way, any fast food feels like it's made by a robot anyway, will it really save the fast food industry that much when you have people willing to work for $10 an hour?

I never dreamed of something like that until I saw it happen. Nothing has come out of left field yet with AI where your like, wow that's a whole new way of doing something that I've never even imagined let alone thought was even possible. The iPhone, Social Media, Starlink, bitcoin etc. these were all completely new ideas, it wasn't even imagined in science fiction movies. Chat GPT blew me away for a while, but it's already starting to feel like a gimmick to me now in terms of what I really use it for. With all that being said, maybe something will happen where I'm just like damn, we don't need people anymore and AI can do it all, but I'm not there yet and it's hard for me to visualize a world where I wake up and an AI makes me breakfast and I'm walking down the street and there is an AI doing all of the landscaping and then I go to eat and an AI robot takes my order.

That doesn't mean it will fail and of course I do wish you success, but here's what you misconstrued in a number of ways. I'll work backwards from the points you made to illustrate them plainly.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the main supplier for Nvidia, as well as their competitors like Intel. The way American technology companies function is they modify design documents, and engineers overseas use those slightly altered plans to create nominally iterative manufactured products to enable American companies to evade totally violating the patents for their \"exclusive\" version of the same basic product being made by a foreign facility.\n\nIn other words, it is far more common and arguably easier for American companies to already have their own designs for comparable products to Nvidia, but none of them have the capability nor the current knowhow to manufacture them at slave-wage or low-cost prices.\n\n\"Customers\" in this case, need time, money, and the ability to create manufacturing domestically or in another area like Africa, or India, where the wage-structure could be emulated. Even Mexico may not be able to do this cheap enough to compete at the rate things are now.\n\nContinuing backwards through your backwards logic, a company like Nvidia, as well as their competitors, know only how to buy, rebrand, and market/sell - to the same crop of companies supposed to be competing with one a other - in order to falsify their collective value & importance.\n\nNow to the Zoom comparison...\n\nZoom had a legitimate reason for becoming more valuable as well as perceived as more valuable, because unprecedented dictatorial governmental policy forced individuals and businesses to use such a product to facilitate their otherwise normal in-person meeting functions. At the time, it was put forth that this \"new normal\" was going to persist, and no defined end goal was in place other than the eventual change in policies which had people admit COVID was not a novel virus with a required novel response, and then in-person meetings resumed their regularity and the facade of the inflated sense of importance of Zoom (and everybody hating them) faded away, resulting in a natural stock crash.\n\nCalling Zoom a bubble, is again conflating a single company with a market bubble, which is traditionally how the term bubble is used, because it demonstrates a market-wide condition, which was present in Zoom because of how COVID was used to pump things up. But COVID pumped up basically everything starting in healthcare, which made the most sense even though it ended up being a fraud essentially. Social media companies (where Zoom sort of fit in) saw a run-up based on their presumed rise us use, however this also made no sense because advertising budgets (how Facebook and others make money) on every single company on Earth was slashed, even if they then put their remaining dollars online instead of traditional ads. It also should be said that the available hours to use those platforms is 24 hours per day, which may have been close to some people's use, but it has a defined limit.\n\nTherefore, nothing about Zoom & Nvidia are comparable because there was no outside force which required the development or implementation of \"AI\" technology to save the human race, which was the hysteria around COVID. Quite the opposite actually, as AI is being regarded as the end of human workforce.\n\nMany of the same results on the market, and consequences may be effected, but nothing about your thesis adds up, and thus it is unlikely to be the thing to catch fire here so to speak.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.
