{"title": "Should I buy $25,000 worth of $RIVN next week?", "selftext": "Generally feeling pretty optimistic about Rivian long term following their past two years. The demand for their vehicles doesn't appear to be waning much (if at all) even in a high interest rate environment - probably because they've really begun to corner and carve out the EV SUV / pickup truck space. (After listening to $TSLA earnings in Q4, it doesn't look like the CyberTruck is going to eat Rivian's cake and reservation numbers when the price to reserve is $100 isn't nearly the same as Rivian's $1k)\n\nBasically, here's what I'm looking at.\n\n  **2022**\n\n* In 2022, Rivian produced 24,337 electric vehicles\n* In Q4 2022, Rivian produced 10,020 vehicles\n* In 2022, Rivian delivered 20,332 electric vehicles to customers \n\n **2023**\n\n* Q1 2023: 34,735 units produced\n* Q2 2023: 48,727 units produced\n* Q3 2023: 65,031 units produced\n* Q4 2023: 82,572 units produced \n\nAs of January 2024, Rivian's 2023 production was 57,232 units, and 50,122 were delivered. This was higher than the 54,000 units that management had guidance for in 2023. Rivian took a hit to their stock price because they barely missed deliveries (exceeded production) due to the holidays, something they told investors in Q3.\n\n In Q3 2022 was $139,277, and in Q3 2023 it was $30,648.\n\nTheir vehicles are also, well, great ([lol Consumer Reports](https://electrek.co/2024/02/04/rivian-tops-consumer-reports-most-loved-ranks-after-its-reviewers-derided-it/)) and I'm beginning to really see them everywhere.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7f903020vhc1.jpg?width=836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1907faf3d61844b1eef6d6eb46368437747c7884\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ceu4e5020vhc1.jpg?width=836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63e6a95f8b9d3f73f022d98ed5619d7282d67289\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vnpqb7020vhc1.jpg?width=836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f4c9828690c61202170c134d36a2315170a6215\n\n*(if anyone can find these charts with Q4 too I'd be so appreciative)*\n\n**2024**\n\nThis year, Rivian is guiding that they will be profitable by Q4. Perhaps more importantly, they are announcing their R2 model (a more affordable SUV) on March 7th for deliveries beginning in 2026 following the completion of the new plant in GA. \n\nI think these two facts are what make Rivian a buy right now.
