I‚Äôve been DCA‚Äôing pretty consistently since 2017, so my per unit costs across the board look pretty damn good and can survive a sharp downturn that I‚Äôm well aware could be bad. Tech isn‚Äôt going anywhere though. While I need to diversify more (I‚Äôve at least been building up my VOO position, but that‚Äôs very tech exposed itself of course), my core philosophy around these positions is that I‚Äôm going to be very happy in 203X that I held onto them through what is certain to continue to be a decade of uncertainty. So much shit will fly about tech, there will probably be an alarming dip in the near future, followed by ‚Äúis this the death of tech?‚Äù headlines.

I think restaurants and hospitality and the like might be ones to look at, probably some IPOs. With grocery prices so high, we‚Äôve found for our small family that getting takeout and modest sit down restaurants, while still rough on the budget, we are actually paying less of a premium on it (on a ‚Äúcost vs cost‚Äù basis) than before inflation. I feel like we keep hearing the line ‚Äúthe numbers don‚Äôt reflect how people *feel* about the economy‚Äù. And I totally get why, everyone is feeling the squeeze. But you go to restaurants, and while I‚Äôm a city guy living between a minor, and shall we say ‚Äúmid major‚Äù metro area, restaurants are absolutely HOPPING right now. Everywhere we go. \n\nEven if people are beat down and crushed at their jobs, it makes them even less likely to want to go home and prepare a meal. Then there‚Äôs no solace in running up a $250 grocery bill. Instead maybe you go meet a friend at your favorite spot for happy hour, have a couple drinks and an entree and it doesn‚Äôt feel all that bad spending $25-$30. Conventional wisdom says people would tighten their belts in a recession and stop going out to eat. But through what has now been years of recession hand wringing and inflation recovery, people have continued to spend through it all while being very vocal about the pinch they are feeling in their budget. While filling 2 carts full of groceries and spending $500 while deal shopping is the most economical way to do it, not everyone can do that right now. Fewer will be able to manage that in a recession. A recession will also bring back more ‚Äúbang for your buck‚Äù deals, enticing people too low on money for a grocery budget into an expensive cycle of fast food. \n\nSo while I wouldn‚Äôt characterize it as ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù exactly, I think this is a sector I‚Äôll be researching this week and maybe identifying some opportunities.

I picked up Nvidia around 180, near its lowest point in ages .... which I proceeded to day trade away for a measly few thousand dollar gain. My plan at the time, logically, or so I thought, was to day trade during the wild market fluctuations  I was certain would occur late into 2020 as Covid pervaded the mentality of the world.

I didn't want to buy back in at those prices, \\***knowing**\\* it would go down again, right? Wrong! It never went down; never has since. I've held Microsoft throughout that entire same period, which I'm up 150% on since, but Nvidia?.... That would have made me at least a cool $million. Nvidia was my day trade of choice to recover some of my Jan-March 2020 Covid losses, planning all along to buy back in permanently when the market looked to settle, but that huge NASDAQ spike no one expected following March 2020 collapse and the bubble thereafter (followed by Gamestop and all that noise in 2021)...

{"title": "Reddit files to list IPO on NYSE under the ticker RDDT", "selftext": "Social media company Reddit filed its IPO prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday after a yearslong run-up. The company plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúRDDT.‚Äù\n\nIts market debut, expected in March, will mark the first major tech initial public offering of the year. It‚Äôs the first social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019.\n\nReddit first filed a confidential draft of its public offering prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2021.\n\nThe social media company, founded in 2005 by technology entrepreneurs Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, has raised about $1.3 billion in funding and has a post valuation of $10 billion, according to deal-tracking service PitchBook.\n\nPublishing giant Cond√© Nast bought Reddit in 2006 and then spun it out as an independent company in 2011.\n\nAs of October, Reddit had 70 million daily active users and over 100,000 active communities, or subreddits, according to its corporate website. Reddit is one of the most-visited websites in the U.S., according to analytics firm Semrush, but it has struggled to build an online advertising business comparable to tech giants like Facebook-parent Meta and Google-parent Alphabet.\n\nIt‚Äôs also faced challenges with developers and moderators.\n\nIn June, several prominent Reddit moderators locked subreddits as part of a blackout to protest the company‚Äôs decision to increase the price third-party developers pay to use its application programming interface, or API. At the time, Reddit said the pricing change was necessary because many big tech companies were using data to train large language models.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/22/reddit-files-to-list-ipo-on-nyse-under-the-ticker-rddt.html\n\nProspectus: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm", "id": "1axgrww", "created_utc": 1708633697.0, "score": 784, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 396, "comments": [{"body": "Yea I‚Äôm not buying.

{"title": "Nvidia- Don't Mistake a Highly Cyclical stock for Perpetual Growth. Perspective from a Software Engineer, why I set a $250 price target.", "selftext": "Nvidia is currently trading at over 100x earnings, but many investors will justify this by claiming that \"forward earnings\" is 25x. \"Forward earnings\" is just an estimate from analysts where they took past growth, and extrapolated it out into the future. \n\nThese analysts do not understand the industry. They ignored AI for several years while CUDA was regularly being used in AI research and AI projects, setting price targets and earning estimates too low, and it only caught their attention as a growth engine when AI models started producing impressive media, rather than just boring scientific papers. Now, having seen earnings, they are assuming this growth will continue perpetually, without considering how the industry works.\n\nNvidia's growth in earnings is due to the surge in companies looking to fund AI projects. As a hot new trend, Even non-tech companies are trying to explore ways they can utilize AI, even in areas where it makes no sense and doesn't add any value. AI has essentially became a buzzword in the way that Blockchain was a few years ago, or \"internet\" was 25 years ago. Historically, these trends often last a couple years before slowing down considerably.\n\nSince AI chips are a brand new market, companies are essentially building up AI infrastructure from nothing. And Nvidia is the only real supplier. Unlike other capital goods, there is no used/secondhand market yet. So in the short term, this has understandably meant exploding earnings as Nvidia can charge outrageous prices and faces no competition.\n\nBut will it last? It probably will in the short term, Nvidia can't ship enough chips yet to meet demand, and competitors will take time to produce viable alternatives, so there is probably a sales backlog that can keep them going a few quarters, possibly another year or two. But eventually supply will catch up to demand, and when that happens, growth will stagnate.\n\nOn top of this, a couple years down the line most companies will abandon their AI projects that don't work out.  When they do, you now have all of this used AI hardware(or cloud capacity) that is now on the market. Other companies can then buy this hardware at a discount, or cloud services now have less of a need to expand their AI compute capacity. This is exactly what happened with the crypto mining boom- Nvidia made a huge windfall from crypto mining sales, but then the market dried up, a huge oversupply hit the secondary market, and Nvidia's earnings stagnated until AI came to the rescue.\n\nNow of course, you could argue that Nvidia will release better hardware every 2 years, and that will ensure they still have a market. And I think they will. \n\nBut this introduces our next problem- suppliers. Nvidia is dependent on TSMC to produce their AI chips.  They could potentially use Samsung or Intel as well. They do not own their own fab.  Fortunately for them, they already had a lot of capacity they reserved with TSMC for their RTX 4000 GPUs, which they switched to produce AI chips, which has allowed them to produce a lot of AI chips for dirt cheap, and enjoy huge margins. But when Nvidia's contract with them runs out, they're at risk. Nvidia's 75% gross margin is well known. Additionally, it's almost certain that other companies like AMD are planning their own AI products. This explosion in manufacturing demand, combined with knowledge of Nvidia's high margins, will give TSMC leverage to raise their prices, threatening Nvidia's margins.\n\nOur next issue is competitors. Nvidia may control nearly the entire  AI hardware market now, but is extremely unlikely to remain that way. AMD GPUs are just as capable of creating and running AI models as Nvidia, the main problem is most software is built for CUDA, which runs on Nvidia hardware.  \n\nWith the huge surge in the AI market, it's almost certain that there are companies out there developing AI models that can run on AMD, and it's very likely AMD is designing their own dedicated AI chips and software around it. There is tremendous amounts of money to be made in producing either cheaper hardware, or software that can run on cheaper hardware. If you look on LinkedIn, job boards, etc, you'll see semiconductor companies have hired and hiring large amounts of ML/AI engineers. And these listings don't mention CUDA. Assuming that Nvidia will never face any competition is na√Øve. Nvidia will probably remain a leader since they are ahead, but cheaper alternatives will threaten their pricing power.\n\nOverall, the semiconductor industry is often a boom/bust industry, and I expect it will stay that way, even with AI. Investors should be careful buying during a boom period based on the assumption that it will continue booming.\n\nAll of this leads us to the valuation. Nvidia's quarterly earnings are likely to remain around $5 per share over the next few quarters, or possibly even grow a bit further, as demand remains high. But as competitors enter the market, a secondhand market emerges from failed startups, suppliers raise prices, and investor funding for AI startups dries up, I expect these earnings to decline over the next decade, until stabilizing when the industry matures\n\nI ultimately decided on the following:\n\n$25 earnings FY2025(a bit optimistic, that's assuming significant growth this year, more than analysts are predicting)\n\n(5%) negative growth in earnings for a decade followed by 2% terminal growth rate as the industry matures and the race to the bottom ends.\n\n8% discount rate\n\n= $249.89 fair value per share", "id": "1axj4og", "created_utc": 1708639315.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.51, "num_comments": 255, "comments": [{"body": "What company do you work at as a software engineer so I can short it.", "score": 432, "replies": [{"body": "Nvda", "score": 26, "replies": []}, {"body": "He is definitely job hunting", "score": 33, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol", "score": 44, "replies": []}, {"body": "His mistake is applying his software engineering skills to the stock market", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "üëèüèº", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "damn. this may be the funniest reddit comment of all time.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Not as funny as Reddit going public.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Hahaha", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I would love for OP to drop the name.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Put your money where your mouth is.

{"title": "Hi I'm the guy that bought $25k of $RIVN at ~$15.40", "selftext": "Couple of quick things to kick us off here before you start SCREAMING like you LOVE TO DO:\n\n1. Ouch. Hug me.\n2. I bought at the wrong time.\n3. I didn't invest money I wasn't ready to lose and I'm not emotional about volatility / downs with this investment. \n4. I think Rivian is a great long term hold and that they're doing just about everything right given the circumstances.\n\nPhew. Okay. Now, yesterday's earnings had a lot bad news. But it also had a lot of good news. Let's start there for fun.\n\n* Reasserted guidance that it plans to be profitable by Q4 (assuaging concerns from *some people* on Twitter who are projecting Rivian runs out of cash in six quarters; they will also be able to restructure debt with lower interest rates)\n* R2 launch on March 7th. Even more is riding on this now. And in the earnings call they mentioned R2 as the future of the company consistently and frequently.\n* YoY per-vehicle loss is way down. \\~$81k improvement. \n* Leasing has begun for R1T and R1S.\n* Exceeded all aspects of guidance for 2023.\n* YoY revenue increase of 167%.\n* Additional, lower-priced variants of the R1.\n* Lower cost basis with reduction of staff.\n* Planned 30% plant efficiency in 2H in 2024.\n* Better partnership with suppliers reduce variable cost per vehicle.\n* Extremely strong brand, literally the strongest auto brand in 2023 according to Consumer Reports.\n* Opportunity for additional revenue through subscription model that will offer ongoing improvements to the platform ‚Äî including entertainment and vehicle capabilities. \n* Top selling EV over $70k.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d781gmber5kc1.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=763b91221dff177d970f128dad1e2e69d57a5c08\n\nBut, some of that good news also has bad news associated with it. Here's the other side of some double edged swords before getting into the bad, bad news.\n\n* Gross loss per vehicle actually increased QoQ, from a loss of $30,648 per car in Q3 2023 to $43,372 per car in Q4, 2023 (lower deliveries)\n* Those efficiency gains at the plant and new suppliers mean that the plant has to shut down for several weeks in Q2.\n\nAnd now the bad, bad news that I don't like.\n\n* Rivian is guiding that they will not produce more vehicles than they produced last year: 57,000. Deliveries can still increase YoY and they'll use existing inventory during that plant shut down, but yeesh. That's not what people want to see.\n* Deliveries were down in Q4. A lot of people are speculating softer demand for the vehicles overall (which is likely true as RJ himself said that people reserved vehicles with different financing expectations), but I think the real issue here is that Amazon deferred delivery of their EDVs until 2024. It would appear the margins on EDV are preeeetty good and that deferral contributed to their increased gross loss per vehicle. Rivian guided that Q4 will see fewer deliveries for future quarters.\n* R2 launch is two years away. It's gonna be sorta rough for Rivian until then I think, but hopefully, at worst, pretty flat.\n* Interest rates are very rough and a lot of Rivian's future demand depends on cutting rates.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjnwxp9fr5kc1.png?width=2236&format=png&auto=webp&s=5293608b2b630779a9f8f6a5302278efc325b9d4\n\nThat's not a lot of bullet points, but I think it all boils down to those four points overall. \n\nOne of the most interesting parts of the Shareholder Letter was why Rivian believes they'll be profitable by Q4 2024: \"We believe our success driving significant reduction in the costs of our vehicles during 2023 positions us to achieve modest gross profit in the Q4 of 2024. The key drivers to bridge the fourth quarter 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2024 are:\n\n*  \\~50% - Variable cost per unit \n* \\~35% - Fixed/semi-fixed cost efficiencies \n* \\~15% - Non-vehicle revenue\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5llfs0gr5kc1.png?width=2222&format=png&auto=webp&s=902051053fcd800ec2301d5b211fb3c5daa11163\n\nI'm still bullish on Rivian. This is a pivotal moment for EVs. And a rough one for autos in general. I think the best thing to do is sit back and wait ‚Äî and while I maybe didn't enter at the *optimal* time ‚Äî I think looking at a long term graph 4 years from now will show that it wasn't the worst time. Again, I think so much of this rides on the R2.", "id": "1ax9qat", "created_utc": 1708617238.0, "score": 1944, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 840, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|42|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|11 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I love this post*\n\n*Sincerely a holder who bought Rivian at $18", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I've been buying down since $40.

So in heat of exchange Elon called him Pedo guy. He also retracted that tweet and also was brought to Defamation lawsuit about it and he got cleared in US court. Maybe if the brittish guy would be more open about help from others and not being a child to tell Elon to sodomize himself with the submarine. WHOOOO CARES? Two guys clutches and exchange mean tweets and then gets over it.\n\n>Claiming to support free speech while being one of the greatest dangers to it on Twitter?\n\nAgree to disagree? He is liberating free speech and with twitter files showing how bad the left/socialists agenda and narrative is. Your opinion may vary. Only great things from when Elon paid 44 B dollars to liberate free speech. It's truly a gift for mankind for someone to help free speech on the internet. Also, every countrys law has to be obeyed sadly otherwize [](http://x.com) will be banned from that region of the world. You seem very biased here. What previous owners did with twitter was bad.\n\n>Being a terrible father?\n\nI don't know. Seems to be great with the kids he has around him. One kid in question is woke and rebellish and hate her father. Nothing horrendous really here. Sad of course but label him a terrible father is a bit much. He seems great with the kids he has with him from time to time. He probably is our times greatest visionary and entreprenur and it comes with a price of working many hours every day. He also have kids with several womans and no it is not the norm. But being a billionaire and a great entrepreneur and big visionary aint the norm either. As long the kid have good time with their parents and taken care of and having great time with his dad once they see each other I see nothing wrong. Small price to pay in the grand scheme of things.\n\n>Having absolutely zero grip on reality?\n\nSo once again we have to agree to disagree here. Tell me who has more grip on reality then Elon? His track records speeks for that he indeed has more understanding of reality then most. Who has better grip on reality then Elon? Mara? Biden? Trudeau? Socialists? Commies? Pooh Bear in china? Who? Putin?\n\n>Taking credit for \"creating\" companies he bought and being \"self-made\" when he absolutely,¬†*indisputably*¬†isn't?\n\nTell me you know nothing about running businesses without telling me you know about bizniz. Also, study Elons Past and what he has endured with every company and what he has performed and maybe you will change your perception about this specific topic.\n\n>The list goes on and on.\n\nGreat, do tell more about him. I'll gladly give me my opinions about one of the most visionary man of our times and what he has accomplished. No one is perfect and neither is Elon.

If the current price of the stock is $100, and you buy a call for $105 (because you think the price will go to $105 or higher), $105 is called the strike price. The closer strike price you choose to the current price, the higher premium you'll pay (more likely to get to $105 than $120). You pay the premium up front when you buy the contract and no matter what happens, the seller of the contract keeps that.  If the premium is $1.00, it'll cost $100 ($1.00 √ó 100 shares for 1 contract). If the stock only goes to $103, your contract expires worthless and basically lost $100. If it goes to $110 at the time of expiration, then it's $110 - $105 (strike price)= $5...$5 √ó 100 shares =$500 - $100 (the premium you paid earlier). So on that trade you'd make $400. The same thing goes for puts, just it'd be $95 strike price and if it went to $90, you'd make $400 on that trade. \n\nFor selling contracts, you would get paid the $100 premium and if you sold a call, you're hoping it stays below $105. Then you'd collect $100 and nothing else happens if it stays below. If it goes to $110, you are saying you'll buy 100 shares at $110, and sell it to them for $105, so you're losing $5/share ($500), but you collected the $100 earlier,  so you'd be down $400.\n\nIf you own 100 shares already of the stock, instead of you buying 100 shares at $110, they'll just take the 100 shares you already own.  It's called a covered call and decent way to make money,  especially if you're strike price is higher than what you bought the 100 shares for.\n\nYou can close out contracts early, which can be good so instead of losing the whole $100, maybe you can sell it for $50 later so you only lose $50, not $100 of the premium.\n\nJust start watching YouTube videos on options strategies... thats all I did to learn.

Let‚Äôs say you are confident that NVDA will hit $900 by March 1st (next Friday).

Anything over $821.75 on March 1st and its profit, so if it did get to $900, it'd be profit of $7,825.\nThe $880 call on March 1st will only cost $229 to buy up front, but it has to get all the way up to $882.29 before you're in profit. And at $900, you'll only get $1,771 profit. \nIt's a higher up front cost for $810, but if you're SURE it's going to get to $900 by then, make a lot more with the $810 call, and it doesn't have to get as high to be profitable", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks so much.

You have the right to be sold shares at $900( or your strike price, that's why u pay the premium). If you decide you want the shares you can exercise your option. You then have to pay for the stock which is if its $1000 , $100 0x 100 ( shares). So $100,000 to buy the stock. Most people just close the position out and collect the increase on the options premium. If he paid 2.00 premium it could goto 3.65 premium resulting in an 82.5% return. ( you would need to know the Greeks and the IV drop to compute this, and the delta for possible IV increase/ decrease. If its below the strike price at expiration on calls it loses all of its value. The only possible value u get it .05 and that's normally people closing out their positions. An option is the right to buy the shares, you are not obligated to buy them though.

It was perhaps the biggest and most radical victim of the dot-com bubble I have seen. Stock peaked near $1,000 in  1998 and then crashed to $50 by the year 2000.

The ability for \"AI\" promises to infect anything from art production & entertainment companies, to the Healthcare sector, will eventually also be effected.\n\nAAPL & MSFT for example, were younger companies back then, and in turn, their charts look as if this tumultuous time of the 90's didn't even impact them which would be strange, and possibly explains why now they are facing a bubble-style run-up.\n\nNVDA went public in 1999, 2 years before the dot-com bubble burst.

Rather than what is currently being demonstrated by all of the sarcastic inflation of stocks like Nvidia, and the callous nature of joking about giving people a belt in this sub, which are definitively negative attitudes about the value and nature of human life itself. Statistically speaking, you can see that increased valuation in social media, and now artificial intelligence computing, has correlated to increased levels of suicidality, depression, etc.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Meta, and Nvidia for example, were to crash in valuation by 90%, it would not eliminate social media or the philosophical pursuit of intelligent machines. But it would force people to see that something was askew in the value scale.\n\nThere is a theoretical limit, too, of valuing things like the metaverse, which initially caused a steep drop on Meta before it came back to trillion-dollar prominence, and that was the question, \"where do the servers exist?\" The answer to that question is, \"reality, not the metaverse.\" In other words, the metaverse could never actually be valued more than reality, because if you were to achieve such a state, you would no longer value the servers which exist in reality, which would undo the metaverse.\n\nSimilarly to \"AI,\" if you continue to place value on IT rather than US, you will eventually destroy the value of that which creates or prompts, or even buys these technologies by suggesting the technology itself is more valuable than its creators. We have yet to reach this limit but even toying with it has created substantial instability that is costing people their livelihoods despite the tech actually not being there to do their job. The job that is being valued is simply human labor replacement, and marketing lies combined with fraudulent financial statements already give human being in power justification to pretend the AI revolution is here.\n\nPerhaps the sci-fi twist none of us some coming with the existential threat of AI is that arrogant and greedy people would convince powerless or less intelligent people they created something which isn't even real, and that would result in the undoing of society as we came to know it.\n\nBy the time anybody realizes what happened it might be too late to stop the catastrophic collapse regardless of how immature or incapable the technology really is.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So you believe NVDA will pullback?\n\nWhat's the likelihood of $1,000 EOY?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I already wrote about this, but I predicted - in order for $NVDA to reach where shareholders need it to be which is $1,000 - a pull-back of sorts would be necessary in order to induce buyers who can't afford it at $750 or wherever it lands after this week of earnings in conjunction with needing to spark outrage-based options traders to disprove the thesis that it is crashing as part of a wider AI bubble deflation event.\n\nIn other words, I think that the market wants and needs Nvidia to go to $1,000 for those people who bought in recently as well as those who bought the 2022 dip to which the price likely will need to careen down to a similar range before being able to force people to ultimately hold long enough to get to $1,000.\n\nThe thesis I'm describing which nearly ever vocal member of this sub is clearly betting on, requires a 40% growth of the stock this year, which based on the recent past (which the gamblers here clearly only factor in when it appears to be to their advantage) would not seem impossible, if not being generally implausible.\n\nHistorical trends would suggest that if this stock does reach the peak of $1,000, given how much is riding on it individually, as well as the broader bubble it represents, a crash of such epic proportions would occur that it would be near-certain the government would step in to effectively bail-out \"big tech,\" which may have already happened on some level with the dispersment of the CHIPS act money beginning in the last week or so instead of years ago when the legislation passed.\n\nIn effect, Nvidia is causing the entire country to become bag-holders whether we like it or not, but pushing the national economy into a situation where our government would ultimately deem it necessary to give them even more of our money to compensate for the unwillingness on the part of those who don't want to invest with them.\n\nIf I had to estimate the timing, I would say that it if nothing else interrupts this drunken sailor party from the outside, it would likely be a bailout that would be revealed some short time after inauguration of whichever geriatric candidate \"wins\" the 2024 election.

Eventually they only generally need to dip down to convince people to purchase more options on it, rather than looking for longterm shareholders. And it is all dependent on these press stories related to the power of AI, even though most people can plainly see they are lies or fraud.\n\nIt would take a person able or willing to take what would appear to be a major loss, like the inheritor of their parents' or grandparents' portfolio, to sell off everything underlying the total bubble market which can be found mostly in Apple & Microsoft, and to hold their cash out probably for at least a whole year, giving it to no publicly traded company whatsoever. This may be part of why the new lore in this sub jokes about a grandfather and grandson investing together. To dissuade this from actually happening, because too much of the real value in our market actually belongs to accounts of deceased people and/or children who came to the age of termination years ago.\n\nComputershare is Nvidia's stock transfer agent, and they also are transfer agent for basically the entire NASDAQ. I believe that squeezing Computershare (also a publicly traded company, based in Australia) could cause a market collapse faster than better options on any magnificent 7 company (all Computershare clients).\n\nYou saw it this week, when Nvidia pulled back and then popped up, and their M7 friends followed.

MTBCF metrics are standard and I've always seen them discussed in the industry.\n\nI am happy that you are happy with your product, it doesn't sound like you are stressing it to the level it was designed for. Most users can run a chip for decades, but that isn't the case for scaled out dense data centres, idle time is wasted money.\n\n20% duty cycle doesn't mean 20% fail out in 3 years.. it means the average part will fail after 3 years of running at 100% load for 20% of the time. The chip will stutter and throttle itself thousands of times per second to avoid hitting that 100% load. design margins save the day for most people.\n\nEDIT: Ironically, AI is one of the best tools we have to do floor-plan layout and placement of RTL logic in physical circuit space to optimize performance and disperse heat to minimize failure rates...
