{"title": "PSA: A company being great and doing well does not protect the stock from dropping massively. NVDA can fall 50%+ for NO REASON. You need to be prepared for that. ", "selftext": "I think the recent rally has attracted a lot of new investors who don't have enough years in the market to understand this, but I just want to be clear for everyone:\n\nYour money is not safe in NVDA short term. It doesn't matter how great the company is, how well it's doing, etc etc -- people always have reaons why they think their investment or chosen stock is awesome and so can only go up. That is not how stocks work.\n\nEven the absolute best companies like NVDA, routinely get routed on no news for no reason at all. This is because market movements, especially on shorter time horizons (and this can be a few years, not just a few months) -- they aren't really about fundamentals, or performance. Those things impact share price, but share price driven by our own animal spirits more than anything else.\n\nAnd human beings are fickle. our emotions are fickle. It's not manipulation. If people get scared of maybe AI not living up to the hype? boom, nvda down 50% even if it's doing the same or better revenue. People get afraid of a macro event or mass layoffs? boom, multiple compression and nvda down 50% even if the business is really strong.\n\nA company's performance does not prevent the stock from having horrible, HORRIBLE routs that keep you up at night. And they don't always go away in a few months. They can take years to blow over.\n\nIf you can't handle that, and please listen to me -- sell your nvda stock and just buy SPY. Buying stock in single companies, no matter how good the company, can be extremely volatile. You are most likely going to see, at some point in the next few years, your account down by 50% or more if you are primarily invested in this, or any other single stock. And if you hold through and DCA, you probably won't mind 10 years out.\n\nBut you need to be emotionally ready for huge routs, and you don't need to invest so much money that you can't whether those storms. They will come for NVDA, and the company's performance will NOT protect it from the tides of investor sentiment -- which are fickle and almost always turbulent.", "id": "1ei76nv", "created_utc": 1722596535.0, "score": 205, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 163, "comments": [{"body": "Basically what he is saying is to keep buying Nvidia because it can randomly go up 50% for no reason.", "score": 185, "replies": [{"body": "Just bought more because of this comment.

This is where you can start making money if you don't plan on exercising the call. This is not a dollar to dollar movement though.

My job requires technical aptitude, so i'm not a marketing type and can see through the usual sales hype. I also understand the evolution of these types of products (s curve). At the same time my job also requires me to understand adoption cycles, how to commercialize technologies and to develop some sense for what markets are willing to pay for or not.\n\nAs far as how i got to the valuation.

Estimating total AI spend and attributing how much of that will go to NVDA over the next 5 years. What i did here was list the top use cases for GPUs (beyond just LLMs) across 10 different sectors, to try to size the total spend in the AI market. I then broke that down as how i expect it to be allocated across the value chain from software costs, to operations, ML engineers, servers....etc and of course chips.

This gives me potential total projected revenues that NVDA would earn that i then cross-refernced with 5yr revene projections from #1 above\n3.

You need special leadership to have lots of SW engineer installed, lots of research (300 PhD) invested to in to technology/products which aren't your core business (HW gaming GPUs). \n\nNvidia's investment in CUDA, the AI platform, buying Mellanox has been funded by gaming. Gaming made Nvidia big and Jensen made a bet on it 30 years ago. But later he used gaming funding for another bet in accelerated computing. That needs conviction and strong leadership since Jensen was convinced of the idea upon founding but he had to convice every Nvidia employee that it's the right way to go with CUDA and use a lot resources for it despite having strong competition in gaming back then.\n\nYou have to understand that the DGX-1 system for ML with V100 is 7 years old now. The first GPU HPC with Nvidia was installed like \\~13 years ago. People think that Nvidia became \"suddenly\" successful but that is total BS. Nvidia has been on this track for a long time. While others try now to compete at the 24hrs race of AI, Nvidia is on the 24 years mission into the future. \n\nAnd Nvidia takes it's time, see Omniverse was presented actually 4 years ago:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o\\_XeGyg2NIo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_XeGyg2NIo)\n\nInstead of rushing it, Nvidia is slowly nurturing it just like they have done with the AI platform. Improving it every generation to make it as great as it is today. Likewise Nvidia is working with a lot of patient and focus on many solutions for years. Like their self driving system is 7 years in the making. Their robotics stuff isn't new at all. Don't expect any fast releases because Nvidia rather refines before they release but by the time they release, they will surprise and be without competition. The basic rule of Jensen here is to work on very hard problems nobody else tackles. Hard problems take time to solve but once solved you'll instantly become the market leader since you basically created the market yourself.\n\nAnd finally, Nvidia is the best at marketing. So many companies ignore how important marketing is. Jensen is the king at this and does the best job there is. He is also an engineer so he is unique in a way that he can combine marketing while also using a lot of tech speak but simplified. Many don't like him for that because he seems like the sales guy with the vacuum cleaner knocking on your door but the CEO must be the #1 promoter of a company and its' products. And as I said, nobody beats Jensen at that.\n\nTherefore, Nvidia's success isn't their current product line. No, they are just the results of leadership and company culture of the past decades. As long as these remain, the company will remain one of the best there is. For sure, there will be cycles in revenue as there have been in the past, the same for the stock but if you want to invest in future solutions then invest in Jensen and his team because Jensen is the only guy in the world, ready to bet a trillion dollar market cap on new ideas while cannabilizing his own products\\*.\n\n\\*his very own teaching:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn1EsFe7snQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn1EsFe7snQ)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This!

No.\n\nChatGPT, and all of these other current \"AI\" systems in the world (Google Gemini, Meta AI, and etc.) are all just very polished traditional computing systems with fancy data-models and algorithms. GPT is stupid; literally, it's stupid. It makes frequent mistakes, you have to repeat yourself and constantly ask it to do any type of complex task (especially coding). Everything that is says, does, and writes to you is based off of data models it was trained with. It's ability to code and answers are really just a collective input of data, largely from the internet. Dare I say, GPT and other AI are just a glorified \"Google\" engine. Instead of Googling, it pieces things together things you ask of it, whether it's to generate a picture, write a novel, or some code.\n\nGPT is not actually artificial intelligence, or sentient. We're decades away from true AI. I do feel eventually the hype around AI is going to slow down some.

While the Federal Reserve aims for a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù to manage this process more smoothly, everyone still feels the impact and knows where it‚Äôs headed. It‚Äôs like a train conductor warning passengers of an inevitable collision. In the long run, the outcome is similar, but it‚Äôs better than an abrupt impact with no warning.\n\nEither way we are ‚Äúlanding‚Äù and won‚Äôt be ‚Äúflying‚Äù economically until things are fixed. Flying basically represents economic growth, while landing signifies a slowdown. A crash would be an uncontrolled landing. The real question is if the brakes on the economic plane are still working because the runway is only so long. It‚Äôs a bit disingenuous the way they present these terms as if it‚Äôs a good thing. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs just better than bad.\n\nImagine the economy as an airplane in flight, with inflation representing the plane‚Äôs speed and a smooth landing symbolizing stable growth. Flying smoothly is ideal, landing safely is the next best thing, and crashing is the worst outcome. Interest rates act like the plane‚Äôs air brakes and landing gear brakes; when the economy is moving too fast (high inflation), you use air brakes (raising interest rates) to slow it down. Cutting interest rates is like easing off the air brakes; it can prevent a jarring stop but might not slow the plane enough for a safe landing. If you only pump the air brakes intermittently, the plane might decelerate temporarily, but without sufficient braking force, it risks overshooting the runway, leading to future inflation issues. When it‚Äôs time to land, you also need the landing gear brakes (other economic policies) to come into play. While cutting interest rates can provide short-term relief, it may delay necessary adjustments, risking economic instability. Even though achieving stability today might not bring back the conditions of the past, using both air brakes and landing gear brakes effectively ensures a smoother transition, preventing an economic crash, though some degree of inflation may still persist.\n\nCutting interest rates is a sign that we over shot the approach and now are trying to compensate even though it was anticipated.\n\nNot sure these analogies are perfect but I tried.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "I‚Äôm a huge aviation enthusiast so I loved this analogy as a beginner to economics and finances.

Now I have to repay that 161M Yen loan, but at 146 Yen / USD I have to come up with another 8-10% more Japanese Yen to pay back the loan.  Not only that but $NVDA is down to $106.\n\nThe avg exchange rate over the last 25 years has been 110-100 Yen/USD.  I imagine the Yen will pull back Monday.

If I'm a sizable company, am I going to want to be part of the QQQ that has massive investor interest/dollar volume or am I going to want to be part of a few stocks on an ETF of a new exchange that few people have heard of?\n\n I mentioned the LTSE, which was announced in 2021 and as of 2024 has not yet opened and their list of listed names are two names that nobody is going to really care that much about.\n\nBut lets say something in the QQQ went to a different exchange. You wouldn't lose the money, the ETF would sell it. Likely, something else would be added to the index in its place.

{"title": "Intel heads for worst day on Wall Street in 50 years, falls to lowest in over a decade ", "selftext": "Intel shares plunged the most in 50 years on Friday, reaching a price not seen since 2013, after the chipmaker reported a big earnings miss and announced a massive restructuring.\n\nThe stock plummeted 27% to $21.22 as of late morning trading. It would be the second worst day ever for the shares, behind only a 31% drop in July 1974, which was three years after Intel‚Äôs IPO. The company‚Äôs market cap is now below $100 billion.\n\nThe dramatic selloff contributed to a 2.4% drop in the Nasdaq and pulled down global semiconductor stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ‚Äî known as TSMC ‚Äî closed 4.6% lower in Taiwan, and Samsung was down more than 4% at the end of the session in South Korea. TSMC is the world‚Äôs biggest manufacturer of chips, while Samsung is the largest memory semiconductor firm globally.\n\nIntel‚Äôs numbers were bad across the board.\n\nThe company swung to a $1.61 billion net loss after reporting net income of $1.48 billion in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings per share of 2 cents fell way short of the average analyst estimate of 10 cents, according to LSEG. Revenue also missed expectations.\n\nIntel said it won‚Äôt pay its dividend in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 and lowered its forecast for full-year capital expenditures by over 20%. The company said it would lay off more than 15% of its employees as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the most substantial restructuring of Intel since the memory microprocessor transition four decades ago,‚Äù Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told CNBC‚Äôs Jon Fortt in an interview that aired on Friday. ‚ÄúWe have laid out an audacious journey of rebuilding this company, and we‚Äôre going to get that done.‚Äù\n\nA decision to more rapidly produce Core Ultra PC chips that can handle artificial intelligence workloads contributed to the loss, Gelsinger said on a conference call with analysts. The company said pricing was more competitive than planned during the quarter, as AMD, Qualcomm and other companies have been working to take market share from Intel, which has fallen way behind its rivals in the AI battle.\n\nThe job cuts will mainly take place this year, Gelsinger wrote in a memo. It‚Äôs the largest of any single job cut listed on Layoffs.fyi, an industry tracker that‚Äôs been operating since March 2020.\n\nCompeting on merit\n\nAdding pressure to the chip sector is a report from The Information that AI chipmaker Nvidia is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation.\n\nThe DOJ is looking at complaints that the company allegedly abused its market dominance in AI, The Information reported.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company ‚Äúwins on merit.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making NVIDIA openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,‚Äù the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson added that Nvidia is ‚Äúhappy to provide any information regulators need.‚Äù\n\nCNBC has also reached out to the DOJ on the report.\n\nSamsung rival SK Hynix, which supplies U.S. giant Nvidia, also fell sharply to close more than 10% lower. The sell-off continued in Europe. Shares of ASML, which sells key tools required to make cutting-edge chips, declined along with STMicroelectronics and Infineon.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF, which includes major names in the sector, fell more than 4% on Friday after plummeting 6.5% a day earlier.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/intel-share-plunge-drags-down-global-chip-stocks-from-tsmc-to-samsung.html", "id": "1eifwxf", "created_utc": 1722619596.0, "score": 440, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "RIPIP Intel Kid - 700k bags to hold for another 50 years.

Eg Intel‚Äôs 10nm is akin to TSMC‚Äôs 7nm). \n\nIntel didn‚Äôt move away from a 14nm process on desktop consumer chips until Alder Lake in November of 2021.

(People and the bots really need to cool it with the downvoting even if you disagree with someone's point of view. It just makes people less likely to post or interact and this place will end up a ghost town or echo chamber of only 1 point of view. I upvote almost everyone as long as it adds to the conversation.)\n\nThis happens all the time, markets get too frothy, bulls get overconfident, leverage up, get caught up in the momentum and voting machine. After a correction, around this time the bears come out and start parading. Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. \n\nWhen things get frothy and super expensive, get some hedges in place, sell CC, buy protective puts, or something else. This costs money or limits your upside, but also protects your gains in case something like this happens.\n\nWhenever a correction like this happens, bears need to start thinking about when to cut their down bets and start adding to their long term position. Markets trend up over the long term so you need assets of some sort. Holding cash forever is 'safe' but you'll lose out over the long run to inflation and asset appreciation. No one will time the bottom perfectly, so just have to buy shares at valuations that make sense, or sell puts at strikes you're happy taking assignment at.\n\nSince options have really gained traction and volume, especially the 0dte and all these leveraged etfs, the markets have been juiced to the tits. Both to the up and downside. This has made the voting machine absolutely bonkers and not normal at all (NVDA had a -7%, +12.8%, -6.67% 3 day streak for a company worth $2.7T) . Using millions or billions, someone can influence market direction by billions or trillions. It's pretty important to realize this and not get too caught up in the voting machine that's turned up to 11.\n\nThis is there the weighing machine comes into play. Sooner or later something breaks the voting machine. Sometimes it's something important, sometimes something silly. What really matters at the end of the day is making money now and in the future and how much you or the market is willing to pay for that. Hype and promises can only take you so far, sometimes years, but a company has to make money sooner or later. The market won't tell you how much they're willing to pay for that, only you can figure out what you're personally willing to pay for it. If you're right, great. If you're wrong, figure out why you're wrong and hopefully learn/grow as an investor.\n\nEveryone has their own investing philosophy and thesis and risk tolerance so it's not a one sized fits all solution. I turned forever moon bull to moderate/realistic bull after 2021. Since then, I care more about protecting gains rather than a sprint to mars. It's really fun to see the 6-7 figures up but that means you have to be willing to see the 6-7 figures down. At some point you realize it's not worth the lack of sleep and stress, and nice boring gains and losses are much better for mental health. Once I figured out that if I just put in my net worth or portfolio into a calculator and compounded returns at a safer goal of 10% a year, it becomes a ridiculous number relatively quickly.

The \"monthly payment is the problem\" argument has gained some validity with the low rate financing discounts they did recently and the supposed effect it had on sales (we cannot scientifically prove the effect, but I believe it did work), and it does offer some insight into what demand might look like once macro-sentiment improves and rates come down. \n\nI am glad we are \\*supposedly\\* releasing more affordable models start of 2025, and that we have the energy division which will not be affected by consumer demand as I expect demand for megapacks and such to only increase, especially considering rates will be coming down in September. Also, the lack of follow-up on investment plans by other big autobrands, while being terrible for the energy transition, might be a boon for Tesla as a company in the longer term.\n\n  \nI think the current state of both the market and the economy is simply put shit, and TSLA will weather the storm with large amounts of cash. I believe that FSD will work but I would simply urge everyone invested to practice the patience of a buddhist monk in a desolate temple in Bhutan. We all want it to happen NOW, but as we have seen we really don't know when the investment in AI-technology will bear its fruits, all we can see is the continued improvements in the software. If FSD is not as succesful as we thought it would be, I genuinely believe the AI will still find other use cases in scenarios where the operation of the technology will not pose risk to human life as in cars (i.e. Optimus). \n\nTL;DR: HODL", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Yep. If you look at all autos, they're all doing even worse than Tesla is. The global market for buying cars is stagnating or slowing. You can blame inflation or global economics or whatever else, but it's just not great. Out of any company making cars, Tesla is best positioned to make it through out alive and thrive for the future.\n\nThen combine that with energy growing, just adds another source of revenue for Tesla if auto slows down. We just have to be careful with modeling the future growth potential and market for stationary energy storage. Don't want to fall into the trap of 50% growth forever again.\n\nThen the wild card of FSD/bot. They're making progress on making improvements, but so far no real significant progress in really monetizing it. It might take months to years to solve all the 9s enough to monetize it. Then you have to convince average people to let it drive for you, not the tech forward investors/community. The normal person hates change and not being in control. We can't convince people to switch to EVs exponentially right now. I'd imagine the hesitation to let a car drive itself would be even worse.\n\nAs for TSLA and the rest of the market, there's been a storm brewing for some time now. It's hard to say how everyone will make it through. Just have to keep in mind valuations and multiples and what could happen if things do really turn south. At the 2022 lows, our PE ratio got to 30-40 I think. With 2.5 EPS, that's a share price of $75-100 (and this is without the E part dying because of a global recession). Anyone reading this will be thinking, well Tesla has energy and FSD/bot so deserves a premium. Well, PE of 30-40 is a premium compared to the rest of auto and energy trading at 5-10 PE. But Tesla is a tech company so deserves a tech valuation. Most tech companies have a PE of 40-60. Also, a difference is tech companies are growing revenue and earnings with high margins now, not some nebulous uncertain future time frame.\n\nSo Tesla is doing cool and great things. It doesn't always translate into TSLA doing (and sustaining) cool and great things until it can really prove it's making a ton of money. Anyone holding TSLA should know these are the risks involved with holding it and waiting for Tesla to succeed. Shares are great because you can hold them for years or decades until Tesla solves autonomy and starts the money printer going. Leverage to the upside through margin or buying calls, even leaps, isn't great except for some short term bets or plays.\n\nDon't listen to me, don't listen to the crayon drawers saying we're going to $300, don't listen to gojo saying we're going to $10. Look at the company, financials, and figure out what you're willing to pay for it. Buy more when it's below that, hedge when it's way above that. If you're right, great.

{"title": "Sahm Rule Signalling Recession", "selftext": "# Background\n\nThe Sahm Rule is a recession indicator introduced by macroeconomist Claudia Sahm in 2019.¬†It is designed to signal the early stages of a recession based on changes in the unemployment rate. Here are the key aspects of the Sahm Rule:\n\n1. Calculation: The rule compares the current three-month moving average of the U.S. unemployment rate to the lowest three-month moving average unemployment rate over the preceding 12 months.\n2. Threshold: A recession is signaled when the current three-month moving average unemployment rate exceeds the lowest three-month moving average of the past 12 months by 0.50 percentage points or more.\n3. Data source: The rule uses the unemployment rate (U3) data released monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n4. Smoothing effect: By using a three-month moving average, the rule aims to prevent overreacting to a single month's data.\n5. Historical accuracy: According to Sahm, the rule has never triggered outside of a recession since the 1970s.\n6. Real-time vs. current indicators: The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database provides both current and real-time Sahm Rule recession indicators.\n7. Origin: Sahm introduced this indicator in a policy proposal for The Hamilton Project, suggesting automatic stimulus payments to individuals when the rule signals a recession.\n8. Purpose: The rule is designed to identify the onset of a recession quickly, allowing for timely implementation of fiscal policies to combat economic downturns.\n9. Limitations: While historically accurate, the rule is an \"empirical regularity\" rather than a definitive proposition, and circumstances such as GDP growth and inflation levels could influence its effectiveness.\n\nThe Sahm Rule has gained recognition for its simplicity and effectiveness in identifying the early stages of recessions, making it a valuable tool for economists and policymakers\n\n# Current Sahm Rule\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7y17obwqx8gd1.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=5909a14eb9ae79c6dcf59e3add07536a03746836\n\nWith unemployment raised to 4.3%, in today's job report we are pass the 0.50 threshold in the Sahm Rule", "id": "1ei9497", "created_utc": 1722602657.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 4 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 year ago\n**Total Comments** | 571 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cso979/barrick_gold_gold_bull_case/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cujnts/petrodollar_recycling_into_gold_instead_of_us/) \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Saw the post title and I thought Sahm rule was ‚ÄòStay At Home Mom‚Äô , interesting so they buy less on amazon recession incoming?", "score": 118, "replies": [{"body": "I also that this was going to be a mom related indicator‚Äîdisappointed.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Who do yall think is spending all the money on Amazon?", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "They stay at home because they are laid off from their jobs.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "German stock market is not doing bad and it's been in recession forever", "score": 88, "replies": [{"body": "liquidity is what drives markets. as long as fed keeps money sloshing in the system it has to go somewhere.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Isnt biden about to issue one last stimulus check before he goes?", "score": -12, "replies": [{"body": "Imagine if he did something truly stupid to reignite inflation like removing all taxes on social security.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yeah he should bribe the voters with a gambling check before he leaves", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Why don‚Äôt they just change the definition of it like we did?", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/white-house-definition-recession/", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.snopes.com/news/2024/06/19/biden-malfunctioning-june-2024/\n\n\nhttps://www.snopes.com/news/2024/06/19/biden-freeze-up-obama/\n\n\n\nhttps://www.snopes.com/fact-check/biden-invisible-chair-dday/", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Snopes.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "SSSHHHHHH!

The unemployment rate came in at 4.3% and best believe this marks a significant turning point. \n\nJerome is also wrong signalling a 25 bps cut. It needs to be 100 bps at this point. At this point, if consumer pricing doesn't come crashing down this will be viewed in the rearview mirror as a colossal economic failure by Jerome Powell. \n\nFor months and months and months the Fed was looking at a situation that never matched up with the reality on the ground. Levi jeans pricing was not the key indicator one should have been looking at as why they should be considering cutting rates. \n\nJPow was asked directly, point blank, if job data was weak would you consider cutting rates. Ever since that woman asked him that question job data has come in very weak. So weak we are now driving right off a cliff and into an economic recession. \n\nForever and ever, in the annals of history, I will never understand WHY THE HELL a home interest rate is tied into the overall rate situation by the fed. We're subsidizing Elon Musk's paper empire with EV rebates but one doesn't think to solemnly save the housing situation by letting folks in high rate periods buy into homes at lower rates so the normal cycle of housing can continue unabated. \n\nMoreover, there should be a mandatory housing single family home build requirement for each state that requires housing be built (to a certain percentage) before subsidies are levied out to each state and municipality. This can be managed by location and housing costs. \n\nThere is a way to fix this and the fed holding rates absolutely hostage is not the way. There is nothing being done to actively fix blatantly broken shit. We can't continue to let tech and new emerging market receive every subsidy while the rest of the country suffers.

I'm sure to an executive, changing which teams you work on, your actual work, and your process every 6-12 months is whatever, how hard can it be and all... they can't imagine that anyone under them is somehow less interchangeable than they are.

If you ask them personally, you will get variations of \"duh\" and \"no shit\". They're very well aware of what Taiwan and TSMC both mean to the US. The issue is that the politicians who effectively say what they can and can't do aren't.\n\n>So the US Government has an active interest in backing any US-based Semi-Conductor Manufacturing Company, \n\nYou have that backwards. The Department of Defense has a legal obligation to source all parts & materiel from US-based suppliers. In other words, if Argentina wanted to sell TAM's to the National Guard, they'd have to buy and establish a factory and US-based company to do so. The DoD has pointed out that as of recent years, due to the politically backed decline of the US industrial base, that approximately half of what they buy can no longer be made from entirely American materials and parts. This provided the impetus for the CHIPS act, not so much Taiwan being a single point of failure. The DoD does not actually care about where their parts and materials come from beyond the single point of failure and legal requirement. It's an economic issue--we spend a lot of money on our military, and if a lot of that money were to be going to factories and companies that aren't in the US, then we're just handing out our wealth. Because it stays in the US, that wealth never leaves the country, and its impact on the US isn't that large.\n\nThat's why we gave TSMC $12b to move at least one fab to the US, not part of the CHIPS act.
