This potential swing is based on the company‚Äôs $3.17 trillion market capitalization.\n\n**Scott Rubner**, managing director at Goldman Sachs noted that ‚Äúthe bar for Nvidia this earnings season is a lot lower than it has been in recent quarters,‚Äù due to fundamental selling in the tech sector. Nvidia holds the record for the biggest one-day market value swing at $330 billion, which occurred in late July.\n\nAccording to the bank, if Nvidia reports strong growth and forward guidance, it could surprise the stock market and lead to a significant move. ‚ÄúCan you imagine if NVDA beats expectations on Wednesday?‚Äù asked Rubner.\n\n**Why It Matters**: Nvidia‚Äôs upcoming earnings report is¬†[crucial for several reasons](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/08/40585459/nvidia-stock-q2-earnings-preview-analyst-says-ai-cycle-far-from-over-company-has-fi).

I do understand the possibility of not being able to realize that the real world issues and rumors we need clarified and squashed for this quarter are greater than this year's previous quarters. What has changed is (again) real issues of a different nature to prior, the accumulation of kids and uneducated, trigger happy investors in NVidia that are willing to sell off with a slight gust of wind, and rumors preached as truths by journalists that want to stir you and I up (if they feel they can convince us). So, this isn't about a change in NVidia's fundamentals as the one all be all source for caution and self awareness/reality checking ourselves. \n\nTo be overly cautious rewards in dividends upon every success, and eliminates any strong worries when things go south. However, being overly over optimistic in any thing or aspect of life can result in catastrophe. Just a basic example is thinking back to friends of mine (when we were younger) always thinking if a girl looked in their direction that they must be the only guy they're looking at, when in reality she's just grinning at a girl friend of hers that's behind him. With this irrational sense of confidence there will be hard learned lessons. These days an over optimistic person can think a woman likes him, walk up to her and compliment her, and the girls these days may call it harassment. You can get yourself in real legal trouble with over optimism, as well as heartache, other forms of let downs, and eventually questioning everything you thought you knew.\n\nRemember, you can't hurt yourself by being on defense, cautious and strategic, but over optimism is a recipe for disaster in almost any given scenario of life, and the stock market is the last place for pride/over certainty of your thoughts without reservation for possibly making a bad move. I'm tempted to be more bullish than anyone. I believe we'll easily surpass $200 before Jan 1st, but I can't rely on that.

Here‚Äôs why:\n\n### **Benefits to Company Performance:**\n\n1. **Higher Profit Margins**: Improved yields mean that more functional chips are produced from each wafer, reducing the cost per chip. This directly contributes to higher profit margins, which is favorable for the company's financial performance.\n\n2. **Increased Supply**: With higher yields, NVIDIA can produce more units of their GPUs, which is particularly important during high-demand periods, such as the launch of a new product. Meeting or exceeding market demand helps maximize revenue and market share.\n\n3. **Better Product Quality**: Yield improvements often correlate with higher product reliability and performance consistency. This can lead to fewer defects, returns, or warranty claims, which not only saves costs but also enhances the company‚Äôs reputation and customer satisfaction.\n\n4. **Stronger Market Position**: Successfully improving yields before release can give NVIDIA a competitive edge, allowing them to deliver more products at a lower cost or higher quality compared to competitors. This can reinforce their market leadership in sectors like gaming, AI, and data centers.\n\n5. **Positive Investor Sentiment**: If NVIDIA can demonstrate that they are efficiently managing production and improving yields before product release, it boosts investor confidence. This often leads to positive sentiment in the stock market, potentially driving up the stock price.\n\n6. **Smooth Product Launch**: Improved yields can help ensure that a product launch proceeds smoothly without supply shortages or quality issues. A successful launch strengthens brand reputation and supports continued sales momentum.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhen NVIDIA makes yield-improving changes to a mask before a product release, it usually leads to better overall company performance. The company benefits from higher profit margins, increased supply, better product quality, and stronger market positioning‚Äîall of which are likely to have a positive impact on financial results and investor confidence.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buy time", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "this is non sense, earlier the day, it's ANF, now NVDA. \nis this meme market afterall?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "ANF was even more of a joke honestly.

Nvidia needs a 690% gain in profit to even be set to \"fair value\" of a stock like Microsoft. Nvidia is pulling HARD on the \"hype\" so if the hype is not at the magnitude of at least 100%^+ then people get worried they bought in too high too soon. Dont forget Nvidias main issue currently is supply chain, their demand is so high they vant make all the chips yet, they pre order sold their chips to get their profits so high so fast, they are still trying to finish making boards for products they already sold a year ago... thats not good for a hyped company. Investors want to see demand filled so we can see more confirmed sales roll in, not them failing desperately to make chips they sold for tons of profit a year ago lol. Their main supply issue is Memory chips. Look at the memory stocks, MU sold every single chip the moment it was made to Nvidia, and they need more, tried to build a new factory, and it got delayed by 18 to 24 months, that was 3 months ago when nvidia tanked down from 140 down to 100 again.

So only about 9.77 bil was actually profit taking out all production costs and employee payments. Still Microsoft reported 69.59% profit margin, on 64.7 billion revenue just last quarter. Approximately 44.643 billion net profit after employees paid and all industry costs on their public earnings report document. This is both directly on nvidia and microsofts business website by the way. That's still a gap of about 350% scale up in profit that Nvidia has to hit to even break even with microsofts profit, again its a comparative thing, microsoft stock is worth less than nvidia but they made 3.5x more money. The reason nvidias price is so high is because investors expect that 350% profit to come soon, and then after another big growth but the issue is the H200 production chain is failing.\n\nNvidia next proposed board uses MU brand hb3me memory. MU literally is the first to make them and first to sell to Nvidia and nvidia signed a contract with them to buy every single chip they make MU has announced this contract and they will sell every single chip to nvidia up until 2025, nvidia already pre paid its a done and punlic deal, MU is unable to meet their demands, and buyers of Nvidia are still waiting in large quantities to get their next gen h200's because of the delay. Nvidia is still selling last generation tech the h100, which is where their current revenue is from and thats great even still. But Nvidia has already started pre selling these new h200 chips artificially inflating their revenue to massive amounts before they can even make them.... its a pre sale false sense of profit, if the production falls through, which it did, you'll see within a year the destruction of it if they do not find a solution soon, and we have yet to hear any concrete solutions for this problem. They are still making the h100s and selling those old tech for good profit which is nice, but the hype of the stock is not on last generation tech... It's the next gen. H200 is the product everyone wants to see actually being delivered faster since they already paid their money for them last year and still they havent been shipped, still deadlines get pushed back further and further, not a good look to maintain this scale of growth. H200s just started arriving in July, so they are making progress, but its still approximately 300% down from the demand, as per Nvidia announcement of the delay. So we know they have massive pre orders, and are unable to produce 3/4th of the boards THEY ALREADY SOLD, and its confirmed that the delay will likely go until 2025 UNLESS they make some sort of deal with Samsung or another company but they are having major issues with the restrictions over seas and the fact that Samsung memory is significantly less desirable so then theyd have to back track on their expected performance of the h200s and we could be looking at massive backlash from the buyers paying 100k per board if they preform 20% worse than they promised....", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "that‚Äôs an essay to still just post wrong numbers, are you looking at last years report or something?

Samsung and others are still slacking behind. Nvidia cannot finish the H200s without the hb3me memory. Emphasis on the 3, they have plenty of other companies supplying hb2me for the old out dated h100s that are extremely inefficient, nvidia is still selling a lot of them, but a majority of everyone wants the h200s and they wanted them at the start of 2024 and they didnt deliver the first ones until July, and they were faulty, so now theres massive call backs and redesigning and now thats how we got another 3 month delay announced earlier this week lol. MU has announced that Nvidia requires upwards of 4x the memory that MU can produce to even BREAK EVEN with the boards that they Already Pre Sold.... soooo that's obviously an issue. Nvidia announced they are working with Samsung to try and work out a deal to make the hb3me chips they need but it isnt going well because samsung is a shit asian company that makes low budget low grade memory that degrades quickly and has statistically preformed close to 40% WORSE than MU american made chips. So then thay becomes another problem when nvidia pre sold all these h200 boards promising 40% power efficiency increase and then suddenly they are delayed, broken, and using lower class chips to finish them because they failed their promises... customers like Tesla have already recalled and tried to pull their funding back from Nvidia because of this, and Tesla is MASSIVE client for Nvidia, soon other companies will also withdraw and cut their losses if nvidia cant get their shit together soon.

{"title": "Are Small Accounts Doomed There's No Edge in This Market", "selftext": "The idea of starting with a small account, growing it into $100k+ port is the dream for most but it seems so unrealistic, doing this full-time past a hobby/for fun.\n\nThe capital needed to make enough profit to live-off means you already have substantial capital made elsewhere, not starting the race with a small portfolio. Am up 30% for the year, percentage wise is phenomenal, but it's not going to change my life in anyway. Then there's trade-offs to everything, every variable perfectly calculated by machines priced to perfection.\n\nThere's only a few strategies when used in certain environments have left in mind which may give *edge:*\n\n1. Diagonal spreads opened on day of earning's to capitalize on high IV, receive the most amount of premium, and buy longer dated calls 3-6m out which will be unaffected by IV crush. For example, S reported today so would open $26/$29 (8/30-12/20), capturing the higher than usual IV premium, long legs dodge IV crush, and can keep selling against while price moves in my direction. It's utilizing high IV but the trade-off is can only do this every 3 months.\n2. Selling covered calls when VIX spikes, most likely shares have tanked in price tremendously, buy shares and sell a far OTM covered call which will offer exceptional premium because VIX is high.\n3. Selling cash-secured put when VIX spikes, if price drops further you're getting an exceptional deal on shares and hefty premium to cover downside.\n\nIt's basically selling volatility, taking advantage of market event and going long. However, cannot for the life of me decipher any way to get ahead quickly. The time it would actually take would be better spent building a business, earning wealth elsewhere, then coming back to the market, which makes it much easier since need much less percentage gain to be meaningful return, and can utilize basic strategies keeping it ridiculously simple even just selling covered calls for a living.\n\nFrom my experience with other structures I found noticeable cons:\n\n* Neutral structures don't profit much, safe but small returns. Losses can be far more costly than the wins. Win 3, lose 1, back to square one.\n* LEAPS are a huge commitment, can go good for a year and next year wipe out all of your gains. Begs the question why not just buy shares eventually will get burned using such leverage.\n* Long calls/puts the price wont go to infinity, no need to overpay, this where spreads come into the picture. Diagonals, calendars, debt spreads are great for trading but have to be right about direction. There's no edge here it's just better way of taking bets, if you're good at predicting direction can do well but with a small portfolio again is it even worth trading?\n\n**CONCLUSION:** Maybe this is widely known but those getting rich off  small portfolio seems to only happen with luck, taking on so much risk things very well could've gone very wrong. So the more capital have to work with, the less ballsy plays need to take, and 1-2% suddenly becomes very lucrative returns. However, if you're at this point you're not going to be needing this money to live-off of like a job anyways. Seems those full-time in the market are already wealthy and and can keep it stupid simple with their strategies while profiting substantially.", "id": "1f33v6d", "created_utc": 1724828793.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 151, "replies": [{"body": "And sunscreen", "score": 26, "replies": []}, {"body": "‚ò†Ô∏è", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Go on WSB.

I think Jensen's tone was overly defensive/annoyed on the conference call, but a lot of the questions felt overly speculative to me, who is biased.

It's the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure investment you can make today. And so, one way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through it is just go back to first principles.\n\n> You have $1 trillion worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure. And the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth of Juniper CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably **rent it** for less than $1 billion. And so, because it's commoditized, there's already $1 trillion on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so, the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon, Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start **saving money**.\n\n> That's a tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start **saving money** is because data processing **saves money**, and data processing is probably just a giant part of it already. And so, recommender systems **save money**, so on and so forth, OK? And so, you start **saving money**. The second thing is everything you stand up are going to **get rented** because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI.\n\n> And so, your capacity **gets rented** right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommender system or a next-generation search system? So, for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms, for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so, there's a lot of ways you could think through it.\n\n> But at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA.\n\nWhich really translates to:\n\n\"We have no idea how you are going to make money with AI other than renting out the excess capacity. You are going to save money if you switch from general purpose compute to tensor multiplication compute, so that we can make money. All we're doing is selling you shovels, whether you're digging gold or your own grave is your problem. Do like startups or something, IDK.\"", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I don't know about that. Microsoft said that their AI-oriented crowd is growing and that demands outstrips supply. I've seen articles comparing GPU spend this year vs. related ROI this year, but that comparison is disingenuous, because a GPU is still useful for 5-10 years, and that's the timescale Microsft can see an ROI on AI. Before transformers and LLMs, that was still the case. I'll admit that I don't understand Zuck's business model, and META is number 2 on spend, but they aren't throttling back yet either and I am glad he open-sourced weights on a chatGPT peer.\n\nCloud providers are making money on AI right now and don't see a supply/demand balance right now. I do watch the other megacap earnings for signs that they are cutting back on spend, and haven't seen it yet. You're right that when they do cut back, NVDA will go down and then I will start looking for dividend stocks, and maybe look for a rebound in copper. I have already started a utilities dividend barbell. \n\nI haven't yet seen a cogent argument as to why NVDA is a year-2000 Cisco, with only 15% year-over-year revenue growth and a PE three times higher than NVDA, rather than a 1996-97 Cisco. In the last couple years, LLM's have moved from a mouse-sized brain (where parameters equal the number of neurons and dendrites) to a cat-sized brain and improved. I've seen arguments that AI has already vacuumed the Internet, so they can't get better because there's not enough data. But, historically, a neural network was overdetermined unless its size was smaller than the dataset that it was trained on. Now, that's no longer true. With modern training techniques, LLMs have the worst performance if their size is really small, then they get better, then they have the second worst performance if their size equals the size of the training data, but then they continue to get better. \n\nAI is really bad at math unless you ask it to show every step and correct it along the way, but most humans on the Internet are bad at math. But, it is perfectly possible to synthetically generate infinite mathematical training data without AI if not computationally constrained (see Proof Theory and Goedel numbering, or use Mathematica-style approaches of making equations into lists and then using those lists to generate a tree structure, and explore all the permutations that are logically allowed under valid mathematical operations). \n\nFinally, a lot of people think that AI doesn't really understand reality because it is trained on text, when SOTA LLMs seem to still understand a lot about reality without it. Multimodal AI is coming, unreleased applications like Open AI's Sora will benefit from cheaper and more energy efficient compute, which is NVDA's wheelhouse. Also, I read a statistic that the amount of information that comes in through a child's optic nerve in the first few years of their life exceeds the total information of the Internet. $16k AI-enabled robots are coming, and I think they will get a lot better when they start collecting oodles of training data in parallel, which requires compute.\n\nSo for me, there are two key questions regarding NVDA: Is there significant demand for GPUs right now?

So there's no net benefit for the shareholders unless they're able to use that money for better ROIC, more earnings/cash flow, more dividends than investors have put in.\n\nThere's a good chance this would crush any company with a high P/E as there's no reason to invest in them until that set price is increased.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Well the benefit of buying shares is the same as now - you expect future earnings to increase.

{"title": "Things to consider before betting it all on NVDA earnings tomorrow.", "selftext": "**TLDR; I AM AS REGARDED as the next guy, but I recommend lowering exposure to NVDA earnings tomorrow to save money to play the aftermath.**\n\nTomorrow is the Super Bowl of stocks. It's no secret that everyone down to the shoe shiner is balls deep in NVDA (mostly long, looking at the options chain) exposure. There are also those hoping for the end of the world to begin tomorrow. But the one thing we know about Wall Street as a certainty is that they don't like when retail wins.\n\n**We are all aware of the bull case. VERY simplified:**\n\n1. Major tech companies have significantly increased CAPEX in Q2 and it doesn't take a genius to figure out where that money went.\n\n2. Tech CEOs have been quoted as saying that underspending is more of an issue than overspending. *See* *also* Sam Altman (OpenAI) & Co. as being open supporters of the theory of effective accelerationism, which in a nutshell is the belief that the pursuit of general intelligence warrants all costs, natural and financial.\n\n3. Nvidia is still founder led at this scale by Jensen Huang who is an amazing man and one of the greatest minds of our time. \n\n**The bear case is mostly about forward guidance, as pretty much everyone believes there will be an EPS beat. This is mostly macroeconomic and includes:**\n\n1. Concerns about tech companies not being able to profit from AI spending, leading to winding down.\n\nRebuttal: We're not going to see this materialize this quarter. Tech has barely dipped their toes into seeing what value they can extract out of the newest line of hardware. It is simply too early to see. Even if you don't buy that, see previous point about under/overspending.\n\n2. Blackwell delays \n\nRebuttal: Priced in, much like the heat death of the universe itself. But really, who cares about this. Blackwell is still the only game in town.\n\n3. US economy slowing, 800k jobs just \"lost\" while stocks are nearing ATH, election concerns, general stuff like that.\n\nRebuttal: No rebuttal. Completely legitimate to believe that a large correction is looming, if you're not kidding yourself. \n\n**So why not move all in tomorrow? 50/50 is better odds than what retail usually get anyways.**\n\nYou all know about IV crush, how NVDA is already priced to jump basically 10% after earnings, and all that. If you need to play options, please consider getting ones longer than August 30, which will be impacted the most. September 20 seems like a fair middle ground between \"fun\" leverage and having enough time to correct the ship should things go bad. \n\nYou also all know that the world is watching these earnings the way we watch a groundhog come out of a hole to tell us if there are going to be six more weeks of winter or early spring. If you are patient enough to hold cash and simply wait to see the outcome, you WILL make money on placing a directionally good bet - with the benefit of being able to scoop up IV crushed options. It is also possible to hold SPY calls/puts as a proxy for NVDA to lessen the impact of IV crush.\n\nIt is a likely reality that big money is able to keep the prices pinned this week so that these 130's expire cheap or worthless. A massive 128.60 institutional buy wall was briefly up today, before the stint over 129, which suggests to me that smart money/funds are keeping dry powder ready. \n\nPlease consider which would minimize regret: missing out on winning the big 50/50 or not having the funds to act on what will be very well informed plays for the direction of the entire market over the next 1-2 months.\n\nThank you very much, may God protect our savings.", "id": "1f2xbn6", "created_utc": 1724806355.0, "score": 979, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 369, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 194 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "For once I'm doing this.

This can be a direct way to return value to shareholders, similar to dividends.\n\t2.\tSignal of Confidence: A buyback can signal that the company‚Äôs management believes the stock is undervalued, indicating confidence in the company‚Äôs future prospects.\n\t3.\tEarnings Per Share (EPS) Boost: Reducing the number of shares increases the earnings per share, which can make the company‚Äôs financial metrics look better.\n\t4.\tTax Efficiency: Buybacks can be more tax-efficient for shareholders compared to dividends, which are typically taxed as income.\n\nPotential Downsides:\n\n\t1.\tShort-Term Focus: Buybacks can sometimes be a sign that a company is more focused on boosting short-term stock prices rather than investing in long-term growth opportunities.\n\t2.\tDebt Financing: If a company borrows money to finance a buyback, it could increase its financial risk, especially if market conditions worsen.\n\t3.\tMisallocation of Capital: If a company‚Äôs stock is already overvalued, buybacks may not be the best use of capital, potentially leading to a waste of resources.\n\t4.\tNeglect of Business Needs: Excessive buybacks might lead to underinvestment in essential areas like research and development, which could hurt the company in the long run.\n\nConclusion:\n\nStock buybacks can be beneficial when executed properly, particularly when the stock is undervalued or the company has excess cash that isn‚Äôt needed for other investments. However, they can be harmful if they are done at the expense of long-term growth or if they are used to artificially boost financial metrics.
