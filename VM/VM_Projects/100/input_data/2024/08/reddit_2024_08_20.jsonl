Sometime this week, we‚Äôre likely to see a sharp and short-lived pull-back in the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ), the S&P 500 (SPY), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) and the rest. This is largely due to everything reaching extremely overbought conditions on the near-term indicators. But make no mistake, any pull-back we do see will be a huge buying opportunity. As I made pretty clear back on August 5, the markets have bottomed out and have already begun a new rally back to all-time highs. That being said, the hourly charts on both the indices and in the high flyers such as Nvidia have reached extreme levels. Let‚Äôs take a look.¬†\n\n# NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) Rally Is Overheating\n\nThe QQQ has already rallied $53.81 from its lows back on August 5. This has been on a straight line up from the lows. That‚Äôs more than 10% in just 9-10 days. Historically speaking, that is as big as it gets on such a near-term basis. Typically speaking, we can expect around a \\~10-12% move up but on 20-25 trading sessions which amounts to around 0.5% per day on average. That‚Äôs the typical strength we see in a new QQQ rally post-correction. This rally has been moving at pace nearly DOUBLE that number. Now we‚Äôve seen that happen before, but it is a lot more rare.¬†\n\nThe table in the image below examines 10 of the largest corrections going back to 2018 and analyzes the typical rebound that follows a bottom in the market. The first column outlines the size of the correction, the second column shows the total recovery rally (percentage gain) during the first 25ish trading days after a market bottom, the third outlines the number of days it took for the QQQ to reach its high point in the rally, the next columns outlines the average percentage gain per day and the last two columns shows the continuation of that rally in the 35+ day range. Now it‚Äôs important to note that the 25-day column merely outlines rallies within a 25-day range. Some rallies fall short and other continue just past 25-days before peaking. The reason I think we‚Äôre getting closer to a near-term peak now at around the 11-day mark is because we‚Äôve simply gone too far too fast. The QQQ is very overbought and due for a short-term pull-back. Typically what we see in such a pull-back is something around 10-18 points or 2-4%. After that, I expect the QQQ to continue higher toward its all-time highs of $503 a share by September.¬†\n\n# NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) Overbought On The Hourly\n\nThe QQQ is also very overbought on the hourly as is NVDA, AAPL, TSLA and all the other high flyers of the NASDAQ-100. This is more evidence indicating that we‚Äôre now due for a near-term pull-back. Take a look at the hourly chart below. Notice just how overbought the QQQ is and what typically follows after reaching overbought conditions. When we reach peak overbought conditions, the QQQ will generally move mildly higher for another 2-3 sessions at most and then a sharp pull-back follows.¬†\n\nAgain, don‚Äôt mistaken this for anything other than what it is. If you‚Äôre not long already and want to buy, this pull-back will make for a very short-lived buying opportunity. If you‚Äôre already long, then just know that we‚Äôre likely to see a swift recovery and another explosive leg higher. I expect the QQQ might drop from $480 down to $463 before continuing higher to $500 a share in short and swift bear kick to the nuts. The rally back to $500 a share may look something like this:¬†(see [Sam Weiss for charts and tables](https://sam-weiss.com/sharp-short-lived-sell-off-coming/))\n\n# Nvidia (NVDA) Due To Pull-Back Before Earnings\n\nAs I‚Äôve mentioned several times before, stocks do not trade in a vacuum. As goes the NASDAQ-100, so goes NVDA. With the QQQ set to see a sharp near-term pull-back, NVDA is likely going to follow suit. But more than that, NVDA is even more overbought than is the QQQ. In fact, this is the most overbought we‚Äôve seen NVDA in nearly 6-months now. So you can expect to see something like a $10-$15 pull-back soon. But again, don‚Äôt take that for more than it is. A buying opportunity plain and simple.¬†\n\nNothing has changed since August 5. We still expect NVDA to rally to $150 a share by January or earlier. January conservatively. Notice it can easily see those levels immediately after earnings are reported. I‚Äôd even venture to say that history has told us repeatedly that this is likely the case. That being said, our official stance is $150 by January.¬†\n\n# Apple (AAPL) Near-Term Uncertain\n\nUnlike the QQQ and NVDA, Apple actually isn‚Äôt all that overbought on the hourly. That‚Äôs because Apple hasn‚Äôt run up in a straight line as NVDA and the QQQ have. That being said, with the market due for a sharp pull-back near-term, I expect Apple to follow suite. It just might not pull-back as much as the QQQ and/or NVDA.¬†\n\n**Read the full article at www.sam-weiss.com.**   ", "id": "1ewxyd4", "created_utc": 1724166339.0, "score": 364, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 181, "comments": [{"body": "This guy logs on to give people free money and naturally, redditors get mad at him for it.", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Free money?

Can you please point at a few resources to start on the track you obviously are an expert at.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "So question 1 is too far ahead in the future.  We don‚Äôt know what will come of earnings or what type of rally we‚Äôre going to see in the Nasdaq.  \n\nLet me give you an example of why that type of outlook is difficult to forecast.  \n\nThe QQQ rallied from $341 up to $450 over 103 trading session (32%) between November 2023 and April 2024.  That‚Äôs 6 consecutive months of non/stop rallying and the biggest pullback we saw in that time was 4%.  After an 8% correction in April, the QQQ rallied for over 40 trading sessions from May to July.  The run went from $411 to $503.50. \n\nWe finally just had a real correction.  The QQQ fell from $503.50 down to $423.  That‚Äôs $80 or 16%.  \n\nSince then it has rallied back 12%.  \n\nOkay.  So let‚Äôs consider question #1.  What we‚Äôd need to know is whether this is going to be like the Nov-April rally where the QQQ runs 30% over 103 days or the May-July rally over 40-days.  I‚Äôm willing to wager it‚Äôs going to be the former because we just had a 16% correction.  \n\nBut that‚Äôs impossible to know until we actually eclipse all-time highs and evaluate the structure of the trend.  \n\nWe certainly can‚Äôt forecast what‚Äôs going to happen in October today.  \n\nWhat I can say is that between now and January, Nvidia is likely seeing all-time highs ($150). \n\nIn terms of resources, I use stockcharts.com for charting.  But I‚Äôm mostly experience-based knowledge.  I‚Äôve gained almost all my knowledge through experience.  \n\nI just launched a blog at www.sam-weiss.com.  Feel free to drop by.

I don‚Äôt know off the top of my head. Here‚Äôs what ChatGPT says:\n\nWhen a company undergoes a corporate action like a spin-off, merger, or split into multiple companies, the handling of long-term options (LEAPS) is governed by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). The specific treatment depends on the nature of the corporate action. Here‚Äôs how LEAPS might be affected if a company splits into multiple companies:\n\n### **Scenario: Company A Splits into Companies B, C, and D**\nIf Company A splits into three separate entities‚ÄîCompany B, Company C, and Company D‚Äîyour LEAPS (long-term call options) would generally be adjusted to reflect the new structure. Here‚Äôs what typically happens:\n\n1. **Adjustment of Options Contracts**:\n   - The original LEAPS on Company A would not disappear. Instead, they would be adjusted to reflect the ownership in the new companies (B, C, and D).\n   - The strike price and the number of shares covered by the option might be adjusted to account for the new distribution of shares.\n\n2. **Creation of New Options**:\n   - In many cases, new options will be created for Companies B, C, and D, and your original LEAPS might be converted into a package of options that cover all three companies. This is known as a **‚Äùpackage‚Äù** or **‚Äùbasket‚Äù** option.\n   - For example, if you originally held 1 LEAPS contract on Company A, after the split, you might hold an adjusted contract that represents a certain number of shares in Company B, Company C, and Company D, combined.\n\n3. **Contract Symbol Change**:\n   - The ticker symbol of your option might change to reflect the new companies and the adjusted terms.\n\n4. **Strike Price and Number of Shares**:\n   - The strike price of your LEAPS might be adjusted downward to account for the distribution of the new companies.\n   - The number of shares the option controls could be altered to maintain the equivalent value before and after the corporate action. For example, instead of 100 shares of Company A, your option might now cover 50 shares each of Companies B, C, and D.\n\n5. **Expiration Date**:\n   - The expiration date of your LEAPS would typically remain the same.\n\n### **Example**:\nSuppose you held a LEAPS call option on Company A with a strike price of $100, covering 100 shares. If Company A splits into Companies B, C, and D, and each new company trades at $40 per share after the split, your original option might be adjusted as follows:\n\n- Your option might now give you the right to purchase 100 shares in each of Companies B, C, and D at a proportionately adjusted strike price.\n- Alternatively, you could end up with three separate options: one for each new company, with adjusted strike prices and share amounts.\n\n### **Important Considerations**:\n- **Notification**: You would receive a notification from your broker about the specific adjustments made to your options contracts.\n- **No Action Required**: Typically, as an options holder, you don‚Äôt need to take any action‚Äîthe adjustments are automatically processed by the OCC.\n- **Value Preservation**: The adjustments are designed to preserve the intrinsic value of your original options, ensuring that you‚Äôre not disadvantaged by the corporate action.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhen a company like Company A splits into multiple companies (B, C, and D), your LEAPS will be adjusted to reflect the new structure. This adjustment ensures that your options maintain their value relative to the new companies. You‚Äôll receive a detailed explanation from your broker regarding how the options have been modified, but the core idea is that you‚Äôll continue to hold a position that reflects the new corporate structure.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Youtube does not make a profit\n\nGCP without Google would totally be tanked.\n\nI'm bullish on Google because I think this case wont amount to anything, but I am shocked at the complete lack of financial knowledge on this subreddit that is supposed to be stocks related.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Huh?

That is slightly lower than the maximum provisional duty of 37.6% the Commission had set in July for companies that did not cooperate with the EU's anti-subsidy investigation.\n\nTesla was among the companies classed as cooperating with the EU investigation.\n\nThe Commission said it conducted an investigation, including sending a team to Tesla facilities in China, to verify what subsidies the firm had received.\n\nA Commission official said Brussels had concluded that Tesla receives less subsidies from China, compared to the Chinese EV producers Brussels had investigated.\n\nThe tariffs are on top of the EU's standard 10% duty on car imports.\n\nThe Commission, which oversees the bloc's trade policy, says the measure is needed to counter what it says are unfair subsidies.\n\nIt said on Tuesday the three companies it had sampled would each receive slightly lower provisional duties.
