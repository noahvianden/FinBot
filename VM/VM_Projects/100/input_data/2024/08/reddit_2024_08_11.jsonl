However, it's not implausible if we assume market saturation, increased competition, or macroeconomic challenges.\n   - **Scenario 2 (Best Case):** 25% growth for the next 5 years and 20% for the following 5 years are optimistic but possible, especially if NVIDIA continues to dominate emerging markets like AI, data centers, and autonomous vehicles. These rates suggest strong belief in continued innovation and market expansion.\n   - **Scenario 3 (Normal Case):** 25% growth for the next 5 years and 12% for the following 5 years seem to strike a balance between optimism and realism. This might be considered a reasonable estimate assuming continued growth but accounting for some market maturation over time.\n\n### 2. **Discount Rate:**\n   - An 8% discount rate is commonly used in DCF analyses for large, established companies. It reflects the opportunity cost of capital and the risk associated with the company's cash flows. For NVIDIA, 8% seems reasonable, but some might argue for a slightly higher rate given the volatility in the tech sector.\n\n### 3. **Terminal Value:**\n   - **Terminal Growth Rate and Multiple:**\n     - The terminal growth rate reflects the expected long-term growth of the company after the projection period. The rates used (ranging from 2% to 10%) seem within a reasonable range.\n     - The terminal multiples (ranging from 30 to 45) are higher-end but might be justified if NVIDIA continues to grow and maintain its leadership in high-growth markets. However, multiples in this range assume strong long-term performance and a favorable economic environment.\n\n### 4. **Intrinsic Value and Implied Share Price:**\n   - The implied share prices of $141.28 (worst case) to $398.73 (best case) encompass a wide range. The weighted average price of $263.14 falls within the mid-range, aligning reasonably well with the market's expectations given current valuations.\n   - Whether these figures are realistic depends on whether the growth assumptions are met. NVIDIA's current market price is likely reflective of a strong growth outlook, so the best-case scenario might align with more bullish market expectations, while the worst case could align with a more pessimistic view if growth falters.\n\n### 5. **External Market Factors:**\n   - Consider the broader market environment, competition, technological advancements, and potential regulatory challenges. These factors could significantly impact NVIDIA's future performance and, therefore, the realism of these projections.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Realism:** The analysis presents a wide range of possible outcomes, which is good practice in valuation. The normal case seems reasonably realistic, assuming NVIDIA continues to grow but faces typical market pressures over time. The best-case scenario is more aggressive and could be realistic if NVIDIA significantly outperforms expectations. The worst-case scenario, while conservative, could be realistic if growth stalls or the market environment worsens.\n- **Caution:** Valuations are inherently uncertain, and the assumptions in the model should be scrutinized and updated as new information becomes available.

Although he will likely be the saviour of it instead. Intel is a massive slow moving ship that takes time to redirect. He took over from a bunch of MBA finance people with a lack of engineer background. These are the people that had Intel stuck in the mad and innovation was nonexistant. Instead they tried to milk every penny without innovating.\n\n* Intel is too far behind\n\nSince Gelsinger a new strategy called 5 nodes in 4 years has been implemented. They currently are on schedule to make the deadlines. Normally Intel should be far behind the likes of AMD but if you look at their new sierra forest server processer they are unexpectedly on par with AMD. In the next two years they will also release backside power delivery which will be a massive innovation that TSMC hasnt pulled off yet.\n\n* Intel is too far gone\n\nPeople would make you believe as if Intel is going bankrupt. Whilst in reality theyre creating lots of cash/profit if you ignore their fabs investment. They already secured 15bn in contracts from Microsoft for their 18a chips to be released in 2026. Remember they are on schedule and they are already testing these 18a chips. If they are succesful it will likely put intel on parity in semi fabs with TSMC.

However, I think governments and companies have woken themselves up after the last Covid chip shortage. They realize they cannot be reliant on one manufacturer and need to diversify. Intel will play into that with their new fabs. The question remains if they can pull it off. My instinct would be yes. How in earth would they otherwise be able to compete with AMD in price/value for years after AMD went fabless? Although I dont see foundry adding a great amount of profits. Manufacturing isnt a highly profitable sector. But I think it will add enough value to get Intel to about 300-500bn market cap.

Nvidia‚Äôs leadership in this space, especially with their GPUs, continues to drive strong growth, which could support the stock price.\n\n2. **Earnings Momentum:** Nvidia‚Äôs recent earnings reports have consistently beaten expectations, driven by higher-than-expected demand in data centers and AI-related products.

Look at Nvidia prior to AI. They dominated and still dominate GPU sales. If you were a gamer, Nvidia was the way to go. Intel has been trying to break into the GPU industry beyond iGPU for a while now. I'd bet (and I am betting) they got 10 years before they get anywhere. AMD has always been second to Nvidia. There were a few times AMD made something a little faster than Nvidia but then a month or two later, Nvidia would roll something out better than that. Nvidia has a track record of holding the 1. position. That's not about to change. I don't see any other players, including outside of intel and AMD, being able to out run Nvidia. \n\n2. TSMC is not an issue. If China wants to take Taiwan, they would be dumb to make it an issue for Nvidia. Because the US gov will not tolerate it. China doesn't want war. Not with Taiwan or with the US. They want global business dominance. China Taiwan relations will likely cause a little stock moving but in the long run it won't matter. Also 6 months isn't the long run. \n\n3. AI isn't hype. For short term players, it will be hype for them. Only because something like this takes time to grow. There will likely be moments of massive upswings but it's still in the building phase. For those seeing this as a long term play, this isn't hype. This will change the world. Once AI enters the physical world, thru robots and other machines, it's going to revolutionize the world. \n\n4. I'm not some AI hype person, I've been reluctant for some time, I've seen enough and work with many that build off AI platforms, and I see where we are headed. This is going to be massive! Nvidia is going benefit more than anyone else. \n\n5. If you think we are already passed the gold rush and it's over... call me in 3-5 years. I think Nvidia having a market cap of 5-10 trillion isn't out of the question. Probably more. We're at the cusp of something world changing, this is like facebook back in 2005-2007. It's gaining momentum but it's not fully there yet. Imagine being able to buy into facebook/meta prior to IPO and you know now what it's worth. I'd do that deal. Pretty sure everyone would. That is Nvidia right now. \n\nOnly real concern I have is insiders selling right now. That's it. I understand they probably want some liquidity, I don't blame them. Still, not a fan of the selling. \n\nNot advice, just ramblings of a regarded mad man.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
