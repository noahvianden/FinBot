Everyone understands intrinsic value, but extrinsic value isn't that hard to grok at a high level either.  It represents the probability that an option can gain more intrinsic value before expiration, and how much.  And remember, theoretical pricing models are theoretical, the extrinsic value of an option is set by the markets, not by a computer calculating theoretical greeks.  When you place a trade, the computer is just assuming a few variables and back calculating what the Greek would be, in the theoretical model, to generate the observed extrinsic value of the contract at market price.\n\nThis probability increases as volatility increases, because a more volatile stock can make bigger moves, thus, an option has more liklihood of gaining intrinsic value if the underlying is volatile.  If volatility increases, therefore, so should the extrinsic value of the option.\n\nAs time goes by, however, the probability of additional gains (and the amount of those gains) declines, because there is less time for a stock price to move in a favorable direction.  Therefore the passage of time should erode the extrinsic value of an option.\n\nAnd of course, moneyness.  Even with big vol, a far ITM or OTM option has relatively less of a chance to see a large change in (percentage) of intrinsic value before expiration.

You are learning a lesson about implied volatility here. As an options buyer, part of what you pay for is volatility--a fudge factor for the unknown, if you like.\n\nIf you buy before earnings, the IV is up, so the prices are up. Investors do not *know* what is going to happen, either with the earnings report or how the market will respond. I've seen triple beats on earnings result in a stock price drop.\n\nOne way to mitigate IV is to use a vertical spread. I didn't see your strike price but let's say it was $120 and on 8/26 when the price was around $127, you spent $1200 per contract, 25 contracts, roughly $30K total.  You needed the price to be $12 per share higher than your strike to break even--$132. Now let's compare that to a vertical, where we still bought the $120 but at the same time, we sold the $130. Doing this, a large chunk of the IV gets cancelled out b/c you bought IV and you sold IV. This reduces the break even (and caps the upside at $130).  You'd have gotten around $700 credit to offset the $1200 cost, so it also cuts your capital requirements by over half to $500. You will pay twice as many broker fees for contracts, since we double the number of contracts, but for most traders that is $1 or less. Point is, if you used a vertical here, your break even point might have been more like $125 AND you'd have spent half as much money to get there.\n\nFast forward to 9/6. If the price is $132, you got nothing but fees from the solo call option, but you got \\~$500 profit from the vertical.

(IV crush) My experience when I owned AMD and their earnings was this‚Ä¶..Everyone knew AMD‚Äôs earnings were gonna be bad. I sold a covered call the day of the earnings report at a greatly inflated price because of super high IV, about a dollar above the strike price for about $600. Earnings were bad, the stock dropped, IV returned to normal and I bought back the covered call for like $4. Yesterday I sold a covered call on NVDA about $8 above the closing price. That allowed for a rise in the stock price if the earnings were good and it jumped. High IV and I got $365 for it. We all know what happened, but either way the IV went back to normal and I bought back the covered call for $7. Yes I lost money on the price drop of the stock, but the AMD trade covered it all and the NVDA trade covered at least half. I don‚Äôt own AMD anymore and I‚Äôm not selling my NVDA. If neither stocks moved at all after earnings, I would have a nice profit just because the super high IV went back to normal and the price of the options would automatically drop substantially. \n\nI‚Äôve gotten beaten on calls before like everybody , but I learned, in my opinion, don‚Äôt buy calls on earnings day when IV is sky high. You‚Äôre gonna get hurt. Sell a covered call. Easy money. Of course to sell a covered call you need to own at least 100 shares of the underlying stock. \n\nGood luck to you. If your expiration date is 9/6, I would at least hold for a bit tomorrow to see what NVDA is doing. If it and the market are going nowhere, probably best to sell and put the money somewhere else. You‚Äôll get killed on Theta decay over the weekend. Don‚Äôt know how many options you have, but you know about what you‚Äôll make if the stock rises a dollar, two, five. You can‚Äôt figure what a stock is gonna do anymore almost no matter what the earnings are. NVDA beat on every metric and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Go figure. Very disappointing.\n\nAs an alternative, I bought calls yesterday on PLTR. Another AI stock that is gonna benefit from NVDA earnings. It did. Didn‚Äôt have to worry about IV crush. Just the benefit of NVDA great earnings. Banked $1500. Could have been $3000, but my sell stop got triggered and then it took off much higher.

I threw away 10 grand on SPAC warrants a few years back when I started trading.  They basically went to 0.  \n\nSave up more money and get back to gambling.  But learn from it.\n\nI've been taking a beating the last few months in the market.  Somehow I've managed to keep a 6 month return of 26%, but it would probably be a lot more if not for the recent chop.  I got lucky and called the top on SPY, bought long dated ITM puts when IV percentile was 7%, market dropped two weeks later.  Sold early for 50% gains, could have made a lot more.  I continued to trade and made some profitable scalps, but made about a zillion small losing trades by getting scared and backing out with a tiny loss.  \n\nI've done OK mostly for one reason.  Trade small, trade often.\n\nA rule that I didn't follow on the losers, but did on my winners, is understand why you are making the trade, what can go wrong, have a thesis, execute on that thesis, and don't deviate unless the thesis changes.\n\nI basically did the opposite of what you did on NVDA.  Right before earnings, I sold premium rather than buying it, and my position had negative delta.  It's the first trade in a while that I felt really good about going into.\n\nHere was my thesis.  \n\nAt the time, I had long exposure to SPLG, ROKU, and PLTR.  I knew NVDA earnings were happening and the hype was off the charts.  I knew that those three positions have correlation with NVDA because NVDA is like 7% of the S&P now, and PLTR and ROKU are \"risk on\" stocks that will get hit if the S&P gets hit.  \n\nSo I wanted to hedge against NVDA falling and triggering selloffs elsewhere.  I could delta hedge against the positions themselves, but that is boring.  \n\nI looked at a few things.  \n- I believe investors are more cautious due to the recent vol explosion, so they will be quicker to sell when there is trouble in paradise.  \n- NVDA was close to hitting ATH's again, trading at \"speculation\" tier multiples, not \"investment\" tier multiples, meaning it needs accelerating revenue growth, but the past three quarters show decelerating growth.  \n- I think there are serious problems for AI capitalization and AI is a bigger bubble than dot com, and the tech is not even as world-changing as the internet.  \n- I think there are scaling issues for AI datacenter startups, which will put a ceiling on NVDA's sales meaning their growth won't be infinite forever.\n- NVDA reminds me of Enron in a lot of ways.  Not saying it's a fraud, but I do think they fluff their numbers a bit, legally.\n- The hype for NVDA was insane, option IV was at ATHs and pricing in a 10% move on earnings, people were having \"watch parties\" for the earnings calls in bars.  That's insane.  When hype reaches a certain level, the probability of disappointment skyrockets.  \n\nAll of this told my gut that NVDA will probably have good earnings, but that the market is expecting them to be absolutely nuclear, and wall street will be disappointed if they don't have intergalactic gorillion dollar revenues.  And, with IV that high, pricing in a 10% move, I have to pay with my kidney to make a bet on directionality by longing options, so buying options is a serious long shot in either direction.\n\nSo, I sold a call spread, betting that NVDA would move slightly lower, and volatility would plummet following earnings.  I allocated $2000 of buying power to hedge my other positions to the level I felt appropriate.  Ultimately, my other positions didn't move as much as I though on a drop in NVDA, in fact they went up, and my call spread jumped to 35%.

I only added pepper on all sides today. I set the oven to 190F/90C and cooked the steak until 120F/48C. Thew it in the pen with some oil. Toasting the fatty side first, then the flat sides, then the round leftover side. I had it in approx 1 minute per side. I cooked the butter in a separate pot with some garlic until dark brown yesterday the butter burned a little in the pen. After searing, I re-added the thermometer to observe the temperature. It got up to 135F/57C after letting it rest for 10 mintes, basically perfect medium rare. So I have that process down for a 2 inch steak pretty good after only one try yesterday which wasnt perfect.\n\nResult: Dry brining definitely works. Steak is much tastier throughout. And where it was pure muscle, also more tender. I very slightly under salted it, which was ok, so it allowed me to add some extra on top after cutting it, which I like very much. The crust was not quite as good as yesterday in terms of crispiness. I probably should have waited for the oil to smoke before adding the steak. Maximum heat baby! The taste of the crust was practically indistinguishable from yesterday. So basing it in butter or having the butter prepared extra doesnt make a difference. At least not that I can taste it.\n\nThe only downside was, this second cut of the same piece of meat was tougher than the one yesterday. This one had a tendon down the middle, which the other one only had at the very edge. It was similar to the one yesterday in terms of juiciness. I definitely learned from yesterday how to eat it and I mopped up the juices as I ate the steak with each piece, so I didnt have a puddle left like yesterday.\n\nAs this was an experiment, I didnt go for the most expensive meat there is, it was ok but not good. Marbling was very light, so I didnt expect much anyway. It was a rumpsteak cut (I think.. its H√ºfte in German, translates to hip. Basically meat from the upper arse, where the tail is connected). It was definitely too lean for its tenderness.\n\nAnyway, with this, I can cook my next steak much better.

{"title": "Short term Nvidia call holders- it's over. ", "selftext": "Seeing so many comments and threads of people asking if their $130 8/30 calls will still print followed by the equally delusional regards replying about how the market will magically gap up 12-15% by market open tomorrow, erase all losses today, and somehow pump enough for their 1dte far OTM options to be back in the green.\n\nNo, it's not going to happen. I'm by no means saying that this AI hype/Nvidia is done for, but large runups like these absolutely do need a cool-down period as a break. No stock can sustain Nvidia type growth for years on end. Nvidia has blown so many earnings reports out of the water, this time it essentially had to face the impossible task to beat the expectations to beat the sky high expectations of beating analyst predictions. On top of that 99% of the posts and comments I've seen on WSB were NVDA earnings extreme bulls, so that alone should've told you something. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying that this run is over and Nvidia will go to zero- I still think it's fundamentally a great company and has clear long-term growth potential. A LOT of people are comparing this to the dot-com bubble, but what people don't realize is that bubbles usually tend to eradicate the smaller BS companies that base their entire business on AI to piggyback the hype. Nvidia is comparable to Google, Meta, or Apple back then, and will likely be perfectly fine. \n\nWhat I think will mostly happen is that, again, soon DTE calls would go completely or near worthless in the next few weeks as Nvidia regresses and enters the backburners in terms of the overall rotation leading up to the election, and will continue its rally soon after. \n\nPositions: An assortment of strike 120, 122, 123, and 124 8/30 puts, 120/123 8/30 debit put spreads. Will soon add some longer DTE leaps. \n\nTL;DR: Your 8/30 or 9/6 NVDA calls are done for. There will be no magical 15% gap up tomorrow. LEAP holders are likely fine, and start buying shares if we dip further. \n\n", "id": "1f3p767", "created_utc": 1724891503.0, "score": 1055, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 393, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 9 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 165 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The problem is I that invidia bulls are all in and no money for buying this dip ü•π", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "On the up side, I have over 300 years of tax loss deductions.", "score": 761, "replies": [{"body": "You lost 900k?

Here's my thesis on why I'm shorting NVIDIA.\n\nAbout a year ago, the major tech companies were severely \"GPU poor.\" Getting a GPU instance on any cloud server was incredibly difficult. People, including the CTO of Hugging Face, even used the term \"GPU poor\" to describe the situation. However, things have changed.\n\nNVIDIA has fulfilled a significant number of orders, and now, securing a GPU instance on cloud servers is much easier.\n\nMost companies rely on Microsoft, Google, or AWS for their GPU needs. With the \"shovels\" (GPUs) already sold, the opportunity now lies with the \"gold diggers\" (companies using GPUs for innovation). At this point, I struggle to justify NVIDIA's $3.1 trillion market cap. The only way for them to continue standing out with such a high valuation is by innovating something even faster. But, in my opinion, that‚Äôs unlikely to happen at the pace the market expects.\n\nSo, that‚Äôs my thesis, and I'm ultra-short on NVIDIA now. I've been shorting it since the $100-$120 levels \\[before results\\], and I believe this position will pay off in the long run.", "id": "1f4ap98", "created_utc": 1724958514.0, "score": 302, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 460, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 year ago\n**Total Comments** | 3 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I play counterstrike with nvidia GPUs.
