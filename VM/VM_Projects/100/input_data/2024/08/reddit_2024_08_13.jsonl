{"title": "Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google", "selftext": "A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.\n\nThe move would be Washington‚Äôs first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.\n\nRegardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google‚Äôs web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.\n\nThe Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta‚Äôs Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government‚Äôs proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.\n\nAlphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.\n\nA Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.\n\nThe US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.\n\nJustice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google‚Äôs practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company‚Äôs search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google‚Äôs AI products in order to appear in search results.\n\n**Breakup**\n\nDivesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that‚Äôs been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.\n\nThose agreements also require that Google‚Äôs search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can‚Äôt be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.\n\nMehta‚Äôs decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn‚Äôt yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn‚Äôt be allowed ‚Äúto reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.‚Äù\n\nGoogle paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.\n\nMehta‚Äôs ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google‚Äôs total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year‚Äôs trial.\n\nIf the Justice Department doesn‚Äôt call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.\n\n**Data Access**\n\nAnother option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft‚Äôs Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta‚Äôs ruling found that Google‚Äôs contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data ‚Äì 16 times as much as its next closest competitor ‚Äî but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.\n\nEurope‚Äôs recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.\n\nRequiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department‚Äôs first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.\n\nIn the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.\n\n**AI Products**\n\nFor years, websites have allowed Google‚Äôs web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company‚Äôs search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.\n\nLast fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn‚Äôt apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with ‚ÄúAI Overviews,‚Äù narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.\n\nGoogle doesn‚Äôt allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.\n\nWhile AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature‚Äôs roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-13/doj-considers-seeking-google-goog-breakup-after-major-antitrust-win", "id": "1eriwi8", "created_utc": 1723582995.0, "score": 3301, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 598, "comments": [{"body": "When the DOJ Googles what to do in this situation, Google will inform the DOJ to let Google be.

Here‚Äôs what I picked up that might be less obvious:\n\n1. Mutual Utilization of Influence:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tTrump‚Äôs Utilization of Musk: Trump appears to leverage Musk‚Äôs popularity and technological prestige to bolster his own image as a forward-thinking leader. By associating with Musk, he subtly aligns himself with the cutting-edge innovation that Musk represents, despite their differing views on many issues. This is a strategic move to appeal to a younger, more tech-savvy audience that Trump might not naturally resonate with.\n\t‚Ä¢\tMusk‚Äôs Diplomatic Flexibility: On the other hand, Musk navigates this interaction with a sort of diplomatic ambivalence. He carefully balances agreeing with Trump on certain points to maintain a positive relationship while subtly distancing himself on others, particularly where Trump‚Äôs views might clash with Tesla‚Äôs brand or Musk‚Äôs long-term vision. This shows Musk‚Äôs ability to adapt his stance based on his audience, which is a strategic skill not immediately visible to all viewers.\n\n2. Subtext of Economic Self-Interest:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tRegulation and Innovation: While Musk discusses the impact of regulations on innovation, there‚Äôs a deeper layer here. He‚Äôs not just speaking to the viewers but also subtly lobbying. Musk‚Äôs comments can be seen as a calculated effort to influence public opinion, and possibly regulators, by framing regulation as a barrier to progress. This is particularly important for Tesla and SpaceX, where regulatory hurdles could impact growth.\n\t‚Ä¢\tTrump‚Äôs Economic Vision: Similarly, Trump‚Äôs economic rhetoric is less about concrete policy and more about reinforcing his brand as a champion of American business. His focus on deregulation, while appealing to business owners and investors, also serves to align himself with wealthy donors and powerful business interests, which is crucial for his political aspirations.\n\n3. Implicit Messaging on Power and Control:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tTrump‚Äôs Power Dynamics: Trump repeatedly emphasizes control, whether it‚Äôs over borders, other nations, or the media. This reflects his broader worldview that values centralized power and influence, something that aligns with his leadership style. However, it also subtly suggests a desire to maintain control over the narrative and public perception, a trait that might go unnoticed but is key to understanding his approach.\n\t‚Ä¢\tMusk‚Äôs Vision of Autonomy: Conversely, Musk‚Äôs discussions often revolve around autonomy‚Äîautonomous vehicles, sustainable energy independent of fossil fuels, and even humanity‚Äôs autonomy from Earth through space exploration. This focus on autonomy can be seen as a subtle critique of centralized power structures, including governmental ones, and it aligns with Musk‚Äôs broader philosophy of empowering individuals and humanity as a whole.\n\n4. The Dance of Ego and Humility:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tTrump‚Äôs Dominance: Throughout the interview, Trump‚Äôs ego is front and center, as he consistently positions himself as the ultimate problem solver. However, this also reveals an underlying insecurity‚Äîhis need to assert dominance in every topic reflects a desire to validate his status and power.\n\t‚Ä¢\tMusk‚Äôs Tactical Humility: Musk, while confident, often downplays his achievements or deflects praise, which is not just humility but a tactical move. By doing so, he subtly contrasts himself with Trump‚Äôs brashness, appealing to those who value humility in leadership while still maintaining his stature as a visionary.\n\n5. Cognitive Dissonance and Appeal to Emotion:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tContradictory Statements: Both figures make statements that, upon closer inspection, are somewhat contradictory. For instance, Trump advocates for deregulation but also wants strict control over certain aspects of society, which creates cognitive dissonance. Musk, too, occasionally suggests broad solutions to complex problems that don‚Äôt fully align with his usually detailed, engineering-focused mindset.\n\t‚Ä¢\tEmotional Appeal: These contradictions are part of a broader strategy to appeal to emotion rather than logic. By making emotionally charged statements, they can resonate with a wider audience, even if the statements don‚Äôt fully make sense. This is a subtle but powerful technique that taps into the way many people prioritize feelings over facts.\n\nInsight Summary:\n\nThe interview is a carefully choreographed exchange where both Trump and Musk are playing to their strengths while subtly maneuvering around potential pitfalls. The most insightful takeaway might be the recognition that both figures are not just speaking to each other or the interviewer‚Äîthey are speaking to multiple audiences simultaneously, including their followers, critics, regulators, and potential allies. Their words are layered with strategic intent, much of which is geared toward maintaining or enhancing their influence in different spheres. This kind of multi-dimensional communication is something that might not be immediately apparent to most viewers but is crucial to understanding the deeper dynamics at play.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting take.
