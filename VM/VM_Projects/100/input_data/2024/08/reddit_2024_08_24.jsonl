You can't really do that if you take your own car and put a stolen plate on it. They'll just go \"Hmm that car with the stolen plate on it matches the car that you own...\" You got to make it appear you didn't go anywhere.

Because if one of them became potentially unsafe, they wouldn’t be stranding astronauts in space. NASA requires a well-quantified risk for manned spaceflight and they could not satisfy their protocol because of the level of root cause analysis needed is impossible to do from orbit. \n\nThis doesn’t mean that Boeing is going to crumble, really, nor does it mean that Starliner is cooked. \n\n*However*, if the unmanned return flight goes poorly… *then* Starliner might be cooked. NASA has indicated they expect it will go fine, but they can’t hit the 99.7% certainty necessary to qualify it for manned spaceflight without knowing why those thrusters failed.

{"title": "Recession Predictor: Unemployment rate and Interest Rate Intersection ", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/ohv3vba6ankd1.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fa8572994bdeba8741648c4ef36ae4de4603a04\n\nTo start, I am not a Doomer and I have money in the market.\n\n  \nI was looking at the unemployment rate recently just out of curiosity and saw a correlation between a recession and whenever there was a rise, which makes sense of course. What struck me though is when I started adding other variables and eventually ended up with the combination you see now. Since the 70s, the intersection of falling interest rates and increasing unemployment have occurred around 6 months before or 6 months after each recession. \n\nIn 2023-2024 Slowly and without garnering much attention, unemployment has risen .9% over the last 7 months or so. While this doesn't sound like a lot, if it continues, there will be a major problem. This is because in the last 70 years, a 1% increase of unemployment in a time frame less than 1 year a recession followed. While this wouldn't have been case closed, with the addition of the interest rate there is an even more clear trend. \n\nInterest rates have a very clear relationship with unemployment that when looked at more carefully show a bleak picture. What is also very interesting is the timing of everything is eerily similar to the 2008 interest rate and unemployment numbers. In September of 2007, interest rates were initially lowered, which is almost identical timing as today. At the same time unemployment started to creep up from 4.4% to 4.7% which is where they eventually intersected, and the great recession was triggered. \n\nInterest rates have held steady at 5.33% over the last 9 months or so, but with the announcement from the fed and Powell that they are going to start lowering the interest rates, the trend that has occurred over 6 times (excluding covid) is starting to play out. \n\nUnemployment is currently at 4.3% and all it needs to do is increase another .5% while interest rate are cut down to 4.8% which would only take around two .25 cuts to intersect with each other. \n\nThere is NO example in the last 55 years in which when unemployment rate increases to interest with falling interest rates that a recession was not triggered. I also suspect with the revision of 818k jobs creation that there are more false numbers being reported. I think there is a chance that the entire economy is being propped up on false numbers until after the election. \n\n  \nSo with high regards, do with this is information as you will, I'm almost certified Illiterate so there are bound to be mistakes and typos but I personally found this interesting and wanted to share.

{"title": " ASTS DD and yolo", "selftext": "I missed the massive rally in ASTS that started on May 15th, so I did a lot of research and patiently waited for the right moment to enter my trade. I currently hold about $75K worth of put options.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/af5bekx5mnkd1.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6810c2952b06106505550bb0a6101c2560527b2\n\nHere’s why I think ASTS is headed for a big drop:\n\n**1.The Surge Itself is the Biggest Bearish Signal**\n\nASTS has skyrocketed nearly 2000% in just three months. For comparison, NVDA took three years to climb 2000% from its COVID-19 low, and NVDA actually had strong revenue and profit growth backing it up. ASTS, on the other hand, is a company that might not even be profitable until 2028. There's no comparison in terms of valuation or future potential.\n\nA rapid stock price increase often leads to profit-taking pressure and can even cause unforeseen operational issues for the company. According to their Q2 report, \"The increase in fair value of warrant liabilities resulted in a loss of $66.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, largely due to a significant increase in our share price.\" The stock price is now three times higher than it was on June 30th. If it doesn’t drop, I expect warrants to cause an even bigger loss in Q3, possibly between $200 to $300 million. ASTS only has $287.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, so this would be a heavy blow to their balance sheet.\n\n**2.Launching Satellites Requires Continuous Funding**\n\nThey’re launching five satellites in September, and they’ll need to launch 25 or 95 more after that. \n\nAccording to their Q2 report,\"We currently estimate we will need to raise approximately $275.0 million to $325.0 million to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures necessary to design, assemble and launch 20 Block 2 BB satellites and operate a constellation of 25 BB satellites.\" \"We plan to achieve service in the selected, targeted geographical areas with the launch and operation of 25 BB satellites and achieve substantial service in all targeted geographical areas to meet our long-term business goals with the launch and operation of approximately 95 BB satellites.\"\n\nTheir 2024 operating funds are in place, but I believe they’ll need to raise $275 to $325 million in 2025, and if they want to scale up to 95 satellites in 2026, they’ll need at least $1.1 to $1.3 billion. This means they’ll need to issue new stock or debt. Based on past actions, they’ll likely choose convertible debt. They’ve already issued about $310.8 million in convertible debt, and using the $5.75 conversion price from the January 2024 issuance of $110 million in convertible notes (I couldn’t find records for all their convertible debt), that converts to about 53 million shares—roughly one-third of the current shares outstanding.\n\nMy view is that the existing convertible debt will inevitably convert to stock, diluting shareholder equity, and they’ll need to keep issuing debt or stock to raise funds. The debt or stock issued will turn into company assets, and for a telecom-like company, the P/B ratio is usually below 2. For instance, VZ’s P/B ratio is 1.8, and AT&T’s is 1.34. However, ASTS has a staggering P/B ratio of 33.66. This means either the current price is way too high, or they’ll need to issue a lot of new shares in the future, either of which would drive the stock price down.\n\n**3.History Shows a Sharp Pullback is Inevitable After a Rapid Surge**\n\nI believe ASTS has long-term potential and could reach $50 or $100, but that might not happen until 2028 or 2030, not now. We’re currently in the phase where the stock has surged 2000%, and both volume and price are starting to decline. Based on ASTS’s past behavior, sharp rallies are typically followed by 50%-90% corrections. For example, in early February 2021, the stock doubled, hitting a high of $25.370 on February 10th, only to drop to $11.21 by March 4th. Two months later, on April 19, 2021, it was down to $7.12.\n\nAgain, in late July 2022, the stock doubled, peaking at $14.270 on August 17th, but by the end of September, it was down to $7, and by December, it was only $3.6.\n\nSo, I expect a reasonable pullback of 50%-75% over the next one to three months, with a more extreme drop of 80%-90% possible in the worst-case scenario.", "id": "1f0c0te", "created_utc": 1724523896.0, "score": 327, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 512, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 1 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This honestly makes me more confident for my 8k shares and 25 leaps.

Running pretty conservative estimates on revenue per subscriber and total subscribers, if they are successful their market cap will 10X again.  Now of course \"if they are successful\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting there but for the purposes of Puts it doesn't really matter.  Even a put option with an 18 month horizon is pretty short term for ASTS so the share price will be more dictated by them being perceived to still be on track.  \n\n3.
