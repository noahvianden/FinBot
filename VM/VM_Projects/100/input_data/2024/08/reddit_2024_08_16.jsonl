So whatever we have YTD is like the growth of 3 years, and when you think of that way, it is terrible.\n\nI quickly ran the CAGR rate from 2013 to 2024\n\n| Year | CAGR Year to 2024 | CAGR Year to 2024 (Net Inflation) |\n\n|------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n\n| 2013 | 10.50%         | 7.56%                         |\n\n| 2014 | 10.41%         | 7.26%                         |\n\n| 2015 | 11.72%         | 8.27%                         |\n\n| 2016 | 12.00%         | 8.38%                         |\n\n| 2017 | 10.98%         | 7.15%                         |\n\n| 2018 | 14.14%         | 9.94%                         |\n\n| 2019 | 11.40%         | 6.89%                         |\n\n| 2020 | 10.22%         | 4.98%                         |\n\n| 2021 | 5.16%          | 0.43%                         |\n\n| 2022 | 20.15%         | 16.96%                        |\n\nAs you can see if you did 3 years, it would show your average rate of return as 5.16% But if you did 5, it would be 11.40%, but these are such small samples.\n\nI have added the CAGR above as well, the 2nd number is the CAGR after inflation. As you can see if you look at it after inflation that 5 year return that looked great at 11.4% all of a sudden becomes 6.89%, which are below historical averages of the last 30 years which is around 7.78%\n\nInvesting is a long term thing, if you easily affected by the short term fluctuations, you will not be successful in this.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Run it over the past 100 years...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Umm then you get the same thing that the last 100 years is not over valued...", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Try to beat S&P 500 ten years in a row!

Took a while to find, but it's [here.](https://www.personalfinanceclub.com/how-to-perfectly-time-the-market/)\n\nI also think it important to have this knowledge because people who do wait for crashes inevitably panic, afraid to catch a falling knife.

Copenhagen-type interpretations hold that quantum descriptions are objective, in that they are independent of physicists' personal beliefs and other arbitrary mental factors.[5]: 85–90 \n\nOver the years, there have been many objections to aspects of Copenhagen-type interpretations, including the discontinuous and stochastic nature of the \"observation\" or \"measurement\" process, the difficulty of defining what might count as a measuring device, and the seeming reliance upon classical physics in describing such devices.

Nothing is quite that refined and ultra-simplified to a Youtube shorts level on Youtube atm.  But a few videos come very close.\n\nThe first one you should watch is this [https://youtu.be/kC28MuQPyu8](https://youtu.be/kC28MuQPyu8)  This video is the simplest it is possible to boil down the core technical ideas involved in options trading contracts (2 people, trading 1 contract for call options.  Basically \"Hey lady, I want to bet you that Yelp is going up this week!  I'm going to be rich!\" and her laughing and being like \"Nah, Yelp is not going anywhere.  Hand me some money upfront and we can arrange a fair bet that will make you money if they actually rise a lot this week\").  You and another person are involved in a contract for the rights to buy a share, and are each taking a bet on if that company is going up or down.  In the first example he gives: you pay 80 cents for the Yelp option, so you need Yelp to go up.  If it does, you instantly get the right to buy the stock for cheaper than it is worth and flip it for profit.  For just .80 cents you got to bet heavily on Yelp without having to buy those expensive shares!  Within 2 minutes and 30 seconds all that has been explained in that particular video, and shown with the Robinhood interface by the 3:30 mark (though do not get Robinhood.  Pick any real broker).\n\nDon't worry, you can't screw up.  Why?  Sometimes when you do, you still make money since your bet was actually dumb.  And the market went the other way.\n\nJust remember the two golden rules: do not bet something you cannot afford to lose (especially your house or your student loan money, as losing those two destroy you for life) and second: if your wins are good enough to screenshot and excitedly talk about with friends then SELL.  Take the profits and run.  You can bet more tomorrow on something else.  Time is often your enemy with options; these are not stocks.  Things can expire, stuff can change in aftermarket, or the dreaded doom clock of Theta can steal your money: [https://youtu.be/6RiHheBV9eM](https://youtu.be/6RiHheBV9eM)\n\nWhen you are new, generally you flip options like hot potatoes as soon as you win or lose what you were hoping for.  And find someone to ask if something is going weird in your bets that you don't understand.  Lastly: sometimes you have not lost as much money as the screen makes it look like, so don't ever kill yourself over a stupid option.  That shit is dumb, but happens all the time.\n\nRemember: money is serious, but it is not real.  Life however is.  \n\np.s. All these rules have exceptions for experienced traders.

And it was the act of splitting it up that make Rockefeller the richest man in history.\n\n>Moat building\", walled gardens, captive demand, non-competes, industry collusion and patent trolls continue to accelerate as reinforced and incentivised anti-competitive behaviors that squeeze out small independent innovators.\n\nAgreed.  I just contend that all things like that only have meaningful teeth with government support and government barriers to entry.\n\n>Easy to start and maintain a business?\n\nNo, that's my point.  Right now it isn't easy to start a business in most sectors, which gives established businesses a huge advantage.  The more regulations there are, the harder it is to start a business.  We make it easier to start a business by paring back the government.  This allows the market to begin equilibrating in the right direction.\n\n>Econ 101 from the Classical, Keynesian or one of their offshoot schools? Each have faulty assumptions about market rationality and information parity. The market can stay irrational and status quo forces in big government AND big business can meddle with incentives longer than many can become financially independent during their workable lifespan.\n\nMostly agree.  Though again, I would argue the entity that can tell you you have to run your business and spend your money in a certain way or risk arrest is the more serious threat.\n\n>Progressive Era (1901-1929) is not the same as the modern political concept of \"progressive\" ie moderate leftist.\n\nYeah, it was a pun.\n\n>Rapid growth is almost always highly concentrated to a rising elite.\n\nWhile that's true, conditions improved for everyone in a dramatic way.  Before the industrialization of that time, 98% of every man, woman, and child worked on farms all day to stay alive.  Within a short period of the Guilded Age, we were able to establish the 40-hour work week and even ban child labor.  That was a dramatic improvement over historical norms.\n\n>don't believe the fictitious entity we all call \"The Market\" can alone restrain a malicious actor with global Too Big To Fail status and societal dominance ambitions.\n\nBut Too Big To Fail is literally a government invention.  Without the government, there is no such thing.  Every business would be at risk of failing, no matter how large.  The only thing that can save a TBTF monopoly is our tax dollars.  Absolutely no business should be saved from failing when it acts irresponsibly.  \n\n>Representative democracy paired with free market capitalism is a proven combo approach to stable and broad prosperity, but democracy must stay in the pilot's seat to protect individuals, while capitalism rides co-pilot.\n\nI can see the value for sure, but I fear the modern system is proof that such a combination will inevitably equilibrate toward central planning and government overspending.  I would love a representative democracy with severe limitations, primarily focused on national defense and court arbitration.  But what we have now is a monster of oligarchical control over our entire lives masquerading as a democracy.\n\n>We agree that the status quo is not sustainable.
