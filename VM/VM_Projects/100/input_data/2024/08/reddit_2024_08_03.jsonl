We're not going from 2.8% in July to -X% anytime soon, as regards in reddit forums seem to think.\n\nThere's a difference between a slowing economy and a recession. A slowing economy is exactly what the fed wanted to engineer, and is all we're seeing here. Just because the market is pricing in some small % chance of a recession does not mean it will happen, or is imminent.\n\nThe VIX is basically already at it's non-black-swan typical high. Look at the 12 year chart on the VIX and tell me how often it stays above 30 (it's intraday high on Friday) for more than a week or so. Covid, a black swan event, is really the only exception, and it sustained 30ish a bit during the sharpest QT cycle we've seen since the 1980s back in 2022. We're not in a black swan event, and we're not in a QT cycle. When the VIX drops, there will be a squeeze.\n\nUnlike the large correction we saw in 2022, Credit Default Swaps are barely moving. Hell, they're lower than they were in April. Smart money is not concerned with this current aberration.\n\nThe S&P, on average, sees three 5% and one 10% correction per year. The 10% correction is obviously inclusive of one of the 5% corrections. We saw one 5% correction in April, and a second one in August here. This correction is now just a smidgen bigger than the April event, another 'end time' event according to redditors, that saw a ferocious recovery....when? When the VIX crushed back down.\n\nOpinion:\n\nIf Thursday's payroll report comes in stronger than expected, or even in line, we'll see a huge squeeze in the market, just like last Wednesday. Bulls flipped to bears and calls flipped to puts so drastically, yet frivolously, that the slightest hint of good news will cause a squeeze.....puts are just a compressed spring right now. AMD having decent earnings last Wednesday caused NVDA to surge, and the entire market squeezed as a result given it's massive weight in indices. That's how slight the good news has to be for this correction to be old news.\n\nIf Thursday's payroll report comes in soft, we could see another leg down towards....what? A completely natural 10% correction.\n\nThere's absolutely no current impetus for a larger pullback than 10%. We're not going into a QT cycle, GDP is healthy, there's no black swan events on the horizon.

However, I only raised that issue to highlight that apple as a company could still be in a position to do so. 3rd parties not withstanding.\n\nThe main issue is that tsmc ownership comes with a lot of \"potential\" political baggage, not so much with apple, who just makes money everywhere within whatever system is in place.

In all honesty, from a purely neutral perspective, the US commerce department methodology is not much different from whatever perceived threat China poses to TSMC. Both sides wanted the secrets, and one side has now got them. \n\nSo that means there are viable alternatives already just that the situation hasn't escalated enough where it's needed for the party to deploy and create domestic infrastructure to take advantage of such technology.

That's definitely a reality most companies would need to deal with when it wants to reinvent itself. \n\nHowever, these issues are usually irrelevant for corporations on the scale of Intel. I believe companies like Intel  can opt to develop the two streams separately as two different companies.

After all the r&d expertise needed for designing your own chips is vastly different from the r&d on the manufacturing process.

ARM develops using the open RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) process.  \n\nWhile CISC is absolutely critical to any high end computing, it is also very inefficient thanks to the number of instructions that are needed to process which aren't important for most low level tasks.  This is where RISC shines.  The reduced instructions means that many tasks can be handled in a more efficient manner. \n\nOne of those tasks that can be delegated to a reduced instruction set environment is machine learning.  That's where Nvidia comes in.  They wanted to buy up the dominant player in the reduced instruction set environment which is ARM since it was the easiest way to completely dominate the RISC market.  \n\nHowever unlike x86, which requires a license, anyone can develop a RISC architecture on their own.  They don't \"have\" to use ARM, they chose to use ARM because it's simpler than developing their own instruction set, well established, and proven efficient. \n\nHonestly there are a lot of reasons why nvidia wanted to buy ARM, but in the end they can just develop their own RISC based processor if they truly wanted to completely bypassing ARM, but they would rather not devote the resources to getting that done.  Plus there was the added benefit of completely dominating a ARM saturated RISC market which was pretty much the actual goal.\n\nThere's actually a lot more, to this, but I'd imagine most people who don't already know about this stuff have had their eyes glaze over at this point.

GPUs can perform parallel processing, which is crucial for training deep learning models. This capability allows for faster computation of the large datasets typically used in AI.\n   - **CUDA Platform**: Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model that leverages the power of GPUs for general-purpose computing. CUDA has become a standard in the AI and machine learning community, making it easier for developers to optimize their software for Nvidia hardware.\n\n**Software Ecosystem**:\n   - **Libraries and Frameworks**: Nvidia has invested heavily in developing a robust software ecosystem, including libraries and frameworks like cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) and TensorRT (a high-performance deep learning inference library). These tools make it easier to develop, optimize, and deploy AI models on Nvidia hardware.\n   - **Nvidia AI Enterprise**: Nvidia offers a suite of AI tools and frameworks designed for enterprises, providing comprehensive support for AI development and deployment. This suite includes pre-trained models, development tools, and deployment solutions.\n\n **Market Focus and Strategy**:\n   - **AI and Data Center Focus**: Nvidia has strategically focused on AI, data centers, and high-performance computing markets, while Intel has traditionally been more centered around general-purpose computing and personal computers. This strategic focus has allowed Nvidia to tailor its products and innovations specifically for AI applications.\n **Acquisitions and Partnerships**: Nvidia has made strategic acquisitions and partnerships to strengthen its AI capabilities. For example, Nvidia acquired Mellanox, a company specializing in high-performance networking, to improve data center performance and connectivity, which are crucial for AI workloads.\n\n**Performance Benchmarks**:\n   - **AI Performance**: Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs consistently outperform Intel‚Äôs CPUs in benchmarks for AI and machine learning tasks. This performance advantage makes Nvidia the preferred choice for researchers and enterprises working on AI projects.\n\n**Adoption and Community**:\n   - **Industry Adoption**: Nvidia GPUs are widely adopted across industries for AI applications, from autonomous vehicles to healthcare. This widespread adoption reinforces Nvidia‚Äôs position in the AI market and creates a strong community of developers and researchers contributing to the ecosystem.\n   - **Research and Development**: Nvidia‚Äôs commitment to research and development in AI has resulted in continuous improvements in their hardware and software, keeping them at the cutting edge of AI technology.\n\n**Why Intel is Lagging**:\n\nIntel‚Äôs CPUs are designed for general-purpose computing and are not as efficient as GPUs for parallel processing tasks inherent in AI and deep learning.\n\nIntel entered the AI-specific hardware market later than Nvidia. While Intel has made efforts to catch up, including acquiring companies like Nervana and Habana Labs to develop AI accelerators, it still lags behind Nvidia‚Äôs well-established presence and ecosystem.\n\nIntel‚Äôs software ecosystem for AI is not as mature or widely adopted as Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA platform and associated libraries. This makes it less attractive for developers who are looking for comprehensive and optimized solutions for AI development.\n\nIntel‚Äôs broader focus on CPUs, data center solutions, and other areas may have diluted its efforts in the AI-specific hardware market. Nvidia‚Äôs more focused approach has allowed it to gain a stronger foothold in AI.\n\nNvidia‚Äôs specialized hardware, robust software ecosystem, strategic market focus, performance advantages, and widespread industry adoption have positioned it ahead of Intel in the AI market.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

What is Nvidias dividend? Why even bring this up? Cancelling the dividend was long overdue. Growth companies rarely pay dividends. Workforce cuts? Microsoft have done two in as many years. All of tech is laying off. This isn't unique to Intel. So... Also not relevant. \n\nAs far as \"broken silicon\". That's disingenuous. One vendor just stated that they have more AMD RMA's than Intel. AMD had a reported 11% RMA on their flagship GPU 7900xt just last year. AMD just delayed a launch for quality issues. AMD in the same article highlighting Intel issues, were shown having 1% CPU RMA's from the same vendor. \n\nLet's look at some facts. Intel is well on the way to five nodes in four years. I believe I read that they are on track to sell 50m Core Ultra PC's this year. Meteor Lake was reviewed as better than any current AMD offering by Hardware Canucks. On an inferior node, 14th gen Intel is still faster than current gen AMD in most benchmarks. \n\nUpcoming products. \n\nGranite Rapids on Intel3... Let's wait and see, but they are getting core parity with competition. They announced mass production of this node. This could turn the corner in traditional server sales and stop the bleeding.\n\nLunar Lake... This just looks better than Strix and better than X. I know we are only going by leaks, but it looks very good for 8 cores and lion cove looks strong. I've said this before, but I would use this chip as my desktop if they made a 30W drop in desktop variant.\n\nArrow Lake... I don't know if there are enough leaks yet to determine, but we know the lion cove cores are strong from the 30w Lunar Lake leaks. \n\nGaudi3 is slated to ramp production in the 2nd half. It does look good in published benchmarks. I haven't heard anyone denying this. I think this is a wait and see because on paper it looks great.\n\nFinally, Battlemage and Celestial are exciting products. We don't know much about these but from Lunar Lake leaks, Battlemage looks impressive.\n\nNow forget all that and look at manufacturing...\n\nFive nodes in four years is on track from what we have been told. 18A may or may not be industry leading, but it appears it will definitely be industry competitive right out the gate. Ferveros and back side power delivery on the packaging side are both industry leading technologies. Again, who is saying otherwise?\n\nFinancially...\n\nFinancially, Q2 was bad, because of margins. But the quarter was flat from Q2,2023 revenue. This isn't a lot different from AMD. In fact AMD Q2, 2022 was better than their Q2, 2024, despite AI, with Client, Gaming, and Embedded all contracting significantly. But AMD is carrying a 150+ P/E. \n\nWith the product lineup, new fabs, and the financial right sizing I'm not just holding. I am buying.

In this case you are paying $2/share in premium when you purchase the option.

This was done by buying otm puts or selling covered calls using 100 of your shares as collateral if you are bearish or vice versa if bullish. if you own the equity already then its usually a smarter play to sell calls deep otm and slowly accumulate cash via premium. When a option expires out of the money then the seller of the option keeps all of the sales price of the option(which is called premium).

{"title": "The Bulls Are Delusional", "selftext": "The bulls are delusional. The fundamental reason why the market has been mostly going straight up in the past year is because the economy, in aggregate, has been doing very well. Data just came out suggesting that this might be coming to an end. This is not just a fart in the wind or a drop because Powell said something with the wrong tone of voice. It's a fundamental catalyst that will actually impact things. If the data is wrong, then sure, we might go up more. However, people that actually manage money will not ignore deteriorating economic data. They will sell stocks in order to try to time the market. If you're dollar cost averaging, then good for you, but the majority of people here (and on wallstreet) are trying to time the markets to speed up the process of making money. And you don't make money by buying a 5% dip after a 40% rally if you believe that a recession might be coming. \n\nPeople have been leveraging like crazy and are going through the 5 stages of grief now that the market went against them. Every time that someone complains that they are down on Nvidia, the most upvoted comment under it is \"don't worry bro, just hold because it will be at $180 in 6 months\". Anecdotally, it seems like everyone's uncle and inheritor of money is all-in on AI. For it to go even higher, someone has to be buying at higher prices. It also has to start making some serious money for the companies who are spending tens of billion of dollars on it. So far, Microsoft and Google are struggling to monetize it relative to the expectations that were being priced in. \n\nWe haven't had a recession since 2008. Covid doesn't count. The fed raised rates and the economy didn't give two shits. If the fed lowers rates, why is the economy magically expected to get better immediately? These are serious concerns and if you think buying the \"dip\" right now is a no-brainer move, then you have no brain. We were at all-time highs 3 weeks ago and deteriorating economic data doesn't flip overnight. Neither do the concerns about it. These last couple of weeks have laid out very important information about what the market as a whole cares about and will rally or crash because of. Lots of people seem to be ignoring this and sticking their head in the sand. Good luck.\n\nEdit: From the hundred or so comments that disagree with me, here's a summary of the sentiment. People think that a deteriorating economy is bullish because the fed will cut rates faster. They think the fed and government will pump money into the economy to keep it going and that's bullish. While I don't disagree with that, I also think that this is a poor argument to buy the dip at nearly an all-time high, especially if you're hoping for quick profits. Stocks will eventually go up simply because the value of the dollar will continue to get inflated away, but you can spend years holding the bag and being in the red. People will try to avoid this and sell their stocks to buy at a lower price later on. If a recession actually occurs, there will be lots of selling soon. Also, I'm not necessarily predicting a recession, I'm making a simple observation of the data and how the market has been reacting to it. For a while, the market has been ignoring bad data and rallying on rate-cut optimism. It is now doing the opposite.

It is a lagging indicator (it usually peaks after a recession ends).\n2. It exhibits both momentum and a characteristic non-linearity (once it gets going it goes slowly at first and then goes faster and faster and is very hard to/basically never stops). \\[Hence why things like the Sahm rule measure second order changes irrespective of the absolute value - in fact every time the rule has triggered the UNRATE has further increased by a minimum of something like 2% in the following period of time\\]\n\nAs a result, the historical precedence is that by the time it becomes obvious, it is already too late. Like people are arguing about the nuances of the hurricane, immigration, labour force productivity increasing yada yada. The entire point is that by the time we can obviously tell who was right, it is too late if the resolution is to the downside. Add on top of that that monetary policy classically acts with a 'long and variable lag' (in the magnitude of months).
