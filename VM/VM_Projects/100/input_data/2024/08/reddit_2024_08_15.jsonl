Aren’t they a decade away at least", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I assume that the decade horizon that you are mentioning is referring to the general quantum computing industry and to the broad belief  that it'll take another 10 years at least to have quantum computers that are superior by all means to super classical computers. \n\nI think that it is really a debate on what type of technology each quantum company is pursuing. So far the biggest players have been developing superconducting technology, which however are difficult to scale up due to their huge need for refrigerating systems (i.e. the hardware needed to cool down the circuits is bigger than the quantum computer). This is only one challenge, there are definitely several milestones to be reached before we get to quantum supremacy. That's why until today it's broadly assumed that it will take us another 10 years before we get to commercially useful quantum computers. \n\nHowever, the industry has moved quickly over the recent years and different approaches have been explored. Moreover, with the advancing of AI and their ever growing energy needs, there is a reason to develop quantum systems that while not being necessarily superior to super classical computers, will be able to perform some tasks faster and with less energy consumption.\n\nSo this point alone is shortening the timeline for commercially useful quantum solutions. \n\nSpeaking specifically of IONQ, they are a pure quantum player, not like IBM or GOOG, and their approach is based on trapped ions, which have the advantage of working at room temperature. The size of their systems fits regular data centers, which is another direction that the company is taking. The development of solutions that will integrate with classical computers to provide hybrid computing systems.\n\nIn terms of the company's development, at the time of the inception, they published a roadmap according to which they were estimating 2026 the year when they would have been able to offer a quantum computer superior to any other super classical computer. Now, take this with a pound of salt of course, but if you check the roadmap, you'll see that they met all the tech and financial milestones. In addition to this, they are developing commercial solutions beyond the production of hardware. They are working on quantum algorithms that will provide customers with commercial value. In the latest earning call they announced that they are working on a new quantum application and that they will present it at the next earning call. IONQ is already attracting the interest of both government and commercial customers, forming a base for future revenues. \n\nThe industry is really moving fast. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has just approved new standards for post-quantum cryptography. There is already the need to develop quantum solutions for practical purposes, national security in this specific case. It is really a moment when there are many moving parts and we are getting close to the day where all these pieces will come in place and revenues will start growing exponentially.\n\nLastly, if you look at the stock action of this year, the price has been on a downward trend, which isn't nice for anyone that has already invested in the company, but it is forming a base around the 7 level. If you start following the company and get your own idea of what they do, this can be a good entry point.

To me, that's a good indicator that calls on NVDA coupled with puts on AMD is a good bet. AMD doesn't have EBITDA or revenue growth that compare to NVDA, they don't have the ability to compile pseudo-CUDA code, they don't have the extensive proprietary optimization libraries, their current GPUs have barely caught up regarding some specs and if Blackwell gets off the ground they will be left behind. They have always been number 2 and spent too long focusing on beating Intel on CPUs, which were state-of-the-art technology in the early nineties, but now a component that talks to GPUs. AMD has the same TSM supply constraints as NVDA, with less pull. They have consistently lagged NVDA in price appreciation. Finally, their PE is really, really high, and they have to sustain growth for much longer before they get a PE in the range of 20 before diminishing returns or reduced demand curb growth and they have to offer a dividend and aggressive buybacks to keep investors interested. I'm not knocking Lisa Su, because she's brilliant, but she doesn't have the resources to threaten Nvidia, which can always curb its huge margins if it faces competition for high-end chips.  \n\nI think people get trapped in the fallacy that the number 2 stock in an industry that didn't go up as much recently is somehow a better buy and this is rarely true without much better growth or earnings per share in the here-and-now. Back in the day, people adopted this fallacy and bought search engines stocks that weren't google, or smartphone stocks that weren't apple. Motley Fool was pumping companies like RIM, Nokia, HTC, LG and Motorola in don't buy apple clickbait in the early 2000s.\n\nI think the big winner in Intel's implosion is QCOM. I opened my first position in the week of the carry-trade collapse. It has a reasonable PE and dividend right now and QCOM is also one of the four companies that has serious pull with TSM for advanced chips. However, this position is small compared to my NVDA and TSM positions and is based on the chance that QCOM can advance snapdragon LLM-oriented GPUs, especially for edge devices, but maybe cloud later, before Apple succeeds in dropping them, which they have been unsuccessfully trying to do for a long time. In the meantime, there is a dividend, which will probably go up in the next five years. \n\nA great company can have a terrible valuation relative to its competitors, and that describes AMD.

Any recommendations of videos or books on how to learn to invest?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Of course! Many investors look at the free cash flow of a comapny. The amount of cash generated is not equal to the profit of a company. For example a company writing off an amount that they had invested in a building will have that amount deducted from their profits due to the depreciation. But depreciation isn't a cash out flow. But free cash flow alone isn't enough. Would you rather own a company that generates 100$ free cash flow or a company that generates 500$ free cash flow. With this information you'll of course say the company of 500$. But what if the company that generates 100$ of free cash flow costs you 200$ to buy while the company that generates 500$ free cash flow costs you 5000$ to buy. That's why we look at the price to free cash flow of a company. Let's look at examples.\n\nFor example I bought Microsoft in January this year. It was trading at 30 times the free cash flow. (The free cash flow is the first thing I look at within a company). The overall rule is that you want to make 10% of your investment annually. So you would like to see a company at 10 times the price to free cash flow. Now finding a great company, that is growing, that is priced at 10 times free cash flow is hard. You will not find many. So it's good to understand what is the median price to free cash flow of the company you are interested in. I like to use the site gurufocus. If you type in google price to free cash flow Microsoft gurufocus. You will have an overview of the price to free cash flow of Microsoft and how it compares to the industry. You will see that the current price to free cash flow is 42. The median is 27. And the price to free cash flow of Microsoft is ranked worse than 74% of all Software companies. Now this may seem bad. But how many software companies have the resources, the diversification of income and the name Microsoft has. So always keep that in mind. Secondly we see the Median price at 27. It is now 42. It seems the price should go down by half. But if we scroll down a bit within the site until we see the first 'Microsoft annual data' we see that the price to free cash flow was 35 in 2020, 37 in 2021, 30 in 2022 (this was during a stock market drop) and 45 in 2023. What does this tell us? It tells us Microsoft will most likely not see a 20 times price to free cash flow unless something really bad happens within the company. It's more likely to hang around 35 to 40. But this is IF, Microsoft keeps going and innovating as it does.\n\nNow what am I trying to say with this story here? Some investors will tell you Microsoft is a buy and hold type of stock. And I would agree with them. I'm comfortable holding Microsoft. Even at a bit elevated prices. BUT. I still sold Microsoft in June. As it was hitting the 40 times price to free cash flow. You have to ask yourself. How much growth do we see in Microsoft from here. Because if there is not much room for the multiple to grow. All the stock growth will come from increased amount of free cash flow Microsoft is able to generate.\n\nIf we take DHL for example. They have a median price to free cash flow of 17. They are currently trading at a price to free cash flow of 7. Now we have to ask ourselves why is this. So the second thing I look at within a company, is how much net debt are they holding. So I look at their total debt and their total cash on hand. If the company can pay off their debt within a reasonable amount of years based on the amount of cash flow they generate annually I'm happy. Then I look at if they are buying back their own stock (this is not a must, just a huge plus in my eyes). A company that buys back their own stock is great because the stock price goes up. But it's also great because these stocks will not be publicly traded anymore. They're just held by the company and that will most likely stay like that if you are investing in strong companies. Meaning stocks are more scarce and also meaning they generate more cash flow per share as the amount of shares have decreased. So back to the example of DHL. DHL is currently trading at 7 times price to free cash flow while the median is 17. Now this seems like the deal of your life. But it doesn't always have to be the case. Usually there is a reason for it. And the reasons are Germany being in a recession and lowered revenue guidance by DHL. Now let's say DHL doesn't grow 10% like previous years but they grow 5%. You can expect a stock growth percentage of 5%. But lets say the fears of lower revenue for DHL start to dwindle. And the price to free cash flow goes back to 14 from 7 for DHL. This is an increase of 100%. Your stock is now up an extra 100% just because market sentiment has shifted. I like to keep a safety margin within the price to free cash flow of companies that I understand. So for Microsoft I bought at 30 price to free cash flow. And I found 40 price to free cash flow too expensive. So I sold. I like DHL as a company and see them gaining in stock price. But I won't hold indefinitely. They have about a price to free cash flow of 12 in the past four years. So I will look to sell if DHL hits a price to free cash flow of 10.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Amazing explanation, learned a lot, thank you.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ask ChatGPT for help", "score": -2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I bought amd at $8.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Had you bought enough.. unless your greed is limitless you would have no need to tell us.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I did not, I bought 100 shares lol", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Tl;Dr:\n\nOP bought AMD at ATH and now wants everyone else to buy it too.\n\nAMD is a really good company but not great stock at more than 120.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "All this sub does is talk about tech stocks.", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "What else is gaining like tech?

Both wage and margin spirals are bad, and I honestly think some companies overdid it on the \"grabflation\" or simply making service worse.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "fair points. One major factor in economic growth is people. If your population shrinks its really hard to have real economic growth. You can hide that with inflation, but at the end of the day people and what they do is really the economy. \n\nEurope, Japan, China, and the US are all looking at serious demographic issues to various degrees. It boggles my mind that people are against immigration with the act of more people being in your economy will likely be more beneficial than not. There are diminishing returns of course, but it still more people with more supply and demand of labor. \n\nI dont think our economies are built for infinite growth. I think our expectations for the economy are for infinite growth and we get that growth through increasing efficiency, increasing population, or inflation. We dont want much inflation but we want some. We want increased efficiency but not so much that its too disruptive to society. We want population increases, but at a rate that doesnt disrupt our lives too much. \n\nIn the end individuals have an image that their slice of that pie will be bigger over time(think the American dream) and that the slice will grow faster than inflation. If individuals realize their slice is actually shrinking as the pie gets bigger they tend to be upset. Once they get upset either they figure out how to get more, or they make peace with it, or they thrash about because its not fair in their minds. They might be right. They might not. If they figure out how to get more through more work or better skills thats wonderful. If they make peace with it that sucks for them, but not end of the world for society usually. The problem is people thrashing about. If they have a valid issue it can be disruptive but resolved. If the issue isnt valid though that is where we have real trouble. What that thrashing about looks like varies but I think we all can all point at events and say that is thrashing about. Determining the validity of the claim is a political question and the answer rarely makes everyone happy so I will skip that part. \n\nThe major issue for the next 100 years or so is that population globally will likely peak and the decades before that and after it will almost certainly be full of a lot of people thrashing about. Much of that will be due to climate change and the impacts it has. Places get too hot for your way of life you suffer with it or you move. If your area floods you put up with it or you move. All that moving will generate frustration and anger on the part of the people moving and the people who have new neighbors. We all see at least some aspect of that happening already. Its already bringing out some ugly reactions. Bad actors are definitely riling up people about some aspects of it. In some places they go on and on about illegal immigrants. In others its about the mistreatment of immigrants. In others its racism or religious extremism. Some of it is cross international borders. In some places its internal. Try living somewhere that is pricing locals out of the market. Try living somewhere where you cant get affordable insurance for your house. \n\nMy guess is that a lot of companies are seeing a lot of these issues impact them in various ways and tbh they likely dont have answers for much of the problem. If I had to make a guess its going to have a huge impact on their revenues and on the value of many currencies and commodities over time. It might not look like it as it will all be in motion, but like the tide coming in it will happen. \n\nIf I could convince everyone of one thing it would be to show a little bit of consideration for everyone else around you. This is not going to be an easy thing for younger generations to deal with and it will be even worse if we convince them that thrashing about is the solution to the problems. Dont leave anyone behind because eventually you might be the odd one out. I dont care if they look different, act different, are an asshole, are morons, idc. Im not saying bend over backwards to help them, but for sure dont go out of your way to make it harder on them. \n\nAnyway apologies for getting on my soapbox.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">Dont leave anyone behind because eventually you might be the odd one out.\n\nVery well said.

Housing is overpriced. Unemployment is trending up. Inflation is softening.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Inflation is put a fork in it done. \n\nTech stocks might be overpriced in many cases, but some may actually be cheap vs where they will be in a few years. Id say NVDA for example will likely continue up. TSLA is probably overpriced. MSFT will go up long term. Googl might have issues. apple likely isn't as much a growth stock as it used to be. meta is still growing, but it will slow down before too much longer. Many of the smaller but still big tech are a mixed bag of potential and issues. \n\nHousing is overpriced due to throttled supply. Most homeowners are not willing to trade their low rate for higher rates due to the risks involved with a higher mortgage. When rates drop a bit supply will likely jump up dramatically. That will likely be when fed cuts about 150-200 basis points so we are still quite a ways off from that tipping point. Tack on the issues with insurance in many areas and you have people leaving those places and going elsewhere that is putting pressure on the already limited housing supply where they are going. For example I bet Florida house prices will drop over the next few decades, but further north in NC and TN it will be pressured by many FL folk moving there. CA will see similar issues, but I dont know where they are all moving towards. I live in NC and anecdotally Im seeing a huge influx of FL plates in the area year around now. They built around 50 homes a few hundred yards from my house and roughly half of them were bought by people from FL. Few of the homes were bought by locals. Beyond the FL crowd we got a mix of people from other states with few NC residents moving in there. I have friends in TN and they are seeing similar things in their area. Lots of new homes going up, but most of them being bought by folks from elsewhere. Not complaining about it. I'm observing its happening and its makes sense for it to continue to happen.\n\nUnemployment has trended up a bit, but not spiked and all of that is relative to where its been for the past few years. A bigger issue is that skilled labor is excessive in one place and absent in another due to the housing issues. People aren't going to bear that cost  and risk for a bit more pay. Businesses aren't willing to cover that cost for the most part and its becomes a chicken and the egg kind of situation. Rates come down enough, people move, critical skill shortages get filled, economy stops grinding on problems the rates are causing. It doesnt help that many of these skilled labor jobs are not super high skilled labor, but rather just critical for a smooth operation. Without them you cant spin up all the related jobs. As an example the local hospital has had several opening for higher end nursing. The jobs aren't being filled and they are trying to make do with temp nurses. Not enough nurses are willing to move here and these specific jobs are mid to late career type nursing jobs. The pay offered is fine in normal times, but if the nurse you need has to sell the house out of town and get a house here then they either need to come out ahead or the new job has to pay enough to make it sensible. right now that simply isnt the case. Sell your house for a profit, get the same exact amount of mortgage in the new place, pay more due to rate by several hundred dollars a month at a minimum and your 24 or 25 mortgage is now back to 30 years. I know because I used to work at the hospital and someone I know there literally had this discussion with someone a few months ago. The lady didnt take the job because moving was only going to net her perhaps another $100 a month if you dont factor in the rental truck, the hours of packing, and if you factor in getting the prices just right on both the sale and the purchase.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": ">  That is what has happened.

{"title": "Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt sees Nvidia as big AI winner: ‘You know what to do in the stock market’", "selftext": "I'm not looking for another debate about whether Nvidia deserves its valuation -- we've had tons of threads about that already. What I'm curious about is:\n\n* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).\n\n* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)\n\nHere's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:\n\n* “I’m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion — very very hard,” said Schmidt, adding that he’s a “close friend” to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\n* “If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,” Schmidt said. “That’s not a stock recommendation.” Schmidt didn’t say if he owns Nvidia shares.\n\n* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google’s lax work culture in the session.\n\n* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won’t be the only winner in AI, but there aren’t a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can’t spend as freely.\n\n* “At the moment, the gap between the frontier models — there are only three — and everyone else appears to be getting larger,” Schmidt said. “Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I’m not so sure.”\n\n* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company’s CUDA programming language. He said AMD’s software that translates Nvidia’s CUDA code for its own chips “doesn’t work yet.”\n\n* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion.

While there, Yuri Milner, a Russian tech entrepreneur who founded DST with close ties to the Kremlin, hosted a dinner to cap the entire event (2).

Three months later Yuri Milner’s DST invested into Facebook at a bloated value. (2)\n\n> Mr Milner dismissed suggestions that at a valuation of $10bn he overpaid for his stake in Facebook, especially given that the social networking site has yet to prove it has turned to profit. (3)\n\n> it’s seen as a desperate and rather vulgar deal on the one hand—Milner buying a small stake in Facebook, valuing the entire company at $10 billion—and, on the other, Facebook debasing itself by taking Russian money. Russian money! In fact, it seems rather like a desperate deal for both parties (in the midst of the banking crisis, Facebook has only two other bidders for this round—and none from the top VC tier) (4)\n\nBy the end of 2009, DST would own 10% of Facebook. Later revealed by the Paradise Papers, DST’s investments into Facebook were financed by the Russian government through state-owned Gazprom. In 2009 Russia owned 10% of Facebook. (6)\n\nSoon after, the two continued to work together on other investments. Breyer introduced Milner to Groupon, and Milner helped Breyer’s Accel invest into Spotify (7). In 2010 an Accel representative joined a gaggle of Silicon Valley investors to Russia and signed a letter promising to invest into the country (8). \n\n1. http://fortune.com/2011/01/11/timeline-where-facebook-got-its-funding/\n\n2. http://fortune.com/2010/10/04/facebooks-friend-in-russia/\n\n3. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7753692/Facebook-is-just-the-first-step-say-Russians.html\n\n4. https://www.wired.com/2011/10/mf_milner/\n\n5. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jan/04/facebook-dst-goldman-sachs\n\n6. https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/russia-funded-facebook-twitter-investments-kushner-investor\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/s/7MOIwgC4E1\n\n7. https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/dst-global-hoping-to-grow-across-asia-puts-down-roots/\n\n8. http://www.ambarclub.org/executive-education/\n\n**Jim Breyer and Rupert Murdoch**\n\nThen in Nov 2010 Jim Breyer invested into Artsy.net, run by Rupert Murdoch’s then-wife, Wendi Deng, and Russia oligarch Roman Abramovich’s then-wife, Dasha Zhukova (who then married Rupert in 2024) Jared Kushner’s brother, Josh, also invested in the fledgling company (1). \n\nAt the time Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation had a joint venture with the Russian mob-linked oligarch Boris Berezovsky, called LogoVaz News Corporation, that invested in Russian media (4).
