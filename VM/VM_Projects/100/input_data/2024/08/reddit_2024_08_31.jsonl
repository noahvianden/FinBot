{"title": "I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now", "selftext": "I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. \n\n1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. \n\n3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta.\n\n2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. \n\n3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. \n\n4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.\n\n5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point.

You think Bezos thought that AWS would make loads of money from renting out portions of the cloud hardware? It was only discovered out of luck, and Amazon for the first time became profitable.\n\nGoogle's needs were mostly internal, while searches are much lighter data in comparison, among other technical reasons.

It is still a leading, natural monopoly. Ballmer just happened to be a business-focussed leader that really tightened up MS books, compliance, etc. My guess is that Natya was able to take advantage of the streamlined books and focus more on the tech vision side of things. Plus, MS had an advantage with at least two existing services that are in every business' computers -- SharePoint and OneDrive. Crudely put, they added extra features and called it Azure (though it's definitely a lot more than that, but the point is that it's just an incremental step with big marketshare from the beginning, which Google has none of, because it's not their business).\n\n>How did openAI manage to launch products and receive tons of investment and Nvidia manage to rake in billions of profits in AI revenue if Google was in AI for a decade at least?\n\nThere were many 'AI' players. OpenAI just happened to be lucky with picking an algorithm out of many. It was literal cutting edge where business leaders have 0 idea about (e.g. Altman doesn't have a PhD in data science). They just happened to make the right bet on the right engineers who bet on the right formulas.\n\nGoogle is also not a hardware specialised company like Nvidia.\n\nThey were unlucky with Tensor. AlphaGo impact was so huge in the industry that R no longer became the programming language of choice, but became Python, and forced R to be able to run Python code (though they already ran C++ for example). That's how huge the impact was. The unlucky part was that the Python library TensorFlow had a very controversial (i.e. very bad) transition from version 1 to 2. There is a chart somewhere of package downloads over time/history, and after version 2, it just died. Now, their Tensor hardware/server business is reflected on it, because it's not growing as fast, not as many people are learning it, etc. Happened to be engineers' design decisions of the package that didn't work out socially and business-wise.\n\n>How did Apple, which started as a computer company, manage to create the iPhone which generates vastly more profits than all of Google's devices and android combined?

For one, Alphabet‚Äôs valuation isn‚Äôt just a simple reflection of its current earnings or growth. The market‚Äôs pricing already incorporates a lot of future expectations and risks. The high P/E ratio often associated with Alphabet could actually be a sign that investors have high hopes for its future growth, and this optimism is likely baked into the stock price.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet faces significant competitive pressures and regulatory challenges that could impact its future performance. The tech industry is notorious for its fast-moving and competitive nature, with new players constantly emerging. Additionally, the regulatory landscape is becoming more stringent, especially concerning data privacy and antitrust issues. These factors can constrain Alphabet‚Äôs operational freedom and potentially impact its profitability, complicating the argument that it‚Äôs undervalued.\n\nThen there‚Äôs the question of Alphabet‚Äôs investments in emerging technologies. While its ventures into AI, autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing are promising, they also come with considerable risks. These projects require substantial investment and time before they start delivering substantial returns. The current stock price might already reflect the high-risk, high-reward nature of these investments, which means it could be overvalued rather than undervalued if these ventures don‚Äôt pan out as hoped.\n\nFinancial health is another crucial aspect. Alphabet is indeed in a strong financial position, but its heavy reliance on advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to shifts in the market. Any downturn in the advertising sector or changes in consumer behavior could impact its earnings. This risk is an important consideration and might contribute to a more cautious investor sentiment, countering the claim of undervaluation.\n\nInvestor expectations play a significant role as well. The stock market often prices in future growth expectations rather than current performance. If Alphabet doesn‚Äôt meet these expectations or if growth slows, the stock might experience corrections. So, what might appear as undervaluation could actually be a reflection of high growth expectations rather than a genuine bargain.\n\nFinally, it‚Äôs worth considering alternative investment opportunities. Alphabet might seem undervalued when viewed in isolation, but there are other sectors and stocks that could offer better risk-adjusted returns. Investing in a variety of options might reveal more attractive opportunities depending on individual goals and risk tolerance. So, while Alphabet is certainly a significant player in the market, it‚Äôs essential to weigh these factors before concluding that it‚Äôs the most undervalued stock out there.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Right!?

I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers.\n\nI think ChatGPT lost numbers because their initial traffic was mostly people amused by it and just having fun/experimenting with it. But their product is getting a lot better. I was really blown away with how much their coding/data analysis has gotten. It can actually solve complex business analyst problems now.\n\n>If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.\n\nData is valuable for selling. The strength isn't just your model, it's your infrastructure. For ideal AI, you have highly specialized models, and a \"dispatcher\" model that is a generalist, that decides which specialized model to delegate a request to. Just having a generic large scale LLM means that your AI has broad knowledge, but not a master of anything because there isn't enough resources to be a genius at everything.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Google is the most at risk from AI.

Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users.¬†\n\n3.

{"title": "UPDATE: What if you had just bought the highest market cap stock and rebalanced anytime a new stock took its place? PART 2", "selftext": "Okay, so my last post got a good amount of comments.\n\n If I‚Äôm doing this right, from 1994 to 2023 this strategy averaged 22% in an extreme scenario in which you had to rebalance every year. \n\nHowever, as mentioned in the previous post, on average the rebalancing (selling 100% of the previous highest market cap stock and then buying with 100% of my portfolio the new highest market cap stock) occurred every 2.9 years. \n\nBut what if we were to extend the back test to more than just 30 years? Here‚Äôs part 2 of this strategy: 1981-1994. This is how far back I could go, I couldn‚Äôt find yearly returns of stocks listed in the previous years. \n\nAgain, this strategy will ONLY be applied to USA companies as so will the strategy. \n\nResults: from 1981 to half of 1988 the highest market cap was IBM. The returns during those years would have been: -16.19% in 1981; +69.22% in 1982; +26.75% in 1983; +0.92% in 1984; +26.30% in 1985; -22.83% in 1986; -2.89% in 1987 and +4.5% in half of 1988. \n\nThen XOM became the biggest market cap halfway through the year of 1988 and kept its dominance until the end of 1991. The returns would have been the following: +10% in half of 1988; +19.63% in 1989; +8.85% in 1990 and +23.30% in 1991. \n\nAt the very start of 1992, GE became the highest market cap stock and it held its dominance throughout 1994. The returns would have been: +15.10% in 1992; +26.04% in 1993 and +0.21% in 1994. \n\nThat leads us to an average pre tax return rate of 26.9%. With taxes, applied on the average of rebalancement during these years, which was 1 rebalancement every 2.14 years (in the calculations I considered every 2 years) we get an average after tax annual return rate of 21.27%. \n\n\nBut how was the market doing during these times? From 1988 to 1994 the s&p 500 averaged an annual return rate of 13.5%.  The total backtest (part 1 and part 2) proves this strategy would have on average returned twice as much as the s&p 500 over the course of the last 37 years. \n\n\nPLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT IM NOT CURRENTLY USING THIS STRATEGY AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU IF NOT PROPERLY STUDIED BY EXPERTS.\n\nPLEASE DONT JUST RANDOMLY START USING THIS STRATEGY ", "id": "1f5l4c6", "created_utc": 1725103797.0, "score": 1316, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 621, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 5 | **First Seen In WSB** | 5 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 37 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 6 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Simple strategy with past numbers on its side.

Which means every institution with an algo has APPL in their sight.\n\nA 30% daily singular drop in APPL will almost certainly trigger a sell down on all algos trying to rebalance their portfolio. This momentum will very likely bleed over to all other stocks, so how do you find the next highest market cap stock when everything is bleeding? \n\nAnother issue is the effect that Apple has as a tech company. While it does have the largest market cap, the top 7 are almost all tech related except for number 6 at saudi aramco, number 8 at Berkshire, and number 10 at elli lly. A drop in apple is likely to be devastating for tech evaluations. \n\nConsidering its Apple and the fact that berkshire still has a significant portion of apple as its investment, that would mean that your largest marketcap strategy would end up ocilating between tech, oil, and pharma.\n\nI would suggest you not look too far in the past for this strategy because the market was much smaller then, and commisions were insane it wouldn't have been workable trying to do a daily rebalance or even frequent rebalancing. The Roth IRA was only available post 1998, so tax-free trades would not be possible prior.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/historical-trading-commissions-2014-3\n\nThere's also an issue of liquidity to consider if the strategy was successful. I.e. compounding returns at 22%. Assuming you need to rebalance immediately, would dumping millions of dollars worth of shares in a collapsing stock give you the best price at exit and would entering the same cash into another stock give you the best entry.\n\nThe last point of concern is that declaring the largest market cap as the winner is also only workable if we assume that market caps grow each year. Apple took dominance in 2013 with market cap. In 2015, they had a cap of 643b, in 2016, they still had market dominance, but their cap was 583b. Similarly, in 2018, they had a marketcap of 860b but the following year in 2019, they lost dominance in msft who had a marketcap of 780b whereas they were at 746b. \n\nThe kicker was that in 2020 apple took back dominance at 1.29T, whereas msft was at 1.2T. \n\nYour performance would likely have been better at just buy and hold apple towards the end. Rather than adjusting for every variance. Furthermore, the yearly marketcap seems to ignore a lot of the nuances that happen in the year.

So long term inflation adjusted return the max I could see you having is 3x, so on a short timeline I could see this being profitable but long term this can‚Äôt continue. No company can grow to be infinite in size, which is what this would need to be profitable. \n\n\nSo, cool idea, and it‚Äôs interesting to see how the biggest companies have grown in size faster than the overall market for awhile now.

", "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway stock selling is been assumed to be because he's fallen out of love with certain stocks (Apple) or because he wants to build up a cash reserve to take advantage of a predicted crash in the market but what if he's selling up to sell up? Berkshire Hathaway is a company that core competencies has increasingly been overshadowed by its CEOs investment gains in partially owned stock - its price going up on the news that its holding so much in T-bills shows how the price might be being distorted by \"buffett magic.\" Market confidence that he can predict a change in the market and that he will be able to time that and exploit it for higher profit with a large cash reserve buoying the price even if the underlying value hasn't change.  $277 billion is an insane amount of cash to hand and it being news probably wouldn't boost the share value for many other CEOs or companies if the source was the same.\n\nIf you're a value investor that should concern you- maybe it concerns him as well- if his value is tied up in Hathaway stock and Hathaway stock is overpriced based on his own continued existence what happens to the stock value when he hands over the company, or dies? Would the market react the same way to learning that Greg Abel has $277bn in cash reserves to potentially invest with? Any other company can fall back on its business model to show potential future revenue when the CEO moves on- but the market value of Berkshire Hathaway stock is no longer in the business model of the companies it runs as a conglomerate- its in only having paid a single dividend since 1965 and reinvesting that money wherever they could if the business they directly controlled couldn't take the investment and Warren and Charlie being able to pick more winners than losers.\n\nHis business partner of 60 years died last year, he's 94 years old, he's a value investor- instead of cashing out of the stock market because he's eager for another round of further investments what if he continues cashing out all of the partially owned businesses that have so overshadowed the core business in the last couple of decades so he can spin off the operating parts of Berkshire Hathaway into businesses that's value isn't at least partially dependent on him living forever as its CEO? Either that or just selling all the partially owned stock that doesn't fall under the conglomerate and paying out a monster dividend so that when he goes and the slight mania of annual shareholder meetings dies down there is still a core value-focused business there to focus on. The guy who he's picked to replace him is much more of a CEO type than an investment management type- was an energy CEO for a company Berkshire bought out in the 2000s. \n\nWhat would you do if this was the case?
