For now only buy the big indexes, why? - you don’t know anything, or at least nothing of substance. Sorry, it’s a fact. \n2. Read, read, read, and read some more. I mean books, not just Reddit for rumours. Get a solid foundation for what investing IS. Also for what some of the greatest investors did / do. Not all of it will apply all of the time going forward but it’s good knowledge. \n3. Your generation has an incredible learning tool at your disposal: AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity etc. While you read use these tools to understand what you’re reading at a faster rate. \n4. Know for a fact, you’ll be learning for a lifetime. But commit the next 5-10 years to reading and learning HARD for at least 2 hours every day of your life. \n5. Keep investing as much as you can and as often as you can in the indexes you choose. Don’t second-guess it for now. You’ll be kicking yourself in the ass you don’t have a pile of the new shiny stock, but don’t worry. You are in the MOST IMPORTANT phase of investing, the foundation. \n\nI’ll only recommend VOO (S&P 500) & QQQ (NASDAQ 100) because they are easy to follow and easy to understand. And they are super-diverse.\n\nIf anyone tells you “you only have your eggs in 2 baskets” - you don’t. You are diversified into 600 companies!\n\nBack to learning: while reading and learning techniques from the greats use the companies that interest you the most to run their concepts. Or at least find all of their info and have AI help you define the numbers “according to Buffet” or whoever. \n\nBy the time you’re 30 you’ll have great habits, a great understanding and you’ll probably already be invested into single issue stocks…let’s be honest. Your confidence will be sky-high. Then you’ll take some lumps. We all do. \n\nThat’s when the second phase of learning is done. You’ll make some big multi-baggers, and you’ll lose some big dough. Just limit those losers. And only lose with a small part of your portfolio.\n\nThat was some of my mistakes. I lost with pieces of my portfolio I shouldn’t have. I had a few home runs that maybe I shouldn’t have had either but it is what it is. \n\nProtect 80% for long-term, never ever sell so when you hit between 50 and 60 you can look at the 80% and say “hey I can live off of the income of that 80% forever now!”\n\nThat’s exactly where you want to end up. And it will probably take 40 years. Some will tell you can do it in less, focus on 40 years. If it happens early then that’s a big bonus. \n\nOne last thing: once you can live off investments, make sure you get more conservative with your approach.

Now is the time for you to learn how to pick your own stocks, figure out what your risk tolerance is, figure out if you can mentally handle extreme volatility.  Learn hard lessons about buying in a frenzy and selling in a panic.  Learn when companies are being over hyped and just get a feel for how investing works.\n\nI say now is a great time to do this because you are just starting out in what should be about 60 years of investing.

Right now you want to make and leaner from mistakes while own one share of Apple and not 10000 shares.  You don’t really learn those same lessons in index funds.\n\nIf you figure out you aren’t good at picking stocks or don’t want to put the time in research and pick the right companies the index funds will always be a low cost low effort and proven option.

I’ll be honest - I’m not a war expert - but even I realize now that production is hella important in a war and so is the economy of it. Ukrainians are desperately in need for artillery shells that we (collective west, which includes Europe) couldn’t deliver enough of for about a year now - either due to greed, corruption, fear or because we couldn’t produce much of it. Russians don’t experience a lack of those shells. I’ve read that NATO’s cost of production of 155mm shells is around 4-5k per unit, whereas Russians produce it for under 1000$ per unit. Russia is also extremely rich in natural resources - oil, iron and whatever else is needed for war and can get them on the cheap. Russian army in the last couple of years gained an invaluable military experience - experience we haven’t got since like Vietnam? Furthermore, Russia has the biggest nuclear dick. I haven’t even touched China yet - imagine their production capacity! How are we going to compete with that? Javelins are awesome - but they cost around 100k per unit and its missile is additional 80k. Abrams costs about 20$ million per unit, Russia’s t-90 about $4 millions.

And being one of it's users, I have to say they do a very good job knowing what music I like and once I start listening, they serve up sections that are appreciated (and that coming from an old guy that likes everything from classical to hip hop to techno).\n\nI have a lot of AAPL (close to 7figures) and have been looking to cut that back and move to more safer more generic bets like SPY, VOO and QQQ. But the reason I hold is AI. Apple makes products that last a relatively long period of time so there are concerns that their hardware sales are flat-lining. \n\nNow, let's consider AI and Apple. If they do a great job with Apple Intelligence, everyone that wants to play will need to get new phones. That's because Apple has stated that only version 15 Pro models have the CPU to complement their AI offerings. Everyone that wants to appreciate the new OS's will need to buy new phones. THIS is a huge change in the prior course for Apple hardware. They have recently noted that they may be offering AI as a \"service\".

IF, someone does not recognize that then I could understand their lack of seeing how this will benefit any ecosystem.\n\nPersonally, I've used AI to write Content. Ok, that's cute and works and now everyone is doing this. I've used AI in programming and my IDE (design tools) have integrated it to the point where it writes code and then will explain why. Who needs to go to school when this kind of knowledge is readily available? But where AI shines is in ChatGPT 4.o conversations. Holy fucknuggets, it's amazing how smart and intuitive the conversational model is. For instance, I am learning Spanish and pose a question in the difference of two closely sounding words (Compermiso and Con Permiso). I'm able to talk to the AI, get a clear explanation of difference and then it can tell if I am making a proper pronunciation. Now I will quit my other apps like Dualingo and just ask AI to teach me new verbs in Spanish and so on... \n\nOnce people integrate AI into their lifestyles, again, like the Internet, there will be no turning back. There will be some reluctance regarding \"your data\" but we all look the other way on that regarding the Internet because of the benefits.\n\nSo, I'm sticking with APPL for a few/couple more years, hopefully not too many, then moving more of my portfolio to Index Funds and maybe more Real Estate.

{"title": "Warren Buffett now owns more T-bills than the Federal Reserve ", "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway now owns more in Treasury bills than the U.S. Federal Reserve as Warren Buffett builds up his cash fortress to a record level.\n\nThe Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate held $234.6 billion in short-term investments in Treasury bills at the end of the second quarter, while it owned more than $42 billion of cash and cash equivalents that included T-bills with maturities of three months or less, according to its quarterly financial report.\n\nThat compared with $195.3 billion in T-bills that the Fed owned as of July 31. The central bank held $4.4 trillion in Treasury securities that include notes, bonds and inflation-linked securities. The Fed was a big buyer of the government’s debt during the pandemic and is always one of the largest holders of Treasurys as part of its effort to keep liquidity in the markets.\n\nBuffett, 93, pulled off a surprising and yet prescient move by selling big chunks in stock holdings including Apple last quarter, ahead of a drastic global sell-off this week. Berkshire has been a seller of stocks for seven quarters straight, but that selling accelerated in the last period with Buffett shedding more than $75 billion in equities in the second quarter.\n\nMany loyal Buffett watchers viewed the decision to dump his top holdings as a wake-up call with the Oracle of Omaha seemingly turning bearish on the economy and the markets.\n\nBuffett has noted in the past during times of crisis that he’ll buy Treasury bills directly at auction. The government sells T-bills for terms ranging from four to 52 weeks.\n\nBuffett’s gigantic war chest has been earning sizeable returns thanks to the pop in Treasury yields over the past two years. If invested in 3-month Treasury bills at about 5%, $200 billion in cash would generate about $10 billion a year, or $2.5 billion a quarter.\n\nAfter the Covid-19 pandemic rattled markets, the central bank bought about $5 trillion of Treasurys and mortgage bonds to help aid the economy. But the Fed has been shrinking its asset holdings since June 2022, in a program widely known as quantitative tightening.\n\nThe Fed seeks to promote maximum employment and stable prices by independently setting monetary policy. It includes buying and selling Treasury securities held by the public to control the money supply and interest rates.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/07/warren-buffett-now-owns-more-t-bills-than-the-federal-reserve.html", "id": "1emj1gk", "created_utc": 1723054415.0, "score": 1396, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 215, "comments": [{"body": "I'll probably forget to turn the stove off at 93.

If they want to believe something enough they will filter counter-points out, or will, in extreme balkanization, simoly avoid criticism by solely associating with a group sharing said bias. \n\nThe risk of too much hyperbole is lost of trust when said hyperbole is exposed. This can further entrench people. \n\nSo, from Musk's perspective, I presume, he is at least presenting his own -Inconvenient Truth- model and platform, his -Brave New World-.\n\nHowever, at the heart of the stated intention, one account per verified human and complete free-speech, WOULD be an ideal to battle, most exgregious and obfuscated propoganda, while also being a manner to combat tribalism. \n\nHowever, the social media structure, in general, just seems, at it's roots, seems highly geared towards reinforcing bias-seeking and echo chamber innundation.\n\nThe incompatibility is not in the intent to, as is succintly (though tribally associated) wrapped-up in the phrase, \"fighting the woke mind-virus\".

This modularity simplifies the design process because each chiplet can be optimized individually.\n\t2.\tYield Improvement: Manufacturing smaller chiplets can lead to higher yields compared to producing a single large monolithic die. This is because defects in smaller chiplets affect a smaller portion of the overall product, reducing waste and costs.\n\t3.\tScalability: Chiplets enable AMD to scale performance by adding more chiplets to a package, allowing them to create more powerful chips without designing entirely new monolithic dies. This approach offers flexibility in meeting different performance and power requirements.\n\t4.\tIntegration of Different Technologies: With chiplets, AMD can integrate different types of technologies (e.g., CPU, GPU, memory, specialized accelerators) within a single package. This heterogenous integration can enhance performance and efficiency while keeping packaging complexity manageable.\n\t5.\tInterconnect Efficiency: Advanced interconnect technologies like AMD’s Infinity Fabric allow chiplets to communicate efficiently with each other, maintaining high performance while simplifying the design of the interconnects within the package.\n\t6.\tCost and Time Efficiency: By reusing existing chiplet designs and integrating them into new products, AMD can reduce both the cost and time required to bring new products to market. This approach leverages existing investments in design and manufacturing processes.\n\nOverall, the chiplet approach enables AMD to create advanced, high-performance chips like the MI300 while maintaining manageable levels of packaging complexity, improving yields, and offering greater flexibility and scalability.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "AMD has put a lot of effort into developing chiplets, and is years ahead of the game there.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "your reading comprehension sucks", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "roll friendly birds modern long full wise onerous compare expansion", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Its like saying gasoline is out put diesel in then, If you are Nvidia customer you cant simply put amd chips there, thats whole ecosystem like apple with their products", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "That's part of the problem, vendor lock-in makes you vulnerable to events like this.

US lowering our interest rates has the same effect as Japan raising theirs!\n\nThat means the second we lower our interest rates even a little the carry trade problem is will come back with vengeance and it will all be blamed on Jerome Powell when the markets have more -14% days.\n\nThe second problem is our own Market is begging for an Interest rate cut and would react very very poorly to being outright told that we can no longer lower our interest rates because the Yen carry trade issue was uncovered and we would have to unwind all those trades resulting in very deep drops on exchanges. \n\nI don't think Jerome Powell knew about the Carry Trade issue when he spoke at the July FOMC. \n\nAll previous predictions about when we would lower rates were based on an assumption the global economy did not rely on a strong US dollar and Bond market.\n\nYou saw what happened when Japan raised interest rates .15% we ended up with +60% on VIX and a -14% day in Korea and Japan and -5% at home. \n\nJerome is now the one who has to choose. What is the worst evil? Sending the world into Global Recession as carry trades break down under a weakening Dollar and weaker Bond markets? \n\nOr dealing with a slowdown in the economy at home due to high interest rates stressing the US economy. \n\nLong story short. Japan has decided it would like to keep carry trading with low interest and a weakening Yen and fuck the rest of the world. \n\nI personally don't think Jerome will be able to lower interest rates until some law is passed to deal with carry trades and until then he will dance around the topic of lowering US interest rates month after month.\n\nTLDR: I would buy puts for each FOMC over the next few months because there is zero chance Jerome Powell will lower the US interest rate until some regulation actually removes carry trades. Japan is addicted and wont do it.

They ask for a random batch of jobs and as long as everything is filled out they assume it was done properly (meaning the individual process and inspection steps on the travelers are filled out and complete *prior* to that part moving on to the next step.)\n\nPeople are lazy and don't care and since there is no accountability it's becoming common work culture to just BS the papertrail.\n\nFAA parts have such high requirements that if a door fell off a boeing jet 5 years after it was built the FAA should be able to reach out to boeing and know within a day exactly who had hands on that part, for what step, and at exactly what time, from the first ply of material to the last nut and bolt every single aspect of the manufacturing of that part is supposed to be recording. The FAA expects to be able to point a very accurate finger at the exact person responsible for that step anytime something goes wrong. For example if I forgot to install a bolt the papertrail would say that and myself and the QA inspector responsible could potentially be sued by the FAA or criminally charged for not adhering to their policies. The fact they can't provide this is insane to me. We've had failures that the FAA has reached out to us about and within a few minutes of pulling the paper work we are able to tell them every single piece of information they want. It's an obnoxious amount of paperwork and a real hassle but when it comes to commercial aircraft it's pretty fucking necessary. The FAA needs to know which exact person in the company was responsible for the failure so they can hold that person and the company responsible.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "This is also how the military runs as well.

{"title": "AMD CEO Lisa Su Says AI Is In Early Stages Of Multiyear 'Supercycle': 'There's Tremendous Need For More Compute'", "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares are experiencing an upward trend after the company reported strong second-quarter financial results. Following the announcement, CEO Lisa Su emphasized that the chipmaker’s performance is being driven by a multiyear AI “supercycle.”\n\n**What To Know:** Recently, chip stocks saw a sell-off as earnings season approached, with investors questioning the timeline for significant returns on the massive investments in AI. This led to speculation that spending on AI might slow down. However, early earnings reports indicate that capital expenditures have remained robust.\n\nSu’s comments on CNBC’s “Squawk On The Street” Wednesday provide reassurance against slowdown concerns. She stated, “From the conversations that I have with our customer set and sort of the broader industry, we can see that AI is a multiyear, you know, I would call it a supercycle frankly. There’s tremendous need for more compute.”\n\nAMD reported second-quarter revenue of $5.835 billion and adjusted earnings of 69 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates as its AI business continues to see accelerating demand. The chipmaker also updated its forecast, expecting GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion this year, up from the previous forecast of more than $4 billion.\n\nSu highlighted that analysts and investors are “hypersensitive” to minor quarter-over-quarter changes. She believes that the AI story should be viewed in a broader context, suggesting that the demand is extraordinarily high. “I wouldn’t be hypersensitive in those areas ... Are more customers using it? Is every enterprise asking for it? Are we seeing more applications on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? The answer to that is absolutely yes,” she said.\n\n“Everywhere I go, everyone wants to talk about how can we incorporate AI into our businesses faster and more efficiently ... this early in the cycle, there’s a lot of learning and experimentation, but definitely, there will be the return on the investment on the other side,” Su added.\n\nAlthough the return on investment isn’t “instantaneous,” it’s occurring very quickly. AI is already boosting productivity and enabling companies to bring better products to market faster. Su emphasized, “We’re investing today for the return in a couple of years, and I think that’s absolutely the right thing to do. That’s the way to think about these investment cycles.”\n\nAMD’s strategic focus on AI and its strong financial performance underscore its robust position in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, highlighting the company’s potential for sustained growth in the coming years.", "id": "1emldft", "created_utc": 1723059920.0, "score": 283, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 152, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 6 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 70 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1emldft/amd_ceo_lisa_su_says_ai_is_in_early_stages_of/) \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "\"Never ask a barber if you need a haircut\".  \n\n- Warren Buffett", "score": 365, "replies": [{"body": "I also look at stuff to confirm my bias.
