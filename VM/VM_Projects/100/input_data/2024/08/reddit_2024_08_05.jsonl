{"title": "Monday.", "selftext": "Just made the title as simple as that because I don't want to generate hysteria for nobody.\n\nAnd to start off, I'm just clarifying I'm no specialist or veteran, I just want to engage some discussions.\n\nI wanna discuss about the impact of latest news and what might be in front of us for this week. I crave for more grounded, logical opinions rather than euphorical opinions from people who expect to multiply their holdings by xxxx for investing in NVDA, but this sub is about NVDA stock, and of course it is strongly biased.\n\nRealistically, we're likely going down on Monday, right?\n\nOf course we can't actually predict it. But, in the last few days, we have seen tons of discussions about the delay. Be it a rumour or real, it leads to concerns and affects people's sentiment. No official note from NVDA denying or clarifying it doesn't help as well.\n\nMany consider it's already priced in because some insiders likely knew about it and sold, but the only thing I can think is \"how?\". How could it be possibly already priced in when these news have only reached most ppl during the weekend. Most people only got to know about it on Friday and Saturday. If we add that to all the volatility and news that have been negatively affecting the whole market, it seems logical to me that we're gonna likely see a lot of sell offs, because it all induced lots of fear in people. It doesn't matter if you have faith in NVDA's future, a lot of ppl are very volatile and easily panic selling.\n\nNow, you might consider that it's a good thing if they panic sell because it means sale day for you, but I feel like if the selloffs are strong, we might finally cross that $100 line, and that might lead us even lower, to the mid-low $90s.\n\nAnyways, I'm no specialist and no stock market veteran, I'm just sharing my thoughts and would like to hear more logical opinions, not hopium, not copium and not people that can swear NVDA is going back to $60 by tomorrow. I would like to hear if I missed something, or if my thoughts are not going quite in the right direction. Specially because in another discussion, someone pointed out something I hadn't realized until then, which is: since I don't live in US, and actually live in a very underdeveloped country, it's considerably harder for me to measure people's sentiment as someone who's fairly new to stock market, and it's not something being talked nearly as much here.\n\nI just want to learn more, so I also don't mind the likely rain of downvotes this post might get because it goes against some ppl's expectations and opinions.", "id": "1ekcu8h", "created_utc": 1722825165.0, "score": 87, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "I have no thoughts on this but I just want to say we need more posts like this.

{"title": "NVDA Still Going to $150 By January!", "selftext": "As I mentioned about a week ago, NVDA will soon begin a monster rally up to $150 a share.  Nothing has changed.  Not one bit.  As I mentioned last week, there was every possibility of NVDA going all the way down to $90 a share even.  But that won't change the fact that once the correction ends, a monster rally of epic proportions will begin.\n\nThe first and most important thing any investor in any stock should know is that stocks do not trade in a vacuum. Virtually all stocks are directionally correlated with the broad market indices. As goes the NASDAQ, so goes NVDA. This entire sell-off we've seen in NVDA is almost exclusively due to the correction in the NASDAQ-100. And that correction is nearing an end. The typical NASDAQ-100 correction runs roughly 15-20 trading sessions and the average correction size is 10%. We're now at 19 trading session and \\~14% off the highs on the NASDAQ-100.\n\nThe NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) peaked at $503.50 only 19 trading days ago. At the lows of overnight trading, the QQQ hit $424 a share! That's down about 16% from its highs intraday to lows in premarket (not typically counted though).\n\nNVDA, by comparison, was trading at $135 a share 19-days ago and is down about 28% from its all-time highs. That makes sense given that NVDA trading at a much much higher beta to the market. The NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) rallies 10% and NVDA goes up 25%. It drops 12% and NVDA is going to drop 30%. That's just how it goes.\n\nThis is no different than when NVDA fell from $970 down to a low of $750 back in April on the 8.2% NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) correction. Just like now, that 22% drop in NVDA had very little to do with NVDA and everything to do with the broad market sell-off.\n\nEventually, the NASDAQ-100 will bottom and continue higher in this secular bull market we're in. NVDA will be a significant beneficiary of new money coming into the market and will likely surge to $150 a share by the time we arrive at the New Year. In all honesty, it'll probably happen a lot sooner than that. Once the NASDAQ-100 bottoms -- and we really aren't that far from that point -- the entire market will go on a gut wrenching rally and will likely reach all time highs within 30-40 trading sessions. That's like two months time. NVDA probably gets up to $130-$140 by late September to late October as a result.\n\nNow obviously we could see the market sustain a crash here. That risk is always present during every correction. But even so, crashes are almost entirely reversed in very short order. The last two legit crashes we saw in the market were immediately reversed. Once in 2015 and again in 2020 with the COVID correction. The three week 25% nasdaq plunged was reversed in just a 1-2 months time.\n\nRegardless of what happens next, NVDA goes back to all-time highs by January anyway.

Also to make it even juicier the Yen was going down in value so imagine this…\n\nYou take out a $100,000 loan (of Yen) that you have to pay back w/ 1.5%, you go invest in tech stocks/treasuries. Let’s say you make 5%, that’s $5,000 profit, bringing you to a total of $105,000. You only have to pay back $101,000 in Yen, but also the Yen has gone down 20% in value, meaning you only have to pay back $80,000 (in Yen). And people keep on adding for YEARS to these loans because it’s getting cheaper and cheaper and free profits. \n\nNot to mention they are also using SOOO MUCH margin. So imagine this, they secure the 100k loan and get a 200k position, 100k margin in Nvidia.\n\nBut wait… Japan decides to raise rates which increases the value of the Yen while everyone else is cutting rates (or about to) which decreases the value of *said currency*\n\nSo Yen 📈 everyone else 📉, this makes paying off loans even more difficult and this doesn’t include the margin call. \n\nSo now you have a 200k margin position on Nvidia, Nvidia is down 20%, so you’re down $40,000, on your position and get margin called. (More selling pressure) \n\nNow you have to pay back an extra $40,000. Meaning your $100k of equity is now $60,000, and now bank of Japan is margin calling you because you only have 60k of the 100k owed, but also the Yen is up 10%, so you really owe 110,000 of Yen.\n\nThis is a super small example… it’s not 100,000, people think it’s 10trillion…", "score": 241, "replies": [{"body": "What a great example", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "Great explanation !", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "^^^THIS.

In 5 years we all of a sudden don't need Nvidia (which is market leader) chips anymore?\n\nThis is extremely naive approach towards estimating the valuation of a share. The correct question to ponder is that will companies continue to throw money in AI and related technologies increasingly or at least on the same level as they are currently in the future? If you think the answer is yes, then you have a chance to buy NVDA at discount. If the answer is no, then you should be cautious as we mostly likely are far from the bottom and it may take years or even decades NVDA to reach these market levels.\n\nIn my view current situation in big tech has more than few similarities compared to dot com boom era. Or even the times of 19th century Gold Rush! In those days companies making shovels made absolutely a bank while most actual Gold Rush participants didn't and during the dot com era companies manufacturing new internet era tools sold their products with sky high margins as companies and investors were throwing eye watering lumps of cash towards the \"new economy\". Companies like Cisco, Intel, Sun Microsystems and countless of others thrived as did their share prices.\n\nThen the investments died, if not overnight, then in a very short period of time. And because the infrastructure investment was so over the top, it took quite a while when companies needed to upgrade their facilities which meant that sales and margins of these tech products plummeted. For example, Cisco is still here and doing well, but its share price hasn't yet reached the ATH of dot com bubble era.\n\nI can't possibly know what will happen, but I've seen this kind of shit, that is, bubbles bursting quite many times including the fabulous dot com era and current situation certainly looks like one too in many ways. In fact, I would be more surprised if tech spending we've seen recently even can continue very long. However, it doesn't mean that NVDA isn't manufacturing chips five years from now. Or that these technologies would just disappear or stop progressing. It is just that it may be that NVDA will have significantly smaller sales, margins and generally much more modest outlook of future performance. And if this is indeed the case, then I would be very cautious of increasing NVDA or other big tech companies in portfolio at this point in time.

Just fancy offices, web designers and to the salaries of bicycle delivery boys? Those too, but like those ridicilous start ups, they were only the tip of the ice berg. Because the web was all the jazz, tech companies including internet operators and even many companies from other sectors which didn’t want to be left behind and wanted the piece of the pie from this new economy, spent buttloads of money in ICT infrastructure, such as networks, data centers, services, software and flashy expensive Unix workstations.\n\nThose few years were fabulous for many hardware, software and ICT services and consultancy companies and which many existed already before the boom. They a saw big jump in revenue and profitability. Of course their spending also got out of hand in many cases as they hired people and burned money to their own infrastructure and people, but it was still good times for many companies. For a while.\n\nTalking about dot com boom as something that is only limited to those start ups is just pure ignorance of what actually happened in tech industry back then. Like during the Gold Rush those who made the shovels did well until the music stopped. Investments dried up so badly that it led to the demise of many large companies. Unix computing market died almost overnight which led to the downfall of Sun and SGI. Compaq couldn’t recover and was puchased by HP in 2002 and so on. While their business was thriving for a few years, many of these companies over extended themselves and couldn’t survive as the spending went down for several years and their own company structures were bloated and as they burned so much money themselves, they didn’t have the capital to effectively restructure themselves and no investor was willing to jump in as the hype was long gone.\n\nNow again, if you can’t see the parallels of this era and what happened 25 years ago and understand the roles of different companies in these bubbles, I can’t help it. And I frankly do not care how you are investing. If you think that NVDA is different and spending on AI will continue, you’re welcome to buy the stock to your hearts content.

At the same time enshitification of their ”traditional” business is real and instead of focusing to deliver better services to customers, both corporate and private, they focus on milking them with half assed and overpriced products and services so they can fund ”the next big thing”.

They care about the real world economy, not the stock market. The real world economy has 2 cohorts, the rich and the regular people. \n\nThe stock market reaction is something the fed wants or needs to fight inflation for the rich people. The wealth effect of the stock market allowed the boomers and asset rich people to keep spending in excess, creating all that demand for current supply.\n\nWhat keeps regular people spending is having a job. Unemployment rates are still acceptable. The real world way to look at unemployment is looking around in your social circles and cities. Are you employed? Are all your friends/family? What about the other people/places around you? When your friends and neighbors are unemployed then that's a recession, when you don't have a job too, a depression.\n\nTo me, this is what was needed to finally achieve the soft landing and now they can slowly cut rates like forecasted (the cherry on top would be real estate finally coming back to the normal trendline and not at the crazy covid spike). We don't need emergency ones or QE like covid. Back then everyone wasn't working, stock markets crashed to the 200 week moving average, the real economy was impacted. In comparison, QQQ would have to hit $345 and SPY $420 and everyone you know needs to unemployed.\n\nThe other thing that would cause the fed to step in in the collapse of the financial markets (not the stock market even though the two are very related).\n\nWhy this response in the stock market? Since April, it's been up only with just mainly like 3 companies doing well. Then everything has been juiced with calls. This move has been just the unwind of leverage.

So, (ii) is impossible (at least on the scale where HF and banks would make money), and (i) would be visible in real-time (in which we can check now in any terminal, and see that has not happened (for both orders & stock).\n\nSo, there's no way for HF & banks to have actually make money with an over correction, unless they were already short - but if they were already, how are they supposed to push the ask volumes?

What's with this? 😂\n\nLike this one, it's a reasonable theory, I don't personally agree with it outright but the end result might not be different. Japan absolutely knew what was going to happen when they did this. It's happening, it's clean off their market and by proxy ours and by proxy wringing leverage out of the carry trade. This one doesn't seem as bad as the Asian contagion of 1998, however even with that one, the s&p sold off hard for a month and 3 months later we were making you all-time highs, some variation of that is very easy to picture this time and this is why I say even though I don't necessarily agree, the end result is kind of the same thing. We have this sell off that allows the Fed to do their thing, Japan stabilizes their currency because right now right cuts would just fan the flames of the USDJPY. The public sees a crisis and a federal response to it therefore it really squashes down any potential political finger pointing. Anyone that says, well this helps Harris, well do you think a crisis right before the election helps Harris? \n\nSo what was the ultimate motive for manufacturing this crisis? I don't think that's one we will ever know, publicly inflation in Japan is the stated reason. I'm pretty sure a 20% fall in their index has kind of cooled off the spending a little bit. If this continues, even if it continues for a few more days, very easy to picture the nikkei absolutely terrifying people over there\n\nWhat it looks like to me is we are going to have a diet version of the Asian contagion. If we test the s&p 5000 to 5100 level, that would not surprise me at all, as low as 4,800 also would not surprise me.

And they don't care too much about what the online sentiment is. So I would be careful to deduce that the internet age basically prevents such crashes to occur. It's rather the other way round: Big money can influence the online sentiment (as well of course the political response). So if big players (like Buffet) decide to step away from the markets for now, it will be noticed and other big investors will reevaluate. The question is: Does the big money decide to restructure their assets now or do they try to milk the market as long as possible - increasing the risk that others might f*** them over. In my opinion it's reasonable to be more cautious now and rather wait at the sidelines until the dust settles a bit.

{"title": "Crash Incoming.", "selftext": "I would love to share my findings on the indication of a probable yet most likely not as soon as expected, crash. I have looked at historical data, interests rates globally, and the VIX.\n\nThroughout history, mostly in the U.S a high peak in interests rates, ultimately conspire to a massive drop which is followed by a recession. You can see that in the charts. Please note that those crashes were not mainly caused by the spike of the rates, but it was also coupled by a somewhat of a black swan event. E.x 2019 spike in interest rates followed up by Covid. Or 2007 peak of interest followed by the housing crash after a cut in 2008-2009.\n\nThat alone isn't going to justify a crash. Japan has raised rates which if you follow the Japanese market that DOES NOT happen often. Most memorable moments where Japan raises interest and the U.S cuts is back in 2008 (housing crash). In addition, England has also cut rates which has not happened since Covid 2020...\n\n2024's Black Swan could very much be the A.I \"bubble\" or a potential War, which I'll get to later on.\n\n10% of the U.S stock market engages in a technique called the \"carry trade\". Which is a form of arbitrage where you take a loan out of a country that offers extremely low rates, in this case it was Japan's yen BEFORE the raise. Then you take an equivalent to lets say $1000 of yen and put it in either a safe yield/bond or the stock market. People started doing that much more with speculations of a rate cut happening in September (U.S FEDS).... which did not happen.\n\nInstead, Japan raised it's rates and the stock market crashed due to poor labor U.S data, taking us away from a confident cut, to a not so confident one anymore. Please keep in mind the $1000 that was taken from Japan most likely was not just invested as the prime amount, but more of on average $2000 due to leverage trading. A standard 1:2 is common and therefore people who have lost the initial $1000 (50% loss) most likely are now in debt to the raising interest to Bank of Japan. Hence the outstanding bear charts of the top 2 banks in Japan. Accumulating to a total today of a 20% loss in the stock market.\n\nThis would lead to tons of people to declare bankruptcy and sell off massively causing a crash (which it did on Friday)\n\nAnd no Japan can't just start printing money because their GDP to Debt ratio is at 260%, 9 Trillion Dollars...\n\nEconomics aside, the pressure and uncertainty of a potential war with I.S and Iran is on the table increasing uncertainty.\n\nWith all this in hand, it is hard when to predict a global crash, even though almost $3 trillion dollars were wiped out...\n\n[U.S Interest to Recession Charts](https://preview.redd.it/etw16xsfotgd1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d4f18313b0117adb97aa0273524180a317a9da3)\n\nThere's more images I want to add but can't...", "id": "1ekkelk", "created_utc": 1722853702.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments** | 7 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 weeks | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good work, Sherlock.
