I would say there is 3 levels of understanding, please try to go through them if you want to use leverage ETFs and don’t listen to what people keep repeating without having fully understood what they’re saying. There is too much monkey see monkey do for something that you need to build your own understanding on. Don’t even take my word for it, but if you do want my suggestion (not financial advice) I’ll offer one at the end \n\nLevel 1: if a stock goes up then 2x, 3x is even better so why not buy the leveraged version \n\nLevel 2: this is where you have the “volatility decay” crowd comes in and perhaps well intentioned but cluelessly deriding these instruments as “day trading only” and making it seem like your investment is going to evaporate overnight. Most people get stuck here and never graduate \n\nLevel 3: The real truth about how these instruments perform. Thankfully there is a lot of great well researched and academic-like depth papers on the topic and a range of historic data and tools you can use to understand if these can be held long term, which yes they absolutely can and offer outsized returns. But also yes the risk of decay is high. \n\nThe biggest variables that determine your net levered performance are\n\n1) what leverage multiplier you go for\n2) when you buy \n3) the volatility of the underlying \n\nIf we take one of the worst and extreme examples \n\nIf you bought QQQ, a tech heavy index, at the top of the dotcom it would have recovered by now \n\nIf you bought QLD, which is 2x QQQ at the same exact time it would have recovered to slightly below QQQ today \n\nAnd if you bought TQQQ, which is 3x QQQ at the same time then it would still have not recovered till today\n\nSo yes the “decay” is real. But there are also thousands of periods I can sample where you could hold any of those leveraged ETFs for months and years and come out way way ahead of the baseline, by a ridiculous measure. \n\nSo there is no inherent thing that says you can’t hold those long term. The reality is nuanced, and the best teacher here is data. Again there is papers on the topic and you could do your own testing as well \n\nThe tl:dr is, on a long term basis, a 2x leverage on Spy and Nasdaq performed the best on the frontier when comparing 1x,2x,3x and 4x. I know there is also similar studies done on the Dow, Nikkei, Australian stock market and a couple others but I haven’t looked into thosez\n\nFor most instruments with that level of volatility a 2x leverage is long term higher returns. But do not underestimate the psychological aspect of going through a 90% drawdown compared to a 45% drawdown tor example. So even if the return numbers on 2x work fine, the psychology aspect is another higher risk. It’s easier to say you can stomach it and sit through it, it’s a whole other thing seeing it happen and most people overestimate their confidence in being able to sit through that. Even when you position size, and put only what you can “afford to lose” a 90% drawdown WILL eat at you. \n\nAt 3x leverage avoid those for long term \n\nFinally, if a stock’s weekly volatility within 2 standard deviations is in the order of 10%, know that you will eat a lot of shit even with 2x leverage\n\nTo make this all more relevant to the topic on hand, for most time periods and a long enough period if you bought and held NVDA vs NVDL the 2x leverage would have netted you orders of magnitude ahead.

{"title": "Stocks Pull-Back a bit as Expected", "selftext": "[This article was first published at Sam Weiss](https://sam-weiss.com/stocks-sell-off-as-expected/).    \n  \nAs I mentioned a few days ago in the article entitled, “[Sharp Short-Lived Sell-Off Coming](https://sam-weiss.com/sharp-short-lived-sell-off-coming/),” the market was trading at extremely overbought conditions and was due for a near-term pull-back. We’re seeing that play-out right now. The two main reasons I expected we’d see this pullback happen is:\n\n(1) the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) index had reached extremely overbought conditions only the hourly for an extended period of time and after a large percentage gain.   \n  \nThat second part is key and didn’t spend much time on that in the article I published a few days ago. So we’ll talk about that here now. It’s not enough for the QQQ to simply touch a 70-RSI or to even to become overbought for us to make a reasonable forecast. For there to be ANY predictive value to forecast a sell-off, you need to see extremes for an extended period of time and it must come after there has been a strong 8-12% move higher off the lows.   \n  \nYou can easily see the QQQ reach overbought conditions right off the lows and it wouldn’t be smart to forecast anything at that point. For example, the QQQ was trading at $423 two weeks ago when it was at its low. Suppose after it had rebounded up to $445, it reached overbought conditions. It would be incredibly unwise to forecast a pull-back when the market had only risen 4.96%. That’s because the rally had barely just begun and not enough new money will have flowed back into the market at that point. There’s a tendency for the QQQ to rally a good $50 off its lows before seeing any sort of pull-back when we’re talking about forecasting the first pull-back. \n\nTake a look at the QQQ chart below as an example. Notice the vertical lines I’ve annotated on the chart. They outline every previous case going back the last 15-months where the QQQ pushed well above a 70-RSI. You can see just how predictable the hourly RSI really is as a forecasting tool so long as it is taken in conjunction with other conditions. It’s not just guesswork here. There’s a pretty well established trend. Notice the red lines \n\nA few things you might notice are (1) once we’ve rallied a fair amount of the lows, overbought becomes more and more predictable. You can forecast big pull-backs once the QQQ has gone on a big move to the upside. The RSI has less predictive value as a tool when we’re coming off of the lows of a previous sell-off and more predictable as we’ve risen quite a bit. In this case, I was confident in the forecast simply because the QQQ had rallied $62 from $423 up to $485. That’s actually the biggest rally I’ve seen in a straight line without a pull-back. And that makes sense as we’ve just had the largest sell-off we’ve seen since the bear market lows of December 2022. So a huge rally makes sense. \n\nThe second big thing that everyone should notice is that the QQQ seldom peaks when we’ve peaked on the RSI. There’s usually a lag period where we get something called negative divergence. Don’t want to get too technical here. But just know it’s more likely to peak after a small lag period has taken place. For example, look at the may peak. We hit peak overbought conditions in mid-May but it wasn’t until late-May that the QQQ sold-off. \n\n(2) The second main reason is the table I posted in the article that outlines what typically follows after a correction.  As I outlined in that table, what we usually see after a correction ends is the QQQ will rally roughly 10-15% during the first 25 trading days after bottoming. Well this time the QQQ managed to accomplish that feat in just 10-12 days. It did it in roughly half the required time. What’s more, in virtually all of these post-correction rallies, we get a sharp-back before moving higher. And that’s because that first surge off the lows leads to overbought conditions. The bottom-line is the QQQ just went up too far too fast relative to its typical historical trading behavior. So that lead me to believe we were due for a sell-off. That table is posted here below: \n\nBut as I also stated [yesterday](https://sam-weiss.com/market-rally-has-only-just-begun/), the market rally that began on August 5 is only just beginning. This sell-off is only a minor blip in a much larger new rally. Nothing I saw today changes that. We’ll see what happens tomorrow. But as of now, this sell-off doesn’t look like anything more than just a minor pull-back ahead of more upside. What’s more, we may actually drawing very close to end of this pull-back. If we get anywhere near a 30-RSI, then that’s the biggest red flag that the selling is over and we’re likely headed higher. The QQQ right now is at a 38-RSI. So we’re not quite there yet. But we’re very close to that point. The meat of the sell-off is pretty much done. The QQQ is down $10 from its high. The typical QQQ pull-back is 3-4% from peak to trough. We’re at 2.5% at the moment. Notice the circle on the chart below. That’s what we’re thinking in terms of the pull-back. At this point, it can bottom at any moment. It doesn’t have to get down to oversold. It’s far less predictable at this point. If it were to bottom right here at $473.81, that would be sufficient. That’s $12 from the highs on the QQQ. It would feel shallow, but it’s enough. \n\n# Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nNow obviously what we’re seeing in Nvidia is just mirroring what we’re seeing in the broad market. Nvidia is directionally correlated with the market. The pull-back in NVDA at this point is less than I would have expected. By today we should have seen Nvidia (NVDA) hit $120 if we’re going to see it fall to the $115’s before earnings. Now I think that is unlikely as the QQQ pullback doesn’t have much left in it. Now if the QQQ pull-back does go the way of 4% — which again is totally in-line with historical trends — then it’s very possible NVDA could get down there. But at this point, I think earnings is acting like a gravity well and offer some degree of protection against this pull-back we’re seeing in the QQQ. \n\nAs to Nvidia (NVDA) technicals, the stock is not only no longer overbought, it is now nearing oversold conditions. It’s not there yet, but it’s getting very close to oversold conditions already. We closed at a 39.49-RSI on the hourly. Now NVDA does have a flare for the dramatic from time to time and might push down to a 20-RSI. We’ve seen that happen seven (7) times in the past year. All seven instances preceded massive moves to the upside. And we’re talking immediate rallies afterward. Could it happen here? Maybe. I think it’s less likely due to the fact that we have earnings coming up next week. That will largely depend on how the QQQ trades tomorrow and Monday. But I do think Nvida does go back toward its highs by the time we arrive at earnings. Take a look at the NVDA chart below. Notice just how explosive oversold conditions are for Nvidia. Whenever NVDA gets down to oversold on the hourly, it explodes higher near-term. \n\n# STOP TIMING THE MARKET!\n\nOne last thing I’d like to stress is that none of this above should really be about trying to time the market. I see a lot of comments on Reddit and in my inbox of people using this as a tool to make timed trades. That is almost certainly a losing proposition. I’ll explain why in a more detailed and dedicated page to [investing basics](https://sam-weiss.com/investing-basics/). Don’t write this off as some sort of empty adage. It’s not empty words. Trying to trade and/or time NVDA is playing with lava-level fire. \n\nNow are there opportunities to enhance returns a little by using a very small subset of capital to leverage oversold trades. Sure. But core-position wise, you should just be long the stock and don’t think about it. There are ways to leverage and enhance your returns without getting screwed by being left on the sidelines. We’ll get to that. If I were on the sidelines right now and wanted to get long NVDA, I would have bought half today minimum. Because at this point it could bottom at any moment. The QQQ has officially pulled back far enough for this to constitute an overbought pull-back by historical stands. 2.5% is on the small side, but it’s technically sufficient. So the next 1% of downside in the market is a high-risk forecast. \n\nRemember, the point of this post is to help provide security, confidence and knowledge. It’s not really intended to trade on it. It’s meant to give investors added visibility to their positions and helps explain why certain gyrations are occurring. Will post some thoughts either during or after tomorrow’s trading session.

The sell off wasn’t that much and a lot of this had to do with Jackson Hole.\n\nAs far as NVDA rallying today that was in line with J Powells dovish speech at Jackson Hole. This sort of movement is fairly consistent with economics data reporting and Fed speak. If you look at the other players in tech you will see a similar chart. AAPL chart looks almost identical to NVDA this AM. \n\nAs for the NVDA rally coming…that has a lot to do with Hyper-scalers reporting continued CAPEX spend on data centers this earnings season. It is generally considered that NVDA will beat and raise.\n\nHe is speaking more to historical trends and TA with QQQ and Nasdaq. The RSI on the 1D for NVDA was not horribly overbought. The RSI was in the 60’s and can be pegged above 80 for a few days before reversing. Which can be seen on the 1D chart for some of these big moves this year. The opposite is the RSI getting into the 20’s where an oversold condition tends to reverse fairly soon after on these Mega Cap stocks.\n\nSo to boil down his post in simple terms : RSI looking overbought, trends showing upside.\n\nKeep in mind historically the fall is bullish and extremely bullish post election. So if NVDA beats and confirms the Hyper-scaler CAPEX spend with increased revenue then yes it will rally just like it did last quarter. Going into the fall it could rally even more with the entire SP500 as rate cuts will most likely occur.\n\nThere is a little more at play here than technical analysis. Don’t get me wrong I use TA daily here. But news/economics plays into this as well as fundamentals.\n\nWhat was interesting and he has not responded to my comment on another thread. A few months ago he made a point of saying NVDA would be stuck in the 120’s because of the problem with reaching a 3 trillion market cap.

{"title": "Are options really a zero sum game.  ", "selftext": "I've been selling options since 2017.  I've tried a few strategies over the years but I mainly sell naked puts.  I use tasty trade and sell options that are 30-45 days out that are 85-90% pop.  I've had two really good years where I made over 100% profit on $30-40k account but I've also had two years where I completely blew up my account on one bad trade.  The other years I've made modest profit or loss.  Basically I've more or less broken even over time but I've really lost because of taxes on the good years.  If I just put 100% of my account long on SPY I would have done much better the last couple of years.

If Y is more than X, you made money. If you let it expire, Y is zero, if you exercise the options, Y is intrinsic value.\n\nThe counter party sold to you for X and bought from you at Y. Their change in V is X-Y. Add both the changes in V together: Y-X+X-Y=0.  That's a zero sum game. It doesn't matter who wins or loses. It's always zero sum (minus fees).

It's now a net positive even if only you get some extra utility from it. \n\nRegarding Edit 2: It doesn't matter who wins. A zero sum game is still defined above. It's still a zero sum game. Y is the payout and X is your premium. Y is zero if you didn't have an accident, Y is big and positive if you do. But it is still a zero sum game because the insurance company sees X-Y. Add them together and you get zero. If you gain utility, then it's a net positive. \n\nRegarding edit 3: That's a perspective piece trying to get people thinking about their accounts as a whole. They made a \"sleight of hand\" by combining zero sum transactions (options trading) with non-zero sum (buying bonds/stocks) to say \"look, not zero sum!\" Sure their strategy as a whole is not zero sum, but the options trader part of their strategy is, by definition, zero sum when measured in dollars.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "so what is an example of a positive sum game? there are negative sum games, zero sum games, and positive sum games. i think that the gambler's utility from playing is a bit more of a \"sleight of hand\" here than the quantifiable example of having a position in the underlying.\n\nedit: perhaps using expected value could help clarify.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Rather than think of it is a positive sum game, it's really \"zero sum game vs non-zero sum.\"\n\nTrading something where neither party goes short an asset would be a non-zero sum. That is different than options which are just contacts written between two people. Whenever anyone trades an option, one party's position goes long one while the other's goes short one. That's the origin of the zero sum. Any appreciation or loss of the long is exactly equal to the loss or gain of the short.\n\nStocks are different. Companies generate income and have expenses. That net revenue increases or decreases the value of the stock. The math works like this:\n\nI have stock worth X today. I sell it to you for X. Next year it's worth X*(1+r) where r is the stock's annual return in percent. What's the change in net asset value of our two accounts?\n\nI started with X in stock and ended with X in cash. I saw no change.\n\nYou started with X in cash and ended with X*(1+r) worth of stock. You saw a change of X*r.\n\nThe total change of both of our accounts is X-X+X*(1+r)-X=X*r.   It's not zero unless r is always zero. That would be if I sold you a dollar coin today for a dollar bill today.

I spin and get Y in return. Y is either zero or 2X (the probability of getting 2X is still smaller than getting zero, a casino gotta make profit). My change is Y-X, the casino's is X-Y. The net is zero regardless of whether I win or lose. So it's a zero sum game, but my expected value is negative and the casino's is positive. It's exactly the same thing as if the casino wrote me a contract (option) to payout Y if red comes up. I bought that contract for X. They are short one contact, I am long one. They either have to buy that contract back (from you or from someone else writing contacts who will then honor your contact) or honor the contract (allow you to exercise your option if red comes up). That's zero sum.\n\n If you add in my utility of U, now my change is Y-X+U and the casino (that does not care about my utility and only cares about money) still gets X-Y. The net sum is U.

They also address potential misunderstandings presented by u/OppressorOppressed, reinforcing the notion that while utility can be positive, the financial nature of options trading remains zero-sum.\n\nu/OppressorOppressed is not entirely wrong but seems to be conflating different concepts. Their argument that options can be a positive-sum game when used for hedging has some validity in terms of utility—like risk reduction or peace of mind. However, they overlook the fundamental financial principle that options trading, when measured strictly in dollars, is a zero-sum game. Gains for one party are matched by losses for the other.

It usually occurs if there's a problem with the model, and as soon as that problem is found out, the model gets corrected and alpha vanishes - which is why CAPM keeps getting additional terms tacked onto it. The other time you might see some alpha is when someone has an unexpectedly good or bad quarter and then next quarter their performance regresses to the mean. *Every* stock, security, mutual fund and hedge fund, without exception, runs into this exact problem - that is to say, the fact that alpha is illusory at absolute best. At the end of the day, if you don't have a diversified portfolio, what you're really doing is putting some chips on red or black. For retail investors, Alpha is not predictable, it's not a better approach, it's not something you can reasonably chase in any meaningful way, and it may not actually exist at all, so you may as well not worry about it. For commercial investors, the only Alpha that genuinely exists is the insider trading that happens before some kind of announcement. But by the time *you* hear about it, it's already priced in.\n\nSecond, it doesn't quite seem like you have a diverse portfolio. It sounds like you have a few concentrations in specific industrial sectors, so your investment correlation is quite high, which may increase your beta and standard deviation outside of an optimal or near-optimal envelope. A properly constructed diverse portfolio would do something like this in terms of your risk profile: https://imgur.com/s695O9Q. Ideally, you will have a capital allocation line tangent to the efficient frontier and then you push or reduce your leverage depending on your appetite for risk.

The US savings rate will continue to decline, as it has been for years, continuing debt issued by the federal government and households will be the only way to keep the system afloat.\n\nI cannot be certain of the consequences, but taxing the ultra-wealthy in this manner is in my view simply a band aid fix for the accomodative stance the US federal government has to take as the global consumer of last resort. It will make the accomodative policy more sustainable in the short term by keeping the federal budget somewhat in check, but it will only increase wealth of foreign purchasers of US assets in low wealth tax jurisdictions. So long as capital inflows are not taxed or limited in some way, this will be a detrimental policy long term.\n\nI am actually one of the staunchest proponents of taxing the ultra-wealthy, but to fix the problem we have to return to national economies with capital flow restrictions or extreme global governance of taxation, labour laws and other economic policies that cause unfair export-advantages for countries like Germany and China, while having severe drawbacks for the general population of deficit countries.\n\nI would still vote Democrat for many other reasons, and for the reason that Trump's economic policies aren't necessarily intelligent either, but the US establishment including Trump seems to be either completely unaware of the issue, finds it to difficult to solve, or is too influenced by the constituents that benefit from the current system (Financial sector and the foreign affairs establishment).

Then you buy something else with that loan or finance your lifestyle with it.
