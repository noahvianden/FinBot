Here's how they are used across different types of ML:\n\n* Deep Learning: These GPUs excel in training deep neural networks, which are fundamental to many areas of machine learning beyond LLMs, including image recognition, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning.\n\n* Computer Vision: NVIDIA's flagship GPUs are commonly used for tasks like object detection, image classification, segmentation, and more. They are particularly valuable in applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and security systems.\n\n* Generative Models: They are also used to train generative models such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), which are applied in areas like image and video synthesis, style transfer, and data augmentation.\n\n* Scientific Computing: These GPUs are employed in scientific research for simulations, modeling, and data analysis across disciplines like physics, chemistry, biology, and climate science.\n\n* Reinforcement Learning: NVIDIA's GPUs are often used to train agents in complex environments, such as those found in robotics, gaming, and finance, where the computational power is needed to handle the large amounts of data generated during simulations.\n\n* Natural Language Processing (NLP): Beyond LLMs, GPUs are used for a variety of NLP tasks including sentiment analysis, translation, and text summarization.\n\n* High-Performance Computing (HPC): In addition to ML, these GPUs are crucial for HPC tasks, where they accelerate workloads like molecular dynamics, fluid dynamics, and other simulations that require significant computational resources.\n\n* Data Analytics: These GPUs can also accelerate large-scale data processing tasks, enabling faster analysis and insights in fields like finance, marketing, and healthcare.\n\nIn summary, NVIDIA's flagship GPUs are powerful tools that support a wide array of machine learning and computational tasks beyond just LLMs, making them highly valuable across multiple industries and applications.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Amazon don't need AI.

How do you envision this full time trading working in a crash?\n\nI don't try to make too many profits when the market is down.  I think it's actually one of the hardest markets to trade.  If the market stays down for 2+ years, then I can see my portfolio being pretty idle.  But since 2019, this portfolio went through the covid crash, and 2022. Both which were pretty quick bear markets, but I've taken a lot of advantage of when the stock market was green.\n\nI think trying to make profits, or big plays, when the market is red is a bad mentality to be honest.  It requires a lot of timing and I suck at timing.  \n\nSo far, I've been able to trade through 2022 and covid crash, not-looking forward to more \"crashes\", but they're bound to happen.\n\n> Also how are you living on a 300K account on California? Do you have any other source of income?\n\nRight now my only income is from Twitch, Patreon, and a very new tastytrade marketing partnership!  Patreon is my main source of income.

If your bet was that the stock would trade flat (because put credit spreads also benefit here), then maybe we choose to be bullish instead on a stock instead of betting that its flat.

I have one other perspective though that I'd just like to bring up. Not to change your mind, but just my point of view.\n\nPeople love comparing results to hindsight metrics like 124% YTD.  If I knew that NVDA would go up 124% I would have just bought and held the stock or bought calls.  However, the trickiest part in these numbers, it assumes I would just put my entire portfolio in one stock to capture as most profit as I can of the future 124%.  However, that's very scary!  Not only because I'd be all in one stock but because I'd have to put a lot of capital into NVDA.  Saying I mainly trade NVDA is not entirely true.  It is the stock I captured the most premium on, but I've traded a LOT of AMD, COST, and plenty of other stocks that I put bets and money into as well.\n\nLastly, I think it's a bit unfair to compare and entire portfolio's performance to a individual stock performance like MBCLX.  I have stocks in my IRA YTD up 124% beating a lot of other people.
