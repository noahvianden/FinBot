Cerebras Systems, with their Wafer Scale Engine (WSE) technology, has certainly caught the attention of many in the AI and high-performance computing (HPC) space, including myself. Their unique approach to designing massive single-wafer chips challenges traditional chip designs and could potentially disrupt Nvidia's dominance in several areas:\n\n* **AI Model Training:** Cerebras claims the WSE can accelerate AI model training significantly, offering potentially faster and more efficient training compared to clusters of GPUs. This could be appealing to researchers and organizations developing large and complex AI models.\n* **HPC Simulations:** Cerebras has demonstrated impressive performance gains in specific HPC simulations, such as nuclear energy modeling. This suggests the WSE could challenge GPUs in scientific computing and research applications.\n* **Power Efficiency:** The WSE's unique architecture and large on-chip memory may offer significant power savings compared to traditional GPU-based systems, which could be attractive for data centers and other energy-conscious environments.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Nvidia remains a formidable competitor with a strong market presence and a vast ecosystem of software and hardware support. Cerebras faces challenges, including:\n\n* **Software Ecosystem:** Building a robust software ecosystem that supports the WSE and attracts developers is critical for widespread adoption. Nvidia has a well-established software ecosystem, which Cerebras needs to compete with effectively.\n* **Market Penetration:** Cerebras is still a relatively new player in the market. Gaining significant market share and convincing customers to switch from established GPU-based solutions will take time and effort.\n* **Cost:** While Cerebras claims the WSE can offer better performance per watt and potentially lower total cost of ownership, the upfront cost of their systems might be a barrier for some organizations.\n\nIn conclusion, Cerebras Systems and their WSE technology have the potential to disrupt Nvidia's business in several areas. However, Nvidia's strong market position and the challenges Cerebras faces mean that any significant disruption is likely to be a gradual process. The competition between these two companies will be an interesting one to watch in the coming years, and it could drive innovation and benefit the entire AI and HPC industry.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "they recently filed for IPO. i will be following the developments for sure. the way they explained it the blackwell  are some sort of frankensteined chips and calls for a new way of creating processors.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "*As of August 27, 2024, NVDA options have an IV of 67.62 % and an IV rank of 61.11%.

He recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla stock is stuck in a \"quagmire,\" prompting him to sell about $60 million worth of shares due to growing concerns about the carmaker's future.\n\nGerber, a vocal critic of Elon Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, revealed that he's reduced his Tesla holdings by about half, maintaining a $50 million stake. He cited a lack of confidence in Tesla's ability to achieve its goals, especially in selling more cars. \"I've been gradually lowering my position because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals they set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently,\" he said, downplaying the significance of Tesla's robotics and self-driving technology.Other Tesla investors are also becoming wary, with Tesla's stock down 13% this year amid declining sales, increased competition in China, and Musk's ongoing legal issues. Gerber noted that the market is saturated with used Teslas and mentioned his own difficulties in selling his Tesla at a fair price.\n\n\"It's really a quagmire when you have top-tier products but a CEO who's not fully engaged in the business or in selling cars,\" Gerber said. \"Sales are declining, and if you're expecting a stellar quarter, you're mistaken. Tesla is mainly selling cars at a discount now.\"\n\nDespite some analysts suggesting Tesla is undervalued as an AI company, Gerber is skeptical. He believes the demand for Tesla's humanoid robots will be minimal, especially given Musk's erratic behavior and his controversial overhaul of Twitter into X. \"The simplest way to gauge interest is to ask around, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' The answer is likely zero,\" Gerber remarked. \"Who would trust it? The last thing I need is a robot made by Elon Musk in my house.\" Musk's leadership has faced increasing scrutiny from both investors and lawmakers. Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board, urging them to ensure Musk is fulfilling his financial obligations to Tesla shareholders.\n\nSource: https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-investor-ross-gerber-says-234413902.html#:\\~:text=The%20shareholder%2C%20Ross%20Gerber%2C%20has,worth%20of%20his%20Tesla%20shares.", "id": "1f2jn76", "created_utc": 1724771782.0, "score": 457, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "Humanoid robots vs tasked designed robots is a horrible idea, it’s like asking a computer to use a keyboard to communicate with another computer.", "score": 142, "replies": [{"body": "Dude's hoping for a breakthrough to come along so he can sell iRobot. \n\nHe wants everyone to have one in their homes, doing chores, helping grandma... and paying him a monthly service fee plus updates and maintenance, and probably thinks it's a better sell to promise a catch all product than specifically designed machines for specific purposes, because we already have those and Elon sucks at inventing a new wheel... while admittedly being really good at buying one and hiring smart people to hammer away for him.\n\nThe goal is also probably to go \"look at this human looking robot that can replace your factory floor.

He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.\n\n\n\n\"Over time, I've just been sort of lowering my position, because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently, which is really to sell more cars,\" Gerber said, dismissing bullish talk on Tesla's robotics and full-self-driving tech. \"That's just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars, this year, and next year, and the year after, because none of this is coming anytime soon,\" he added.\n\n\n\nOther Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company's trajectory. Tesla's stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk's legal battles.\n\n\n\nGerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he'd been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.\n\n\n\n\"It's really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn't actually work there, who doesn't try to sell the cars,\" Gerber said, adding: \"We've seen sales go down, and that's what's happening. Sales are going down. If you're expecting a great quarter, you're wrong. They're not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.\"\n\n\n\nAnd while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla's humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.\n\n\n\n\"The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?\" Gerber said, adding: \"The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don't know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.\"\n\n\n\nMusk's leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years.

I should probably say something about maybe my views on climate change and oil and gas because I think they’re probably different from what most people would assume because my views are actually pretty, I think moderate in this regard, which is that I don’t think we should vilify the oil and gas industry and the people that have worked very hard in those industries to provide the necessary energy to support the economy. And if we were to stop using oil and gas right now, we would all be starving and the economy would collapse. So I don’t think it’s right to vilify the oil and gas industry. And the world has a certain demand for oil and gas, and it’s probably better if the United States provides that than some other countries, and it would help with prosperity in the US. And at the same time, obviously my view is like we do over time want to move to a sustainable energy economy because eventually, you run out of oil and gas. It’s not infinite, and there is some risk.\n\nI think the risk is not as high as a lot of people say it is with respect to global warming. But I think if you just keep increasing the cost per million in the atmosphere long enough, eventually it actually simply gets uncomfortable to breathe. People don’t realize this. If you go past a thousand parts per million of CO2, you start getting headaches and nausea. And so we’re now in the sort 400 range. We’re adding, I think about roughly two plus per million per year. So it still gives us… What it means is we still have quite a bit of time, so it’s not like we don’t need to rush and we don’t need to stop farmers from farming or prevent people from having steaks or-“\n\n\nThen Trump starts talking about how global warming is good because you get more oceanfront property and how we should be worried about nuclear warming (whatever that is).

{"title": "Intel board member quit after differences over chipmaker's revival plan", "selftext": "The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter.\n\nLip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to \"reprioritize various commitments\" and that he remained \"supportive of the company and its important work,\" in a regulatory filing on Thursday.\n\nThe former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations.\n\nOver time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. \n\nThe circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts.\n\nTan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report.\n\nIntel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders.\n\nFormer Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach.\n\nThis month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth.\n\nIntel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported.\n\nIntel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said.\n\nTo cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results.\n\nThe layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts.\n\nGelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022.\n\nTo Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago.\n\nTan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people.\n\nIntel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the \"only-the-paranoid-survive\" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said.\n\nIntel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027.\n\nAn attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully.\n\nWithout Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business.\n\nTan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said.\n\nIntel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers.\n\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms", "id": "1f2ji5j", "created_utc": 1724771447.0, "score": 407, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "Not a great article for shareholders.

Looking into Holographic DUV rather than going all in on EUV. This is what caused them to lose their market position. This was the result of bean counters hoping the cheaper process would be good enough, but while it worked the yield rates were too low causing it to become uneconomically viable and forcing intel to not shrink their chips for multiple generations to maintain economic viability.\n2. Some bug/oversight causing 13th & 14th gen chips to damage themselves slowly with overvoltage issues. They say they have it under control now with the new microcode update. Only time will tell if that is true.\n\nMistakes INVESTORS are worried about that we don't know the outcome of yet\n\n1. Massive investments into new fabs without a clear roadmap, clientele, etc who will use their contracting services. This makes their balance sheet look like shit and if they don't get some big clients this will be a gigantic waste of money.\n2. Their mistakes and anti-consumer approaches are degrading a core customer base in the server sector. AMD is also going after the server market more aggressively. This puts their long term market position in jeopardy.\n3. They are making a lot of long term bets on things like GPU's that are hemmoraging money. While I believe this is probably best for them in the long term; investors want their money this quarter and these types of plays are just not what they want to see.\n\nReasons to be optimistic\n\n1. Their current chips have honestly caught up to AMD. The 14th gen that aren't killing themselves match or exceed the top AMD chips in a wide variety of tasks. 7800X3D is overall best gaming GPU but after that there is a long list of great performance/$ cpu's from intel.\n2. The 9000 series from AMD is overall a bit of a dud. VERY little benefit over the 7000 series which a large part of the 14th gen already was beating. The 7800X3D still best for consumers and while most of the benefits for the 9000 series is for servers and heavey multi-threaded workloads the jump isn't particularly impressive and well below what we normally expect for a generational leap. If 15th generation even an average boost compared to 14th gen it's VERY likely intel takes a clear lead in the market.\n\nMy take. Intel is making multiple long term plays and people are getting super ancy because they have had 2 major mistakes in the last decade. These are really risky gambles with hundreds of billions of dollars and if even 1 of these turns out to be a complete failure it will be a huge issue for the company. By end of 2025 first service fabs will be online, battlemage gpu's will be out, and we will know if 15th gen is better than 9000 series or if they also stumble like AMD on this generational update.\n\nGiven the massive hits in their recent stock, there likely is a lot of upside potential IF they pull it off. The idea 'they are risk adverse' to me doesn't really track with their current heavy investment strategy. The culture might be 'risk adverse' but they are playing with fire here. Messing up and having another micro-code issue is something they CAN'T afford. AMD's messups are giving them an opportunity to regain their footing and we won't know how this plays out until probably end of next year.\n\nI expect the stock to go down or stay put until we see how these bets pay off and any investment in INTEL is just betting on this stuff working out. Only project that has me super worried for them is the contract fabs. It's REALLY not clear who they would be getting contract work from. Unless they get an Nvidia, Qualcomm, etc style client I honestly DON'T know how they can justify the cost and I just don't see any of those companies leaving TSMC in a serious capacity.

The bigger problem was once Pat came into play he was not focused on efficiency but solving the current issues with brute force. Meaning throwing as much money and people at it as possible. The issue that came into play that he slightly miscalculated how far Intel was actually behind. His famous philosophy back then was that by each generational cycle the competition came out Intel already offers 2. We can really see this in the current roadmap we're Intel comes out with new products in way under 12 months in each space.  When AMD and TSMC doesn't get their act together Intel will leapfrog them in 2025. This isn't the first time Intel has done this in its history. The issue now is that Intel is a long term play and in a currently not favorable position. Wall Street does not like that. They want fast money, fast quarterly results and don't care about anything else really. Now with the recent news about activist investors iam quite sure this news is fabricated by activist investors who manipulate the media in the background to gain shareholders favor. Don't fall for it. Intel wants to protect themselves from activist investors because they would try to split the company apart for the short term gain. If they would enter Intel is done. \n\nI really hope Pat will live long enough to see how what incredible work he has done. In 2025 we will see a very competitive Intel and in 2026 current Wallstreet critics will be very very silent. \n\nJust remember the fights Jensen had with Wallstreet back then.

It's the reason Apple left and started fabbing their own chip\n\nParallel computing, including NVIDIA's GPU technology, plays a significant role in addressing the challenges posed by the slowing down of Moore's Law. While Moore's Law predicted that the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years, resulting in performance gains, physical and technical limitations have slowed that trend in recent years, especially with traditional CPU architectures like Intel's x86 (8086/8064) processors.\n\nHere's how parallel computing helps:\n\n1. **Shifting from Single-Core to Multi-Core Performance**: Instead of relying solely on increasing clock speeds and transistor density, parallel computing distributes tasks across multiple cores. This allows systems to handle many operations simultaneously, which is a different approach from the linear speed gains Moore's Law originally envisioned.\n2. **GPUs as Parallel Processing Units**: NVIDIA's GPUs (graphics processing units) are designed for massively parallel computations. A single GPU can have thousands of cores working in parallel, enabling it to process large datasets and complex calculations more efficiently than a traditional CPU, which is typically optimized for serial processing. GPUs excel at tasks like deep learning, simulations, and rendering that benefit from parallelism.\n3. **Overcoming Physical Limits**: As traditional CPU advancements approach physical limitations (such as heat dissipation and quantum tunneling), GPUs and other parallel architectures offer an alternative route to continue improving performance, especially in areas like AI, machine learning, and scientific computing.\n4. **Heterogeneous Computing**: Combining CPUs with GPUs or other specialized hardware (like FPGAs or TPUs) creates heterogeneous systems that distribute tasks to the best-suited processor. This hybrid approach can squeeze more performance out of systems without relying on Moore's Law.\n\nIn essence, parallel computing doesn't solve the problem of Moore's Law but offers an alternative pathway for performance gains by distributing workloads across many cores. NVIDIA's advancements in GPU technology are part of the broader movement towards parallelism as a solution to the diminishing returns of traditional processor architectures like the x86 family.\n\nAs for Intel the foundry, how long is that going to take before it comes online? That also doesn't guarantee they will deliver the same quality. Jensen said no one is catching up to TSMC.\n\nI believe intel will go lower as NVIDIA continues to develop an ecosystem around parallel computing that will take away revenue from Intel. \n\nThen Qualcomm, ARM,  and Apple attacking the consumer line.\n\nAMD is the threat on the gamer line. \n\nIntel hasn't articulated a plan to address all these threats and their own limitations, especially with the tapering of Data Center revenue.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don't think it's a bad price here... pretty much all bad news baked in so mostly upside I think from here...  can probably make more here than Nvidia now as this can easily double out in a year or two whereas for Nvidia or tsm not highly likely to double and in interim you can sell weekly covered to earn extra while holding.  no financial advice here as this can go either way..", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If youre bag holding or youve got some money to park somewhere that could payoff 1-3 years down the line, then INTC is the stock for you.

Additional rate cuts can precede even more market drop, but there truly isn't a direct universal correlation, because it's about larger context. Look at 2007, which is a similar analog to today in some ways - prior to rate cuts in Sept, the market dropped 2-3 weeks (and we may see that again here), then markets surged on the cut announcement, went up to new all time highs (which we may also see again here as of Sept-Oct, like S&P to 5800? 5900?). After the all time high peak, stocks then started their 18 month drop, even as rates kept dropping in salvage mode.  Here now, the S&P could easily touch <3900 into next year before a strong rebound, based on chart setups. No guarantees of course, but hence why I think it's best to wait and watch a bit, risk is legitimately high going forward here.\n\nWatch the bond rates too, which are a leading indicator to the Fed funds rate (or watch TLT going upward ahead as an inverse, it is set up to continue a new up trend). Fed rate changes always lag, but the bond rates dropping are also cluing in a weak economy ahead, not strong. Rate cuts in this environment actually reduce govt interest expenditure which is a massive source of liquidity that gets funneled into markets, essentially draining liquidity that the markets need to keep going up, and spurred-on private borrowing on lower rates (if it even happens) isn't going to overpower that in a weakening environment.\n\nSimilar to 2007 as well, and 2000, the technical chart pattern itself  (in each major index, SPX, NQ, RTY) is now one of completing a multi-year run pattern, and at a large degree scale, not mid-run or starting a new run. I think a lot of people feel like it's 2016-17 about to repeat, rather than 2000 or 2007-08. But this is a different market context now than the last 10-12 years, much more akin to 2007 in pattern, or more so 2000 in context and aftermath - or even 1929, but I doubt we see any straight plunge like '29, more like a grind down and up with multiple plunges. There are no crystal balls obviously, just correlated clues and patterns, but together it hints at a rough risk:reward skew going forward, and a rough frustrating and quite volatile buy-and-hold environment for the next decade, like holding through the 1970s or 2000s, maybe worse, though there would surely be some very strong swings upward.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "80%.\n\nThink about it.

So let's say I expect LUNR to go to $10+ over the next 4-5 months, through the next launch (which I basically do, and would be curious your thoughts on this point). Would selling covered calls actually not be the thing to do in this scenario then? Because we are bullish on it for next few months? Or do we sell covered calls for like a year or two out maybe? Because we know it will drop back down at some point after next launch and probably continue up and down some for next year before it starts really taking off?

{"title": "Why NVDA is going to moon for next 2 quarters", "selftext": "* In the last quarter(s), the big five have raised Capex spending on AI, and their guidance shows even higher Capex spending on AI infra.\n* There is a race to capture AI offerings between Google, Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, and other upstarts. Neither can give up that race, even if it means more infra spending. For example, Google's stock fell 20% over a small bug in their AI offering. \n* The LLM model sizes are increasing multifold, requiring more/better GPUs, which means more business for NVIDIA. The previous models are mostly useless.\n* Assemblers like SMCI have projected a doubling of sales in their recent earning, even with lower margins. \n* Nvidia keeps an insane margin and keeps raising it. Their ability to tell a story around the lower cost to operate, including net energy and compute has been bought by the market. Huangs says it is cheaper to run AI operations with a million-dollar Nvidia chip than a free chip from a competitor. \n* There is still no competition to either Nvidia chips or the Cuda programming and libraries that almost everyone uses for GPU ops. Nvidia has a 10-year lead on GPU programming and open libraries.\n* **A reversal of this trend would have telltale signs. None exist.**\n\nTldr: Nvidia will beat the earnings and raise.
