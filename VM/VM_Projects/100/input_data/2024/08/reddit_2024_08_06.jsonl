{"title": "Elon Musk’s support for Trump pushes a corporate customer away from Tesla ", "selftext": "European drugstore giant Rossmann announced Tuesday it will no longer buy Tesla’s electric vehicles for its fleet, effective immediately, citing CEO Elon Musk’s pro-Trump political support.\n\nRossmann, based in Germany, said in a statement that its decision was “based on the incompatibility between the statements of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the values ​​that Tesla represents with its products.”\n\n“Elon Musk makes no secret of his support for Donald Trump,” Raoul Rossmann, a spokesperson for the company, said in a statement. “Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax - this attitude is in stark contrast to Tesla’s mission to contribute to environmental protection through the production of electric cars.”\n\nWhile Rossmann only purchases about 180 electric vehicles a year — and only had 38 Teslas in its fleet according to Bloomberg — the company’s decision to cut all Tesla EV purchases shows that Musk’s political decisions have begun to impact the automaker well beyond the U.S.\n\nMusk formally endorsed Trump last month, and said he was contributing funds to a pro-Trump group he helped create called America PAC. Musk is also slated to interview the former president, Trump announced on Tuesday.\n\nDuring a debate with President Biden in June, former President Trump dodged questions about what he would do, if anything, to combat climate change. And Trump has called climate change a “hoax.” He has also promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate agreement, as he did during his presidency, if he is re-elected in November.\n\nAccording to ongoing research by Morning Consult, Republicans in the U.S. began to view Musk more favorably following his leveraged buyout of Twitter (now known as X) in late 2022. However, this has not driven an increase in Republican’s “purchasing consideration” of electric vehicles here. According to Pew Research, Musk’s reputation with left-leaning voters has declined even though they are far more likely to purchase an EV.\n\nRossman’s decision follows a recent survey that found a deterioration in Tesla’s brand, attributed partly to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” While Tesla’s revenue increased 2% during the second quarter, automotive revenue dropped 7% to $19.9 billion from $21.27 billion in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nTesla opened a factory in 2022 in Brandenburg, Germany (outside of Berlin) and employs thousands in the country. At the end of 2023, the drugstore chain Rossmann reported that it had more than 4,700 stores and more than 60,000 employees with about half in Germany.\n\nTesla has faced protests by environmental activists in Germany who took issue with the company’s plans to cut down part of a forest and to use water for manufacturing in Brandenburg. Musk lashed out at protesters there, saying on X in March they’re “either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they’re puppets of those who don’t have good environmental goals.”\n\nTesla, Musk and representatives for Rossmann did not respond to requests for further details on Thursday morning.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/06/elon-musks-trump-support-pushes-a-corporate-customer-away-from-tesla.html", "id": "1eluzkf", "created_utc": 1722982672.0, "score": 3525, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 191, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The one for TSLA I'm watching is the 9/20 230C. As of now, there's 51654 contracts worth $675 each or $35M. With a delta of 30, that's associated with 1.55M shares or $310M. (The shorter dated ones can move just as many shares or more but for much less.)\n\nIf TSLA doesn't break $230 those slowly decay away and MM sells those 1.55M shares just for that strike. If TSLA goes past $230 and gets those ITM, then MM has to fully hedge those and increase their shares from 1.55M to 5.16M shares.\n\nThis is why anything with high options volume on a regular basis usually ends at nice round numbers. People buying and selling real shares for portfolios doesn't matter compared to how many shares MM has to hedge for options volume and interest.\n\nAs for the big moves, Say there's a lot of TSLA 230C. As long as we were above that, MM hedges all those calls with lots shares, people feel good with momentum so keep buying more shares and calls. Something bad happens like bad earnings or Japan blowing up and drops it below that 230C. Now MM doesn't have to hedge for those calls anymore, selling all those shares, dropping share price even more. Then momentum is to the downside and now people are selling their calls, buying puts (as evidenced by the elevated VIX) and now MM has to sell/short shares to hedge that way.\n\nThis isn't isolated to TSLA, and you can see the high interest levels on QQQ and SPY as well. Then combine that with the Japan carry trade with people borrowing and investing/speculating billions, you can see how much potential fuckery can happen to the up and down side.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Forgot options from the equation but you're right and thanks for the helpful analysis of TSLA specific options, I hadn't looked at the option chain myself.

Ants marched in disciplined lines, spiders crafted their intricate webs, and beetles polished their exoskeletons, preparing for another day. To the bugs, the world was a vast expanse of wonders and dangers, punctuated by the presence of the Lumbering Giants.  \n\nThe Lumbering Giants, known to humans as people, were both a mystery and a constant source of awe. From the bugs’ vantage point, these colossal beings seemed like living mountains, their movements slow and deliberate, like tectonic plates shifting above. Most bugs couldn’t decide if the Giants were gods or merely part of the natural order, like the wind or the sun.  \n\nGerald, a wise old beetle with a knack for storytelling, often gathered the young bugs around to share tales of the Giants. “Some say they are eternal,” he began. “I have seen them every summer of my life, and they never seem to change.”  \n\nFluffy, a daring young ant, stared up in awe. “Look at the size of it! Do you think it knows we’re here?” \n\nBetsy, a pragmatic spider, scoffed. “They don’t notice us any more than we notice the dirt beneath our feet.”  \n\nAs the Giant knelt and extended a colossal hand, the bugs couldn’t help but feel the weight of its presence. The Giant’s fingers, each the size of a fallen branch, delicately plucked a leaf, revealing Bugville in all its glory. To the bugs, this simple act was akin to a divine revelation.\n\nThe elder bugs, who had witnessed the Giants’ actions over the seasons, debated their nature. “They are eternal,” one proclaimed. “I have seen the same Giant every summer of my life. They never age, never falter.”\n\nFluffy, ever curious, whispered, “Maybe they live forever, like the points of light in the sky. Or maybe they just move so slowly compared to us.”\n\nThe debate was interrupted as the Giant, having completed its inscrutable task, rose and lumbered away. In its wake, the ground bore the deep imprints of its footsteps. Soon, water collected in these shallow craters, and a small ecosystem began to flourish. Detritivores moved in, feeding on the organic matter stirred up by the Giant’s presence. To the bugs, it seemed like a miracle—a sudden oasis of life.\n\nGerald, reflecting on the encounter, gathered the young bugs once more. “We may never understand the Giants,” he said thoughtfully. “To us, they are like the wind or the sun. But maybe it is enough to know that we share this world with them, however briefly.”\n\nThe young bugs nodded, their imaginations sparked by Gerald’s words. Fluffy, ever the dreamer, wondered aloud, “Do you think they ever look at us and wonder what we are?”\n\nBetsy, spinning her web, smiled. “Perhaps they do, Fluffy. Perhaps they do.”\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows over Bugville, the bugs noticed something unusual. A Giant returned, carrying a large, cylindrical object. It placed the object on the ground and left. The bugs gathered around, curious.\n\nThe object began to hum and emit a soft, warm glow. The bugs felt an unfamiliar sense of calm wash over them. Fluffy marveled, “This must be another gift from the Giants! Look how it glows like the Moon, making our night bright and warm!”\n\nGerald nodded slowly, his eyes reflecting the light. “Perhaps it is, Fluffy. Perhaps it is.”\n\nAs night fell, the bugs of Bugville settled into a peaceful slumber, bathed in the gentle glow of the Giant’s mysterious gift. To them, it was a time of tranquility and wonder. Little did they know, the object was simply a human’s forgotten flashlight, left behind and slowly losing its charge.\n\nBugville thrived in its newfound light, blissfully unaware of the impermanence of their miracle.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "that was heartwarming, I was expecting the Giant left behind some kind of RAID bug deathtrap for Bugville- the relief spread through me in an awesome wave.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "yeah i wanted to make people just a little nervous hah. im not gonna kill any bugs don’t worry.\n\nalthough imagining what diatomaceous earth would do firsthand.. yikes", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Sold my Nike I bought when Tesla got called away at 240. \n\nTook 2% loss but got my Tesla shares back. ", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1820851090138505570?s=46&t=mG-wx8ewMg03AyZIsmD4-g\n\nElon became streetfighter lawyer himself lmao", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "RICO act ? lol\n\n![gif](giphy|RMxqGPaXWey2I|downsized)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nMore and more delusional as this goes on.
