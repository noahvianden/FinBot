Countless bets and risky manoeuvres were done just to survive another day, or another month. The difference between a \"good\" company vs another laughing stock was heavily due to luck and is in no way repeatable.\n\nWhen Nvidia had to develop RIVA 128, which should take 24 months, but they only had 9 months to live, so they gambled their money on Ikos that's also going out of business, giving Ikos 3 more months to live and cutting Nvidia's life to only 6...and hope their product was perfect. What if it wasn't perfect when it was taped out? They had no money or time left to check the actual chip. They emulated it virtually, pretended it was a real chip without ever testing a physical product before shipping to customers, and then they just put all their money into production day 1. What if even one small bug occurred, given all the development and QA were nothing but theoretical emulation? Per Jensen's own words when they received the chip: \"The chip came back, and fortunately...fortunately, it basically worked...it basically worked....\"\n\nMicrosoft specified 32 different blend modes for DirectX at the time. They were compatible with a whopping 8. Nvidia basically contacted every developer they can get their hands on in the world and begged them to never use any of the other 24, to please figure out a way with the functional 8, or else they will be dead. What if even one big time dev didn't get the memo or didn't feel like wasting time on this one company that's already being ignored by everyone, and focused on the other 90 better companies that actually are worth believing in given all the industry insight they had?\n\nTruth is, nobody knows how things could have gone. The wind could have blown in the wrong direction, contaminated a few silicon, or that small team of people got sick, inhibiting their mental/physical abilities during those crucial development times and there's that.

Once all of that is checked, make a post on WSB showcasing your data. Tell people what you are doing and what you plan to do, but do not advertise. Ask people if they are interested in taking part of a community that works to perfect this program. It may not be relevant in your case, but it could be an option. I don‚Äôt know what you have done exactly or what you are doing, but I am telling you things that I have done in a very similar situation. My mission was similar, yet the topic was slightly different. I have been building two algorithms in the span of five months, one of which is in the final stages of testing and perfection while the other is in development, tasked at finding perfect trades during different conditions. One finds the most volatile stocks and recommends day trades before fluctuations of more than 50% occur in price in some stocks. Examples that were caught early were FFIE, ZAPP, and SERV (not ASTS unfortunately), while the other recommends trades at earnings call for a stock. Both algorithms, especially the earnings one, utilize multiple indicators and data points (including IV, option volume and others) to predict movements which people can use to their advantage while choosing contracts that expire the soonest. I managed to put together a community of 300 within a week. Even after much trial and error, I have only lost ~30 people to date. I never charged anyone a dollar nor ever profited yet gained so much aid from many people who all pitched in to improve the products. I don‚Äôt know if this helps or if you find it bollocks, but here you go!

So, he‚Äôs already well in-the-money with a lot of time left until January. He probably bought the $20 call around when the actual price of the stock was $20, so if the price hadn‚Äôt risen to $31, he‚Äôd have paid money for no gain so far. If the stock had only risen to $21, he could have bought the shares for a dollar profit per share PLUS the money he paid for the option contract to begin with, so it matters how much the contract cost. If the contract cost $500, he‚Äôd still be in the hole $400, so in this example, he was wagering $500 that the stock price would rise to $25.01 or higher before the expiration in January. In this example, he would have a single dollar of profit (at 25.01, since 1 cent x 100 shares is a dollar) minus the commission that the brokerage charges. \n\nWhen you buy an option, you have the right to buy the stock at the strike price, but you aren‚Äôt obligated to. The risk is that you pay money for the contract but the underlying share price doesn‚Äôt move high enough to be profitable before it expires. Instead of exercising the option and acquiring the shares, he can sell the option to someone else for a profit, since the contract has risen in value. The contract would be worth roughly $1,100, since it lets you buy the stock at $20 and you can then turn around and sell the stock right now for the current market price, which is roughly $31. 31 - 20 = 11 x 100 shares = 1,100, so he would have a gain of roughly $600. Since OP started buying contracts when the stock price was around $2 in May and it has since went up to ~$37 this past week, and he kept rolling the profit into new contracts along the way, you can begin to see how $150 turned into $10,000+\n\nEdit: after looking again, the latest contract he bought was at a $15 strike, not $20, but the concept still stands", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "But why bother rolling?

But, he may have wanted to sell it in order to realize the profit into cash instead of having the gain on paper, because it‚Äôs hard to know when the price has reached its high. Like for example, this past week it hit $37 but quickly leveled to $31. Keep in mind that as the actual stock price fluctuates, so will the corresponding option contracts. If he was a master at timing the markets, he could have potentially sold a contract/position right before a dip in the underlying stock price, and then immediately bought back the same option contract for a lower price, essentially earning money and still keeping the ability to buy the stock later for that same low $20 (but now at a reduced cost basis, because of the cheaper contract)", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "I‚Äôm not the guy who originally asked, but I just wanted to say thanks.

Most likely it‚Äôs someone covering their short position that‚Äôs out-of-the-money (the bad put), again, just from what I know. \n\nBut yeah, if he really can‚Äôt sell it for its intrinsic value, he can always just exercise and then sell the shares to realize his profit. If the contract is in the money by at least one cent, his brokerage will automatically exercise his option for him upon expiration, unless he specifically tells them not to, so he won‚Äôt ever accidentally let the option ‚Äùexpire‚Äù and lose his profits. \n\nIf he doesn‚Äôt have the cash to afford exercising and buying the shares, then it gets more complicated. Some brokers will close out the position by trying to sell it for you. Some will let you buy the shares on margin, I believe, if you have enough margin available. Some brokers will let you buy the shares and then place your account in a ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù state if you don‚Äôt have the margin to cover the purchase, for committing a ‚Äúfreeriding violation‚Äù. This means you cannot use margin and everything must be paid for with cash for a certain amount of time, I believe it‚Äôs 60 days. \n\nBut, the main thing to know here is that if you *don‚Äôt* actually want to hold the shares, you should always sell the contract before it expires. You won‚Äôt have to worry about having cash or margin to cover the purchase after exercise, and you‚Äôll typically earn more money, especially if you sell the option with some time left before it expires, because you‚Äôll earn money on the *time value* that‚Äôs remaining\n\nEdit: somewhat related: Also, you should always try to remember to close/sell call options that are out-of-the-money instead of just letting them expire worthless. What can happen is, you assume the option will expire worthless, but the stock rises some at the very last minute of trading and is now in-the-money by a few cents. Your broker will then exercise the option for you. Then, if you‚Äôre unlucky, the share price can fall back down below the strike price that you just bought it at in after hours trading or over the weekend, and now you‚Äôre holding shares at a loss on top of paying for the ‚Äòlosing‚Äô option contract.

If the stock price stays below the strike price, you keep the premium and your shares. If it rises above the strike price, you sell your shares at the strike price, potentially making a profit on the shares plus the premium.This obligates you to sell your stock at a specific price if the stock price rises above the strike price, capping your upside potential but generating income through the premium received from selling the call.\n\nCash-Secured Puts:\nHow it works: You sell put options on a stock you wouldn‚Äôt mind owning.\nProfit potential: You collect the premium from selling the put options. If the stock price stays above the strike price, you keep the premium. If it falls below, you buy the stock at the strike price, potentially at a discount\n\nProtective Puts:\nHow it works: You buy put options on the shares you own.\nProfit potential: This strategy acts as insurance. If the stock price falls, the put option increases in value, offsetting some of your losses.This gives you the right to sell your stock at a specific price (strike price), providing downside protection if the stock price falls.\n\nCollars:\nHow it works: This strategy involves holding the underlying stock while simultaneously buying a protective put option and selling a call option...You buy a protective put and sell a covered call simultaneously.\nProfit potential: The collar strategy effectively limits both your potential losses and gains, creating a protective ‚Äúcollar‚Äù around your investment. You earn a premium from the call option and have downside protection from the put option.\n\nTo protect your investment from both a downswing and an upswing, you might consider using a collar strategy. \n\nI am not a licensed financial advisor, broker, or formally trained in options trading.

{"title": "Bicycle Therapeutics (BCYC) is a tenbagger", "selftext": "**Introduction:**  \nBicycle Therapeutics is a UK-based pharma company working on precision-guided therapeutics that penetrate deep into tissues and target cancer cells. The company is currently valued at $1.55 billion and has a few drugs in the pipeline, that said we will only focus on \"BT8009\" also known as \"Zelenectide pevedotin\" because this is the crucial one.  \nPipeline: [https://www.bicycletherapeutics.com/pipeline/pipeline/](https://www.bicycletherapeutics.com/pipeline/pipeline/)  \nThe company has a strong balance sheet with $918m net cash if we subtract the debt.\n\n**Zelenectide Pevedotin formerly known as BT8009:**  \nThe drug is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) currently in phase 2/3. It targets the nektin-4 molecule that is overexpressed in cancer cells. The drug enters the cancer cell, binds to nektin-4 and releases the toxin that then kills the cell.\n\nThe company Seagen (now owned by Pfizer) developed the first ADC that made it to market called  \"Padcev\". Padcev made them almost $400m last quarter, this means this one drug will make them about $1.2 billion a year, which translates to $900m in net profits assuming a 75% profit margin.  \nIn a press release posted in May 2024 ( [https://investors.bicycletherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bicycle-therapeutics-present-pharmacokinetic-and-safety](https://investors.bicycletherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bicycle-therapeutics-present-pharmacokinetic-and-safety) ) Bicycle Therapeutics releases some study results that show that BT8009 is better than Padcev in many ways. This means that if this drug gets to market it will be able to directly compete with Padcev and any other cancer drug of this type.\n\n**The risk/reward:**  \nThe obvious risk is that there are some unknown sideeffects that come to light and the drug does not get approved and the stock tanks -60% in one day. The current failure rate of phase 3 cancer drugs is around 50%.  \nIf the drug gets approved the company is probably worth $15 billion or more, that translates to a $200+ share price.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEssentially its a coinflip: 50% chance i lose 60% of my investment or 50% chance i make 10 times my money. Thats a bet I take all day.\n\n*Disclosure: I am personally long the stock, my cost basis is around $22 per share.*", "id": "1ev29in", "created_utc": 1723960780.0, "score": 179, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 169, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Someone just tell me when they test the drugs or whatever so I know what date to buy my calls for", "score": 227, "replies": [{"body": "The company will release results in 9-12 months if everything goes according to plan.", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "Morgan Freeman Narrator: ¬†But of course it wouldn‚Äôt go according to plan at all.", "score": 283, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 25, "replies": []}, {"body": "right on", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "ü§£", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Theta gang coming for u", "score": 23, "replies": []}, {"body": "Any update?

If it was obvious what direction a drug would go in trials, those developing it would make better bets on investing in 8-9 figure clinical trials.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "I've been fucked by CRSP and Humanigen, good luck to anyone who invests in Bio - you need balls of steel", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nectin-4 is a popular target these days; overexpressed in bladder but also breast, pancreatic, esophageal, nsclc.. it‚Äôs a surface protein/transmembrane glycoprotein, meaning that no internalization is actually required to bin initially.

I think their radioconjugates will be much more interesting. The radiotherapeutics space has experienced some very significant (7-8 bn in purchases by bms, Lilly, AZ, (Bayer) just to catch up with Novartis)\n\nAnd while those programs are still in preclinical, they will be very interesting as they do not need any internalization of using alpha or beta emitting particles.\n\nWhere do you think will EV (Padcev) expand to first?

Most RICs are using Lutecium which is a beta emitter, but there seems to be a slow push in the field towards alpha particles of which actinium is one of the preferred isotopes.  \n\nActinium is extremely scare and considered one of the most expensive elements to buy or create. Getting and maintaining a supply line of actinium could prove challenging for them and or small biotech startups. \n\nAnother challenge is that the field is extremely new and a lot of the science is still up for debate. Some of the most basic questions like what is the max dose that normal tissue and organs can handle is still being based off of external beam therapy guidelines that can be helpful, but are a completely different modality. Another basic question that‚Äôs up for debate is whether or not dosimetry to determine absorbed is even needed. \n\nAll said, personally, I think these are some major issues for a small startup to deal with and probably the big pharma companies are probably better suited to handle these problems as they have more resources to throw at them.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Low volume stock OP is trying to pump and dump", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/8sa7cow5cfjd1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac5fc7fb4221e10009e5549a0dc2dba40764d149\n\nAm I regarded?
