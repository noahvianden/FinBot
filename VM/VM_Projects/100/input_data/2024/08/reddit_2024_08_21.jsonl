{"title": "Market Rally Has Only Just Begun", "selftext": "This post was [originally published](https://sam-weiss.com/market-rally-has-only-just-begun/) at [www.sam-weiss.com](http://www.sam-weiss.com](http://www.sam-weiss.com))\n\nYesterday morning, I published a reddit post entitled ‚ÄúSharp, Short-Lived Sell-off Coming‚Äù where I conclude that we‚Äôre likely to see a good sized 3-4% pull-back on the NASDAQ-100 and a $10-$15 pull-back in NVDA. The reasons for that are pretty straight-forward.¬†\n\nFirst, the indices (QQQ/SPY/Dow) are all very overbought in the nearly vertical rally we‚Äôve seen since August 5. They‚Äôve all hit extremely overbought territory in the hourly RSI. In most cases, that tend‚Äôs to precede a near-term sharp sell-off. Not always, but in the overwhelming majority of the cases. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôll see. NVDA is also deeply overbought. The most we‚Äôve seen in 6-months in fact. You can read more about that in¬†yesterday's post.\n\nSecond, there‚Äôs an identifiable trend in the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) that is very well established. The QQQ doesn‚Äôt tend to trade sideways or linger after a correction. It almost always immediately rebounds and that rebound is generally very robust. In most cases, we see a good 10-15% rebound from the lows in the first 25-days after bottoming, a sharp pull-back and then another leg higher. So that trend is also in play. In just 12-13 trading days, the QQQ is already up 14.62%. That‚Äôs an insane rally off the lows without even a small pull-back.¬†\n\nAnyway, those are the¬†main reasons why I expect we‚Äôll see a sharp pull-back fairly soon. We‚Äôre talking before next week and definitely before NVDA earnings. In fact, I suspect NVDA will both pull-back and then go right back to its highs before it goes into its actual earnings date. We‚Äôll likely be higher as we head into earnings.¬†\n\n# Why Near-Term Forecast Are Important\n\nNow here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt think came through in my post and what I‚Äôd like to mention today. First off, you‚Äôll never ever hear me advocate trading any near-term move. Never hear me advocating shorting which I think is almost always a losing proposition. Just not worth it to ever short anything ever. The overall risk-reward imbalance is almost always to the upside. The market is up 66% of the time. So not smart to ever short anything. Especially not NVDA as that would be insane. We‚Äôll get into why later on. Suffice it to say, that wasn‚Äôt the point of the forecast I published yesterday.¬†\n\nThe point is to feel secure in one‚Äôs position when a sell-off does happen. For example, if we know the markets generally pull-back sharply after being overbought or after a 10-15% move off the lows and then that pull-back actually occurs as forecasted, we don‚Äôt need to sit around and speculate (or be unsure) as to the reasons. If you understand the reasons for that pullback, then it provides security and confidence in your position.¬†\n\nFor example, right now we know that the coming pull-back is expect to be just a minor blip in an overall massive move higher that is likely developing and will develop in the coming months. It‚Äôs also to give anyone on the sidelines a window in which to make an entry into the market if they weren‚Äôt long to begin with.¬†\n\nAnd I think it‚Äôs really important to highlight just how critical security in one‚Äôs position really is. Reading through the NVDA-Stock Reddit page, I was surprised by the number of people who were almost shaken out of their position in NVDA all due to what was very obviously a regular correction. If you‚Äôre able to understand the difference been real risk to the markets and a relatively benign correction, you‚Äôre less likely to make emotionally driven or irrational decisions.¬†\n\nI had a few people mention to me in my inbox that they were almost shaken out of their position on¬†August 4-5 upon seeing the markets down 4% in overnight trading. NVDA pushed all the way down to $90 a share. But if you‚Äôve been through 30+ corrections over decades of trading, you start to get a real sense of what is a regular correction and what is a crash. It‚Äôs usually told in the volume and the size of the selling pressure early on in the correction. A regular correction slowly develops and then escalates as we arrive at capitulation. A crash or bear market typically begins with very heavy selling at the outset. See how the Covid crash in 2020 developed and how the 2022 bear market began for example. In both cases, we saw extreme selling almost immediately. There are also a wide number of key technical indicators that reach extremes. We saw none of that here. We didn‚Äôt even see a real distribution day. Not once in this past correction.¬†\n\nAnyway, the point here is that security is the point. The take away is to not get shaken if you see NVDA pull-back from $135 down to $120 or something. It‚Äôs all nonsense. And that brings me to the main point of this article.¬†\n\n# The New Rally Has Only Begun\n\nWe‚Äôve only just begun a new rally in the stock market. The typical rally lasts 40-trading days on average. During this recently secular bull run that began in December 2022 or January 2023, the segmented rallies have been significantly longer than usual. We‚Äôve had rallies that lasted 90 sessions, 70-sessions and 103 sessions. The most recent rally only lasted 40 sessions which is the typical average between corrections. We‚Äôre only at session 12 and we‚Äôve only moved up around 15%. You can expect the QQQ to rally a good 25-30% on this leg up. That‚Äôs another $60 or from here. NVDA is likely to move higher with the QQQ. It‚Äôs certainly not going to see market headwinds.¬†\n\nThat being said, one thing worth mentioning ‚Äî and we‚Äôll cover this in a separate post as it bears some attention ‚Äî there is the potential risk of this being a double-correction. In most cases, we get a correction, we get a bottom and the market simply sustains a v-recovery and we go on our merry way. That‚Äôs the typical situation in most corrections. But there have been some instances where we go back down and retest the lows. That could happen here. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very likely as we‚Äôve seen a very convincing and robust move off the lows. That tells me we‚Äôre probably going to new highs. But anytime we get a near-term pull-back, we‚Äôre going to have to do some analysis on the selling pressure and make a determination on whether it‚Äôs a retest or just a minor blip. This upcoming pull-back we should see in the coming 1-7 days will give us a sense of that.

Unless something truly fundamentally shifting happens, earnings will only have a near-term impact and NVDA will continue ahead in its general direction.  A delay isn't a fundamental shift. It's a small blip.\n\nA fundamental shift would be like NVDA coming out and saying that it's customer's aren't making money and are likely scaling back spending in the future. That would be bad.\n\nWhat we saw this past month was driven by a market correction.  It wasn't just NVDA falling. The entire market was taking a huge beating.  A 16% correction to be exact.  When the market moves lower in a correction, bad news takes center stage.  But it's important to understand that it's not the bad news that drives the stock lower. It's the stock selling off in lock-step with the market that drives bearish sentiment which in turn points to bad news as the reason.\n\nWhen the market is rallying, bad news is brushed aside and any piece of good news is highlighted.

We don‚Äôt have all that many past historical events where the fed started cutting rates leading to a peak in the market.  \n\nAnd what‚Äôs more, the last few times we‚Äôve seen that happen, there were a lot of other things happening in the world.  \n\nFor example, in the Greenspan era, we had the housing bubble and financial crisis.  The fed was forced to cut rates due to the Fanny/Freddy fiasco back in the summer of 2007 and that eventually lead to the Bear Stearns collapse and ultimately the financial crisis. \n\nThe fed was behind the curve back then and it was ultimately their own doing.  The underlying problems were taking place as they were raising rates.  \n\nThis current fed had very legitimate reason for raising rates in 2022 and have equally legitimate reasons to begin cutting.  \n\nThe point here is that those two markets don‚Äôt quite match up.  \n\nWhat‚Äôs more, there was a very big lag effect between when the fed began cutting rates in summer 2007 and when the market peaked in late 2008.  It was a good 4-6 months between those two things.  \n\nCertain segments of the market peaked in January 2008 ahead of the Bear Stearns collapse.  The fed began cutting rates in Aug-September 2007.  But remember, the fed was hawkish up until August 2007 when credit conditions began tightening.  I remember that period well.  It was one of my best trades ever.  I got super long a basket of different stocks (January options) across the board in Aug 2007 and it all paid off by Nov 2007.  \n\nBut really various segments in market were in okay shape throughout much of 2008 even. In August 2008 (a year after the fed began cutting), all of the big tech stocks like google and Apple were within a few percentage pints of their highs only a single month away from the financial crisis.  \n\nThe character of the Bernanke fed and that economic environment was very different than today.  The Bernanke fed went from hawkish to dovish in a single month driven by rapidly deteriorating financial conditions.  \n\nThe Powell fed has largely been very dovish and these upcoming rate cuts have been expected for nearly 6-8 months now.  The Powell fed is by no means ‚Äúforced‚Äù like Bernanke had been.  \n\nIn 2007, it all happened very dramatically as the fed was forced to take action during a big market sell-off in August 2007.  \n\nAnd again, even in that situation, there was a big lag period between when the fed cut and when the market actually rolled over.  \n\nI make this point because I‚Äôve heard this whole thing before.

Don't get tricked into chasing falling knives (learned that one more than once).  Buy only the best of breed and buy anytime they are in the lower end of their 52 week chart. My largest holding is Costco, JPM, MSFT, Avgo, NVDA, Home depot.  Followed by some more random but great companies, Texas Roadhouse, Parker Hannifin, Lilly, Vertex pharma, Chubb, Kinsale Capital...\n\nDo not get emotional.  Don't listen to Bias. Do your research, live and die by your research.  I made one of the dumbest mistakes and sold 3/4 of my NVDA at $800.00 got caught up in the 400% gains and worried about protecting them, set a really tight stop loss (4%) and they sold.

You're going to be in your '50s by the time you have just $1 million \n\nTo make real money you need inherited wealth or you need to work in a job that has the potential of paying an extremely high salary so you can compound your wealth at a lower return and still do well. If you can land a six-figure job and live frugally, your ability of getting your first million by the time you're 40 is fairly substantial. Moving on\n\n if we look at people who have actual wealth, 50 million maybe. They only need to take 10 million of that and put it in TLT, 4% a year dividend payment. That's $400,000 a year they get for sitting around and buying the bottom of the bond market. They still have another 40 million full of property investments, other shares they hold. The rate they can compound their wealth is so far beyond what the average person could ever achieve. This little story right here is why we have such wealth inequality and why it's only going to get worse as time goes on. Think about the amount of assets this person can buy.

Time, inflation, and individual circumstances is going to necessarily vary your result, but the point is that time will do the work for you.

We make a pretty decent amount of income, but we save about 45% all totaled. We‚Äôre mid-50s now, and well on track to be at numbers similar to above at 65.

{"title": "All-In on Tech: Why I Just Invested $2.1 Million in a Single ETF", "selftext": "Hello Fellow Investors, I Need Your Advice!\n\nRecently, my parents sold their house and entrusted me with managing the proceeds. I've just started exploring the U.S. stock market, and I'm a firm believer that technology is the future. Since tech can't thrive without semiconductors, I found the SMH ETF.\n\nThe holdings in SMH are nothing short of a \"dream team\" in the tech industry: NVIDIA, TSMC, ASML, AMD, and other semiconductor giants. In my opinion, investing in an ETF like this is better than betting heavily on a single stock, as it offers diversification without missing out on growth opportunities.\n\nThat's why I've decided to go all-in with $2.1 million and invest it entirely in SMH, with a long-term horizon of 10 to 20 years, following a value investing approach.\n\nHowever, this is just my initial thought, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or feedback from experienced investors. Are there any better strategies or considerations I might be overlooking? Thank you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9i1ho67ov1kd1.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bf00847cad46963d47d5d1dfdbcfffea4b093f6\n\n", "id": "1exv9ju", "created_utc": 1724260482.0, "score": 1736, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 1360, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 29 minutes ago\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 days | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Nah that‚Äôs too diversified.

I wouldn‚Äôt be saying this for a smaller portfolio, but at that size, you need to be growing your wealth in a safe, conservative way (in my opinion). If we got a few years of economic downturn, then this dude has his entire nest egg stuck in a declining investment that he literally cannot cash out on and realise this money until he HODLs through it to see green again. Imagine how shitty that would be, like the money burning away by the day and you have no choice but to hold and wait for the next bull market, locking up 100% of your entire nest egg. \n\nComparatively, he could have a large amount in a safer more diversified investment like SPY and set aside some of that cash to outright buy a house to rent, then assuming a bull market then every year he could live comfortably from price appreciation and the rental income whilst also cashing out an amount yearly to buy up more housing year by year, which only makes his position even more stress free and a more guaranteed form of income. And then if it was a few years of economic downturn and bear market, he would still be making guaranteed income on rental anyway and then in his stock portfolio, yes it would be red btt it the losses would be far more stomach-able, and because the losses would be smaller, it wouldn‚Äôt be as big of a deal if he was to still sell off some to buy more housing.\n\nI don‚Äôt know how old this guy is but I‚Äôd assume he‚Äôs fairly young, let‚Äôs say 25 for example. If the markets are in a bull run, he may never have to work full time in his life again. It might be that the first few years he‚Äôd be working part time or something whilst he built up a property portfolio to retire on, in a bear market he might have to stay working for a few years, then once the bull market returns, then start the work taper off of going part time as his position gains value to trim it for buying housing, and then after a short few years of the part time work he could probably just fully retire. Living off of rental income and stock price appreciation. It would only get easier and more lavish/luxury as time went on. \n\nSo going back to an assumption that he‚Äôs 25, in a bull market he might be fully retired by age 30. In a bear market, he might be fully retired by age 35.\n\nMeanwhile, YOLOing it all on chip companies that are at multi year high PE ratios that have a stupidly risky beta level for such a big portfolio, his losses in the event of a bear market or upcoming economic downturn (potentially) would be far more substantial, and he could be left bay holding for far, far longer whilst still having to work full time because his entire nest egg is locked up in the bag hold, so it could be 5-10 years and there‚Äôs a chance he‚Äôd never see any improvement on his quality/ease of life despite redefining 2.1 million.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "he says this is not financial advice, i say it is !!!! listen to this wise guy !", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "PUT YOUR HANDS UP Cryptofreedom7!!!

{"title": "Getting SNOW puts for earnings, hear me out tho", "selftext": "Snowflake (SNOW) is expected to release earnings results for its second quarter today. Right now people are expecting the company to report quarterly earnings at 16 cents per share, down from 22 cents per share in the year-ago period (down 27.3%). Snowflake is projected to report quarterly revenue of $849.7 million. \n\nI've looked at what other analysts have said about the stock, and all the points are summarized below: \n\n* Baird analyst William Power maintained an Outperform rating and **dropped** the price target from $200 to $165 just yesterday on Aug 20. \n\n* Stifel analyst Brad Reback maintained a Buy rating and **dropped** the price target from $200 to $168 two days ago on Aug 19. \n\n* UBS analyst Karl Keirstead maintained a Neutral rating and **dropped** his price target from $171 to $155 not that long ago, also on Aug 19. \n\n* TD Cowen analyst J. Derrick Wood maintained a Buy rating and **dropped** his price target from $230 to $180, Aug 19. \n\n* Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow maintained an Equal-Weight rating and **dropped** the price target from $191 to $146, same day as above.\n\nSee a trend? These are all analysts with reportedly high accuracy with their price targets (all above 75%). While all these new price targes are above SNOW's current price of 138, it seems like people are not as excited about the company. [Even Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway just sold Snowflake stock *today*](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/21/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-sold-snowflake/). Why is that? They've been invested in them since IPO in 2020. \n\nSNOW has been suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions, including persistent inflation, which have hurt customer spending patterns. On top of that, GPU-related costs as Snowflake aggressively invests in AI are expected to have kept margins very low. Moreover, stiff competition from the likes of Databricks and increasing pricing pressure. There are also open source options for what SNOW has to provide, from the big cloud providers. SNOW does have a technical advantage, but other cloud providers have caught up. Why pay premium for SNOW if I can just manage my pipelines with another provider that provides better proximity and efficiency? \n\nI've read a lot of bullish stuff tho. Progress in LLM, new offerings, acquisitions, and partnerships. Stuff that longterm investors want to hear about. But you know what I think is going to happen? Expectations are set so low that they'll beat, but the stock will drop anyways. Right now SNOW is up today, giving puts a bit of a discount. I'm gonna grab 8/23 130p @ 5.60 each. This is a bit pricey for an earning play, so it's reasonable to also sell the 8/23 120p @ 2.28. If the stock does drop, it most likely won't drop further than 120. This means you can get the put spread for $332, with a max possible gain of 3x *if* the stock drops about 10% or so. Which is the average move up or down that SNOW has made in the past.

The response follows.*\n\nWell, this piece is a wild ride that blends financial commentary, street-level storytelling, and some surreal humor. Here's my best attempt at interpreting it:\n\n1. **\"Blowing heaters outside Moon‚Äôs Deli in Chicago\"** ‚Äî This means smoking cigarettes (or something else) outside a deli, setting the stage with a gritty, casual atmosphere.\n2. **\"Double fisting two large coffees\"** ‚Äî The speaker is holding two coffees, ready to stay fueled. It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre bracing themselves for what‚Äôs coming, maybe expecting to have a long, odd day.\n3. **\"Waiting for the first homeless man to run me down for a handoff and a 5 minute conversation\"** ‚Äî They‚Äôre anticipating an encounter with someone, looking for some random human interaction, possibly offering money or food (a \"handoff\") to a homeless person and expecting to chat briefly.\n4. **Stock market talk** ‚Äî The homeless man doesn‚Äôt know about the stock market or the Federal Reserve, and neither does the speaker. It‚Äôs like saying, \"Nobody knows what‚Äôs really going on with the economy,\" even the \"experts\" are clueless.\n5. **\"WH interns dressed like the cast from Glee\"** ‚Äî Here comes some satire. A bunch of young, naive interns, compared to the over-the-top cast from the musical show \"Glee,\" are wandering around, maybe thinking they know more than they actually do.\n6. **Getting more farvas (large coffees?)** ‚Äî The speaker and the homeless guy load up on more caffeine and go confront the interns. They‚Äôre on a mission now, seeking answers or trying to make sense of the chaos.\n7. **\"Didn‚Äôt understand confidentiality or NDAs\"** ‚Äî These interns (or stand-ins for inexperienced young professionals) don‚Äôt understand legal/financial concepts like Non-Disclosure Agreements. The implication is they‚Äôre too careless or na√Øve to comprehend the importance of confidentiality, maybe spilling secrets about financial markets.\n8. **\"Everything assets bubble bullshit\"** ‚Äî The speaker is hearing rumors about a potential financial crash or \"bubble.\" They seem to believe something big is brewing, another round of explosive growth (or disaster) in asset markets.\n9. **\"It‚Äôs going to be biblical\"** ‚Äî The speaker is expecting the impending financial event to be massive in scale, possibly catastrophic.\n10. **\"Go acquire some assets quickly\"** ‚Äî Advice to jump on the bandwagon and get some kind of financial stake before things blow up, because things are about to get chaotic. Real estate, stocks, whatever you can.\n11. **\"Hedge fund feeding frenzy in commercial real estate\"** ‚Äî Hedge funds are taking advantage of the current economic situation, grabbing commercial real estate properties at bargain prices, especially as foreclosures rise. The speaker is cynical about this ruthless behavior.\n12. **\"The Fed doesn‚Äôt lower rates now...\"** ‚Äî If the Federal Reserve doesn‚Äôt lower interest rates soon, the speaker warns that the same thing will happen to the housing market, leading to widespread foreclosures in residential real estate.\n13. **\"Futures are already jacked to the tits\"** ‚Äî Futures markets (derivatives based on the expected future price of assets) are already heavily inflated or chaotic, primed for big moves. The speaker sees this as a signal that something big is coming.\n14. **\"SPY could easily run another 20% by EOY\"** ‚Äî SPY (S&P 500 ETF) could increase by 20% by the end of the year. This suggests the speaker thinks the stock market will keep surging in this volatile environment.\n15. **\"I‚Äôm getting the crayons out right now\"** ‚Äî A sarcastic way of saying they‚Äôre going to break things down in the simplest terms possible, implying that even complicated financial markets can be understood by anyone with enough effort.\n\nOverall, this passage uses absurdity and humor to illustrate a looming financial crisis (especially in real estate), wrapped in the chaotic language of a streetwise observer.
