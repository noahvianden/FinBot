If you are short a put option and get assigned thateams you are forced to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price of the option.\n\nGenerally you can think of assignment and excersizing as opposite ends of an In The Money option transaction. The party who is long the option excersizes it, and the parry that is short the option gets assigned. \n\nSo for example, say I sold (am short) a put that expires today with a strike price of $20, and the stock closes at $15. The person holding the put (long) that I sold is probably going to \"excersize\" the right the contract gave them to sell 100 shares at the strike price of $20/share. As the counterparty who sold the contract, I am \"assigned\" the responsibility of fulfilling the obligation of the contract to buy 100 shares at $20/share.\n\nIt would be the opposite for calls. The person long who is excersizing their rights under the contract gets to buy 100 shares at the strike price and the person short who is assigned the obligation has to sell 100 shares at the strike price. \n\nNow, it's a little more complicated in the back end. When you buy/sell an option you aren't immediately matched up with a specific person on the other side. The broker you did the trade with has a list of everyone who is short that contract through them and when they get notice from the OCC that one of their contracts has been excersized they will randomly select one of their customers who is short that contract to receive the assignment. \n\nGenerally though, you should always assume that if you are short an option that is In The Money (ITM) at the time of expiration then you are virtually guaranteed to be assigned.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "I dont think this explaination can get better bravo", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Found the fucking moron.", "score": -10, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Exit before expiration.

These chips are designed around specific, semi conductor producer specific processes called nodes and that takes several years. There is a whole set of design rules, documentation etc around. That is a PDK.   \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process\\_design\\_kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_design_kit) \n\nLike that we get to the second problem. Taking a design and making it ready for production and then producing the chips. That is where Intel has been dropping the ball for many years now. They had their original 10nm node for many years, but the chips they designed for it, would not work because of never ending manufacturing issues. Then Intel basically rebranded Skylake year after year. 6th-10th gen where all Skylake. The architectures designed for 10nm, basically died.  \n  \nThen what seems to be a completely redesigned, now less performing 10nm node (renamed to Intel 7 later) was introduced for Alder Lake in 2021, some five years later than 10nm chips where supposed to ship. Then we got to Raptor Lake which is basically Alder Lake with more cores and higher clock speeds to try and keep up with AMD at stupid power consumption levels. The higher end ones have been dying at an alarming rate. Something Intel only is starting to admit to after months of ever mounting public pressure. And it just gets worse and worse with that mess...\n\nThen Intel its next node is Intel 4. They started shipping chips based on that, nearly a year ago. That is Meteor Lake. But its only for laptops with \"Core Ultra 5/7/9\". Almost a year later, those are still not that plenty to find. Intel isn't making anything powerful like a desktop, let alone a server CPU, on that node. In fact, it seems that Meteor Lake finally convinced OEMs to include more AMD into their line ups. You see, Meteor Lake kinda sucks. Its expensive, not that well performing and doesn't seem to be available in large quantities either. \n\nBut most damming is that Intel its next generation of processors, Arrow Lake, is being made at TSMC its superior 3nm node. That includes laptops. Intel its server parts are slated to remain on 10nm/Intel 7 for a while. So Intel is making all that capacity with new fabs. But the current ones aren't even being used to capacity. And who would want to use them with their spotty track record over the last decade? They delivered one new node in a decade after massive struggles and the next node is so bad, that Intel doesn't even want to make most of its chips on that. TSMC delivered four and overtook Intel. \n\nIntel has all its hopes placed on the next node, 18A. But with Intel its abyssal track record, I would not believe it until I see it. \n\nIn summery:  \nGrandma's inheritance is gone...", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "it's not (just?) stealing of ip, but the obvious conflict of interest.\n\nlike, sure, intel's going to give their competitor priority, amirite?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That also plays a factor.

That is also why they often have better performing chips. Most of the performance gains aren't from architecture and never have been. Most comes from more transistors you can use with a smaller node.   \n  \nIf Intel wants to be taken seriously, they also need to adopt such a model where they can't touch guaranteed supply from 3th parties. Meaning that if Intel runs into trouble with manufacturing (again), they would have to prioritise their 3th party customers over themselves.

{"title": "SPY/QQQ have another 30% upside before a major correction. ", "selftext": "I know this sounds crazy to most bears and probably bulls as well, but everything I‚Äôm charting and gathering from past recessions/bear markets tells me we still have plenty of room to go up before we should all consider buying long dated puts and singing YMCA\n\nFirst from chart perspective, both SPY and QQQ are above their 50 and 100 daily moving averages and they have both support around strong Fibonacci levels. If they both manage to  reclaim August, as in forming either a bullish reversal on the weekly candle or forming a bullish hammer on the month (SPY 550 or QQQ 460) than we are 100% likely to see a strong blow off top before end of the year as we are also in an election year which is very bullish.\n\nSecond, we are all aware of the obvious which is the consumer is weakening (see earnings for most consumer stocks) and that credit debt is rising. But we do know that tech spending is still high. Amazon, microsoft and meta are all raising capex regardless of the consumer. They know the key *now* is to prepare for leveraging AI as a service. They can weather a 12-24 month recession. They have *billions* in cash with very low debt to equity ratios.\n\nSo as such, expect Nvidia earnings to keep rising, and for Amazon/microsofts cloud services and AI systems to grow while their more consumer side of business slows down or goes stagnant for the next year.\n\nThird, I expect layoffs and mass defaulting to occur sooner rather than later. But I do not think this will impact the stock market. Until tech is positioned to stop giving every dollar they can possibly shovel to the mag 7, once all infrastructure is tapped out and exhausted, will we see the market turn over and retrace. The fed will likely raise rates in September and we will see the yield curve potentially uninvert after more than three years. But it will take 6-12 months before this causes a market downturn because we will rally from the news for quite some time.\n\nFor SPY; long to 650, short to 500 level.
