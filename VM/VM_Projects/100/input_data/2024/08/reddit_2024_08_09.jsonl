It may have transacted \"one share\" or at least a low number of shares at that price.  It could also be a glitch.  My advice, unless you want to become a market maker, is to ignore it.  Its \"statistically insignificant data\".  Here is one senario which \"could\" have occurred for example:\n\nWhen the market closes, the mm often \"widens\" the spread between bid and ask, \"because they can\".  If you owned a gas station, and were the only one in town that offers gas at 3:00 Am on Christmas, then you could deliberately raise the price of gas to 8.00 a gallon (from 3.39) because you didnt really want to get up at 3 am on Christmas, and, if you had to you wanted to get paid for it.  \n\nIn a similar way, INTC could have put a large spread, say, bid 19.4 and ask 39.82 at close, not expecting any after market (or pre market orders).  Enter a newbie who has $50 in his or her brokerage account, put in a market order for one share.  It executes at the ask, because it is a market order.  When the market opens, or, even if just more people start buying and selling, the spread quickly narrows down to normal, for that stock, probably a penny to maybe as much as 10 cents or so, when markets resolve this aberration.  \n\nMarkets do not perform perfectly, far from it.  People trade on emotion, FOMO, fear, or they are just uninformed, and some dont even worry about the price for one share.  \n\nIf you were dying of thirst, you would probably pay $50 for one glass of water, even if water was being sold normally for $2.00 per thousand gallons, because you were desperate, and did not care about the price.  I see people put \"unpriced goods\" into their shopping cart at a grocery store all the time.  (I dont).  Many simply say, \"I need milk\", and dont check the price, and just hand their card to the clerk.  Later, they often wonder why they are always broke.  \n\nMy spouse NEVER checks the price at the grocery store, she just puts it in the cart, and hands them the card.  She hates shopping and her goal is to get through as quick as possible.  No, Im not insulting my spouse, she has many great traits, but shopping/negotiating is not one of them.  She is not alone.  Some people get depressed if they check prices, because, especially now, they are way, way, higher than a year ago, on many if not most things.  \n\nOur marketing system is based upon and assumes \"a large number of buyers and sellers\", such as tomatoes.  There are many farmers who raise tomatoes, and many people who consume them.  But, when temperatures are minus 50 degrees in Antartica, a tomatoe seller may choose not to sell his rare crop of tomatoes for $2 per pound, because he is pretty sure no one else is willing to pay the extreme energy cost of growing a tomatoe in this weather, so he could easily raise the price to 20 dollars per pound, to see if there are any takers.

This is why the Yen can be a recession trade.   Because the spread b/w US 10 year interest rates and the Japanese 10 yr interest rates narrows as the Fed cuts US rates putting tailwinds behind the Yen for appreciation against USD.\n\nMy take is the Yen was always due to appreciate against the USD once the Fed signaled interest rate cuts. The surprise BOJ interest rate hike just added a little gasoline to the Yen appreciation trade.  Of course all these degenerative gamblers taking out Japanese Yen loans using USD to buy US Treasuries and Tech stocks got caught with their pants down and are forced to sell some assets to cover their increased borrowing costs. As they sell US Treasuries, tech stocks, and other assets to buy Japanese Yen to cover their increase borrowing costs, this becomes a doom loop as the Yen moves higher and the assets they sell move lower.\n\nThe Yen carry trade unwind isn't close to being unwound yet. Their will be more forced margin call liquidations of assets to cover these loans as the Japanese Yen continues to appreciate vs USD.  Now the question is the speed of this Yen carry trade unwind.

The thing is, premiums are capped, but losses are not. \n\n\nI’ll try to explain this as simple as possible. \n\nLets say he sold the put and received 200 dollars. Great. MU continues to go up and he can make a maximum profit of 600 dollars. Equally as great — as long as the price stays above the breakeven of the out sold, he should be okay as selling options benefit from theta decay. \n\nBut MU has instead dropped far below his breakeven price. Therefore someone who paid him that initial 200 dollars in premium to purchase that put now has their contract increasing in value — that value increase in that our contract does not come out of thin air — it comes from the person who sold it. \n\nTherefore you can have a contract; whether put or call that you sold exceed -100% loss. It’s *infinite*, in a sense. For example, if MU dropped to 30/share, the option seller of that put would be down -775%, as the contract he initially sold for 200 dollars is now worth 4900 dollars. \n\nHope this makes sense.\n\nEdit: Comment below", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "> Hope this makes sense.  \n  \nExcept for the part where he can make $600 after selling it for $200.
