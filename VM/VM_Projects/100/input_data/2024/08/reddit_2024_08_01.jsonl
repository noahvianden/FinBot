{"title": "CNBC: Meta’s advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off", "selftext": "This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question \"Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?\" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. \n\nFor easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically.\n\nSource: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html)\n\nFor investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present.\n\nAfter the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business.\n\n“The ways that it’s **improving recommendations and helping people find better content**, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think **there’s a lot of upside there**,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already **products that are at scale**. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.”\n\nMeta reported revenue growth of **22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion**, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet\n said in its earnings report last week.\n\nMeanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports.\n\nAs in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.\n\nZuckerberg pointed to **AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform**, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet.\n\n“They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and **generated a lot more user engagement because of AI**,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s **showing up in the revenue and the profits now**,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares.\n\nMeta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.\n\nLike the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is **spending billions of dollars** on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future.\n\n‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is **reaping rewards today**.\n\n“You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said.\n\nAngelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “**clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely**.”\n\nZino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “**nicely outpacing those of its peers**.”\n\n**Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI** and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “**significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research** and our product development efforts.”\n\nFor 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of **$37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion**.\n\nLi says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.”\n\nGenerative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to **open up new revenue opportunities over time** that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”", "id": "1eh89pb", "created_utc": 1722487975.0, "score": 269, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "The usual suspects are already making money.  While everyone else is pretending that they use AI", "score": 154, "replies": [{"body": "While I don't think Zuck is outright lying, because AI long driven more effective digital ads, the eye-opener for me this quarter was seeing Google, then Microsoft, then Meta reported very substantial increases in capital expenditures. As a disclaimer, I own NVDA and TSM (substantial positions and recently added more on the pullback), and will ride out any swings between now and late August when NVDA reports, which better be a really great report or it will tank, but it probably will be great or everyone will be scrambling to find out where the spend went. \n\nRight now, investors are obviously getting skeptical about AI cap ex, which will eventually result in lower mag 7 cap ex, which will be really bad for semis, but that's a second derivative effect and the arms race definitely isn't ending right now. I'll seriously shave my top-tier semi positions when these cap ex numbers start dropping in a meaningful way or when LLM training/inference ASICs start eating NVDA's lunch. As far as I know, AVGO (just added to a meaningful buy-and-hold position) and TSM are the way for a non-accredited investor to play the eventual ASICs wave, but NVDA could also come out with their own ASICs.  \n\nBut right now, the megacap CEOs are really excited about AI and they have the money to spend on it. They still have good cash flow and can still spend big if they want to. I think LLMs and other applications of transformers will continue to get better, they'll be faster, smaller models will be better, and context windows will be larger before the LLMs start spitting out hallucinations and functionally break. With the right training techniques, which are still evolving, the transformer that LLMs is based on can remarkably improve on really overdetermined data, which breaks what I used to know about signals analysis and training old-school neural networks.\n\nI think we are going through a routine low-volume summer pullback with hedge funds piling into the previously lagging R2K, which makes momentum plays swing like crazy. But, hedge funds will be back, and they'll long the same positions they shorted months earlier, and then they'll short them again. It's fine for investors to hold the feet of megacaps to the fire, but that just brings their PE multiples closer to normal (for a tech stock). \n\nOther position disclaimers:\n* Google (small LT buy-and-hold position, they are behind and will probably lose search market share but I won't bet against their data and proprietary tensor core iterations)\n\n*Microsoft (small long-held position)\n\n*Meta (no position due to longstanding antipathy plus I think they are behind with AI and the metaverse and they have more limited room to grow because 3.5 billion users is a lot, even if many of those are bots. I think they will outperform but won't be in the driver's seat. I still don't see how Zuck is going to monetize their open-source LLM models while Microsoft at least has a plan that may kick in when co-pilot improves and co-pilot subscriber numbers improve. I may be in the minority, but I think this will happen eventually, can't say when.

That ride is over.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "You're right that YoY growth is a really bad metric to value a high PE stock, as is comparing this quarter this year, vs the same quarter last year. For me to buy a stock with a high PE, it better have higher revenues and higher earnings every quarter and those numbers better have a strong correlation to each other and to EPS (those boxes are checked). I like to look at quarterly revenue and [EBDITA](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/ebitda). I have plugged in the numbers, and I would argue that these numbers are both statistically linear. The revenue numbers do a fit a parabolic fit better than a linear fit, hinting at slowing revenue growth. But, the parabolic fit will always be better than the linear fit, whether or not it has meaning, and quarterly earnings reports make for very sparse data. I'm expecting roughly linear but moderating revenue and EPS growth and will unload if there is a big surprise to the downside. With linear EPS growth for the next year out, earnings for the next year would be 2-3 times higher, making the forward PE, which ignores analyst estimates, very reasonable. Growth will probably moderate because of supply chain constraints and moderation in demand. But, Nvidia doesn't need a PE close between 20 and 30 a year out at these prices because high-growth market leaders always command a PE premium. \n\nBut, it's very plausible that revenue growth is slowing because TSM's production capacity is a bottleneck and it takes a long time to build new fabs, which TSM is doing. However, Nvidia has historically kept its margins very high when there is strong demand. I think the pertinent historical examples are the last bitcoin bubble pre-ASICs and Cisco around its nose-bleed peak with a PE over 200. During the crypt0 bubble Nvidia absolutely crushed it while reddit gamers had daily tantrums about Nvidia charging unfair prices for their GPUs. That lasted until ASICs made it unprofitable to mine with an all-purpose GPU, crypt0 started crashing and Nvidia crashed. I'm watching Mag 7 cap ex because Cisco collapsed roughly the month after its biggest customers (like Worldcom, AT&T, AOL, Qwest, and Sprint) started dramatically cutting their cap ex. The now bankrupt Worldcom was an outright criminal fraud that was buying Cisco routers to pretend that they were making money to pump their share prices. So I'm worried about demand, I'm worried about ASICs, respectively thinking about Cisco and the last crypt0 bubble. The main reason I bought more AVGO because its price is down and because OpenAI is building a new secret chip with Broadcom, which is almost certainly a new ASIC chip that will rely on Broadcom and TSM. Also, broadcom should benefit from its auto and manufacturing chips and cell phone sales will probably pick up if rates go down and it's a given that they will go down.\n\nBut, major risks are that the economy is definitely slowing by almost any metric and the Fed is always late with their rate moves, with their backward-looking data analysis, and what's bad for the economy is bad for everyone. Also, from now to October is historically a very bad time for semis and Wall Street knows it. Also, we know that if investors revolt on spend, CEOs like Zuck will dramatically cut back on cap ex, like he did after the Metaverse crash. I think if one megacap CEO cuts back on GPU spend, they all will, as I feel they are defensively spending to not get left behind, so the script can flip and growth can turn into misses in a hurry. Finally, I feel that most semi and software stocks are overvalued and catching AI tailwinds for no reason and this will hurt the few stocks with good performance, because hedge algos will work to keep correlated pairs of stocks correlated. The conflict between Iran and Israel could blow up in the near future. Also, the performance of bigger and bigger transformers could hit a wall, but I don't think there's evidence of that yet. I don't think humans are special and that there are intrinsic limits about what humans can do and future AI can't. However, better GPUs will someday be locked down even in the U.S., as a national security issue. \n\nBut, I have a long-term horizon, and the megacaps that are pumping money into NVDA haven't cut back on cap ex yet.

If Blackwell has persistent water-cooling leak issues, that could be a problem for many years. Blackwell yields could be much lower than expected, since joining chips is a new technology. A president could ban GPUs that are more powerful than a threshold out of fear of AI. Policy could be changed to tax cloud providers unless they use green energy, which I would support.

For me, hold till you die means hold until your thesis is reached or changes. I usually have a very broad thesis for buying so it isn’t often reached but companies can do something that changes my thesis or ruins it. That would be when I sell. For example PINS, my thesis was that once they reached massive MAU they would pivot into monetizing their users. They said they were going to do that and then seemed unable to monetize to the level I expected. I gave a couple extra quarters and didn’t like the progress so I sold for an okay profit and got out. Which I’ve been trying to not sell even at that point. \n\n\n\nSomething else I’m trying to do but I am not good at yet is literally almost never selling except some tax loss harvesting. The theory is with proper asset allocation/diversification (ie don’t put 30% of your portfolio into one stock immediately) you can let some stocks basically go to 0 and be okay. Just don’t add to the position or double down on a lower, instead double up on your winners. “An object in motion stays in motion” “winners win and losers lose” is sorta true for a lot of stocks. Stocks have unlimited upward potential and can only go down 100%. Like I said I’m not good at that, I like to hold 2 years minimum and if I’m down 40% or something after that and don’t see a future I tend to sell, but historically that has been a huge disadvantage for a lot of investors. Think people who sold Amazon or Microsoft at $11 when they didn’t move for 5-10 years, if the position was 1-5% of their portfolio and they let it ride while adding to other companies then even if they failed it wouldn’t hurt a bunch but on the chance it does what they did then that 1-5% could grow to 10%+ even without adding to it. \n\n\n\nOne more thing: I track all my buys and sells and compare against the market and I compare my sells to what I sold to buy.

Intel also said it would not pay its dividend in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nHere’s how the company did, compared to LSEG analyst expectations:\n\nEarnings per share: 2 cents adjusted vs. 10 cents expected\nRevenue: $12.83 billion vs. $12.94 billion expected\nIntel’s revenue declined 1% year over year in the quarter, which ended on June 29, according to a statement. The company had a $1.61 billion net loss, or 38 cents per share, compared with net income of $1.47 billion, or 35 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe company’s Client Computing Group that makes PC chips contributed $7.41 billion in revenue, up 9% and right around the $7.42 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.\n\nIntel’s Data Center and Artificial Intelligence unit posted $3.05 billion in revenue. The result was down 3% and lower than the $3.14 billion StreetAccount consensus.\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter, Intel called for an adjusted net loss of 3 cents per share on $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in revenue. The LSEG consensus was adjusted net earnings of 31 cents per share and $14.35 billion in revenue.\n\nDuring the quarter, Intel announced that Apollo would invest $11 billion in a joint venture around a chip manufacturing plant in Ireland. The company also introduced Xeon 6 server processors, along with a Gaudi 3 accelerator for artificial intelligence workloads.\n\nIn addition, Intel disclosed in May that the U.S. Commerce Department was revoking export licenses for consumer items to a customer in China, widely believed to be Huawei. Intel said second-quarter revenue would still be in its previously announced range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion, but below the middle of the range.\n\nExcluding the after-hours move, Intel stock has lost 42% of its value so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up almost 14% in the same period.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/intel-intc-q2-earnings-report-2024.html", "id": "1ehqdsk", "created_utc": 1722542844.0, "score": 1626, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 572, "comments": [{"body": "Woof, that guy who just put 700k of his inheritance into INTC is not going to be happy lmfao.

{"title": "Amazon's earnings are today, what are we doing?", "selftext": "Guys, yesterday I gave you [META](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eguija/why_im_playing_meta_calls_today/) and anyone who followed got an easy 3-bagger. Last week, I predicted [TSLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eaf4yn/why_im_playing_tsla_puts_today/) and that got quite a few of you a lot of profits. Well today, we have AMZN's earnings. Is anyone reading these? I just wanna put in my 2 cents and explain why I think Amazon won't do well with their earnings.\n\nAs of right now, from what I've read, analysts expect Amazon to show revenue growth of 10.5% in its second-quarter earnings report after the close on Thursday. They expect the following numbers:\n\n* Earnings per share: $1.04 ($0.65 in Q2 2023)\n\n* Revenue: $148.8 billion ($134.4 billion in Q2 2023)\n\n* Amazon Web Services: $26 billion in revenue ($22.1 billion in Q2 2023)\n\n* Advertising: $13 billion in revenue ($10.7 billion in Q2 2023)\n\nHonestly, it's been a mixed earnings season for a lot of big tech companies. Google parent Alphabet met analysts' expectations for the second quarter, but posted disappointing YouTube ad revenue and dropped like a rock. Microsoft's beat on the top and bottom lines but then they mentioned their lower-than-expected Azure cloud revenue. As I predicted, Meta's results topped analysts expectations, fueled by growth in its core digital ads business. And of course, Apple is also reporting today after the bell.\n\nDuring the call, I'm going to be keeping a close eye on how Amazon Web Services fared during the quarter, as these guys are racing to provide more artificial intelligence offerings. Microsoft reported 29% growth in its rival Azure business, and Google Cloud grew at about the same rate. From what I see, Amazon (which leads the cloud infrastructure market) is expected to report growth of 17.6%.\n\nAnalysts at BofA Securities said they viewed Google's cloud results \"as a positive read-thru for AWS,\" adding that AWS should see tail winds from growth in its backlog revenue, and increasing demand from customers who need compute power to train their AI models.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan pointed to AWS’s growth trajectory and the advertising segment’s contributions among Amazon’s strengths.\n\nAmazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is another player in the arms race to claim AI market share and launch new enterprise and consumer services. But the mood around AI investments has shifted in recent days. Coming off lackluster results from cloud and AI leaders. Honestly, I don't really have a very positive stance toward AI spending anymore. \n\nMeanwhile, on the ecommerce front, the everything store has drawn increasing competition (think Temu and Shein), companies that specialize in low-cost garbage that rely on a direct-from-factory supply chain. Amazon is reported to be developing a low-cost digital storefront of its own to directly compete for fashion and lifestyle spending. It is possible Amazon will offer an update today on those efforts as it works to defend its first place on online shopping.\n\nLet's take a look at Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. For the past two years, he's been more disciplined in the company's spending, and has looked for ways to slash costs. Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees since late 2022, with the cuts going into 2024.\n\nAmazon's profit has rebounded sharply over the past year as a result of the cost cutting. Operating income soared 200% in the first quarter, and analysts expect further growth in the second quarter with year-over-year expansion of about 79%.\n\nAmazon's advertising business has emerged as one of its biggest growth and profit engines. Revenue in the segment increased 24% year over year during the first quarter, and is expected to show 22% growth in the second.\n\nEarlier this year, Amazon joined its streaming peers in including ads in Prime Video content. Prime Video users are now automatically shown ads, unless they pay an additional $2.99 a month to unlock the ad-free tier. What's funny is that in a note on July 21, Loop Capital analysts called this a \"gangster move\" that could help propel Amazon to become an \"advertising powerhouse.\"\n\nThe ad business could haul in as much as $150 billion in sales before the end of the decade, up from $47 billion in annual sales last year, the Loop analysts wrote. They have a buy rating on Amazon's stock.\n\nDuring the quarter, Amazon secured a highly sought after position as the third rights partner in the NBA's new 11-year TV deal. It's the latest example of Amazon's push into live sports and is likely to boost its advertising business and Prime Video platform, which Amazon uses to hook new Prime subscribers and drive purchases on its store.\n\nAnd lastly, AMZN investors are also looking out for a dividend surprise. Amazon is the last remaining Big Tech company to refrain from offering one, as Meta, Alphabet, and Apple (AAPL) recently announced or expanded their shareholder return programs. So we'll have to see.\n\nWhile all of this sounds great, I believe expecations have been set to high. And you know what that means? AMZN may drop quite a bit if they don't achieve and even surpass these expectations. So, I'll be grabbing a put spread. Unfortunately, due to today's price action, these puts are not exactly at a discount. I'll be buying the AMZN 8/2 180p @ 4.65 and selling the 175p @ 2.85. This means I can get the spread for only $180. If AMZN were to drop as much as I think it can, this spread can bag us 2.8x profits. Regardless of how well it does, next week we have PLTR, ABNB, and a few other key earnings. Lots of stuff to be excited for. I'm going to definitely be checking out a few of those.", "id": "1ehnhtp", "created_utc": 1722535732.0, "score": 520, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 224, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 8 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 69 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cr7i8c/how_to_profit_off_this_meme_rally/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e6j6uv/ok_so_this_is_what_you_need_to_know_before/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eaf4yn/why_im_playing_tsla_puts_today/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eah1be/why_goog_calls_are_in_the_bag_today/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eguija/why_im_playing_meta_calls_today/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ehnhtp/amazons_earnings_are_today_what_are_we_doing/) \n**Account Age** | 5 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/4rp9ut8vj3gd1.jpeg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0784c9b4ec7ef23c2a0869759566845c02dc07e4\n\nDD", "score": 464, "replies": [{"body": "Never made the connection before.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I mean, other than him being bald...", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "ouch", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "My amazon package came a day early which is unusual. *buying puts on NVDIA*.", "score": 214, "replies": [{"body": "Better DD than most", "score": 42, "replies": []}, {"body": "I wonder if Jeff B ever looks down and says \"My Amazon Package\"", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "[Looking down at Amazon packages generally means Amazon has lost a ton of money in some sort of accident somewhere lol](https://youtu.be/8eGv54KOFKY?t=25)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Well shit!

New generation will regain the performance leadership per core, that they will lose with Zen 5 in a week or 2. Server CPU, specially the one with E cores looks extremely competitive and the one with P cores is designed to close the gap to AMD CPU. If you watch reviews, last gen server CPU narrowed the gap to AMD, this one will narrow it even more or even close it. Then they have Gaundi 3 which will start generating revenue. Plus, most of the fab investment was done, they need to ramp up production. The way I see it, Q3 & Q4 will generate strong revenue in client segment & stagnating revenue in Server segment at worst. So say worst case scenario, 1B per quarter loss, they still have 11B cash. Once they ramp up 20A and 18A processes they increase efficiency and will be back in net profit from Q1-Q2, while still having at least 5-7B cash to burn. Debt is not that bad, they have 50B. TSMC has 30B. \n\nSo with all respect, I would like to understand what scenario would lead to Chapter 11? I do not see how they could have the client and server shrink significantly in next quarters for them to eat the cash and I do not see how a bank would refuse to lend them a few more billion given that debt to equity is only 0.5.

I read the full review of 6780E server CPU, made with their 3nm process and personally I was shocked. It's a more specialized CPU and for the scenarios for which it was designed, it's quite competitive to AMD CPUs, both in term of performance and efficiency. And this was the version with 144 cores. They will also have a version with 288 cores in Q1 2025. And from what I read from reviews, Gaudi 3 is between current Nvidia solution and the one that they will launch soon, which makes it quite competitive if sold at the right price. Bottom line, they have to fail to execute for 6-7 consecutive quarters for them to go into default. I don't see how this can happen. Their 3nm is the equivalent to TSMC 4nm. If I understand well their strategy, they intend to always keep their internal projects on best nodes in house while selling capacity from their retired nodes to external customers. This will change drastically the dynamics of the fab revenue since this will very likely double their life, thus getting them on pair with TSMC for profitability. I think their strategy of splitting the fab and product development is a hedge against competition. If one product is not competitive enough, they scale down and sell the capacity.\n\nAs for lithography, this is all ASML machines and finetuning of transistor design.

There are also some up and coming Chinese aircraft companies that will eventually have a big presence.\n\nWith Intel, their historic niche in semiconductors is CPUs, and they’re really only competing with AMD there (and I believe that Intel still has majority market share). But AMD doesn’t actually make their own chips and Intel does (mostly), so in that aspect they’re competing with TSMC. But they’re also trying to compete in other areas like GPU (Nvidia being the big dog, also a TSMC customer). Intel would gladly sign foundry contracts with AMD and Nvidia to take market share from TSMC.\n\nBut anyway, no there’s a big moat.

Where are you getting that information LOL??? Leverage is the devil. Stay away from options :)\n\nOverall the post has decent enough reasoning for a long term play but I would have advised him to not dump it all in Intel and not all at once, maybe keep 70% in a high interest acct for the next year or two because rates are so stupidly good right now and the market has been more and more volatile/choppy... But still Intel is fine. We're talking 20-30 years time frame, you pick any solid, critical company like Intel or Tyson food, doesn't matter how the short term is looking. Look at AMD. They were a joke stock 10 years ago trading for $2 and everyone was fawning Intel, it's flipped today and the same can happen in the future esp when you consider the fed getting involved and bankrolling the company for national security. Anyway, I might dabble and buy some Intel, with the recent dropping I still think their market cap is OK. Not high, not low, so not a bargain. Good long term upside, but high short term downside so just sit and watch.\n\nHe is a young guy so I can understand becoming trigger happy from feeling excited/ nervous.\n\nHilarious video btw,, I keep hearing RDJs deep, scratchy voice from this movie reading those lines.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ripped off haupt91", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I hope to one day inspire a meme half this good, but without making my dead mamaw cry.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You know, when I was a college freshman I took a personal finance course, and one of the things they really, really, reaaaaaallly emphasized was how important diversification is.
