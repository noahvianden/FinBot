My desire is that when CONY hits the number of my average investment cost, I would like to sell and put the money into QQQY which offers a healthy dividend monthly as do the others.  QQQY estimated dividend is usually 2.5026 per share.  CONY Est. Dividend pays 1.006 right now but was paying a lot more.  \n\nAnd, YBTC dividend is 2.0622.

Invest in real money, make mistakes, and feel the pain of doing things *wrongly*. But, this rides on my next statement...\n\nI'd first ask yourself, *why* did you invest in these stocks? Did you think you were gonna make a quick buck of NVDA or TSM? Or are you seriously interested in being a stock investor? It's a serious question. Did you just do this to make a quick couple buck, or are you in it to win it? Do you want to make this a serious side hustle? My portfolio is serious business. I wanna retire young and not kiss ass in life. If you did this just thinking you were gonna make a quick buck, the stock market isn't for you, period.

No. If you don't need the money for something very important right now, leave your investments the hell alone. You're emotional investing. If it makes you feel any better about the situation, I think you bought in at a great price... I bought $15,000 worth of NVDA at around that $116 mark. I'm a very iron-clad investor. I don't look at my portfolio every day, especially when the markets red. I don't care about news, wars, Cramer, Trump, recessions, depressions, supply issues, government crap, etc. You know why? Because the lot of it is propaganda that leads to emotional investing. And furthermore, everything I just talked about, it has *little-to-nothing* to do with how valuable a company actually is.\n\nI'm invested in NVDA because I know they are a behemoth of a tech company, with hardware that is **literal years** ahead of the competition. They're run by a tried-and-true CEO that built the company from dirt. I feel 100% confident with investing in them. I invested in NVDA before it was cool. And you know what?

The chart of META stock is being used to illustrate the point.\nThe chart shows the move up in META stock on earnings.\nThe chart shows that as of this writing, the stock is trading above the top band of the support/resistance zone.\nRSI on the chart shows that there is more room for the stock to run.\nThe resistance zone shown on the chart shows that if the stock runs from here, there is not far to go before selling may come in.\nCan companies monetize large capital expenditures on AI? This has been a key question for investors.\nMETA shows that it is successfully monetizing AI.\nMicrosoft Corp \nMSFT\n and Alphabet Inc Class C \nGOOG\n earnings showed that they are having difficulty monetizing AI.\nAmazon.com, Inc. \nAMZN\n and Apple Inc \nAAPL\n will report earnings after the close. Prudent investors should carefully watch and see if Amazon and Apple are able to monetize AI.\nAs a result of being able to successfully monetize AI, META reported strong earnings.  Here are the key points:\nEarnings were better than the consensus and whisper numbers.  Stocks move based on the difference between whisper numbers and the reported numbers. Whisper numbers are the numbers that analysts privately share with their best clients.  Whisper numbers are often different from the publicly available numbers published by the same analysts.\nRevenues were up 22%.\nEarnings were up 73%.\nMeta is angling to make Meta AI the most used AI assistant by the end of the year.\nNew AI based tools increased return on investment on advertisements by 22%.\nMeta is planning to spend $37B ‚Äì $40B in capital expenditure this year vs. $35B ‚Äì $40B prior.\nA capital spend of $37B means Meta is spending about 23% of its revenues on capital spend, most of which is on AI.\nAs full disclosure, META is in the ZYX Buy Core Model Portfolio from The Arora Report. \nPreviously Microsoft indicated that in spite of slowing Azure growth it would continue to spend heavily on AI.\nThe big beneficiary of all of this AI spend continues to be NVIDIA Corp \nNVDA\n. Nvidia has just added over $300B in market cap in one day.\nEarnings from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. \nAMD\n show that AMD is also making inroads.\nOf note is that Arm Holdings PLC ‚Äì ADR \nARM\n which controls about 99% of the CPU designs for mobile phones is now striving to become an AI company. ARM gave a tepid forecast. ARM stock is falling. Also, Qualcomm Inc \nQCOM\n gave a tepid forecast about smartphones.\nJobless claims are increasing, indicating that the jobs picture is beginning to weaken. Jobless claims came at 249K vs. 233K consensus.\nQ2 Productivity ‚Äì Preliminary came at 2.3% vs. 1.6% consensus.\nUnit labor costs have dramatically improved. This is good news for lower inflation. Unit Labor Costs ‚Äì Preliminary came at 0.9% vs. 1.7% consensus.\nEngland\n\nBank of England cut its interest rate to 5%. This is the first rate cut in over four years. England tends to precede the U.S.\n\nMiddle East\n\nIran has reportedly issued orders to strike Israel in retaliation for killing a Hamas leader on its soil.\n\nOn the prospect of a wider war, money is flowing into gold and oil.  \nMagnificent Seven Money Flows\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in AAPL, AMZN, META, MSFT, and NVDA.\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are neutral in GOOG.\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are negative in Tesla Inc \nTSLA\n.\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust \nSPY\n and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 \nQQQ\n.\n\nMomo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks\n\nInvestors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust \nGLD\n. The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust \nSLV\n. The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF \nUSO\n.\n\nBitcoin\n\nIt appears that bitcoin whales used the strength generated by Trump's plan to drive Bitcoin to the moon to unload bitcoin to retail investors. \n\nProtection Band And What To Do Now\n\nIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.\n\nConsider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\n\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\n\nA protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.\n\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\n\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\n\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\n\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\n\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

You can either wait for the contract to close, hopefully ITM, or close the position yourself at any point in time before its expiration date for a profit.

In this case, you buy an option and hope for it to expire worthless, at a loss to yourself. If the option is OTM at expiration, your portfolio should have gained enough to offset the loss. If the market takes a sudden downturn, your rights as an option holder will let you exit your positions without a major loss. This strategy is mostly used by large banks, not retail traders.\n\nMy personal favorite way to trade options is to use what's called an income strategy. In this case you would sell an option to gain an obligation that was already a part of your strategy. For example, if I wanted to enter a position on MSFT because I'm slightly bullish on the stock I would sell a cash-secured put that is likely to expire ITM, or in other words, with a delta of around 0.5 or greater. From the date of the sale to expiration, I would be at risk of assignment as long as the option is ITM. If I am not assigned before expiration, I walk away with the premium. If I am assigned, I buy into a position I planned to open anyways.

Yes, they can come up bigger than the organization they replaced.\n\nBut you are right that established players try to hold on to their moat, and you are right that industry has become more concentrated.\n\nWhat you are not mentioning is the mechanism in which they try to accomplish this. The primary tool has been burdensome regulation. They lobby for it. Pam Am I think is one of the most stark examples of this. For years they were basically the only American international airline due to extreme regulation. It was after the deregulation of the airline industry that they quickly got swallowed up by competitors (also leading to a precipitous drop in prices)\n\nIt‚Äôs the best tool they have to hold on if they otherwise don‚Äôt innovate. Large established organizations LOVE burdensome regulation. They can afford to comply with them, while new competition cannot. Over the last 20 years regulations have increased substantially. And they are accumulative, as every year new regulations get added, and early removed.\n\nSo yes I agree with your assessment of increased concentration.

Though I‚Äôm surprised you seem to think increasing regulations even more is the solution, rather than a contributing factor. Do you think there is ever too much regulation? Or should there always be more?\n\n\nI'm not sure how answer that question without context. It implies that there's something like a regulation Laffer curve, where 0% regulation sucks, and 100% regulation sucks, and there's a sweet spot somewhere in the middle. Like with the tax Laffer curve, I don't know how you'd find that sweet spot, and it's probably not even a steady target.\n\nI guess you could say that in a vacuum, I skew towards the high end on regulation. Governments and the public both have interests that corporations don't, and I'm of the opinion that they're far enough apart to be irreconcilable. Hell, sometimes short-term corporate interests don't even align with long-term corporate interests - look at Intel and Boeing. All those guys are incentivized to do is make money in the next 90 days, and expecting that their short-term profit interests will just eventually line up with the public interest if we deregulate them enough seems completely asinine to me.\n\nFriedman wrote that workers should be able to trade off less safety equipment from their employers for higher wages. If you believe that employers won't have an information advantage in that trade and won't use it against their employees, I have a Chinese lathe to sell you. \n\nMore pragmatically, I don't see deregulation as being very economically effective. The sales pitch of neoliberalism is that \"yeah these companies are just self-interested, but if we let them go do their thing, then a rising tide of growth will lift all boats.\" The problem is that they haven't been lifting squat. Real GDP growth in the western world has been on a steady downhill slide for 60 years. SPY earnings since 2002 (6.2x) haven't even pace up M0 monetary inflation (8.7x).\n\nAt this point, things like rising energy costs and falling birth rates are damping growth moreso than FAA inspections of Boeing. The neoliberal answer to those is the only one they ever have - just offshore and deregulate some more and maybe it'll work out. It's their hammer and every problem is a nail.\n\nI take a Malthusian, Limits to Growth type look at things that's almost diametrically opposed to the \"line goes up forever\" crowd. It's why I'm a doombear, and it's also why I come out swinging so hard against market fundamentalism.
