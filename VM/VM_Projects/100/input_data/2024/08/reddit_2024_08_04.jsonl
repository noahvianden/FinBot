{"title": "Intel's stock price is now at the same price it was in 1997", "selftext": "It’s mind-boggling that Intel’s stock price has somehow circled back to where it was in 1997. We’re talking about a major player in the tech industry, yet its stock has offered virtually no returns for nearly three decades. With such a big name in the semiconductor space, it's surprising to see it move like this. The company just laid off 15% of its workforce, trying to cut costs and restructure. But during a year dominated by AI, Intel seems to have completely missed the boat on capitalizing on this. What’s even more wild is that the U.S. government has pumped billions into the company through subsidies, and yet, we’re still seeing such such underwhelming performance. I’m curious, does anyone out there see this as a buying opportunity, at these levels? The dip might look attractive, but it’s hard to ignore the long-term performance.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p9x2m86bapgd1.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=3436add397b2dada8b7915805cfd4e593f47a8bc\n\n", "id": "1ek3z4h", "created_utc": 1722800626.0, "score": 824, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 278, "comments": [{"body": "Company is break-even to losing money with stagnant earnings, having to fire 15k people and suspend the dividend to save money, and $50B in debt to service.

They get too hot to the point selective underclocking does not cool them. They actually run better without the feature on. I tend to use two things for testing. Taking a simulation game and purposely overloading it with mods as well as attempting to export a massive video file from a program like Pinnacle. In both cases TurboBoost off is both faster and cooler. All aspects of performance improve without it. I think where people get confused is theyre looking for a benchmark peak vs actual performance. Turboboost will push your benchmarks to a max, but performance wise turning the feature off will improve overall performance.

Reasons I say this:\n\n###  1. It's Not *That* Useful\n\nI use AI all the time for work. It is an excellent and flexible tool. The problem: it takes too much skill to use for any truly productive task, and even then the range of those tasks is narrow.\n\nEven if we've been presented a *diverse set of applications* of AI, the value it provides in any of these tasks can vary greatly. It's interesting the disparate skills it does have, but that's different than broad application.\n\n### 2. It's Not as Universal as we Hoped\n\n*Artificial General Intelligence* 'AGI' turned quickly from a nerd's fantasy (I remember when Lex Fridman's show was called AI and he frequently pondered if AGI was possible), into a marketing term. The term is now tired and beaten.\n\nWithout significant innovation, AI will not widen its breadth. We're being sold the narrative that hard work and money thrown at it will shape these inference machines into universal workers.\n\nNew expertise from an AI is currently only the result of large amounts of **human** (general intelligence) intellectual work and engineering. The hype probably can't sustain itself to wait for this real, hard work.\n\n### 3. It's Not as New as it Seems\n\nIf the above points were all that were, then the *AI Boon* would still have the great opportunity to be crafted by teams for use in specialized applications, sold to large companies. And of course this opportunity still exists, but unfortunately it isn't all that new.\n\nYouTube, Spotify, Google, Facebook had been using 'Machine Learning' (same exact technology!) in production for several years (probably more) before ChatGPT came about. Credit to ChatGPT for making the best chat bot we've seen yet, but it's just a chat bot.\n\nThe fact that the world at large got to be exposed to the that power Machine Learning had already expressed in other domains (that already affected their lives far more than the chat bot probably ever will), made it seem like AI was just invented out of the blue.\n\nSo if selling AI to industry is going to keep the AI-hype train a-going, what did the release of ChatGPT realistically add to that value proposition? I imagine it added some value, a lot for many domains (like call centers) - but we can see much of the 'value' is in making AI easier to advertise.\n\nFor companies that didn't understand they could use pre-ChatGPT AI tech for very useful tasks (mostly related to various forms of surveillance/auditing), then this hype may help them. Still, building for these companies will not be simple, as the hype train implies it is.\n\n## Intel\n\nSo obviously when you miss the hype-trains, you miss the hype-gains. But why should money be flowing out of intel right now?\n\n* Is Nvidia producing general purpose CPUs? No.\n* Has AI reduced our need for CPUs? Probably not.\n* Is this because ARM Chips are waking up? Maybe.\n\nWe are just now seeing Windows ARM laptops instantly catch-up to M-series chips in terms of efficiency. Qualcomm stock, who make these new ARM chips, seems to be okay.\n\n\"If Arm emerges, I want to be the foundry.\" - says Intel founder - https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/intel-says-its-happy-to-make-the-very-arm-chips-that-threaten-its-x86-hegemony/\n\nSo my thesis is that our need for Intel-CPUs has not wavered *too much.* ARM Chips are a bigger threat to Intel than AI, and ARM chips are an easier pivot that the CEO has already expressed interest in.\n\nI wonder if anyone else not completely brainwashed by AI-marketing has thoughts on all of this.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I bought some Intel a few weeks back, with the thinking it will be like TSCM in five years.

Intel is *seriously* taking it on the chin as the silicon of choice for both Windows and Linux.\n\n**Data Centre**\n\n* Crazy failure rates and high pricing on the latest generation chips has caused data centre builders (esp. game and general-purpose VM server vendors)  to flock to AMD for new builds.  One of my contacts that runs a VM shop told me 50% of his new orders are now for AMD-based servers.\n\n* The \"big cloud\" CPU purchases are slowing down, and behemoths like Microsoft, Amazon and Google are pouring more into GPU (AI) racks than CPU now.  Cloud infrastructure buys have slowed significantly as the market hit near-saturation and is now building out organically and not *en masse*.\n\n**Personal Computing**\n\n* Intel has no competitive offering for the phone market.  Desktop and laptop upgrades are typically on a much slower cycle than phones, and PC's have not been a real \"growth\" market for over a decade.\n\n* AMD is making inroads in all PC/Laptop segments (budget, business and performance).  Not long ago, Intel held >90% of the PC/Laptop market, and recent estimates put them [as low as 66%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/735904/worldwide-x86-intel-amd-market-share/).

Native app support is improving rapidly, and even NVidia has announced they will be releasing ARM-based gaming hardware for Windows.  Windows-on-Arm (WoA) has the potential to take a *large* bite out of Intel's lunch, as it may become the defacto hardware for laptops and tablets.\n\nThe TL;DR here is that Intel has no moat, is not a leader in a growing market, and is facing serious headwinds in the markets it currently dominates.

Truth is that LLM are story tellers, they replace a profession that’s already extinct - the person who used to read and write stories for kings and queens. LLM in technical terms are nothing more than an approximation function that tries to predict the next word. That’s hardly an intelligence. We have tools like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) that aren’t LLMs and can do 90% of the things people describe here in the comments. LLMs are not suited for automation tasks as they are very unpredictable. Imagine a Toyota production robot that manufactures a car 90% of the time and writes poetry on the side while occasionally killing someone. That robot would be scrapped faster than you can sell your shares. And for legal? With all the liabilities involved do you really trust an LLM with that? Would you hire a paralegal on shrooms because that’s what you have with a LLM lawyer. Not to say how cheap actual intelligence is. You can hire heaps of people in a cheaper country for fraction of the price of an LLM. That’s why the Amazon smart stores were actually a person in India marking your stuff remotely.

We can try to fix that with an agent or even a set of agents - one is focused on manufacturing and the other is supervising the process.

Speculation was so rampant that they were building entire towns on cheap land in the middle of nowhere, far outside metropolitan areas. They would pay Romanians €40 a day to work as labourers and not even pay for a hotel. They'd get smashed all night at the bus station, then go back to work.\n\nWhen the global financial crisis happened, developers started going bankrupt, meaning these towns were left without basic services like water, electricity, sewage, etc.. because they were building these sprawling condo complexes with the idea that the city would eventually hook them up and businesses would begin setting up there once they were fully bought out. \n\nAll of a sudden, the bubble popped, and nobody had any money, so nobody was buying any properties.  Municipalities wouldn't hook up all these huge buildings with services because nobody lived there, and businesses selling even essential goods had no incentive to set up shop. So you had people that did buy, without any electricity or nearby stores. Many sold at a loss if they were able to sell at all, buildings were condemned due to disuse, or are still standing with people living there rent free in the middle of nowhere in derelict buildings. \n\nThere are still a lot of places like this in Spain, essentially ghost towns. To this day you can buy very cheap apartments in Spain that are remnants of places like this. The company I worked for owned a condo complex on the southern coast that was integrated into a golf course. I won't give the name, but Jack Nicklaus got his brand in on it, so it's pretty easy to Google. It went bankrupt in 2012 and finally sold off all its assets in 2017.\n\nI wasn't aware of the stock market imploding either. The iPhone had just come out in 2007. There was no real retail investment scene because smaetphones and apps didn't exist, so it was hard to get into. I even started my own real estate office for a bit, but the \"crisis,\" as they called it in Spain, just cut too deep. I closed it in under a year and finally went to university.\n\nYou're wrong that crashes aren't preceded by anything, though. 2008 was clearly caused by easy access to loans, bundled up in the so-called credit default swaps, which fuelled insane speculation and development. This caused banks to fail once it all unwound, taking the global economy with it. There's literally an entire movie made about it. You've probably heard about it. It's called The Big Short. There was the dot-com bubble, covid, and 2022 with covid-related inflation in my lifetime.\n\nIt's always preceded by something. It doesn't have to affect your life if you've set yourself up correctly, but it does have real effects on real people. It isn't all imaginary wealth. Real people worked at INTC that lost their jobs, real grandma's money is sunk into a failing stock that doesn't even pay a dividend anymore, real people bought apartments that they couldn't even take a shit in in Spain. It's not just a numbers game on your phone. \n\nJordan Belfort was made his money selling pump and dump penny stocks to regards in the 80s.
