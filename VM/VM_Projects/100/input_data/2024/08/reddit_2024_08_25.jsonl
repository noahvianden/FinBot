{"title": "Interesting Idea Buying Put LEAPS!", "selftext": "Saw WSB post of someone with 500%+ return for the year, claimed to have been buying the farthest strike, farthest date, the idea was because it's so far out in time it would barley decay to Theta even though so far out in price.\n\nSo started adding lots of contracts to my watch list inspecting farthest strike, farthest date. What found was it's inconsistent between tickers, and some strikes were so much farther out from the price. What I did notice was when inspecting LEAP puts instead, they surprisingly are very resilient, they don't really decay and all the sudden explode in value when asset sells-off.\n\nThe benefits of playing LEAP puts:\n\n1. Could hold put LEAP for 2-3 months almost for free\n2. Pay really nothing to Theta cause contract still 500-800 days till expiration\n3. The strikes will be a lot closer to price than calls. For example, NVDA have to go to $280 strike while price is $130 currently. However, the LEAP put at $40 is much closer to the price and so cheap in-comparison to call, talking $1600 for the call vs just $90 for the put!\n\nThe results are better too, if opened NVDA farthest strike, farthest date when price was $95 and held, it would've doubled from $800 to $1600. If bought the put even back in June, it triples in value in August from $90 to $270, *while having decayed nothing to Theta holding for two months technically for free before the rise took place*.\n\n**EXAMPLE**: I can open now a LEAP Put on NVDA $40 01/2026 for just $1.15, it's small price to pay, doesn't burn hardly any to Theta, and can stand price moving against it for a bit. Cheap gamble if sells off after earning's with big potential imo. Can even open as a diagonal selling a weekly near $50 to capture some premium but will then have collateral cost.\n\n**CIONCLUSION**: Seems can really use put LEAPs to play to the downside cheaply and effectively. Can probably even time opening when the daily stochastic RSI has peaked for some easier to read companies, then smartly play to the downside while hedging risk aka cost/losses by opening as a LEAP with lots of time. I doubt many consider LEAP puts because by nature it's a losing battle but actually something there it seems.", "id": "1f0s6hj", "created_utc": 1724576769.0, "score": 150, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "There is a book called \"The Black Swan\", I think you will love it.", "score": 97, "replies": [{"body": "It seems this is a cheap way to set-up and prepare for black swan unexpected events, am amazed the NVDA $40 strike 509dte put LEAP literally sat at $.90 for two months not really dumping or pumping even though NVDA was having $15 price swings.

(Maybe not so black swan cause August was x3 return after that sell-off, but in a real Black Swan event this style of trading would really turn a profit.)\n\nI can open put LEAPs on really overpriced companies with crazy high P/E ratios, if black swan event hits, with these type of option plays am realizing are the kind which make wealth.

Economists, risk management, and anyone involved in running a business where P&L includes all variables, including risk.\n\nConsider this. However unlikely - let’s say that it’s only likely to happen once in 10,000 years - that a medium sized French plant were to melt down, it would cause more property damage than the GDP of France. That means it would bankrupt any insurance company and the only way to operate the plant is with the understanding that if you screw up, other people have to pay the price.\n\nThat is fundamentally at odds with how markets work, and if that is the norm, they won’t work long.\n\nNote: tail risk meltdown risk and the fact that it can’t be insured by anyone, including the government, is a stand alone argument.\n\nIt won’t come back because it’s too expensive.\n\nJust to state the obvious China is ignoring the long term costs and risk management considerations and has no problem socializing risk.

Once PLTR gets household recognition and people understand its true potential, it will soar. For those that don't know, the best way to put it in layman's terms would be PLTR is a data aggregator that uses AI to help decision makers make mission critical decisions. That might not sound impressive these days but think about it like this: PLTR's core programs operate similar to how Zapier does app integrations but instead of apps PLTR can integrate any data source and marry it into a much larger data mainframe that is ready for analysis and dashboard creation. Factor in its AI capabilities and it's now the premiere end solution for businesses when it comes to utilizing their data effectively to enhance business operations.

Additionally, ongoing wars don't seem to be significantly impacting the markets. What do you think could lead to a major downturn?\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSUMMARIES OF MAJOR CRISES \n\n1. 1973 Oil Crisis\n Triggered by the OPEC oil embargo, which led to a quadrupling of oil prices. This caused severe inflation, economic recession, and a sharp decline in stock markets worldwide.\n\n2. Black Monday (1987)\nOn October 19, 1987, global stock markets crashed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 22.6% in a single day. The exact causes are debated but include computerised trading and overvaluation.\n\n3. Japanese Asset Price Bubble (1991)\nA massive speculative bubble in Japanese real estate and stock markets burst in the early 1990s. The Nikkei index lost about 50% of its value, leading to a prolonged economic slump known as the \"Lost Decade.\"\n\n4. Asian Financial Crisis (1997)\nBeginning in Thailand with the collapse of its currency, the crisis spread across East Asia, leading to massive currency devaluations, stock market declines, and economic turmoil in countries like South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\n\n5. Dot-com Bubble Burst (2000)\nAfter a period of extreme speculation in internet-related companies, the bubble burst, leading to a massive decline in the NASDAQ and global stock markets. Many tech companies went bankrupt, and trillions of dollars in market value were wiped out.\n\n6. Global Financial Crisis (2007-2008)\nThe most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression, triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market and the failure of major financial institutions. Stock markets around the world plummeted, leading to the Great Recession.\n\n7. European Sovereign Debt Crisis (2010)\nThe crisis started with concerns over Greece's high debt levels and quickly spread to other Eurozone countries. Stock markets across Europe fell sharply, and there were fears of a Euro collapse, leading to significant volatility in global markets.\n\n8. Chinese Stock Market Crash (2015)\nA dramatic decline in the Chinese stock market, fueled by a combination of high levels of margin trading and government intervention. This led to a significant drop in global stock markets, with concerns about China's economic slowdown.\n", "id": "1f165vp", "created_utc": 1724618052.0, "score": 261, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 468, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nPlease direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Here’s a breakdown of the key considerations:\n\n1. Current Debt Levels:\n\n\t•\tAs of 2024, U.S. national debt exceeds $32 trillion. This is a significant amount, and the debt-to-GDP ratio (a common measure of a country’s debt relative to its economic output) is over 120%, which is historically high for the U.S.\n\n2. Sustainability of Debt:\n\n\t•\tInterest Payments: A crucial aspect of managing debt is the government’s ability to service it. The U.S. still has the ability to make interest payments on its debt, but as interest rates rise, these payments consume a larger portion of the federal budget, potentially crowding out other spending priorities.\n\t•\tEconomic Growth: If the economy grows robustly, the debt-to-GDP ratio could stabilize or even decrease, making the debt more manageable. However, slow growth or a recession could exacerbate the debt burden.\n\n3. Impact on Future Generations:\n\n\t•\tHigh levels of debt can be a burden on future generations, who might face higher taxes or reduced government services to manage or reduce the debt. However, borrowing today for investments that spur economic growth, such as infrastructure or education, could benefit future generations.\n\n4. Historical Context:\n\n\t•\tThe U.S. has had high debt levels before, particularly after World War II, and managed to bring them down through a combination of economic growth, inflation, and fiscal policy adjustments. However, the current debt level is more peacetime-related, driven by tax cuts, entitlement spending, and emergency measures like those during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n5. Global Confidence and Reserve Currency Status:\n\n\t•\tThe U.S. benefits from issuing debt in its own currency (the dollar), which is the world’s primary reserve currency. This status allows the U.S. to borrow at lower interest rates than other countries might be able to. A loss of confidence in U.S. fiscal management could undermine this advantage, though there is currently no imminent sign of such a shift.\n\n6. Political Will:\n\n\t•\tManaging the debt effectively requires political consensus on fiscal policy, which includes decisions on spending, taxation, and borrowing. The U.S. has faced political gridlock on these issues, which complicates efforts to address the debt sustainably.\n\n7. Comparison to Other Countries:\n\n\t•\tWhile U.S. debt levels are high, they are not unprecedented globally. Some other advanced economies, like Japan, have much higher debt-to-GDP ratios. However, the economic and social structures of these countries differ, making direct comparisons challenging.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhether the U.S. debt is “out of control” depends on future economic conditions, fiscal policy decisions, and the government’s ability to manage interest payments and promote growth. While the debt level is certainly high and could pose risks if not managed prudently, it is not necessarily “out of control” in the sense that it poses an immediate crisis. However, without proactive measures to address underlying fiscal imbalances, the situation could become more precarious in the future. The key is finding a balance between necessary borrowing for growth and ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability.", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "What about debt to asset ratio instead of debt to gdp ratio?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Holy shit.

{"title": "The AI Bubble is over, and Nvidia are going to eat shit on earnings", "selftext": "## Why is AI a bubble?\n\nBefore any of this will make sense you have to understand that our current approach to AI does not work and never will. I'm not saying AI is impossible and that we'll never build it, but the GPT/ML approach was a known dead end for decades in academic research. We didn't need modern technology to figure that out, you can do it with a slide rule and many did. All we're seeing now is what came of a bunch of idiot VCs deciding to try anyway, some of it is genuinely impressive but for the $400 billion that's went into it it's still catastrophically disappointing.\n\nThe business case for AI is dead simple: \"Hey there Manager, hiring staff is an expensive pain in the ass right? What if we made a computer that did their job for a tiny fraction of the price and always said yes?\". Think about the mindset of the C-suite and upper management of any major company. They didn't work their way up, they don't have professional expertise in whatever it is their company actually does. They're the accountants and lawyers who say things like \"just make it work\" and \"do more with less\". AI as promised is their dream, they can fire all their staff and never have to think about physical reality again, they think they'll be able to tell GPT 7.0 \"just make it work\" and it'll be so gosh dang smart that it can.\n\nIt's neat that OpenAI and a few other companies have built vaguely serviceable chatbots, it's neat that Midjourney can spit out cool pictures, but it's embarrassingly short of what investors were promised. Ford's executive team doesn't want to replace 40% of it's level 1 customer support team with ChatGPT, it wants to be able to end a board meeting by saying \"FordGPT, please design and start manufacturing next year's F150 model, make sure it's available in the usual colours plus moss green\" and it'll _just do it_. They don't want a search assistant, they want J.A.R.V.I.S.\n\nAnd GPT/ML can't do that, no matter how many GPUs you throw at it.\n\n## Why now?\n\nA ground rule for machine learning is \"exponential investment for linear gains\". That means exponential increases in training time, in compute, in training data, in storage, in power. Neither the world nor the economy is infinite and many of these are bumping into both of those.\n\n* [They're running out of training data](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-training-data-running-out-9676145bac0d30ecce1513c20561b87d). Llama 3 and GPT 4o's input training data is a 2-digit percentage of \"all words ever written by humans\".\n* [They're running out of power](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/).\n* [They're running out of money](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/openai-training-and-inference-costs-could-reach-7bn-for-2024-ai-startup-set-to-lose-5bn-report/).\n* ML-focused GPUs aren't seeing that much generation-to-generation improvement in terms of cost/power efficiency.\n\nBut most of all the investment levels are getting so high that even [major financial institutions](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/a-skeptical-look-at-ai-investment) are starting to feel uneasy. Remember they don't want a search assistant, they want Jarvis, and as we enter year 9 of \"the next version will finally be it, trust me bro\" with stagnating improvement and not a single financially viable product to show for it, they want to see more results before signing off on the next trillion dollars in capex.\n\n## Why Nvidia?\n\nNvidia's importance within the AI ecosystem is grossly overstated. Their work on CUDA opening up GPUs for general-purpose computing tasks deserves a lot of credit for starting the broader machine learning gold rush, but that was a decade ago now. Today none of the software to train or run AI models is beholden to Nvidia's hardware. All of Microsoft's recent datacentre expansion has used [AMD Instinct cards, not Nvidia](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-5-21-amd-instinct-mi300x-accelerators-power-microsoft-a.html). Microsoft are [already developing their own chips in-house](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/in-house-chips-silicon-to-service-to-meet-ai-demand/), as are [Meta](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-deploy-in-house-custom-chips-this-year-power-ai-drive-memo-2024-02-01/), and both [Google](https://cloud.google.com/tpu?hl=en) and [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/) have had their own deployed for years. Nvidia is merely a chip _designer_, not a manufacturer. They can design and market all the chips they want but the sector has grown large enough that it's a no-brainer for the real tech giants to vertically integrate.\n\nThe expectation is Blackwell selling faster than they can manufacture them for the next 2 years, the way Hopper has for the previous 2 years. Even if Blackwell is as big of an improvement over Hopper as promised ([which it probably isn't](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/fresh-rumours-claim-nvidias-next-gen-blackwell-cards-wont-have-a-wider-memory-bus-or-more-vramapart-from-the-rtx-5090/)), and even if the delays aren't indicative of serious manufacturing problems with TSMC's 3nm process ([which it probably is](https://www.techpowerup.com/314452/samsung-and-tsmc-reportedly-struggling-with-3-nm-yields)), it's hard to see a winning formula.\n\nNvidia is a sound business long term, they've got a well-deserved dominant position in several markets, but their current valuation is based on future revenue estimates that not even the most bullish AI future could possibly deliver. With the confluence of so many factors, I think this is the quarter where the penny finally drops.\n\n## Are we in for a broader tech crash?\n\nPersonally, I think not. The tech bubbles that most of you will be familiar with are the financial ones comprised of shitty unprofitable startups that IPO and inevitably explode some time later. AI is more of a _tech_ bubble where its just the new hot thing tech bros are obsessed with. Rather, it's 40% of the new product development budget at the blue-chip tech giants. It's a waste of money that will no doubt result in corrections at some point, but that money mostly came from the revenue of existing profitable products. It was wasted on some stupid bullshit before, and it'll be wasted on some new stupid bullshit after.\n\nThe real hit in the medium term will be to \"shovel sellers\". Nvidia, AMD, TSMC, Equinix, Dell, HP, Supermicro, etc. Any company for whom those capex numbers are a considerable source of revenue.\n\n## tl;dr\n\nML/GPT-based AI is dumb, institutional investors have noticed, Nvidia's chips aren't special anymore, and tech giants are vertically integrating chip design anyway.", "id": "1f125zr", "created_utc": 1724607819.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I read your entire post including all the links.

But GPT read and responded in <5seconds:\n\nThe critique you've provided rests on a few misconceptions and overlooks key aspects of AI's current trajectory and potential.\n\n1. **AI Approaches and Progress**: The critique dismisses the GPT/ML approach as a \"known dead end,\" but this perspective fails to account for the significant advancements these methods have already achieved. While it's true that current AI systems are not equivalent to human intelligence or capable of fulfilling science fiction-like fantasies (e.g., J.A.R.V.I.S.), this was never their immediate goal. The successes of GPT-3, GPT-4, and similar models in natural language processing, image generation, and other domains are impressive and provide immense value across industries.\n2. **Exponential Investment for Linear Gains**: The notion of \"exponential investment for linear gains\" is not unique to AI. Most technological progress, particularly in nascent fields, requires substantial investment before significant breakthroughs are realized. The idea that AI is stagnating is contradicted by ongoing improvements in model capabilities, optimization techniques, and the emergence of new architectures that continue to push the boundaries of what's possible.\n3. **Business Case for AI**: The critique argues that AI has failed to meet investor expectations by not delivering a fully autonomous system capable of complex tasks like designing cars. However, this expectation misunderstands the nature of AI development. AI is not meant to be an all-encompassing solution to every problem overnight. Incremental improvements, such as automating specific tasks, enhancing decision-making, and creating new products, are already transforming industries. The ultimate goals may be ambitious, but the journey itself is valuable and profitable.\n4. **Training Data and Resources**: Concerns about running out of training data or resources ignore the adaptability of AI research. Techniques like transfer learning, unsupervised learning, and more efficient model architectures help mitigate these challenges. Moreover, the development of specialized hardware, improved algorithms, and better data utilization strategies continuously address the resource-intensive nature of AI.\n5. **Nvidia’s Role**: While it's true that tech giants are moving towards vertical integration, Nvidia remains a critical player in the AI hardware ecosystem. The dominance of CUDA, the ongoing innovation in GPU architecture, and the importance of a robust software-hardware ecosystem are not easily replaced or replicated. Nvidia's role may evolve, but it is far from obsolete.\n6. **Investor Expectations**: The critique implies that investors are disillusioned, yet the continued flow of capital into AI suggests otherwise. While there may be some adjustments as the field matures, the broader trajectory of AI investment remains strong, driven by both immediate applications and long-term potential.\n\nIn summary, while AI's development is complex and requires tempered expectations, dismissing the entire field as a \"bubble\" fails to appreciate the genuine advancements and ongoing potential that AI, particularly machine learning, continues to unlock.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": ">I read 1 paragraph of the DD before giving up.

Well, I’ve written you a helpful guide to do so.\n\nPrior to Wednesday market close:\n- puts $3-5 OTM 8/30 expiry until NVDA crosses $125 or lower\n- $130 calls 8/30 expiry if NVDA falls below $125, then drop calls dollar for dollar (ex: if NVDA hits $122 buy $127 calls).\n- swing trade the shit out of this and close out all these mofos prior to earnings.\n\nWednesday market close:\n- stay the F out. This stock will move a bunch AH but it’ll open no more than 3% higher Thursday and IMO will trade 3-5% lower. I think the channel for this is tightening up to really shake some branches in both legs of the options chain.\n\nThursday Morning:\n- let that IV deflate and enter a long call position. What I am uncertain about is how quickly it will recover n rally. I would not be the least bit surprised if you see some downside Thursday Friday.\n- I will be watching closely and guess it will fall to below $110 very shortly after earnings. If it opens $125 or higher it may take 3 days for it otherwise I expect the downside to run its course by the weekend.\n- calls $5-10 OTM for 9/13 expiration. Of course that’s LEAPS to yall here so fine go with 9/6 I just don’t know how long it will do nothing before the do something meme no longer applies.\n\nTL/DR: Market makers will screw both sides of the options chain on earnings. Play puts leading up to ER if NVDA > $125 and calls if it falls below $125. Look for calls after ER timing Thursday might be tight wait until Friday go $5-10 OTM 2 weeks out.\n\nYou’re welcome 😘", "id": "1f14gxu", "created_utc": 1724613687.0, "score": 878, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 318, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 1078 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "it’s gonna moon because Nana is blessing us from above ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sir this is not a drive thru", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just put the fries in the bag bro.", "score": 1506, "replies": [{"body": "💀", "score": 112, "replies": []}, {"body": "I hate when they don’t give any napkins in the bag.

I may pick up a few lotto puts around 90 if they are cheap in the next few days.  My take is a grand slam is  priced in, so there isnt much upward movement potential barring something phenomenal (which absolutely COULD happen, we're still in the begging phase of AI, they could announce new significant partnerships or developments, etc), mostly downside as profit taking / selling hits hard regardless of the earnings (if it tanks, people will want out ASAP, if it runs, people will want to take profits and algos are set to sell at certain % gains or loss, exacerbating the impact)  I may stay out of it for a while, as the whole market would shift dramatically if NVDA comes in lukewarm.\n\nit should be an interesting week for sure.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "I'm staying away from nvda for earnings because I agree that it has ran up too high already.
