Unlike a regular stop loss, which is set at a fixed price, a trailing stop loss moves with the price of the asset.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Setting the Trailing Stop**: You specify a trailing amount or percentage, which is the maximum distance you are willing to let the price move against your position.\n2. **Movement with Price**: If the price of the asset moves in your favor, the trailing stop moves with it, maintaining the set distance or percentage from the current price. If the price moves against you, the trailing stop remains in place.\n3. **Triggering the Stop Loss**: If the price reverses by the trailing amount, the stop loss is triggered, and your position is sold at the next available price, helping to lock in your gains or limit your losses.\n\nFor example, if you set a trailing stop loss at 5% for a stock you bought at $100, the stop loss would initially be at $95. If the stock price rises to $110, the trailing stop would move up to $104.50 (5% below $110).

However, I briefly had a mentor. During my conversations with him, I was introduced to NVIDIA. I have a few shares only and when it dipped it hurt not to have available funds to buy more.  Frankly, panic reactions to peaks and valleys should be avoided if possible. \n\nIn short, I have faith in the Artificial Intelligence communities and I have been watching this stock for a few months.  This doesn't make me an expert but it has instilled confidence in this choice.  Therefore, I also bought NVDY which subs under the native  NVDA stock.  NVDY is and income stock and pays dividends monthly.  Because it rides on the back of NVDA, I watch them both daily. \n\nMy question is, how can you gain confidence in a stock unless you are vigilantly watching how the stock performs daily? It, also, benefits one to read some of the news reports on one's stocks.  But, sometimes listening to others can make things more confusing.  I have kept my portfolio simple and small so I can pay attention to all my investments. \n\nPersonally, NVIDIA has proven its worthiness to me.  My average is 118 and a high reached today was 117 or thereabouts. The temptation to sell when it reaches a slightly more than I paid for it is very strong, however, looking at the overall picture of the performance of this stock, I can only feel that I want to buy more when the funds become available.  \n\nI had thought to sell my CONY stock because it dipped drastically to $1 per share from about 1.50 or so, it is extremely volatile and dividends slumped as a result so I will have to wait or lose a great deal of money if I sell.  But, as soon as it recovers and I believe it will soon, I am going to invest what I found to be a better more stable choice of QQQY.\n\nQQQY (Defiance Nasdaq 100 Enhanced Options Income ETF) has remained stable throughout this little crash and pays a little more than $2.50 per share.  Having watched it through this recent dip, it has proven itself to me as have the other stocks I am invested in.  Currently, I have MSTY, CONY, NVDY and NVDA. \n\nInstead of relying solely on investors on YouTube, I also refer to Market Chameleon.  This site gives a lot of info including history, estimated dividends on income stocks but all stocks can be  looked up on this site. Also, you may ask questions on this site that may help your decision making process.  I highly recommend them. \n\nI am not a stock broker and have only been investing a few months so don't depend on me for current info or sage advice, however, this is my recent experience and I am sticking with NVIDA.

{"title": "The Consumer Recession of 2023-2024 and the Future", "selftext": "Alright so this going to be a long post so bear with me. I think we are currently in a consumer recession right now. Now you’re probably thinking ok but how? GDP continues to grow, unemployment continues to be stable, and the market is higher than ever right now. I am going to talk about some companies here that will hopefully give support to my theory.  \n\n1. Microsoft (MSFT)\n\nNow you’re probably wondering why this is the first company I am bringing up when Microsoft grew revenue and income. Microsoft grew revenue by 10% and net income by 20%. Microsoft does both software and hardware. The software parts of the business like Office, Cloud, and Services increased substantially. However when you look at the hardware side of the business it paints a different picture. \n\nDevice revenue decreased 20%. These are things like personal computers, accessories, and other electronics that Microsoft sells and this part of their business declined considerably. Gaming revenue decreased by 5% with Xbox hardware sales falling 11%. We are currently seeing a similar trend in 2024. People are pulling back on items like PCs and gaming consoles. \n\nNow you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor not everybody buys PCs/Xboxs every year. This means nothing.” \n\nSo now we go to our next company. \n\n2. Apple\n\nLike Microsoft Apple is a big tech company that is integrated into our society and the every day consumer. If you don’t personally use them you know someone who uses their products. If we look at Apples results in 2023 and we look at product sales they declined from 316.1 billion to 298 billion. Hardware sales were down across the board. Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Wearables all declined. However no what didn’t decline? Services. Like Microsoft services grew for Apple from 78.1 billion to 85.2 billion. Once again we are seeing this pattern of physical products that appeal to the middle class consumer fall. \n\nNow you’re probably thinking “yeah random redditor but Apple isn’t cool anymore so of course their products are not selling. So that makes no sense and means nothing in the grand scheme of things.” Ok let’s keep going. \n\n3. Nike\n\nNike is a global fashion and one of the biggest in the world if not the biggest. Like Apple if you don’t use their products you personally know someone who uses them. They’re everywhere. Nike reported a decline in revenue by 2% in 2024 and is currently forecasting a 10% drop in Q1 2025 and a drop for the full year of 2025. We saw Nike report product declines like their shoes in 2024 and it’s expected to get worse in 2025. The stock is currently sitting at a multi year low and besides Covid these levels haven’t been seen since 2018.\n\nNow you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but Nike isn’t cool anymore and Adidas is better and sells more track suits to the Eastern Europeans. So it makes sense why it’s down.” Ok lets look at more. \n\n4. Home Depot and Lowe’s\n\nThe two home building retailer giants of the US. If you own a home or have done work on your home you’re familiar with these 2 companies. These 2 companies are staples to the entire US economy. Similar to UPS and FedEx if you want to get a general look at how the economy is doing you’re paying attention to these two companies as they’re crucial to its health. In 2023 we saw Home Depots sales decrease by 3% and earnings decrease by 9.5%. We just saw Home Depot recently report their earnings and according to them they expect more pain as the consumer continues to pullback. We saw a similar result for Lowe’s. They reported a net sales decrease of 11% and are forecasting another sales decrease in 2024. With expectations being another 2-3% fall in comparable sales. \n\nBoth Home Depot and Lowe’s stock are still down from their highs in 2021. Home Depot is down 16% and Lowe’s down 10% which was close to 3 years ago. \n\nNow you’re probably thinking “ok random redditor but those are boomer companies nobody cares about.” Ok how about another one. \n\n5. Target \n\nTarget is a company that you know well cause you either have a mom or a girlfriend or both who spends their day there. Target is the upperclass Walmart that is a bit more luxurious and like all the other companies I mention they appeal to the middle/high class. \n\nIn 2023 Target reported a sales decline of 1.7% and a comparable sales decline of 3.7%. Full year revenue decreased by 1.7%. The company going forward is expecting a continued consumer pullback and is expecting either flat or declines. Target stock is currently down 48% from its high with its high being in 2021. \n\nI can really keep going with this. Here is some more. \n\n1. Estee Lauder: massive stock decline\n\n2. Ulta Beauty: massive stock decline\n\n3. UPS (a crucial economic stock): massive stock decline\n\n4. Lululemon: massive stock decline\n\n5. Dollar General: massive stock decline\n\n6. Hershey: massive stock decline \n\n7. Starbucks: massive stock decline\n\nNow what is the point of all of this and all these companies mentioned and talked about? These are all companies that sell a semi luxury product that appeals to the middle class consumer. Now we are seeing the middle class  consumer pull back on these products. Maybe you’re not buying the next Microsoft PC this year, or the new iPhone, or the new pair of Nike sneakers due to rising costs in other areas. This is causing the market to price in future bad results and causing the stock price to crash. \n\nWe are seeing a case where the market is not reflecting the economy. Businesses all across various industries are showing declines across the board and it’s only expected to get worse. Now with all these declines in other industries why is the market so high? The answer is tech. Companies like Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, AMD, etc. are dominating the market. With these stocks continuing to increase and other stocks continuing to decrease it’s only getting worse. They have a heavy weight on the indexes and they’re causing most of the gains in the index while we are seeing other sectors decline. \n\nThis has caused tech valuations to soar and other areas of the market to lag. Now what does this mean going forward. Are we due for a massive decline in the market where we see tech finally come down? \n\nI personally don’t think so. However I think going forward we won’t see the returns that tech has given now going forward. I think these stock declines in the market has presented opportunities and we can possibly see a sector rotation. For example the Fed cutting rates and alleviating pressure on the consumer. A case where tech lags behind and we see other areas of the market which have fallen start to climb. I could be wrong on this but these are just my thoughts.

But it’s hard to even imagine what the number 35 trillion looks like. So, say you had 35 trillion actual dollar bills, and you put them end to end, starting from the Earth’s surface. How far up would those dollars reach? Like, maybe, the moon? As it turns out, the moon is not even that big of a jump. It only takes about 2.5 billion dollar bills to get from Earth to the moon. It’s no wonder the IMF is worried: U.S. debt has boldly gone where no human has gone before.\n\n“Yeah, $35 trillion is really a big number,” said Peter Blair Henry, an economist at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. To get a sense of just how big the number is, Blair Henry says that you would need to take our dollar bill trail out into the solar system.\n\nCall it “Debt Trek.” Our $35 trillion debt is so huge, our trail of dollars would breeze past Mars, which is 140 million miles away (roughly 1.5 trillion dollar bills). The next planet out: Jupiter, the giant of the solar system. But not nearly giant enough. (It takes roughly 4.5 trillion bills to reach Jupiter.) Next up: Saturn. But at a measly 9 trillion bills away, on average, even Saturn can’t put a ring on U.S. debt.\n\nWe continue to the outer planets. We pass Uranus and arrive at Neptune. Neptune is just under 30 trillion dollar bills away. We’ve reached the last official planet in our solar system, and we still have about $6 trillion in debt to go. Keep in mind, a dollar bill is just over 6 inches long, and 35 trillion of them would reach Pluto. I ran the calculations over and over again because, truly, I was stunned at the absolute absurdity of the size of the US debt. \n\nBlair Henry said. “What really matters is: How big is the debt relative to the size of the economy?” And our debt, which has been piling up for decades, is $35 trillion. Right now, our debt-to-GDP ratio is around 120%. We owe a lot more than we’re actually making — that’s what worries Blair Henry.\n\n“As your debt ratio rises, your financing problems just start getting tighter and tighter,” he said. “And the danger is, at some point, your creditors look at your debt situation and say, ‘Oh my gosh! You are not going to be able to repay me.’” So those creditors will start demanding higher interest rates when they lend money. “Your borrowing costs go up dramatically, and that will ultimately lead to a financial crisis,” Blair Henry said.\n\nIn fact, that has already started to happen. For the U.S., borrowing costs were really low for a long time. The government could basically borrow money for free because people were confident the country would pay it back. The size of the debt didn’t seem to matter. But as that debt has ballooned, lenders have started demanding higher interest rates from the U.S. “We’ve hit a turning point,” said Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff.\n\nRogoff was chief economist at the International Monetary Fund for years. He calls the rising US debt a huge economic problem. “This is the biggest thing that’s happened in the global economy in the last 10 years,” he said. That’s because the U.S. has practically-Pluto debt, so even a small jump into more debt gets galactic real fast. “The interest payments that we have to make on U.S. debt have soared,” he added. “I think the interest payments alone is now the equivalent of our US military budget.”\n\nThis year, the interest bill is expected to approach $1 trillion. That’s $1 trillion we can’t spend, for instance, on roads, health care or growing the economy. Our debt isn’t just big, it is now draining our economic resources.   \n\n“People got this idea that it was just free — ‘Don’t worry about what your debt is!’” said Rogoff. “That’s the big change that’s happened in the world, is a bucket of cold water on this idea that debt doesn’t matter. A debt this large, if left unchecked would ultimately obliterate our economy.”", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just a warning to everyone: keep a sharp eye on unemployment the rest of the year.

If the government creates too much money, it can lead to inflation. Therefore, the focus should be on managing inflation rather than balancing the budget.\n\nFull Employment: MMT advocates for using fiscal policy to achieve full employment. The government can spend more to stimulate the economy and create jobs, and it can cut spending or raise taxes if inflation becomes a concern.\n\nDebt Sustainability: From an MMT perspective, as long as the debt is denominated in its own currency, the US can always meet its debt obligations.

{"title": "July CPI data seals the deal for a fed cut in September", "selftext": "The July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed U.S. inflation continued to moderate, with the headline CPI rising by 2.9% year-over-year (YoY), slightly below the 3.0% expected by economists, marking the smallest 12-month increase since March 2021. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, increased by 3.2% YoY and 0.2% month-over-month (MoM), both in line with expectations. The report is seen as a pivotal indicator for the Federal Reserve, likely sealing the case for an interest rate cut at its next meeting in September, as inflation continues to trend closer to the Fed's 2% target.\n\n\n\nShelter costs remained a significant contributor to inflation, with the shelter index rising by 0.4% MoM, accounting for nearly 90% of the monthly increase in the all-items index. Over the past year, shelter costs have increased by 5.1%, making up over 70% of the total increase in core inflation. Energy prices, on the other hand, were unchanged in July after declines in the previous two months, while the food index saw a modest 0.2% increase, consistent with June's figure.\n\n\n\nWithin the food category, notable increases were observed in the prices of meats, poultry, fish, and eggs, which rose by 0.7% in July, with the eggs index surging by 5.5%. In contrast, the cereals and bakery products index, along with the dairy and related products index, both declined by 0.5% and 0.2% respectively. Over the past year, food at home prices have risen by 1.1%, while food away from home saw a larger increase of 4.1%.\n\n\n\nEnergy prices remained stable in July, with the gasoline index unchanged after a 2.0% decrease in June. However, over the past 12 months, the energy index has risen by 1.1%, with electricity prices up 4.9% and natural gas prices increasing by 1.5%. The stabilization of energy prices in July, following months of volatility, provided some relief but continued to contribute to the overall inflation landscape.\n\n\n\nThe July CPI report's data on shelter, energy, and food prices will likely influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions. The moderation in inflation, particularly in core categories, supports the case for a potential rate cut in September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has previously indicated that favorable inflation data would be a key factor in determining the central bank's next steps, and this report aligns with those expectations.\n\n\n\n  \n", "id": "1es1eos", "created_utc": 1723641573.0, "score": 219, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 8 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 7 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 8 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I dont think a rate cut will have the effect you think it will.", "score": 99, "replies": [{"body": "I think you are conflating past rate cuts (and the reasons for those rate cuts) with the last 4 years of unprecedented events that have never happened since the stock market was created. ", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "The upcoming rate cut is becasue unemployment is ticking up, not becasue the rate of inflation is barely on target.

You might make some money with a bounce back to 30s but I don’t think INTC even have a remote chance to tripling or more. List a few things that fundamentally against this play:\n- INTC has lost a lot of market to AMD in their traditionally dominant space and they are unlikely to catch up as the company is slow at its core to bring products to market\n- INTC is losing the nm chip race, they promise to catch up by 2027 with the 1.4nm, but their competitors are already ahead of them and more likely deliver faster\n- General compute arch is moving towards ARM architecture, AMD making more strides here. All the tech giants developing their own chips, and the demand for ARM will increase with more IoT device demand, apart from the smart phone and tablets today.\n- PC sales decline and windows now supports ARM architecture. The need for intel chip x86 is slowing and they know this. You’re betting now that intel will change course, which I don’t think can materialize in two years to set up the supply chain for its rebrand. Not to mention, the ARM space already is hyper competitive, the growth potential for INTC to copy is just not reasonable.\n\nAll in all, perhaps you’ll make money on a bounce.

If non Apple ARM cpus have more than 10% market share in client by 2030 I would be blown away\n\nI don’t think you realize how dominant Intel is in many of these spaces.
