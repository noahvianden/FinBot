Wouldn't that mean it is already priced in? What numbers would they have to report to make it skyrocket like people are expecting, if the market is already expecting such high numbers?\n\nThe run from 92 all the way up to 130 felt so unhealthy and overbought, yesterday's dip would make it healthier if followed by another red day until we reached 117-120, but then, the daily market skyrockets again today, ending up in a higher position than before the dip. In other words: it not only completely reversed the dip (which would be a healthy move for the market in my understanding), but also went higher.\n\nLike, the price cannot keep only going up, this dip reversal feels so unnatural, and I don't feel like the Jackson Hole speech was much of a logical reason to cause such a reversal and soaring back up.\n\nIf we keep going up next week, then how much room is gonna be left for going up upon the earnings?\n\nI guess we might only go up due to investors coming in for the hype, because \"everyone\" who's already invested in NVDA is going full throttle for the earning.\n\nBut what do I know?

In 2-3 months I will likely have to start taking portions of what I invested, which leaves me with smaller investing sample, and therefore, smaller potential for generating gains. I just want to stay on the game, and for that, I need to make a certain amount of money during these 2 months. That said, I might go extremely bullish on leverage EFTs for the earnings, because even though the loss potential is higher, I'm gonna have to opt out of the game soon if I can really achieve the gain goals I have to.\n\nMight sound like despair, but its actually me just accepting the chance of losing money in order to make money, and if I lose it, it's gonna be gained experience and I'll deal with that, but I just want to stay and truly understand the game, and be able to improve my financial life while learning.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Unfortunately, anyone telling you that any investment is a sure thing is lying to you, especially short term.

Also stock climb over $129 today so unless you bought around $140, you should have made most of your $$$ back from last month. \n\nFinally, leverage efts are terrible investments imo and are mainly for short term/daily investments.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Opportunity Cost**: If your investments are returning over 20%, this is significantly higher than the typical mortgage interest rate, which might be around 3-6%. By paying off your house, you're essentially getting a guaranteed return equivalent to your mortgage interest rate, which is much lower than what your investments are yielding.\n2. **Compounding Returns**: The power of compound interest works more effectively with higher returns. By keeping your money invested in assets that generate 20% or more, you accelerate the growth of your wealth.\n3. **Leverage**: A mortgage is a form of leverage, allowing you to use borrowed money to invest elsewhere. If your investments are significantly outpacing your mortgage interest, it makes sense to maintain that leverage to grow your net worth faster.\n4. **Liquidity**: Investments are typically more liquid than home equity. If you pay off your house, that money is tied up in the property and not easily accessible without taking on new debt.\n\nHowever, this strategy assumes that your investments are relatively stable and can continue to deliver high returns. If there’s significant risk associated with those investments, it might be safer to consider a balanced approach—partially paying down your mortgage while also investing.\n\nThis approach is also contingent on other factors, such as your risk tolerance, the security of your income, and your long-term financial goals.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow dude, calm down.

All you are doing is incurring repeated taxable events for no reason (as you say yourself, you do not need dividends today).\n\nYour goal today should be to grow your portfolio as much as possible (suitable with your risk tolerance).

That way you don't repeatedly incur taxable events but end up at the same place more or less.\n\nIf I invest in SPY which grows 10% a year in price + 1% in dividends, I get 11% annualized.

Think of it like company taking money from your right pocket and forcing you to move it to your left pocket, and then you immediately move it back to the right pocket.\n\nThe notion of a 'building a strong base' via dividends/shares doesn't actually make sense. Well it does, but you can do all that without dividends. You're still invested in a growing company even if it there is no dividend. Your ownership in the company is still rising in value.

Your goal is to make the pie as big as possible. Taking chunks of it today and putting it right back isn't increasing the size of your pie. Owning shares in a growing company is. When you're old, you can then sell chunks of your pie to finance your lifestyle with your winnings.

It's also a hierarchical process depending on how long I'm looking to invest. \n\nFor long-term holds, I rely on these:\n\n* Return on assets/invested capital. This is the most important factor when determining the protective \"moat\" a company has, while being a major contributor to net profit and FCF. It should be 15% minimum and growing 5% or more over the median 3-year average. Obviously, we would want ROA/ROIC to be in the top quintile of the sector as well. \n* Valuations in the lower fifth and fourth quintile relative to the entire market. Relative to sector, PEG takes precedence over simple P/E and shares priority with MAPE (Margin-Adjusted P/E). This is supported by the intrinsic notion of valuations beyond P/E's face value - how it reflects time preference of the investor pool^1 and ancillary factors determining the price premium/discount.\n* Debt/equity, EV/EBIDTA, P/B, P/NAV, etc. are all sector-dependent e.g. P/NAV is superior to P/B for tankers due to the cyclical nature of the business and normalized leverage ratios.\n* Proprietary assets or processes that grant *lasting* competitive advantage. I'm very keen on this in the micro-cap space as it's the main catalyst behind potential growth into mid-cap size. \n* A harsh discrepancy between long-term market sentiment and the fundamental performance of the business. Exploiting this is the big ticket to making gains; you will be able to establish a stake before the classic price feedback loop kicks in. I'm subscribed to a CPA firm that analyzes quarterly reports and untangles the provided statistics from GAAP standards to discern their real results.\n* The projected macro environment over the next 5-10 years. \n\n\n^1 When backtesting portfolios that combine profitability and value over the last 25 years, we find the ones focused on profitability alone perform poorly over time.

No one has a crystal ball.\n\nAnd it would be a wild guess because the \"pricing in\" shifts constantly. It is defined by what occurs in the daily trading on the bond market which fluctuates like any other market. There is no magic machine or mystical oracle.\n\nIf you want to understand what that looks like day-to-day, minute by minute, then check out the CBOT or ZQ futures which are the Fed Fund futures (of differing time periods).\n\nIf you prefer your data a little more easy to understand because you're better at reading pictures than charts (which I'm guessing is the case), then use the [CME TOOL](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) and be very sure to note how much it shifts day to day, month to month, etc. \n\nFor example, when the Japan carry trade unwound and the market shit itself in early August, there was a spike in probabilities of bigger rate cuts, yields tanked, bond prices went up.\n\nThen people stopped panicking and everything reverted as they priced in the new likelihood of less severe cuts. \n\nThese are not stagnant numbers. They are probabilities.

Then banks tack on more points as they lend that money out to customers in loans, mortgages etc.\n\nLet's use mortages as an example (although this absolutely works with bonds/t-bills as well).\n\nLet's say the Fed rate is at 5% so banks grab some of that money and lend it out at whatever they want. Let's say they lend it at 7% in the form of mortgages. They net 2% profit on that trade.\n\nThen the Fed drops its rate to 4% so banks grab that 4% money and lend it out. \n\nOne bank decides to lend it out in mortgages set at 9% so they can get a 5% profit.\n\nEvery other bank lends it in mortgages set at 6% so they can get a 2% profit.\n\nWhich mortgages do you think sell?\n\nDo you think the basic LAW of supply/demand will dictate that the 9% mortgage will ever sell in that environment?\n\nNo. So they have to drop the rate.\n\nLike I said, it's the same with yields.

You can totally just ignore the results thinking it is a one-off and that it has no implication on your final grade or decide that historical precedence whether preliminary/immature does have an effect on the future. \n\nMaybe failing the quiz means your preparation was lacking. You can then choose to study harder to pass the class or sit back and relax and fail the class. The opposite can also be true. You get the top score on the first quiz and think you’re hot shit. Now you either under-prepare and end up failing or check your ego and continue to perform. \n\nThe government is “not choosing to use inaccurate data”. It’s a question of practicality. We can totally just have a final number that’s always late and simply be responsive or we can have preliminary but less accurate data and make timely assumptions.

Nvidia will need to cut prices massively on the long run.\nWhere does this leave nvidia?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "What are you talking about man, everybody had CPU chips in the early 90s. So what? As they get faster you need to buy the new stuff as old ones go kaboom or are too slow.\n\nIt's the same with this stuff, new hardware will be bought for years, probably decades.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "They'll need to find some way to like 20x their production to justify their stock price which seems impossible. They don't even make their own chips they just design them.  The company that does make them, tsmc, is building seven new factories but those factories take forever to be built.  They each require tons of specialist parts and equipment.  It would probably take 20 years for manufacturing capacity to reach the point where Nvidia could justify their current valuation.\n\nThat would assume that the stock price stays the same over the next 20 years, and that no new competitors emerge during that time to take away some part of their market share. I actually think most of the big tech companies will eventually have their own in-house development teams designing custom chips.\n\nI don't think Nvidia can never grow to the point where it justifies its current valuation. They can't even come close to making enough chips now to justify it, and by the time they will be able to make enough, I don't think the demand will still be there.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "> I don't think the demand will still be there.\n\nYou think that demand for high performance compute is gonna go down in the future?

Look at the way Apple makes phones now. They've got their own custom silicon for the chip. They've got a custom modem chip coming soon. They're now going straight to tsmc to have their chips made with their own designs and cutting out the middleman. \n\nNvidia is a middleman in the exact same way. 20 years from now you really don't think Apple will have their own custom AI chip and they'll just have tsmc make it themselves without relying on nvidia's designs?  Same with Google.  Nvidia will still be a good off-the-shelf solution for smaller companies, but the big players will want to save money by doing their own chip designs in house.\n\nI mean I think that'll take at least a decade, but during that decade Nvidia just can't ramp up its production fast enough to justify its current price let alone a higher price.\n\nAgain. Tsmc is the one who makes all the chips. All Nvidia supplies is their own designs. So we're not talking about the demand for\" high-end computing\" going down, we're talking about the demand for the service that Nvidia specifically provides going down.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I see but IDK if I agree. Doing things in-house is a lot of overhead. There's a reason why most tech companies use cloud providers like AWS instead of creating their own server centers.

Nvidia has so much demand and so little production capacity that literally all they can do to increase profits is just increase prices. They can't really ship more units.

Custom silicon is always going to favor your custom use cases.  I don't know why you think the economic forces that pushed companies into developing their own phone chips would not apply here. This market is just ten years behind that market but ultimately it will likely play out the same way. It'll be cheaper and more effect to design your own chips than to feed a middleman all your profits buying chips from them when the company that **actually makes the chips** will happily make your chips too with all the same cutting edge processes and tech.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Again.

In house chips will be a big thing for big tech to build but until they're ready to dump 10+ years/cash on training/developing their AI. It makes no sense to go in that direction. By then, NVDA and possibly AMD will have moved on to having specialized software for their big tech customers and consumers\n\nAI is likely to never be fully functional locally making in house chips only viable for consumer grade products.

{"title": "ROTH IRA: All in on TESLA ", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/iwzq21zymfkd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=311c2c41cc913df1863fd39c03236c1ed7c0964c\n\n**I Believe in the MUSK**\n\n \n\nI think Tesla is a highly undervalued play right now, especially in the AI sector.\n\n \n\n**Anecdotal Evidence**\n\n \n\nI’m starting with my own experience of traveling the world and seeing Teslas everywhere. I’ve been to over 30 states and noticed their prevalence in each one. Beyond the U.S., I’ve spotted Teslas in countries like Greece, Albania, the Philippines, Korea, and Germany. Even in some of the most remote parts of these countries, Teslas are present. To me, this shows the strength of the brand. Globally, people recognize Tesla as a leading car company, appreciating both its designs and the values it stands for.\n\n \n\n**Elon Hate**\n\n \n\nAlongside this, there’s the fact that Elon Musk—loved and hated by many—is the face of the company. Whether you like him or not, you can’t deny that he’s extremely well-known. And as they say, “no press is bad press.” Everyone knows Musk and the cars he represents. Some may argue that his polarizing nature could harm Tesla, but I believe that people ultimately buy good vehicles, and their feelings about the CEO won’t stop Tesla’s success. Look at other tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg or Tim Cook, who have faced severe public backlash, yet their companies have continued to grow. Public opinion can change; Zuckerberg, for example, is now seen sporting gold chains and Yeezy clothing. I believe something similar will happen with Musk. Eventually, the dislike for him will either fade or turn into admiration. Don’t you want to be part of the Musky baby babe?\n\n \n\n**2035 EV Mandates**\n\n \n\nCurrently, 13 states have EV mandates for 2035 or earlier, and 45 states offer EV incentives. This means that people will have to switch to electric vehicles whether they like it or not. In these states alone, the population exceeds 60 million—that’s already 18% of our entire country set to go EV within the next decade, and this number will only grow as more states pass similar laws. Personally, I think people should choose EVs because they’re a superior platform to ICE vehicles, not just because of mandates. Having visited several of these states, I can’t stress enough how many Teslas I see on the road—you can’t drive for long without spotting one. They’re everywhere.\n\n \n\n**Self-Driving**\n\n \n\nWe all know Elon has repeatedly promised that self-driving technology would already be here, and I agree it’s frustrating. No one really knows when it will arrive. However, no other company is operating at Tesla’s level, and it’s only a matter of time until they solve the self-driving puzzle. Tesla has over 5 million vehicles constantly running and recording data, with that number only growing. No other automaker is collecting this amount of real-time, global data. Watch current videos of Tesla’s latest FSD (Full Self-Driving) version—you’ll be amazed at how close we are to success. A good YouTube channel to check out is AIDRIVR.\n\n \n\n**RoboTaxi and Robo-Semi**\n\n \n\nOnce self-driving is perfected, RoboTaxi and Robo-Semi trucks will revolutionize the industry. We already know that ride-hailing is a massive business with high demand. RoboTaxis will be able to undercut the cost of human drivers so significantly that most people will choose them 9 out of 10 times. Plus, a new segment of the market will emerge—people who start ride-hailing because of the reduced cost. We’ve seen the success of companies like Waymo, which has a strong fanbase and continues to grow. Once Tesla nails self-driving and offers a superior service worldwide, it’s poised to dominate. The same goes for semi-trucks—companies will be eager to get their hands on them to comply with 2035 EV mandates, earn tax credits, and reduce costs by eliminating the need for human drivers and all associated expenses. Imagine a world where Optimus robots load a Tesla semi, which then drives itself across the country and is unloaded at another store—completely automated. I don’t think we’re too far off from that reality.\n\n \n\n**Charging Infrastructure**\n\n \n\nTesla has over 50,000 chargers worldwide, many of which are Superchargers. No other car company has this level of infrastructure and support. This is huge—other companies, like Rivian, are already signing deals with Tesla to use their chargers. Companies will be forced to stay competitive in the EV market. Consumers want to drive long distances; the U.S., for example, is built on the highway system. People don’t want to feel limited by their EVs, stuck within city limits, or forced to wait hours for their cars to charge. As people gradually switch to EVs, they’ll demand the support that only Tesla can currently provide.\n\n \n\n**Optimus**\n\nOptimus is still in its early stages, but it signals that Tesla has completed the consumer car phase of its business. Now, they just need to keep producing the S, 3, X, Y models, and the Cybertruck, making them more affordable. With that under control, Tesla has the bandwidth to focus on new ventures—where the real gains lie. Tesla can leverage the real-world AI they’ve been training on driving data and apply it to Optimus. Every company is looking to reduce human labor and automate more tasks. Whether you like it or not, this shift is happening, and it’s wise to get on board by owning some stock. Fast food, for example, has been gradually reducing human interaction with touch screens—many people now rarely interact with a person. With advancements in AI, robots like Optimus will become a part of our daily lives, running factories and handling repetitive tasks. While this will impact the job market in the short term, people will need to adapt and learn new skills, just like with any major societal shift. I don’t see widespread adoption happening anytime soon. I predict that by 2030, Optimus will be working in factories, but day-to-day use is likely at least a decade away. Still, in the long term, I believe it’s inevitable.  Imagine a world where Optimus is your wife's bf and you can spend all day gambling on stocks as he takes care of her.\n\nEDIT\\*\\*\n\nforgot to add this cus im regarded\n\n**Energy Sector**\n\n  \nTesla's energy sector more than doubled its profits since the last quarter, it will continue to grow and eventually outpace the automotive sector. Many people think Teslas is just an automotive company not realizing it's only one piece of the pie and will continue to play less and less into the company's profits. Tesla will eventually be regarded as a name like Apple with many sectors encapsulated under the name. Self Driving, Robots, Energy, etc. \n\n \n\nThis is just some bs I wrote up off my dome while slacking at work. My prediction is a 3 trillion market cap by 2030, we shall see.

The current existing robó taxis have tens of thousands of dollars of sensors on them and are geofenced to small mapped out areas. Tesla is selling their vehicles for less than the sensors alone on those vehicles and teslas will eventually have non-geofences full self driving. The calculations are being done in real time by AI trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of real time driving footage from real people. Once completed a Tesla will be able to encounter any road, any situation, anywhere and solve it where as the other companies are focused on tiny areas just to get it working.
