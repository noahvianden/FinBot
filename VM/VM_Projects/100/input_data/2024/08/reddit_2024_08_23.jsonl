In 2-3 months I will likely have to start taking portions of what I invested, which leaves me with smaller investing sample, and therefore, smaller potential for generating gains. I just want to stay on the game, and for that, I need to make a certain amount of money during these 2 months.

By paying off your house, you're essentially getting a guaranteed return equivalent to your mortgage interest rate, which is much lower than what your investments are yielding.\n2. **Compounding Returns**: The power of compound interest works more effectively with higher returns. By keeping your money invested in assets that generate 20% or more, you accelerate the growth of your wealth.\n3. **Leverage**: A mortgage is a form of leverage, allowing you to use borrowed money to invest elsewhere. If your investments are significantly outpacing your mortgage interest, it makes sense to maintain that leverage to grow your net worth faster.\n4. **Liquidity**: Investments are typically more liquid than home equity. If you pay off your house, that money is tied up in the property and not easily accessible without taking on new debt.\n\nHowever, this strategy assumes that your investments are relatively stable and can continue to deliver high returns. If there‚Äôs significant risk associated with those investments, it might be safer to consider a balanced approach‚Äîpartially paying down your mortgage while also investing.\n\nThis approach is also contingent on other factors, such as your risk tolerance, the security of your income, and your long-term financial goals.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow dude, calm down.

All you are doing is incurring repeated taxable events for no reason (as you say yourself, you do not need dividends today).\n\nYour goal today should be to grow your portfolio as much as possible (suitable with your risk tolerance). When you are at the age where income matters to you, you can simply sell off your portfolio at the right rate or move it into dividend yielding assets.  That way you don't repeatedly incur taxable events but end up at the same place more or less.\n\nIf I invest in SPY which grows 10% a year in price + 1% in dividends, I get 11% annualized. What you're doing is in sense investing in a strategy that grows say 9% a year in price + 2% in dividends (if we're lucky). Both portfolios get to the same place, but one paid a lot more in taxes. And at the end of the day, you have the same cash pile (pre-taxes) that you can now migrate to bonds or cash or high dividend paying companies, etc., as desired at that old age.\n\nRemember that dividends are not free. They come straight out of the company's assets. It's not like you're getting a 'gift' for no reason that you don't get from non-dividend paying companies. Think of it like company taking money from your right pocket and forcing you to move it to your left pocket, and then you immediately move it back to the right pocket.\n\nThe notion of a 'building a strong base' via dividends/shares doesn't actually make sense. Well it does, but you can do all that without dividends. You're still invested in a growing company even if it there is no dividend. Your ownership in the company is still rising in value.

Your goal is to make the pie as big as possible. Taking chunks of it today and putting it right back isn't increasing the size of your pie. Owning shares in a growing company is. When you're old, you can then sell chunks of your pie to finance your lifestyle with your winnings. We don't care what you did to get the pie big, just that it is big.\n\nFor some reason, dividend investing has a bit of a 'cult' around it that tends to attract a lot of younger investors.

It's also a hierarchical process depending on how long I'm looking to invest. \n\nFor long-term holds, I rely on these:\n\n* Return on assets/invested capital. This is the most important factor when determining the protective \"moat\" a company has, while being a major contributor to net profit and FCF. It should be 15% minimum and growing 5% or more over the median 3-year average. Obviously, we would want ROA/ROIC to be in the top quintile of the sector as well. \n* Valuations in the lower fifth and fourth quintile relative to the entire market. Relative to sector, PEG takes precedence over simple P/E and shares priority with MAPE (Margin-Adjusted P/E). This is supported by the intrinsic notion of valuations beyond P/E's face value - how it reflects time preference of the investor pool^1 and ancillary factors determining the price premium/discount.\n* Debt/equity, EV/EBIDTA, P/B, P/NAV, etc. are all sector-dependent e.g. P/NAV is superior to P/B for tankers due to the cyclical nature of the business and normalized leverage ratios.\n* Proprietary assets or processes that grant *lasting* competitive advantage. I'm very keen on this in the micro-cap space as it's the main catalyst behind potential growth into mid-cap size. \n* A harsh discrepancy between long-term market sentiment and the fundamental performance of the business. Exploiting this is the big ticket to making gains; you will be able to establish a stake before the classic price feedback loop kicks in. I'm subscribed to a CPA firm that analyzes quarterly reports and untangles the provided statistics from GAAP standards to discern their real results.\n* The projected macro environment over the next 5-10 years. \n\n\n^1 When backtesting portfolios that combine profitability and value over the last 25 years, we find the ones focused on profitability alone perform poorly over time. They still beat the S&P average, but they're on the low end of the scale. Portfolios in the lowest quintile of valuation and second highest in profitability are the top performers, and by a huge amount. The S&P index returned 12% average per year between 2000 and 2024, highest quintile profitability returns slightly above 12.5%, and the last type mentioned hit 21%.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I imagine you are correct.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "nothing wrong with 10-15% small caps", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "U never know w this market.

That would be financial suicide and also impossible because we aren't remotely close to there yet and yields change as the bond market trading changes. \n\nThey would bleed money like a stuck pig if they made a wild guesses that far in advance and got it wrong. No one has a crystal ball.\n\nAnd it would be a wild guess because the \"pricing in\" shifts constantly. It is defined by what occurs in the daily trading on the bond market which fluctuates like any other market. There is no magic machine or mystical oracle.\n\nIf you want to understand what that looks like day-to-day, minute by minute, then check out the CBOT or ZQ futures which are the Fed Fund futures (of differing time periods).\n\nIf you prefer your data a little more easy to understand because you're better at reading pictures than charts (which I'm guessing is the case), then use the [CME TOOL](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) and be very sure to note how much it shifts day to day, month to month, etc. \n\nFor example, when the Japan carry trade unwound and the market shit itself in early August, there was a spike in probabilities of bigger rate cuts, yields tanked, bond prices went up.\n\nThen people stopped panicking and everything reverted as they priced in the new likelihood of less severe cuts. \n\nThese are not stagnant numbers. They are probabilities. They shift as the market shifts, information shifts, economy shifts and geo political events shift.\n\nWhich is why I said they've priced in 25bps for Sept. now (almost absolutely) and that number appears absolutely secure based on Powell's chatter at 10AM today.

Then banks tack on more points as they lend that money out to customers in loans, mortgages etc.\n\nLet's use mortages as an example (although this absolutely works with bonds/t-bills as well).\n\nLet's say the Fed rate is at 5% so banks grab some of that money and lend it out at whatever they want. Let's say they lend it at 7% in the form of mortgages. They net 2% profit on that trade.\n\nThen the Fed drops its rate to 4% so banks grab that 4% money and lend it out. \n\nOne bank decides to lend it out in mortgages set at 9% so they can get a 5% profit.\n\nEvery other bank lends it in mortgages set at 6% so they can get a 2% profit.\n\nWhich mortgages do you think sell?\n\nDo you think the basic LAW of supply/demand will dictate that the 9% mortgage will ever sell in that environment?\n\nNo. So they have to drop the rate.\n\nLike I said, it's the same with yields.

{"title": "ROTH IRA: All in on TESLA ", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/iwzq21zymfkd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=311c2c41cc913df1863fd39c03236c1ed7c0964c\n\n**I Believe in the MUSK**\n\n¬†\n\nI think Tesla is a highly undervalued play right now, especially in the AI sector.\n\n¬†\n\n**Anecdotal Evidence**\n\n¬†\n\nI‚Äôm starting with my own experience of traveling the world and seeing Teslas everywhere. I‚Äôve been to over 30 states and noticed their prevalence in each one. Beyond the U.S., I‚Äôve spotted Teslas in countries like Greece, Albania, the Philippines, Korea, and Germany. Even in some of the most remote parts of these countries, Teslas are present. To me, this shows the strength of the brand. Globally, people recognize Tesla as a leading car company, appreciating both its designs and the values it stands for.\n\n¬†\n\n**Elon Hate**\n\n¬†\n\nAlongside this, there‚Äôs the fact that Elon Musk‚Äîloved and hated by many‚Äîis the face of the company. Whether you like him or not, you can‚Äôt deny that he‚Äôs extremely well-known. And as they say, ‚Äúno press is bad press.‚Äù Everyone knows Musk and the cars he represents. Some may argue that his polarizing nature could harm Tesla, but I believe that people ultimately buy good vehicles, and their feelings about the CEO won‚Äôt stop Tesla‚Äôs success. Look at other tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg or Tim Cook, who have faced severe public backlash, yet their companies have continued to grow. Public opinion can change; Zuckerberg, for example, is now seen sporting gold chains and Yeezy clothing. I believe something similar will happen with Musk. Eventually, the dislike for him will either fade or turn into admiration. Don‚Äôt you want to be part of the Musky baby babe?\n\n¬†\n\n**2035 EV Mandates**\n\n¬†\n\nCurrently, 13 states have EV mandates for 2035 or earlier, and 45 states offer EV incentives. This means that people will have to switch to electric vehicles whether they like it or not. In these states alone, the population exceeds 60 million‚Äîthat‚Äôs already 18% of our entire country set to go EV within the next decade, and this number will only grow as more states pass similar laws. Personally, I think people should choose EVs because they‚Äôre a superior platform to ICE vehicles, not just because of mandates. Having visited several of these states, I can‚Äôt stress enough how many Teslas I see on the road‚Äîyou can‚Äôt drive for long without spotting one. They‚Äôre everywhere.\n\n¬†\n\n**Self-Driving**\n\n¬†\n\nWe all know Elon has repeatedly promised that self-driving technology would already be here, and I agree it‚Äôs frustrating. No one really knows when it will arrive. However, no other company is operating at Tesla‚Äôs level, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time until they solve the self-driving puzzle. Tesla has over 5 million vehicles constantly running and recording data, with that number only growing. No other automaker is collecting this amount of real-time, global data. Watch current videos of Tesla‚Äôs latest FSD (Full Self-Driving) version‚Äîyou‚Äôll be amazed at how close we are to success. A good YouTube channel to check out is AIDRIVR.\n\n¬†\n\n**RoboTaxi and Robo-Semi**\n\n¬†\n\nOnce self-driving is perfected, RoboTaxi and Robo-Semi trucks will revolutionize the industry. We already know that ride-hailing is a massive business with high demand. RoboTaxis will be able to undercut the cost of human drivers so significantly that most people will choose them 9 out of 10 times. Plus, a new segment of the market will emerge‚Äîpeople who start ride-hailing because of the reduced cost. We‚Äôve seen the success of companies like Waymo, which has a strong fanbase and continues to grow. Once Tesla nails self-driving and offers a superior service worldwide, it‚Äôs poised to dominate. The same goes for semi-trucks‚Äîcompanies will be eager to get their hands on them to comply with 2035 EV mandates, earn tax credits, and reduce costs by eliminating the need for human drivers and all associated expenses. Imagine a world where Optimus robots load a Tesla semi, which then drives itself across the country and is unloaded at another store‚Äîcompletely automated. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre too far off from that reality.\n\n¬†\n\n**Charging Infrastructure**\n\n¬†\n\nTesla has over 50,000 chargers worldwide, many of which are Superchargers. No other car company has this level of infrastructure and support. This is huge‚Äîother companies, like Rivian, are already signing deals with Tesla to use their chargers. Companies will be forced to stay competitive in the EV market. Consumers want to drive long distances; the U.S., for example, is built on the highway system. People don‚Äôt want to feel limited by their EVs, stuck within city limits, or forced to wait hours for their cars to charge. As people gradually switch to EVs, they‚Äôll demand the support that only Tesla can currently provide.\n\n¬†\n\n**Optimus**\n\nOptimus is still in its early stages, but it signals that Tesla has completed the consumer car phase of its business. Now, they just need to keep producing the S, 3, X, Y models, and the Cybertruck, making them more affordable. With that under control, Tesla has the bandwidth to focus on new ventures‚Äîwhere the real gains lie. Tesla can leverage the real-world AI they‚Äôve been training on driving data and apply it to Optimus. Every company is looking to reduce human labor and automate more tasks. Whether you like it or not, this shift is happening, and it‚Äôs wise to get on board by owning some stock. Fast food, for example, has been gradually reducing human interaction with touch screens‚Äîmany people now rarely interact with a person. With advancements in AI, robots like Optimus will become a part of our daily lives, running factories and handling repetitive tasks. While this will impact the job market in the short term, people will need to adapt and learn new skills, just like with any major societal shift. I don‚Äôt see widespread adoption happening anytime soon. I predict that by 2030, Optimus will be working in factories, but day-to-day use is likely at least a decade away. Still, in the long term, I believe it‚Äôs inevitable.  Imagine a world where Optimus is your wife's bf and you can spend all day gambling on stocks as he takes care of her.\n\nEDIT\\*\\*\n\nforgot to add this cus im regarded\n\n**Energy Sector**\n\n  \nTesla's energy sector more than doubled its profits since the last quarter, it will continue to grow and eventually outpace the automotive sector. Many people think Teslas is just an automotive company not realizing it's only one piece of the pie and will continue to play less and less into the company's profits. Tesla will eventually be regarded as a name like Apple with many sectors encapsulated under the name. Self Driving, Robots, Energy, etc. \n\n¬†\n\nThis is just some bs I wrote up off my dome while slacking at work. My prediction is a 3 trillion market cap by 2030, we shall see.

The current existing rob√≥ taxis have tens of thousands of dollars of sensors on them and are geofenced to small mapped out areas. Tesla is selling their vehicles for less than the sensors alone on those vehicles and teslas will eventually have non-geofences full self driving. The calculations are being done in real time by AI trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of real time driving footage from real people. Once completed a Tesla will be able to encounter any road, any situation, anywhere and solve it where as the other companies are focused on tiny areas just to get it working.

The only time most people will be charging away from home will be over long distances which is what superchargers are for and eventually battery tech will improve, we already have comparable ranges to ICE vehicles. The new model 3 long range gets 363 which is more than my small Toyota.\n\n The 38% revenue from carbon credits is just from a recent quarter most likely because they have a backlog of them and this is a rough time for sales so they need to claim them in order to help prop up the business while theyre suffering. Tesla will survive long term.\n\n The vehicle sector of tesla is definetly the most prominent portion currently, but long term it will not be. That is why they market themselves as a technology company, they ened ot sell the cars to people first for them to want to purchase FSD eventually once it gets better. Having an EV will lead them down the road into Tesla energy by having battery walls installed or solar tiles on their roofs. The energy sector profits more than doubled last quarter for tesla, this is the beginning of the transition of profits into other sectors.\n\n Teslas are already cheap enough a new model 3 costs about the same as a toyota corolla, not to say 26k is cheap by any means. I definetly wouldnt buy one new but a lot of people would the F150 is the most popular vehicle in america and costs 45k+.
