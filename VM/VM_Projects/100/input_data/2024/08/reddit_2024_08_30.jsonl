Its a contract to buy(call) or sell(put) a number of shares(usually 1 contract controls 100 shares) at a specific price(strike) on or before a specific date(the most common type, north american contracts are on or before). As an aside, options do not infer voting rights, nor dividends.\n\nYour maximum risk differs for a call vs a put, and if you are long or short.\n\nIf you are long a contract, you have bought the rights to buy(call) someone else's shares, or put(sell) shares to someone else. Your risk is always limited to the premium you paid for that contract. You can choose to exercise that contract on any date on or before the expiration(north american contact). Example: You buy 1 call contract with a $10/share premium and a strike of $100 and expiration of date D. You pay 10 * 100=$1000 today for the contract, you are only ever risking $1000. You can sell it at any point up to the expiration for whatever the contract is currently trading at. Or you can choose to exercise it or or before some date in which case you need to pay another 100 * 100=$10000 and you are delivered 100 shares of XYZ. Your total price was 11,000, so its exactly the same as just buying each share for 110(+trade fees, per contract fees, and exercise fee). Or you can do nothing, and on date D+1 the contract expires worthless, all rights and obligations expire, and you have only lost the original $1000 you paid.\n\nIf you are the writer of the contract, or are short a contract. You have entered into a contract to either sell someone your shares(short call), or the obligation to buy shares from someone else(short put) upon demand if the contract it exercised. \n\nIf you sell short 1 put of XYZ at a premium of $10/share, and a strike of $100. You will collect 10 * 100=$1000. At any point on or before the expiration you may have to pay another $10000 for 100 shares if the other party chooses to exercise their contract. Your maximum risk is $11,000 less whatever the shares are worth when you sell them.\n\nIf instead you sell short 1 call of XYZ at a premium of $10/share and a strike of $100. You again collect $1000. But your risk may be infinite. If you own shares, you have written a covered call, and your risk is whatever you paid for the shares-$1000-$10000(and don't forget the lost opportunity cost of being forced to sell below market, the lost opportunity cost is potentially infinite but you don't pay it with dollars). If instead you do not have 100 shares, if you have written a naked short call, your real losses are potentially infinite. You will be forced to go to the market and buy 100 shares for whatever they cost, then deliver those shares for $10000. Practically speaking you don't need to go buy 100 shares instantly(tho your broker may force you to do so), you will be short 100 shares, but the risk is infinite until you buy shares to close out the short. Whenever you do buy shares, again you losses are whatever you paid for the shares -$11000.\n\nWhen someone chooses to exercise a contract, a random person who is short a contract is assigned the exercise, and they must in very little time fulfill the obligations. If you are short a contract, there is always a risk that you many be assigned at any time; and you must be ready for that\n\nAlso, not tax advice, but tax consequences also different if you are long vs short, they can also different for calls or puts. For example in the US closing a long call or put position can be short or long term capital gains when you close it depending on how long you have owned it. Closing a short call/put position is always short term capital gains no matter how long you have owned it. If you choose to exercise a call, that is not a taxable event. If you choose to exercise a put, that is a taxable event. If you are assigned on a short call that is a taxable event.

The market will learn more as this develops over the next few quarters. While Nvidia is currently enjoying strong demand in AI and data center markets, the slowdown in Moore's Law, coupled with delays in the Blackwell chip release, could pose challenges to its growth if Nvidia continues to experience delays and has to continue to rely on the Hopper series, particularly in the near term. My decision to be 2x short on Nvidia stems from several risks occurring simultaneously: economic downturns, the potential for expanded chip trade restrictions including net new, servicing and components restrictions which I think Jake Sullivan will continue to enact, which could gain bipartisan support regardless of the election outcome,  additional delays in Blackwell chip releases, and potential shifts in the economic cycle during downturns or a possible recession.\n\nThis potential pause in spending, especially by hyperscalers, is the critical factor I'm considering. Even in a long-term CAPEX cycle, I expect some brakes to be applied in the short to mid-term, impacting Nvidia's growth trajectory, there's never been a riskier time in the growth story of Nvidia in my eyes.\n\nLet's face it, this stock is now a meme (albeit a great company), there's going to be a reversion to the mean eventually in the short-term.

That's a huge risk imo. Right now may be your last great opportunity to get out of that. This is just my personal opinion, and is not investment advice. \n\nThe only known limit on Nvidia's growth is TSMC's ability to make chips. But think about that: TSMC's number one customer is Apple. Nvidia is number two. How often have you heard a market report say that Apple is at risk due to TSMC's potential to make more chips? Never. Not ever. So why do people worry about Nvidia's supply from TSMC? (The only real risk is an invasion of Taiwan by China, and if that happens every single mega cap tech stock is in deep trouble).\n\nFor comparison, I think Tesla is in the process of turning into a regular auto maker. Their profit margin is already at that level. The auto industry PE is typically around 10. But Tesla's PE is at around 60. That's more than most high-growth, high profit mega cap tech stocks. It's nuts. Tesla's stock is massively over-priced by any objective measure, and ripe for shorting.\n\nBut even then, I would not short Tesla. There's just too much risk. There are so many Tesla bros and crypto bros pumping the stock every time Musk promises something random that it's just not a safe bet. \n\nNvidia is absolutely a high growth, high margin tech stock. NVDA is on a clear path to higher prices for the foreseeable future.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "When comparing Apple's and Nvidia's reliance on TSMC, Nvidia is hit harder in this event of any supply chain disruption. Nvidia depends nearly 100% on TSMC for GPU production, there is no alternative, while Apple has a more diverse product lineup and multiple chip suppliers, giving it a better chance to weather such issues.   \n  \nSo, concerns about Nvidia's dependency on TSMC are valid, given its unique strategic needs and the different market dynamics it faces. I don't foresee a Taiwan invasion in the short term, but the risk isn't just about TSMC's capacity to produce chips; it's about Nvidia's specific requirements for the latest technology and its exposure to fast-changing markets, making its reliance on TSMC more vulnerable.\n\nI don't follow Tesla closely myself, but I can't bring myself to short a company led by someone whose behavior seems erratic and who appears heavily reliant on keeping the stock price inflated.

But if there is an issue, it's only about a delay in supply meeting demand, which will be met later by increased supply as TSMC builds new fab capacity.\n\nYou raised a point about Blackwell that I didn't respond to. On that, too, I wouldn't bet against Nvidia. They have a long track record of emulating their chip designs in software before sending them to be fabricated.

The advisors are considering a full range of options, including splitting off and selling businesses, the person said.\n\nIntel shares rose more than 8% on the report in Friday morning trading.\n\n[Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/intel-is-said-to-explore-options-to-cope-with-historic-slump) first reported that the company was working with its advisors to come up with strategic options. Spokespeople for Intel and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.\n\nCEO Pat Gelsinger acknowledged publicly on Thursday that the company understood investor skepticism and was working to address it.\n\n“We realize we have to operate efficiently with nimbleness, with urgency,” Gelsinger said at Deutsche Bank’s Technology Conference. CNBC previously reported that some advisors, including Morgan Stanley, were helping the company on activism defense.\n\nIntel remains on track to launch its next iteration of its laptop central processor, Lunar Lake, Gelsinger said at the appearance. But investors don’t see a turnaround on the horizon, and have pushed the stock down almost 60% this year.\n\nThe once-dominant company has been trounced primarily by Nvidia, which produces the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are are the heart of today’s prominent AI models.\n\nAlongside a disastrous earnings report earlier this month, Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 workers. The job cuts, part of a broader focus on slashing expenses, did little to assuage investor dismay. And while Gelsinger said Thursday that the company’s foundry business had roughly a dozen interested customers, the buildout remains costly for Intel.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/intel-working-with-bankers-to-present-board-with-strategic-options.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/intel-working-with-bankers-to-present-board-with-strategic-options.html)", "id": "1f54n54", "created_utc": 1725048131.0, "score": 551, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "I don’t think that consulting overpaid bankers is a good move for high end chip company.", "score": 726, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 262, "replies": [{"body": "Man I laughed so hard at this", "score": 52, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The cash crunch is real.

I don't sell usually strangles, but i look to see if price is trading closer to the upper or lower band and sell OTM calls above the upper or OTM puts bellow the lower. For earnings change the standard deviation parameters to  (4,-4.2) and sell at or further OTM strikes. I always sell ONE contract  per strike price and set limit orders extending further OTM.

This way if price is more volatile than anticipated (which it usually is) I can get my target price of 0.75 at multiple strikes instead of just having multiple contracts on one strike. This lessens my chances of all of them getting assigned so I just keep the premium,  and if I do get assigned it will only be one or or two strikes instead of 3 at 1 strike.

That'll change as it gets closer. Also MM currently pricing in $20 move from now until then so basically expecting $185-225 from yesterday's close.\n\nSo how do I use this to sell calls and puts? There's no real huge TSLA catalysts, MM pricing in $12ish move next week or $196-220. Then since that's where all those call strikes are next week, selling the $230C+ should be \"safe\" since that's basically the priced in MM move from the high interest call strike.\n\nThen the $230C is around 7 delta or a 7% probability of happening. Going to the put side, that's about the same as the $185P. So since those are both outside what the MM is pricing in now and for the monthly opex, that's what I sell knowing I can always roll until things make sense.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Nice.

Intel needs to make a superior product that is made in their (Intel's) fabs and not in TSMC's fabs. And they need to do that in 2025/2026. This is not impossible at all, but it is difficult and requires a lot of things to be executed well.\n\n\n\nIt seems you are very confused about Intel's production capabilities and their strategy to outsource part of their production to TSMC. You should read up on this in more detail, so you don't make a fool out of yourself.\n\nIntel has always outsourced part of their production to TSMC, even when they were very successful. This will continue.  \nHowever, their current process is struggling and they are forced to outsource even more, especially for high-end processes used in their current CPU's. Their current CPU's are OK'ish but not great, and because they outsource to TSMC their margins are lower than in the past.\n\nIn parallel to this, Intel has (and is building) a lot of fab production capacity of their own. And they are qualifying new production processes to be run in those Intel fabs. Specifically, Intel20A and Intel 18A are technologically superior to what TSMC does today. The big IF is whether Intel can ramp those processes into high-margin production lines in 2025/2026. Having really good chips that cost more to make than to sell is useless.\n\nIf they do this, they will have a superior product (both their CPUs and their foundry offerings) that will run in their own fabs. THAT is where success lays.\n\n  \nNothing of this is new, this is clearly out in the open and publicly stated very clearly by Intel's management.

I thought it was an intelligent investment decision and not a gamble (because bronze is composed of about 88% copper) but I got thousands of comments and dms telling me about how dumb my analysis was and that I should sell immediately and quit options.\n\nAt first I didn't really listen to these ppl because I was up a little bit on my positions, but then copper started mooning in price and i was down thousands out of nowhere, so I doubled down on my position thinking there was no way it could go higher and I took out some margin and bought more puts on a different strike price to average down, but it kept going higher. Currently I'm down about -$8.5k on my shorts.\n\nSince I only had about $400 of cash in my account left I decided to play around with 0DTE SPY options, I made a little money back initially, but then I woke up today and checked my account and somehow there was a naked call in my account that I didn't even buy, I was only trading long calls and puts but somehow it was in my portfolio and said that i needed to buy 100 shares of SPY as collateral immediately before it closes. I have no idea how this got there, I tried switching to a cash account but it said I had to close my margin positions first, so as the market closed, it automatically bought 100 shares of SPY and now I owe $56k to my brokerage. Im only 19 and essentially my life is ruined and I have no idea what to do or how I can ever repay this, I haven't even told my mom or dad.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fn0sfwybjvld1.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=44426c7724c4bc2ed8e332dbf1586ed001a20ea2\n\n", "id": "1f57hs5", "created_utc": 1725055364.0, "score": 7373, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 1853, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 8 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments** | 11 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 weeks | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Haha this is a joke right?

Actually define it for me. It's literally the optional right to spy shares at at a strike price. OP by definition has sold the to buy 100 shares at 567. Why the fuck would risk analyst at the broker force him to buy the shares, what stupid model are they using to model his position where they think yeah this is so risky, that we can't even force him to liquidate his short call, we straight up have to force him to buy a hundred share than spend a single cent buying a call from a market maker to cover his short call to someone else. I'm pretty sure that cent is both cheaper than 57,000 dollars and he has sold premium so he even has a cent in his account to cover it too. He can even spend a cent to buy a 566 call.

Provide proof he's long 100 shares in his account, like draw a red circle where you've come to that conclusion because my math actually lines up. He's net zero shares, with an expired short call that poses a liquidity requirement of that number. It's basically a UI bug, but it's basically not wrong either.

There's multiple videos of these HUGE losses that are actually green positions or down like 300 dollars.\n\nYou don't know what you're fucking on about, please stop giving false, dangerous advice. Face reality and lose the ego boss.\n\nEdit: Lame guy lol, blocked me. Other than this story being fake he doesnt understand the fact that a broker will not buy 100 shares at close to cover such a short call, they will liquidate your position. Never in a million years would they buy this at close, they would have liquidated his short call position around 1 hour before close unless you have a tastyworks account that has some real degen options that you can hold literally to close, again, if the risk was excessive, they still would cover the short call buy buying a long call at that exact strike.
