{"title": "Musk lays off Tesla senior executives", "selftext": "Elon Musk has dismissed two Tesla senior executives and plans to lay off hundreds more employees, frustrated by falling sales and the pace of job cuts so far, The Information reported on Tuesday, citing the CEO’s email to senior managers.\n\nRebecca Tinucci, senior director of the electric vehicle maker’s Supercharger business, and Daniel Ho, head of the new vehicles program, will leave on Tuesday morning, the report said.\n\nMusk also plans to dismiss everyone working for Tinucci and Ho, including the roughly 500 employees who work in the Supercharger group, The Information said. It was not clear how many employees worked for Ho.\n\nTesla’s public policy team, which was led by former executive Rohan Patel, will also be dissolved, the report said.\n\n“Hopefully these actions are making it clear that we need to be absolutely hard core about headcount and cost reduction,” Musk wrote in the email, the report said. “While some on exec staff are taking this seriously, most are not yet doing so.”\n\nTesla, which had 140,473 employees globally as of end-2023, did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.\n\nHo joined Tesla in 2013 and was a program manager in the development of the Model S, the 3, and the Y before being put in charge of all new vehicles, while Tinucci joined in 2018 as a senior product manager, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\n\nTwo other senior leaders — Patel and battery development chief Drew Baglino — announced their departures earlier this month, when Tesla also ordered the layoffs of more than 10% of its workforce.\n\nTesla is grappling with falling sales and an intensifying price war, which led to its quarterly revenue falling for the first time since 2020, the company reported last week.\n\nMusk made progress towards rolling out Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance package in China, the epicenter of the EV price war, during a surprise visit to Beijing on Sunday.\n\nThat trip came just over a week after he scrapped a planned trip to India, where Tesla has long sought to start operations, due to “very heavy Tesla obligations.”\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/30/musk-lays-off-tesla-senior-executives-in-fresh-job-cuts-report.html", "id": "1cgt3v8", "created_utc": 1714484414.0, "score": 2632, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 686, "comments": [{"body": "So entire supercharging division being shut down, what?", "score": 658, "replies": [{"body": "All gone as of yesterday.", "score": 277, "replies": [{"body": "So, one of the key selling points for buying the car (super charging and it's network) is being reduced or won't exist?", "score": 374, "replies": [{"body": "Its currently looking very shaky!", "score": 148, "replies": [{"body": "Concerning.", "score": 114, "replies": [{"body": "Shocking!", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Ohm...", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Watt?", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "kill-a-watt?", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Well, apparently not for long from now on 🙃", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Worrying", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Looking into it.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Lol lol.

Let's focus to actual facts instead of leaning into this rage bait narrative about inflation. Because inflation is very real, it's not some concocted boogie man, and the majority of companies are not lying about inflation just to milk profits. I keep seeing people saying this and it's just untrue, it's just propaganda from people who want everyone to hate capitalism because they haven't figured out communism is a scam yet. \n\nAverage corporate profit margins (margins meaning **percentages** of revenue) have not significantly changed in recent years. There has been a small percentage of growth but that is just future proofing, not greed. That's because the prices are intended to stay in place after the adjustment for a long time, so it's going to be slightly more profitable now and then it's going to gradually becomes less and less profitable over the next decade until they're forced to adjust prices again. That difference is going to average out across this time frame. \n\nThe future proofing could also be more aggressive as this is a very severe inflationary period where a shitload of money was printed, and our economy is still playing catch up from the lockdowns, not to mention all the money being printed today to send to Ukraine and now Israel. It will be 2030 before we finally begin approaching normal inflation levels again, and it could be much longer because they can't seem to stop themselves from making it worse, and they're also finagling with government assets to slow down the effect by spreading it out. The adjustment was already set in stone when they printed the money though, so all they're doing is drawing it out to take even longer. Anyway all of this is why companies would likely pad more aggressively at this time. There is still a lot of salary adjustments and expense increases down the road, and they want to avoid raising their prices as much as possible for that entire duration as they know they'll alienate users every time they touch prices. \n\nPoint is the inflation argument is very real, and very valid, and the majority of companies are not abusing it to gaslight price gouging.

{"title": "Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings", "selftext": "Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. \n\nLet's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years—it's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.\n\nLooking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.\n\nThe takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing—other big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.\n\n# Revenue Beat\n\nAmazon’s revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year – online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon’s revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.\n\n# EPS Beat \n\nAmazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.\n\n# Possible Dividend Announcement\n\nMeta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon—when are they joining the dividend party?\n\nBy the numbers, it seems like it’s about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.\n\nIn comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year—though most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.\n\nFor Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.\n\nBut what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.\n\nThis 2.4% isn't just dividends—it includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon’s hefty cash flow, it’s looking more and more like they’re due to start sharing the wealth.\n\nJust for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft’s sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft’s expected to hit sales around $260 billion.\n\nAmazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft’s stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they’d need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends—totally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.\n\nBottom line: Amazon doesn’t need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad.

Do you think you are spilling some profound insight that no one knows? So yes if market expects a hawkish Powell and he stays neutral, that's by definition dovish from market perspective \n\nMarket is pricing in only 1 rate cut, when almost every economist anticipates 2 this year. That means it's already priced in rate hike risks already.\n\nSaying rate hike is more likely than rate cut is borderline stupid when core pce yoy is 2.8%, and fed fund rate is 5.5%. Unless the core pce comes in at 0.4% every month from now, Powell's not gonna hike rate. \n\nPowell said it himself a few weeks ago. There's very little risk of inflation accelerating, and some risk of inflation being sticky at 2.5-3%. If that's the case, the fed will hold rate, not hike, because 5.5% against 3% inflation is still restrictive. Let's not forget the core pce yoy was above 4% when they decided to hold rate last year and stop hiking.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
