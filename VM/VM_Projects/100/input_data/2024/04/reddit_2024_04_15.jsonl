Nope. Even now, Intel is bringing in over double the revenue that AMD is, yet AMD is valued almost 75% higher. They've sunk many tens of billions on building fabs, yet they still remain profitable.

{"title": "Tesla execs Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel depart as company announces layoffs", "selftext": "Tesla executives Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel announced Monday they are leaving the electric vehicle maker and clean energy company. CEO Elon Musk thanked both departing execs on X, the social network he owns and runs as chief technology officer.\n\nThe news comes after Tesla said it is laying off more than 10% of its workforce.\n\nBaglino had worked with Tesla since its early years, starting as a firmware and electrical engineer in 2006. He most recently reported directly to Musk as the company’s senior vice president for powertrain and energy engineering.\n\nPatel joined Tesla in 2016 after working as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama on climate and energy issues, among other policy matters.\n\nReuters recently reported that Tesla has set aside plans to make a more affordable new EV at Musk’s direction. The strategy shift includes a greater focus on developing a “robotaxi” and comes amid steep competition including from BYD and other Chinese automakers with more affordable electric cars.\n\nPatel and Baglino had been deeply involved in battery and vehicle manufacturing, related policy, and turning Tesla into a multinational EV manufacturer. They were less involved in autonomous vehicle technology at Tesla. \n\nBaglino wrote in a post on X:\n\n“I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday. I am so thankful to have worked with and learned from the countless incredibly talented people at Tesla over the years. I loved tackling nearly every problem we solved as a team and feel gratified to have contributed to the mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy, a mission that I am quite passionate about.”\n\nMusk responded on the platform, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Few have contributed as much as you.”\n\nAs of Monday morning, Tesla had not yet updated the “leadership” information on its corporate webpage to reflect Baglino’s departure.\n\nPatel wrote in a post on the social network, “The past 8 years at Tesla have been filled with every emotion — but the feeling I have today is utmost gratitude,” adding, “My immigrant parents worked their asses off and as a result I’m the luckiest dude. Lucky to have been a part of @BarackObama’s campaign/administration, and truly honored to have worked at @Tesla to positively changing multiple industries.”\n\nMusk replied to Patel, saying, “Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Much appreciated.”\n\nThe CEO also said, in a post on X on Monday, “About every 5 years, we need to reorganize and streamline the company for the next phase of growth.”\n\nBaglino and Patel were not immediately available for comment.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/15/tesla-execs-drew-baglino-and-rohan-patel-depart-amid-steep-layoffs.html", "id": "1c4wan2", "created_utc": 1713212102.0, "score": 1052, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 351, "comments": [{"body": "$TSLA is going to get very, very ugly.

Battery cell production and the un-boxed vehicle fabrication process were supposed to help this by making inexpensive EVs affordable for most people.  \n\n* Complete de-funding and laying off staff for NV9 (Next-Generation Vehicle, NGV) could potentially mean postponement of the NGV for years, or even cancellation.  It is difficult to re-start complicated, large scale engineering projects once they are mothballed.  Talent moves to other divisions or entirely different companies.  Institutional knowledge is lost.  The supply chain never gets built.  Machinery that's already been ordered may have to be scrapped.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "That being said, I'm skeptical that Tesla is totally retreating from manufacturing as aggressively as some fear in the wake of today's news. \n\nThere's still a lot of groundwork at Gigafactory Texas that appears to be manufacturing related:\n\n* 7-story parking garage.  Tesla probably wouldn't need anywhere near this amount of parking if they were going to just add a small number of engineering staff for the Robotaxi datacenter. \n* Work on the Die Shop and Cathode Plant continue.  If Tesla didn't intend to expand vehicle production, these facilities and the Corpus Christi lithium refinery would have been frozen.  \n* Deployment of heavy foundations and what appear to be paint tanks, on the South side expansion of Giga Texas, imply manufacturing application rather than computer datacenter application.  On the other hand, it is possible that the expansion houses both manufacturing and datacenter operations.  \n\n  \nTesla also needs to maintain a healthy automotive business to provide cash flow for AI efforts.  \n\n  \nAlthough I think it is likely that Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel were fired from Tesla (aka asked to resign) today, it is also possible that they resigned of their own accord if Musk was taking Tesla in a direction they did not agree with. \n\n* Baglino, like his predecessor and mentor, J.B. Straubel, appears to have been highly committed to Tesla's sustainable energy mission.  A Tesla pivot to AI might have caused misalignment with Baglino's professional goals.  \n\n  \nFrom an investment perspective, the lack of specific clarification from Tesla about its future plans doesn't help the company's valuation.  Shareholders deserve to know if there's been a major shift since last year, the nature of that shift, and the reasoning behind it.  \n\n* Is Tesla abandoning the Master Plan Part 3 that they advertised at Investor Day 2023?  If so, why?\n* What is their plan now?\n\n  \nElon Musk stated in December of last year that he would describe Tesla's plans for 2024, after the filing of the 2023 Form 10-K.

So he tried to back out, but the courts said no. \n\nNow TSLA has declined by almost 50% from its peak, and oh yeah the Delaware court threw out his $55B pay package as unfair.

I think that’s probably a good way to start and then you can evolve the process to suit who you are individually. \n\nI think that’s the most important thing you can do: build your system tailored to who you are and your strengths. Acknowledge your weaknesses and deficits readily and you can improve them or ensure they don’t end up in your system. \n\nAs for me, a lot of what I do to journal trades now is mostly just extensive backtesting in excel to look for what the data bears out in regards to my ideas.
