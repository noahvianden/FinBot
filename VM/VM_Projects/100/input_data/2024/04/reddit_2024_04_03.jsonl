{"title": "Amazon cuts hundreds of jobs in cloud computing unit", "selftext": "Amazon‚Äôs cloud computing division is laying off hundreds of employees in its physical stores technology and sales and marketing units, the company confirmed on Wednesday.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve identified a few targeted areas of the organization we need to streamline in order to continue focusing our efforts on the key strategic areas that we believe will deliver maximum impact,‚Äù an AWS spokesperson said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt make these decisions lightly, and we‚Äôre committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition to new roles in and outside of Amazon.‚Äù\n\nThe cuts were first reported by GeekWire.\n\nAmazon‚Äôs lucrative AWS unit has seen its sales growth decelerate in recent quarters as companies trimmed their cloud spend amid rising interest rates. Amazon executives expressed some optimism in February when they said the market is starting to show signs of a reacceleration.\n\nThe cuts to AWS‚Äô store technology team come after Amazon said it would remove cashierless checkout systems in its U.S. Fresh stores. The AWS unit includes teams overseeing the cashierless tech, called Just Walk Out, as well as its Dash smart carts and Amazon One palm-based payment technology. The store technology team was moved out of Amazon‚Äôs retail group and folded into its cloud computing division in 2022.\n\nThe AWS spokesperson said the company decided to make cuts to the store technology division ‚Äúas a result of a broader strategic shift in the use of some applications in Amazon‚Äôs owned as well as in third-party stores.‚Äù\n\nAmazon continues to trim its headcount after more than a year of mass layoffs. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs across almost every area of the company. So far this year, Amazon has laid off employees in its Twitch, Audible, Buy with Prime, and Prime Video and MGM Studios units.\n\nEmployees in the U.S. will continue to receive their pay and benefits for at least 60 days, and they will be eligible for a severance package.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/03/amazon-layoffs-hundreds-of-jobs-cut-in-cloud-computing-unit.html", "id": "1buvr9l", "created_utc": 1712158783.0, "score": 475, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "They should mention how they overhired at one point!!!", "score": 237, "replies": [{"body": "Management will never admit that", "score": 69, "replies": []}, {"body": "They hired everyone to prevent competition.

{"title": "Disney wins proxy fight with Peltz‚Äôs Trian, as shareholders reelect full board ", "selftext": "Disney shareholders on Wednesday reelected the media conglomerate‚Äôs full board, preliminary results show, handing a stinging defeat to activist Nelson Peltz and former Marvel CEO Ike Perlmutter, both of whom agitated for change at one of America‚Äôs most storied companies.\n\nThe widely expected victory caps a combative months-long process and affirms the board‚Äôs decisions, from the move to bring back CEO Bob Iger to his efforts to re-invigorate the $223 billion media company. Peltz and Trian wanted to oust two directors ‚Äî Maria Elena Lagomasino and Michael Froman ‚Äî citing sustained share underperformance, a failed succession process, and billions in misdirected investments.\n\nA second activist, Blackwells, also failed to win board seats in its own long-shot bid.\n\nDisney deployed significant resources in the proxy fight. The company called in support from its founding family, Star Wars creator George Lucas, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Pixar and Apple CEO Steve Jobs.\n\nThe company also spent an estimated $40 million fighting off Peltz. The full-court press worked. Disney‚Äôs two largest shareholders, Vanguard and Blackrock, reportedly decided to back management in the final days before Wednesday‚Äôs meeting.\n\nUltimately, the activist failed to convince enough retail or institutional shareholders that he had a meaningful plan to fix the House of Mouse. While Peltz‚Äôs candidacy picked up meaningful support from proxy advisors and smaller institutional investors, shareholders were less compelled by former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo, whom Trian also nominated to the board.\n\nPeltz, who dislikes being called an activist but has orchestrated successful campaigns at iconic companies like PepsiCo, P&G and Wendy‚Äôs, controls a $3.98 billion stake in Disney, or about 2% of total shares outstanding. Most of those shares are owned by Perlmutter.\n\nWith Disney shares up nearly 50% since Peltz‚Äôs campaign first began, Trian and Perlmutter gained a lot despite their board defeat. Peltz is partially on the hook for an estimated $25 million spent on the fight, a small amount compared to the paper gains in the stake he controls.\n\nAs it moves past the battle with Peltz, Disney still faces down unprecedented challenges. ESPN has shed subscribers for years, raising questions about whether it is prepared to go toe-to-toe with streaming upstarts. Disney‚Äôs streaming business has spent billions to win subscribers and is losing money as it tries to catch up to market leader Netflix.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, the company is searching for a successor to Iger for the second time in five years. Disney‚Äôs botched succession, where Iger‚Äôs hand-picked replacement Bob Chapek was ousted just two years into his tenure, was a key point Trian used against the company.\n\nThere is evidence that major proxy advisors agreed with Peltz‚Äôs argument that the board was ill-equipped to take on a second search process.\n\nShareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS both noted the succession issues in their recommendations to investors. Glass Lewis sided with Disney and asserted Iger‚Äôs return, paired with this year‚Äôs nominations of Morgan Stanley Chairman James Gorman and former Sky CEO Jeremy Darroch to the board, have given the company ‚Äúadequate opportunity to launch a more credible succession program and develop, communicate and execute on several key initiatives which appear to reasonably target acknowledged operational and financial weaknesses at Disney.‚Äù\n\nInvestors rallied around Disney in February after the company made a series of major announcements durings its earnings call, including that it had obtained the exclusive streaming rights to Taylor Swift‚Äôs Eras Tour concert film, a $1.5 billion strategic investment in Epic Games as well as a flagship ESPN streaming service.\n\nPeltz called the slew of announcements a ‚Äúspaghetti-against-the-wall‚Äù plan that was meant to ‚Äúdistract shareholders.‚Äù\n\nShares of Disney have jumped 23% since Disney‚Äôs fiscal first quarter earnings report in early February.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/03/disney-annual-meeting-shareholders-vote-on-nelson-peltz-and-bob-iger.html", "id": "1buyjxb", "created_utc": 1712165234.0, "score": 688, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 178, "comments": [{"body": "the succession adaption will be crazy", "score": 261, "replies": [{"body": "Kendall still failing for a spot even after turning 80", "score": 81, "replies": [{"body": "HES THE ELDEST BOY!", "score": 30, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Even Stewey got a board seat.", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I saw this come up on my feed yesterday.

Here's a summary of the information from the sources provided:\n\n1. **Challenges Faced by Boeing:** The challenges faced by Boeing in 2023 include issues with its defense business, margin pressure, costly charges, manufacturing quality issues, and delivery delays in the commercial airplanes division. These challenges may impact the company's financial objectives and stock attractiveness, raising concerns about its medium-term outlook.\n2. **Potential Rebound Factors:** Despite the recent decline in Boeing stock, there are several potential tailwinds that could support a rebound. The recent incident involving a 737 MAX 9 jet in an Alaska Air Group flight may have caused a spike in bearish sentiment, leading to the stock's decline. However, analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group have rolled out an outlook for 2024 that favors a breakout in the United States manufacturing sector, which could benefit Boeing. Additionally, the backlog of orders in the industry is beginning to rise, indicating increasing demand.\n3. **Valuation and Market Sentiment:** The recent decline in Boeing stock may have been overdone, as 100% of all the jet orders involve either 737 MAX 8 or MAX 10 jets, and none of these orders include MAX 9 jets. This suggests that the market may be bidding up the stock in anticipation of an earnings beat. The article also discusses the valuation of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, noting that both stocks are being punished for the faulty MAX 9 incident, despite the majority of their revenues coming from MAX 8 and 10 models.
