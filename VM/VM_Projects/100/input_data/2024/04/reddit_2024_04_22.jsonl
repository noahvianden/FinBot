A couple points:\n\nThe price cuts are actually less than what Tesla buyers were getting right before the quarter ended.  I got a Model Y with a $4500 inventory discount, a friend got $4900 off.  In most markets these discounts were easy to find.  Then they raised prices $1000 April 1st, ended inventory discounts (they'll likely be back), and then announced a $2000 price cut (which is really only $1000 with the increase).  In the end prices for most buyers of standard models have increased in the past few months, although the year-to-year decrease is dramatic.\n\nRegarding the Model 2, we don't know that it's cancelled, that story has not been confirmed.  I can see Tesla deciding that the lower-price market may not be worth pursuing due to low margins, especially in the face of Chinese competition.  Historically low-end models by legacy automakers often lose money per car and are designed to build brand loyalty.   It's rational not to adopt that strategy for Tesla and other EV manufacturers.\n\nAlternatively, and I personally think this makes more sense, as cost efficiencies increase, it may make more sense to drop RWD Model 3 price towards that 25K cost point (if the tax credit is factored in).

NASA ran a competition for their commercial crew missions (launching astronauts to the ISS). Boeing and SpaceX won (it's more complicated than that but that's the short answer).

To the every day consumer, (folks who actually go outside), the most important aspects of a car is its price, reliability, fuel economy, safety, and the price of insurance. Time and time again, over the last five years, Tesla has shown itself to be a comparatively sub-par product in comparison to the rest of the market. \n\nPoor build quality. Deliberate obfuscation of practical battery range. Negligible cost-differences in “fueling” the vehicle. Comedically high insurance quotes. Higher environmental impact for production, maintenance, and USE of the vehicle itself. (Not to mention child labor and the exploitation of the third world for the accumulation, and subsequent transport of obscure heavy metals). \n\nTesla has effectively NEVER been a profitable company. In fact the majority of its revenue comes from government stimulus on both the manufacturing, AND consumer ends— want to buy a Tesla? “The government will give you up to ~7,500 USD in incentives~” \n(Don’t even get me started on the absurdity of selling carbon credits to competitors in the market…)\n\nThis tricks consumers, and speculators alike into thinking that Tesla motors is some unicorn-company that’s “obviously going to keep growing”, when in reality, the entire sector for Electric vehicles is built upon a foundation of misinformation, and the exploitation of peoples general ignorance/fears. \n\nToyota has electric cars. Mercedes has electric cars. Volkswagen has electric cars. Fuck, even Ford, who make dog-shit, has electric cars. These are manufacturers who’ve been in the game for decades, if not over a century. Not only this, but there are legitimate, all-electric alternatives in the market such as Rivian, (they even have an electric goddam Hummer. A HUMMMER!) which means that if consumers truly want to buy an electric car, (which the VAST MAJORITY of working people don’t) theres plenty of competition to fulfill whatever little demand there is.\n\nThe bottom line is that most of the product that Tesla offers, is surpassed by nearly every metric by practically every-other manufacturer. And after the last two winters— (not to mention the last few years of economic hardship imposed upon consumers by inflationary monetary policy and restrictive legislation in the automotive sector, under the false pretenses of “environmental protection”, as if these political parasites actually care)— people are starting to wake up and realize that the momentum that has been built up for Tesla and electric cars in general is nothing more than a house of cards. And ultimately, the consumer dictates the direction of the market, by making their personal financial choices according to their principles and a general internal logic. \n\nLiterally, if it weren’t for the needless involvement from daddy-government in propping up Tesla, in conjunction with social media hype preying on people’s ignorance, Tesla’s market cap would CAVE in the markets. \n\n\n[[Also, as a side note… nobody cares about Elon Musks opinions one way or another. He’s just a guy who came from exorbitant wealth, made a couple of lucky moves, and has ended up in the center of the social zeitgeist. Everyday people don’t pay attention for the most part, and to suggest that anything that Elon Musk has said or done in the public sphere affects the sales of his automobiles, is pure ignorance based in the projection of one’s own covert disapproval of the words/sounds that come out of his face.]]\n\n[[[Side note to the side note.

I don't need a supercomputer to compare Musk's earlier claims - on which TSLA's sky high valuation was based, since it wasn't sales or profits - with what the company has actually delivered.

It is what the market sees as a fair price, and I can guarantee you that over the short term, the market is correct.\n\nThe reason it fell is because on any particular day there are always new calculations being done.  You get this, right?  You are never actually fixed to believe only one thing in your life, right?  The question is: will the market see things rosier tomorrow or less rosy?  What are the risks of both?  What is the actual upside and downside?  \n\n>why do expect it will rise\n\nI never said I did.  You keep trying to put those words in my mouth.  What I am saying is that the price over the short term (< 3 months) already has all risks and opportunities baked in.  Tomorrow there may be new calculations.  Biden could suddenly announce interest cuts.  GM could announce that they once again will have no chance at actually producing a decent EV.  Who the hell knows?  \n\nWhat I expect is that there is approximately a 50/50 shot it will go down or go up, modified by risks to either side.  \n\nAnd if you think you have some secret knowledge, get out there and make your bets.  You are gambling, but I am not your mom.  Do whatever you feel is correct.\n\n>I think it's obvious that TSLA was - and remains - overvalued\n\nThose are your opinions, and you are free to have them.  If you think that this is the case over the long term, then you know what to do.  I do not agree, and I have bought.  Over the short term, neither of us knows what the hell is going to happen.  And if you continue to claim that you do, you will drive your believability to zero.\n\n>I don't need a supercomputer\n\nYou do if you want to gamble over the short term.\n\n>the company is starting to be valued more realistically\n\nThis is the umpteenth time I have heard someone claim this since 2016, when I started paying attention.  But again: if you think you have a good model, go for it.  You know how to short.

So why take issue when I say:\n\n>I think it's obvious that TSLA was - and remains - overvalued\n\nAren't I just stating a market-verified fact with regard to \"was overvalued\", with the only point of contention yesterday being whether it would continue to fall in the short term, which it did, another 3.4%.

If you need to show returns over the next 3 months, then this price is correct by practical definition.  All risks and possible wins and losses are baked in.  Whether it fits your risk portfolio is a different question, but we have not even touched on that.\n\n>So why take issue\n\nJust because a stock goes down does not mean it was overvalued.  I know that statistics is hard and that we humans tend to default to thinking about things in absolutes.  \"Stock went down, therefore it was overvalued,\" is exactly the kind of thing our monkey brains like to use to make life easier.  It's not right, but it's easy.\n\nI probably could look past your rear-looking statement.  But your statement that it \\*is\\* overvalued is simply not correct, not if we are looking at a short term period.\n\nIf you are talking about a long term period, then go ahead and take your position with shorts or something.  I would strongly disagree with you, and I suspect that you do not have any model whatsoever, so your assessment is probably from the gut.  But ok: at least that would be something we could talk about.\n\n>which it did, another 3.4%\n\nAnd now it has gone up, meaning you were wrong.  \\*shrug\\* Price go up; price go down; market go round and round.  In the short term, anything is possible.  Sometimes when you bet red, you get black.\n\n> And since the market is correct in the short term, my statement from yesterday was also correct.\n\nYou are mixing up two different things.  A fair price is \\*always\\* a combination of upside and downside risks and opportunities.  Always.  The price \\*will\\* move.  I'm guessing we agree on that.  It can be fair and still jump up 12% overnight based on new information.  Or suddenly fall.  The price has both sides already in it.  \n\nWhere I think you are still getting mixed up is that you think you can compete with the big players over the short term.  You cannot.  Any positions you take that do not have at least a 3 month horizon immediately means you are gambling.  On those timeframes, you cannot compete or make market-beating moves reliably.  \n\nI am a bit confused though, because you keep saying that you know if the stock is overpriced, you use short term arguments for it; but, you also say you avoid these kinds of risks, because you apparently have a less-than-ideal time.  That last bit is sound.  The first bit is not.  It's very hard to take apart.\n\nAnd I've been in TSLA for \\*long\\* before Elon Musk was on SNL.  That's why I can say with experience that TSLA is a volatile stock that does not fit well with the 3-month horizons that most big players have to respect.  It will be at least another 3 years before I see even a chance of it settling down, and probably 2030 before it becomes a fairly boring stock.

In the end, here is what I think is about to go down; but It means they are still fundimentaly a car company, just not in a traditional sense.\n\n1. FSD will be bought by many current Tesla owners if it's capable of getting from home to work. This amount of sales despite likely being in the billions will be trivial in comparison to the market they are really after. The cars just provide a basis for the software to be designed and refined enough.\n2. Battery production will conitnue to grow along with sales from the energy and industrial sectors. This too while likely being worth billions very soon will also be trivial in comparison to the market they are after. In doing this, they insure they will have enoguh battery production for the long play.\n3. EV station production will continue to grow, and sales via them will continue to gain more profit as the market grows. This too will be trivial to the end game, but is important for the ultimate goal of EV adoption.\n\nIf the end game is to saturate the market with EVs and advance the progression of EV adoption. To do this there needs to be a cheap EV model, but more importantly to correct the perception around the EV market, the sustainability and safety of EVs, especailly those with auto driving software platforms, and their use.\n\nThe best way to achieve this (aside from producing a crazy cheap low profit ev) will be by leveaging the Uber/rental type marketplace, where people can be exposed to the vehicals, realize there is no issue with regards to travel distance or comfort under an automated driving system and provide rides to the masses at a price lower than the current rental/Uber/lift type marketplace can.\n\nTesla will produce a Robo Taxi, a cheap platform with fsd. The FSD might not be perfect and it wont need to be for this play. The car model will be cheap and simple, but offer a means for third party corporations to outfit them, manage them, monitor them and sell low to no monitoring taxi services via them.\n\nWaymo makes an auto driving system, converts the cars, maintains the fleet, maintains staff to take over in critical injunctions. Tesla has no intents to be Waymo. Instead, Tesla will be the producer of the platform and softwares and sell to others who want to manage it, outfit it, maintain it, and provide live 'take over service' for their own fleets.\n\nThink Yellow Taxi, Uber, Hertz, etc. All of these companies can buy the platform, outfit the interiors if they choose, and offer the same services they do with only minimal changes to their current business model. You could take a car for a half day, or a short trip with little interface aside fro ma phone app. Hertz for example would kill Uber with such a fleet if Uber does not race to adopt as well so the game will be how many units can they make and deliver as well as how fast they can open up new markets to monitored \"self driving\".\n\nTesla is not going to manage the cars they sell or prove the software beyond 99% safety. Much like Waymo, for the first few years it may take a person dialing in to manuver the car out of a tough spot, but I suspect less and less as the softwares improve.  The cars will be a platform, loaded with FSD. The roads will saturate with cheap rides in cheap ev robo taxis, managed by multiple companies, with live takeover staff. Just like Waymo but without the overhead, without the limitations of outfitting someone else's car, and everyplace and road will open up fairly fast as safety is proven (something the Waymos of the world cannot do.)\n\nThis is the ultimate play, because it means not only selling the cars, the softwares, and the power stations to charge them, but providing that critical bridge for wary future car buyers to take a ride and experience a self-driving car themselves. In fact, in the future I could see a time when it will likely be very dificult to take a short taxi like drive without being exposed to the ev and fsd platform, and it will be the choice over the rando driver for most any trip. It won't be a bad thing, It will be safe, consistant, and cheap and likely people will adopt to them quite readily...\n\nThen, after this or maybe durring, you sell the cheap car.

{"title": "Tesla- Don't You Dare Buy Calls", "selftext": "Despite this not being financial advise, here are 24 reasons you should not go long on this stock in any way or form:\n\n1. Ceo takes Ketamine\n2. Ceo takes Ketamine (this is not a control c, control v mistake)\n3. Pay-package related dilution expected (\\~10%) and is another dumpster fire of a debate; possible shareholder revolt coming\n4. QoQ negative growth of sales has materialized (first negative quarter)\n5. Decrease in operating margins (read point 6)\n6. Price wars in an oligopolistic industry are akin to a knife fight that nobody wants to walk away from. Also they are just beginning instead of ending (Li Autos decreased price today in response)\n7. Robo-taxis are technologically very far away (the boy who cried FSD) and is a solution looking for a problem\n8. Model 2 is axed (probably not profitable enough, the finance team is not stupid) so large TAM is chopped from valuation\n9. Lay-offs, talent attrition and underutilized factories incoming, special hello to Gigafactory Berlin because EU EV sales are in negative growth\n10. Ceo (this should be reason 1) has alienated it prime base i.e. democrats (look up recent WSJ article) which republican buyer growth hasn't materialized; they absolutely hate this guy in blue states\n11. Ceo says the stock is in between waves of growth and also noted it was over-priced a few earnings ago\n12. Ceo is not full-time and has many other pet projects like sending people to Mars\n13. China is bank-rolling its EV makers (consipary theory) and their quality (BYD, Li Autos) is no joke at all (not a consipracy theory)\n14. Trip to India delayed because it is not a game changer\n15. No single product that could yield out-sized growth is less than 2 years away from commcercialization\n16. Aging model line; one of the oldest fleet in market without face lift\n17. At the end of the day, no car-marker will have 50% market share; humans like to think they are different and unique\n18. Market is realizing it is not a tech company but a car company which are typically valued at 1/6 or 1/8th the price\n19. Valuation was based on 50%+ growth which is a pipe-dream\n20. Cash balance controlling for short-term liabilities is not great; if negative growth continues, the existing slight-above junk credit rating will worsen\n21. They once had a robot product demo in which a human being pretended to be a robot; funny, they don't talk about that much anymore\n22. Just laid-off the marketing team so no user conversion through education expected\n23. Rivals have caught up with similar products and some like Ford/GM can rely on ICEs + Hybrids whose demand hasn't fallen as much; I would buy a BMW any day of the year over Tesla\n24. Tesla forums on Reddit have a cult status where opposition can be banned. This show marks of irrationality which needs to be met with the timing of positive solvency\n\nHere is 1 reason you might consider buying:\n\n1.
