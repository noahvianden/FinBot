Find the previous update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/1b42kmg/300k_account_wheel_update_month_17/).\n\nIn March of 2024 I closed 25 trades with an average hold time of 19 days to collect $7,642 in premiums. This month went well. I got a bit more aggressive which led to me rolling one position, which ultimately ended up being profitable for me, and also being assigned one position. Currently negative on that new position (ROKU), but I'm able to sell calls on it easily as my basis is right around the current share price. I'm fine holding the company as I think it is undervalued at the moment due to the vizio/walmart news.\n\nBelow are the March trades:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[March Trades](https://preview.redd.it/n0wskbbo7yrc1.jpg?width=965&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=160861789dafee33600bb03b038d02fe3f3b1101)\n\nMy total **realized** profits after 18 months is $117,557. I have **unrealized gains** of $1,300.\n\n**This brings my NET profit to $118,857. This equates to a 39.6% gain on the initial 300k I started with. QQQ is up 48.3% and SPY is up 30.5% in the same time frame.** \n\nI did a good job outperforming the QQQ this past month as my account was up 2% while QQQ was flat this month. QQQ is still outperforming over the past 18 months, though I'm slowly closing the gap. SPY actually outperformed QQQ this month, being up 2%, which was in line with my account. I'm happy to be outperforming SPY over the past 18 months though. I do believe if there is any volatility or broad market pullbacks, I'll be able to catch up to the QQQ and outperform. The goal isn't to outperform on any given year though, but to return a consistent 10-20% yearly gain. So far my annualized rate of return over the past 18 months is 25.5% which I am very happy with.\n\nBelow is the P&L statement for my account and all current positions. \n\n[March P&L Statement](https://preview.redd.it/i43b1jpi9yrc1.jpg?width=1657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3908da6ce8b349ae1c20241378c584894ea8781e)\n\n Lastly, my running log of trades going into the future... \n\n[March Running Log](https://preview.redd.it/a9qqotwl9yrc1.jpg?width=962&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55698c16306688305ed76c1ab697a9396a004cab)\n\nThanks for everyone that has joined the trading group and shared their experiences as well!

{"title": "NVDA Spread update", "selftext": "\nThis is an update from my previous post [“Anyone ever gotten this?”](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/SOSGImr0kf) \n\nFirst, here's the rundown of what happened: So, I had this genius plan to score an \"easy\" $500 by dealing with NVDA options. I sold 10 calls at the $902.5 strike for $2.75 each and hedged with 10 call contracts at the $900 strike that I got for $4.75. Quick math: that's a breakeven at $902, selling for $902.5, netting me a sweet $0.50 per share. \n\nBut here's the kicker, I didn't know you could call your broker until 5:30 PM if your option expires in the money. Long story short, the buyer of my $902.5 strike calls ghosted, leaving me with 1000 shares of NVDA from the expired $900 strike calls and a cash account deficit of $897,813.87. Which is some RH BS because the shares were worth $901,250, but still stressful AF. \n\nI wasn't thrilled about being on the hook for $1000 for every $1 move in NVDA. But Robinhood's 24-hour market came in clutch. I unloaded those shares on Sunday night at $909.62 a pop, raking in a profit of $7.62 per stock. I probably could have made more if I held but I’m relieved I’m out. Crisis averted, tendies secured. 🚀💰🤑\n\nTLDR: Robinhood told me I owed them almost $900k after I did an NVDA spread without knowing about DNE, so I almost got spread, but got lucky and ended up making $7k or 350% in four days.", "id": "1bsq8l9", "created_utc": 1711932635.0, "score": 1006, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 163, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 8 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 47 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 11 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Jesus you got lucky", "score": 667, "replies": [{"body": "it’s Easter 😉🤌", "score": 62, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Could’ve been -$125,000", "score": 114, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wild ride.

($BB) is on fire, and I mean a big ass dumpster fire. People say, \"Blazing a trail of growth and stability as it transforms from hardware to software and services\" which is hard to convince investors, or any other financial crowd, given their recent performance. Their latest quarter, BlackBerry reported revenue of $259 million, actually seeing a 10% increase YoY. The software and services revenue, now the core revenue driver, surged 17% YoY to $215 million, which is actually surprising for them. They have a debt/revenue ratio of .3 which is a good spot to be in for leveraging upcoming shifts in the financial space\n\n\n**Cybersecurity and IoT Focus:**\nBlackBerry's strategic pivot towards cybersecurity and IoT is the only reason they're not fucked. Everybody is fucking up your shit and Media keeps hyping the absurdness of scamming lately, and while that's FUD for my brain while I drink my coffee, organizations are doubling down on cybersecurity investments to bolster their traditional cyber-security backing. BlackBerry's cybersecurity offerings, including endpoint security, encryption, and threat detection, are positioned to ride this wave of demand. They have a good point to ride a wave on the regarded Boom of AI if they mention they are able to branch into new AI related protections. \n\nJust to be frank: In the IoT arena, BlackBerry ain't trash... and with the world being digitized more everyday, their market share is not capping out anytime soon.\n\n\n**Partnerships and Acquisitions:**\nBlackBerry isn't just playing the game; it's buttfucking the rules and generating a new set of Uno cards to pull out in a pinch. They've had a *few* strategic partnerships & acquisitions. BlackBerry is expanding its product portfolio and market reach. Their Alliance w/ Amazon Web Services (AWS) to develop and market BlackBerry's intelligent vehicle data platform, IVY, is a integrated in every fucking car. Good luck getting the fuck away from IVY. Bitch'll make you itch. This partnership not only validates BlackBerry's technology but also opens doors to the lucrative automotive industry, a hotbed for IoT innovations. Their core partnerships include:\n\n\n***Partnerships***:\n**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: BlackBerry partnered with AWS to develop and market the BlackBerry IVY intelligent vehicle data platform, targeting the automotive industry.\n**Baidu**: BlackBerry partnered with Baidu to integrate its QNX technology into Baidu's open-source autonomous driving platform, Apollo.\nAcquisitions:\n\n**Cylance**: In 2018, BlackBerry acquired Cylance, an artificial intelligence and cybersecurity company, to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities.\n**Good Technology**: BlackBerry acquired Good Technology, a provider of secure mobility solutions, in 2015, to strengthen its position in the enterprise mobility market.\n**WatchDox**: BlackBerry acquired WatchDox, a secure file-sharing company, in 2015, to enhance its enterprise security offerings.\n\n\n\n**Potential for Growth and Innovation:**\nLet's be real -- Blackberry is the gardener, floating face down in the pond while the big boys eat caviar, spoon fed by their advanced AI sex-bots. But, If that Gardener survives, the lawsuit to make sure that he doesn't disclose all the other wild shit they've seen at Steevie McQueefies house, well -- that'd be enough to float this bad boy right back into relevancy, *metaphorically of course*. At their current financial performance, strategic focus on cybersecurity and IoT, and partnerships with industry giants, BlackBerry is trying to prepare for upwards growth and innovation. As businesses prioritize digital transformation and security, BlackBerry stands poised to capture a lion's share of these burgeoning markets.\n\n**Risk Factors:**\nI mean -- we know what the fuck. They ain't been great the last decade: despite its recovering performance, intense competition in the cybersecurity and IoT markets *could* dampen its growth. Additionally, BlackBerry's fortunes are closely tied to the economic landscape, with fluctuations potentially impacting IT spending by businesses. That being said, These Canadians are going to be the nicest to work with, and will *likely* not spill poutine on your servers.\n\n**General Discussion**\nThe discussion around $BB upcoming quarterly report *seems* to be leaning towards a more bullish sentiment, likely due to several factors, including the company's shift towards software and services, which has always had promising growth.
