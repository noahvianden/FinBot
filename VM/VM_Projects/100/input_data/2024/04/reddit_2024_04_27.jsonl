{"title": "Tesla Autopilot has 'critical safety gap' linked to hundreds of collisions: NHTSA", "selftext": "Federal authorities say a “critical safety gap” in Tesla’s Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 resulting in fatalities and “many others” resulting in serious injuries.\n\nThe findings come from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysis of 956 crashes in which Tesla Autopilot was thought to have been in use. The results of the nearly three-year investigation were published Friday.\n\nTesla’s Autopilot design has “led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes,” the NHTSA report said. The system did not “sufficiently ensure driver attention and appropriate use.”\n\nNHTSA’s filing pointed to a “weak driver engagement system,” and Autopilot that stays switched on even when a driver isn’t paying adequate attention to the road or the driving task. The driver engagement system includes various prompts, including “nags” or chimes, that tell drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the wheel, as well as in-cabin cameras that can detect when a driver is not looking at the road. \n\nThe agency also said it was opening a new probe into the effectiveness of a software update Tesla previously issued as part of a recall in December. That update was meant to fix Autopilot defects that NHTSA identified as part of this same investigation.\n\nThe voluntary recall via an over-the-air software update covered 2 million Tesla vehicles in the U.S., and was supposed to specifically improve driver monitoring systems in Teslas equipped with Autopilot.\n\nNHTSA suggested in its report Friday that the software update was probably inadequate, since more crashes linked to Autopilot continue to be reported.\n\nIn one recent example, a Tesla driver in Snohomish County, Washington, struck and killed a motorcyclist on April 19, according to records obtained by CNBC and NBC News. The driver told police he was using Autopilot at the time of the collision.\n\nThe NHTSA findings are the most recent in a series of regulator and watchdog reports that have questioned the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot technology, which the company has promoted as a key differentiator from other car companies.\n\nOn its website, Tesla says Autopilot is designed to reduce driver “workload” through advanced cruise control and automatic steering technology.\n\nTesla has not issued a response to Friday’s NHTSA report and did not respond to a request for comment sent to Tesla’s press inbox, investor relations team and to the company’s vice president of vehicle engineering, Lars Moravy.\n\nFollowing the release of the NHTSA report, Sens. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., issued a statement calling on federal regulators to require Tesla to restrict its Autopilot feature “to the roads it was designed for.”\n\nOn its Owner’s Manual website, Tesla warns drivers not to operate the Autosteer function of Autopilot “in areas where bicyclists or pedestrians may be present,” among a host of other warnings.\n\n“We urge the agency to take all necessary actions to prevent these vehicles from endangering lives,” the senators said.  \n\nEarlier this month, Tesla settled a lawsuit from the family of Walter Huang, an Apple engineer and father of two, who died in a crash when his Tesla Model X with Autopilot features switched on hit a highway barrier. Tesla has sought to seal from public view the terms of the settlement.\n\nIn the face of these events, Tesla and CEO Elon Musk signaled this week that they are betting the company’s future on autonomous driving.\n\n“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” Musk said on Tesla’s earnings call Tuesday. He added, “We will, and we are.”\n\nMusk has for years promised customers and shareholders that Tesla would be able to turn its existing cars into self-driving vehicles with a software update. However, the company offers only driver assistance systems and has not produced self-driving vehicles to date.\n\nHe has also made safety claims about Tesla’s driver assistance systems without allowing third-party review of the company’s data.\n\nFor example, in 2021, Elon Musk claimed in a post on social media, “Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.”\n\nPhilip Koopman, an automotive safety researcher and Carnegie Mellon University associate professor of computer engineering, said he views Tesla’s marketing and claims as “autonowashing.” He also said in response to NHTSA’s report that he hopes Tesla will take the agency’s concerns seriously moving forward.\n\n“People are dying due to misplaced confidence in Tesla Autopilot capabilities. Even simple steps could improve safety,” Koopman said. “Tesla could automatically restrict Autopilot use to intended roads based on map data already in the vehicle. Tesla could improve monitoring so drivers can’t routinely become absorbed in their cellphones while Autopilot is in use.”\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/26/tesla-autopilot-linked-to-hundreds-of-collisions-has-critical-safety-gap-nhtsa.html", "id": "1ce2p7z", "created_utc": 1714182190.0, "score": 443, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "Its almost like people think the Autopilot will pilot the vehicle automatically.", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "Nah… look around you when you are on the roads and see the number of people looking at their phones as they drive.

It's better to give up some potential gains now if it means smoothing out the ride up.\n\n2.0 The belief that you should take more risk when you're younger is bullshit. I would have gladly taken 5% per year instead of having to pay dearly for early mistakes and arrogance.\n\n2.1 You're better off building a base of safety and security, and THEN start doing other stuff that has the potential to juice your returns.\n\n3.0 I've tried every trading strategy you could name, every complicated option setup you could come up with. Even though I had a 71% win rate, my average annual return was about 11%. I could have saved myself so much time and stress and worry just... investing that same money in long term, buy-and-hold blue chips, ETFs, or index funds. Trading is a fool's errand unless you make it your life, and what kind of life is that?\n\n4.0 My worst investments were always great investments that I sold too early.\n\n5.0 My best investments were carefully studied and scrutinized stocks that the market had unceremoniously dumped. \"Buy when there's blood in the streets,\" as they say. Ignore the madness of crowds.\n\n5.1. Don't wait for recessions or bear markets to buy index funds like the S&P 500... but never hesitate to double down when they happen.\n\n6.0 It often doesn't really matter what your investment strategy is, so long as it has worked long term and you can stick with it. The biggest losers I know are the people that try a different thing every few months.\n\n7.0 The only things that make stocks go up and down is buying and selling. Fundamentals? Technicals? Patents? Macroeconomics? Inflation? Discounted cash flow models? These are all stories. What you want to know is what motivates *people* on a psychological level to buy or sell. You want to know what \"sell stories\" are temporary BS that are spooking people out of the market (Covid was a big'un). And you want to know what \"buy stories\" are sustainable long term (quality, smaller caps, value, profitability, conservative asset investment, etc.).\n\n7.1 That said, solid fundamentals is the best long-term \"buy story\" you can find. Fundamentals are the closest thing to gravity in the stock market. Everything else is haruspicy.\n\n8.0 Don't waste your energy trying to come up with clever ways to beat the market. Think about what your goal is. Is it to beat the market? Or is it to make money? If you hyperfixate on ROI, you will most certainly take too much risk.\n\n9.0 The people who say that the stock market is like gambling or the lottery are idiots. There are only about 10000 stocks to pick. And of those, historically, 21% have survived AND outperformed the market over 20 years. If you've ever taken a statistics class, this is just a basic-ass math problem. If you pick 20 stocks at random, you have a 60%+ chance that at least 4 of your stocks would have gone to beat the market over 20 years. I'll take those odds any day.\n\n10.0 The only way you can possibly fuck up making money in the stock market is if you consistently do dumb shit: Time horizons that are too short, buying stocks with trash fundamentals, too much risk-taking, no diversification, no safety net, selling too soon, etc.\n\n11.0 Stock investing won't make you rich on its own. The amount of money you can afford to put in the stock market can. That means that your skills and professional development are usually a better long term investment than the market.\n\n12.0 Stock brokers and financial advisors do not have your best interest in mind. Their incentives are not your best interest... even if they're supposedly a fiduciary.\n\n13.0 Don't listen to dogmatic assholes... Including me. Bogleheads have it partially right. Value investors have it partially right. Modern Portfolio Theory assholes who pray at the altar of Smart Beta have it partially right. Don't worry so much about who's right, or what's best. No one can know what will do the best in the years to come.

He then compares it with a new graph released during Tesla's latest earnings call — an event that came with its own eyebrow raising moments.\n\nThe point of the side-by-side is this: according to Moskovitz, the automaker is wrongly recognizing its deferred revenue — revenue for a product that hasn't been delivered, like an annual subscription fee — as earned revenue through the wider release of its Autopark feature last month. This is a sketchy move, Moskovitz claims, because an earlier version of Autopark was already released with FSD years ago, resulting in inflated numbers.\n\n\"The data is presented in fraudulent ways, and it doesn't say what they claim it says even when they make it up,\" he wrote.\n\nArticle continues.

The unique mechanism of action of ANKTIVA (N-803) contributed to these promising outcomes¹[1][1].\n\n2. **FDA Approval of ANKTIVA for BCG-Unresponsive Bladder Cancer**:\n   - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ANKTIVA (N-803) plus Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) for the treatment of patients with BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS), with or without papillary tumors²[2][2].\n\n3. **Bladder Cancer Therapy Milestone**:\n   - ImmunityBio's bladder cancer therapy, Anktiva, received FDA approval. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, Executive Chairman of ImmunityBio, highlighted Anktiva's potential as the next generation of immuno-therapy. The drug demonstrated complete remission that was durable for 47 months and longer, making it a significant breakthrough²[2][2].\n\nFor more detailed information, you can explore the provided news sources.
