{"title": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says he's committed to cost cutting while investing in AI in shareholder letter", "selftext": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday published his annual shareholder letter, where he pledged to keep looking for ways to keep costs in check even as the company doubles down on investing in new growth areas like artificial intelligence.\n\n‚ÄúI think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers‚Äô lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we‚Äôre investing,‚Äù Jassy wrote in his third shareholder letter since taking the helm at Amazon from former CEO Jeff Bezos, who stepped down in 2021.\n\nUnder Jassy, Amazon has morphed into a leaner version of itself, as slowing sales and a challenging economy pushed the company to eschew the relentless growth of the Bezos years. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Those cuts have continued this year, with Amazon announcing layoffs in its cloud computing, Prime Video and Twitch livestreaming units, among others.\n\nEven amid a period of retrenchment in some areas, Jassy said he‚Äôs focused on finding new areas of growth within the company so that Amazon remains ‚Äúresilient.‚Äù He stressed the importance of building ‚Äúprimitive services,‚Äù which he described as ‚Äúdiscrete, foundational building blocks‚Äù that can spur new projects and businesses.\n\nJassy used Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, as an example. Before he became Amazon‚Äôs CEO, Jassy oversaw the creation of AWS, which grew from an internal tool to become the dominant cloud service and one of Amazon‚Äôs most profitable businesses.\n\nHe said he believes generative artificial intelligence stands to be Amazon‚Äôs next ‚Äúprimitive service‚Äù that could transform the company. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,‚Äù Jassy wrote.\n\nAmazon on Thursday added Andrew Ng, a renowned AI pioneer who previously led Google Brain and was a scientist at Baidu, to its board. Ng will replace Judy McGrath, who has sat on the board since 2014.\n\nIn the past year, Amazon has made a flurry of AI announcements as the field exploded, causing tech companies to pour money into the space. Last month, Amazon added $2.75 billion to its stake in AI startup Anthropic in its largest venture investment yet. Jassy has also pledged to infuse AI into every one of Amazon‚Äôs businesses.\n\n(See source for full letter content)\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/11/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-says-committed-to-cost-cutting-while-investing-in-ai-in-shareholder-letter.html", "id": "1c1ckwh", "created_utc": 1712834538.0, "score": 917, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 262, "comments": [{"body": "Andy Jassy is the equivalent to Tim Apple.

Present-day writers on economics, such as Michael Lewis and Andrew Tobias, praise Mackay's writings on economic bubbles.\n\nIn later editions, Mackay added a footnote referencing the Railway Mania of the 1840s as another \"popular delusion\" which was at least as important as the South Sea Bubble. In the 21st century, the mathematician Andrew Odlyzko pointed out, in a published lecture, that Mackay himself played a role in this 1840s economic bubble; as a leading writer in The Glasgow Argus, Mackay wrote on 2 October 1845: \"There is no reason whatever to fear a crash\".\n\n**Economic bubbles**\n\nMackay's first volume begins with a discussion of three economic bubbles, or financial manias: the South Sea Company bubble of 1711‚Äì1720, the Mississippi Company bubble of 1719‚Äì1720, and the Dutch tulip mania of the early seventeenth century. According to Mackay, during this tulip bubble, speculators from all walks of life bought and sold tulip bulbs, and commodity futures contracts on them. During tulip mania, some tulip bulb varieties briefly became the most expensive objects in the world during 1637.\n\n¬†", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "By every observable measure the US economy is doing better than anywhere else", "score": 725, "replies": [{"body": "I can personally vouch that the UK economy is in absolute tatters right now.

Things take time and sometimes the narrative takes time to shift along with them. I personally believe that FSD (along with robotaxi) is the beginning of that shift to AI, with Optimus being a major shift towards robotics.

They'll do it all in Austin where their engineering and manufacturing presence is optimized and then transfer it to Mexico once it's been dialled in.

Merely more often).\n\nIf not that, they would have levied various traditional taxes that you also would have paid and not been any richer than you are now, still.
