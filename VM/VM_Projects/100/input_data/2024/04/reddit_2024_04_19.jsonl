{"title": "You were WARNED about $840 Support", "selftext": "A few weeks ago, I published a post explaining that NVDA formed a double top at $970 a share and that the downside risk was the stock potentially crashing to $700 if it lost its $840 support.  Well that is exactly what happened today.  The stock is down 10% in a single day in a loss of its $840 support level.  Double top breakdown in full effect.  \n\nI’ve worked as a professional trader and as a former hedge fund manager for 26 years. \n\nI can tell you right now that support and resistance levels are taken very seriously by professional fund managers.  \n\nThe point of this post is to illustrate a principle lesson here.  That no matter how strong a company’s fundamentals, no stock trade in a vacuum.  All stocks are subject to broad market buying and selling.  There is no fundamental reason for today’s sell-off.  It’s all technical driven.  \n\nYou can read my post here:  \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1bohmok/nvda_double_top_970/\n\nThe smartest among you will realize that when someone outlines very precisely what is likely to happen and it happens, maybe there’s something to it.  \n\nThe post very clearly outlines support and resistance levels and a downside target in a breakdown of support.  \n\n$840 was the stated support levels on a $130 double top.  The downside target is $710 on NVDA.  \n\nIt is very oversold now and likely to see a huge rally any moment now.  But hopefully you’ve learned something here.  \n\nCertainly it wasn’t very smart buying anywhere near $900 and that much was clear when NVDA formed a double top at $970.  The market was telling you something.  \n\nNVDA will still get through $1000 by this summer. But buying at $700 for a 50% gain is better than buying at $900 for a 10% gain.  Good luck!

Like when NVDA hit $800, one could bring down the stop loss to above the support line ($840/$845). \n\nThe other obvious way to play it is to just wait to buy if you want to get in like me.  \n\nI didn’t bother looking at it at all anywhere in the $900’s or at $840.  Because the QQQ was peaking.  \n\nHad NVDA held $840 today with the QQQ at $414, I would have bought NVDA today at the close.  \n\nInstead it broke down and fell to the $760’s where I put on a few long trades.  \n\nThe question you ask is true of all support  and resistance lines.  \n\nFor example; suppose NVDA held $849 this week and ran all the way back up to $970. \n\nTriple tops are extremely unlikely.  That means chances are NVDA takes out its $970 residence.  \n\nSo what can someone do?  They can go long at $970 either way a stop loss at $940.  If it takes out $970, chances are it goes north of $1000 which means $1100+.  \n\nGo look at every stock that surpasses $1000.  It doesn’t just stop there.  Tesla is a perfect example.  \n\nYou can google it.  Because I was already short the market, I’m playing NVDA form the long side. \n\nSo this analysis is helpful for me in that I know where to put in my buy points.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "It means wait till it gets there, and then see what it does, and then act.

In most cases; the QQQ falls 10% between rallies.  \n\nBut there have also been plenty of corrections that ended in the 5-9% range.  5.5% I think is the smallest correction we’ve seen. \n\nThis correction so far has gone for 7.87%.  So it’s pretty close to 10%.  \n\nIt’s very possible it may have ended.  But I think there’s a much higher likelihood that it goes down to $395 because that’s where the 200-day moving average is and because this was a 31% rally.  Larger rallies tend to lead to larger corrections.  \n\nAlso, the market is acting very predictably.  This rebound for example; was pretty predictable given how oversold we are.  \n\nChances are we’ll rebound further and then see another leg lower; a bottom and a new rally within the next few weeks. \n\nIf you’re long-term; does it really matter if the QQQ falls to $395 before bottoming and then rally to $500 by fall?

This is as cyclical as it gets. They lock in orders placed some time in advance and the machines get delivered to customers based on a set time-frame as agreed in the contract.\n\nIt should be obvious that after Samsung, TSMC or TI or Intel announce they are building factories at X, Y or Z locations, they will place a mostly confirmed order with ASML for a set number of machines, and until more factories are added, ASML is going to sit pretty on its butt for a while.\n\nThe real question people should be asking is whether ASML's peers have managed to release a machine that is as good as, if not better than ASML's for the bleeding edge. One of ASML's biggest moats is that it actually has people on the factory floor to operate the machines it sells to its customers - I read this in a research report on the semiconductor space. So there is an effective service lock-in.\n\nWhy am I mentioning ASML in a thread about Nvidia? Because ASML's sales slowdowns don't mean much for design firms. If Nvidia needs 10 million chips to be produced during a specific time frame, and Samsung/TSMC can accommodate that requirement, it doesn't matter one bit to Nvidia's bottom line whether the foundries are expanding their production lines or not. The only thing that matters is whether Nvidia can get enough of these items out of the door into their customers' hands.\n\nYou might say that this implies silicon design firms are placing fewer orders with foundries so they see no reason to expand. However that misses an important point - creating new fabs take time - at least 2-3 years. Foundries are not going to announce new fab locations every 6-8 months and have them all ready to output chips at quick notice. So if an Nvidia needs 30 million chips now, but TSMC can only supply then 15 million, it will take a while before new production lines are set up (think a couple of years) and at that point the Nvidia's requirement may have changed completely after coming to terms with the reality of their market. So an immediate drop in demand doesn't mean anything for long term growth.\n\nBut because design firms tend to be relatively asset-light, they don't have to bear the risk of capacity expansion at their supplier coming in too late.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "itll hit 900 again i believe but it might be a a while, need more groundbreaking ai powered by nvidia gpus to drive that price up, no clue in the world why were down 10% rn", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Depends on what your investing thesis is.
