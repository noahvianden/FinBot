Revenue in the metaverse division was $440 million, up about 30% from $339 million a year ago and representing only around 1% of Meta’s total sales for the quarter.\n\nAnalysts were expecting a $4.31 billion operating loss and sales of $512.5 million for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.\n\nReality Labs has now lost more than $45 billion since the end of 2020, when Meta first began reporting the business segment separately.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the metaverse “the next frontier,” imagining a digital world that facilitates both productivity and recreation. He changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta in 2021 to reflect his vision for the future of computing.\n\nFor now, developing metaverse technology remains a fledgling and costly effort.\n\nThe company unveiled in September the Quest 3 VR headset, the latest version of its mixed reality hardware, with a starting price of $499. Apple started selling its $3,499 Vision Pro in February, touting a so-called “spatial computing” experience.\n\nMeta announced Monday that it will partner with third-party hardware companies to create new VR headsets using the same Meta Horizon operating system that powers its Quest headsets. Zuckerberg said that while Apple “basically won out” in the phone market with its closed ecosystem, Meta’s move aims to ensure the “open model defines the next generation of computing.”\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/metas-reality-labs-posts-3point85-billion-loss-in-first-quarter.html", "id": "1cchrf6", "created_utc": 1714015131.0, "score": 927, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 266, "comments": [{"body": "thank fk meta is a founder led company and zuck isn't afraid to push through with his vision.", "score": 207, "replies": [{"body": "He is in a unique position which could give Meta an advantage over time.

Remote control of a humanoid robot drone. Imagine someone has a job that needs a specialist present who is hours away. They get specialist to login and run a drone on site. How much would that be worth? \n\n2. Virtual gatherings for events like concerts, movies, or even sporting events. You see a stadium full of people watching a football game and think thats a lot of money spent on tickets. But what if you couldn't attend physically and were given the option to use VR to see the game from a plethora of VR cameras sprinkled around the field? Would you consider that worth more or less than seeing the game through your tv? \n\n3. Education. Imagine you are a student who is advanced in math at a school in some third world country. The country might not have adequate numbers of teachers to teach in all the schools with these students. Many students miss out as a result. What if we could hand them a VR headset and they could all attend virtual classes led by the top math teachers in their country? \n\n4. Remotely operated equipment. Maybe not glamorous but how many jobs need skilled operators and struggle to get enough for the local work in a timely fashion. We all know that road paving jobs can drag on and on. What if the equipment could be run remotely? Would that help get more of the job done in less time? How many other tasks could fall into that category? Crane operators?\n\nThose 4 things are probably worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year in revenue. The first one in particular would be incredibly important for things like oil rigs, remote work sites, or areas that are dangerous for humans to be in. However the biggest thing is that you could get a specialist on site at the drop of a hat for something like a john deere tractor under warranty. Seriously think about it from john deeres perspective. They got many thousands of tractors they sell every year and those tractors need servicing. Traditionally they have a service guy go to the tractor or the tractor comes to them. Alternatively the farmer repairs and maintains as much as he can. What if the big farm had a few drones and could have the tech drop in to troubleshoot issues? He sees the problem, maybe even does the repair, or he just tells the farmer how to fix it. If a part is needed he orders it and when it shows up he pops back over to help with the install. \n\nIm not a fan of the idea of VR being focused on the ready player one kind of stuff. I think there is some minimal value there, but the real value will be combining VR with remotely operated stuff. \n\nLast but not least:\n\nEmergency response. If we get this drone and VR tech up and working lets say you have a dramatic emergency in your area. What if ALL the local drones could be \"drafted\" into helping with the emergency response while be operated by the emergency response folks. Lets say your town has a refinery that explodes and a major fire is happening. Your local town has a few dozen local fire fighters, plus the cops. Typical emergency response is to have the nearby areas send people to help with the overwhelming emergency. What if part of that was further out emergency response people hop into VR gear and run your local drones to help do a bunch of the basic leg work. That might be as simple as putting up barricades, going house to house knocking on doors. It might mean they use the drones to help bring up supplies to the first responders on scene. It might mean they do something as simple as directing traffic. \n\nThen there is the medical emergencies. Say you work at a plant and an accident happens where someone is hurt. You typically need to wait for ems to get there which might only be a few minutes but its still critical time. What if part of that response was ems logging into a drone and using the on hand emergency first aid kit to being stabilizing the injured. This might not seem like a big deal, but mass casualty events usually overwhelm first responders in those critical first few minutes. Bridging that gap even if not perfectly would assuredly make a major difference. Drilling down just a bit further imagine a small hospital has a mass casualty event come rolling in. Could doctors remotely join the effort using drones to assist with triage and relieve pressure on staff on site? \n\n  \nI know this went long, but that is the future I think people should be rooting for when it comes to VR.

Nominal GDP growth was still at 6.3% in 2023, 6.7% over the second half of 2023, and 5.1% for Q4 2023. And I'm doubtful it will have fallen below 5% in Q1 2024 either (as GDP Now is projecting 2.4% real). I'd say that will probably need to fall at least below 4.5%.\n>\n>    2. Core PCE, their preferred target, was only 1.9% annualized for the second half of 2023, very slightly below target, so there is reason to at least think they could be getting close. But it did surge to 4.4% over the first 2 months of 2024 (5.6% in Jan, 3.2% in Feb). These numbers are volatile month to month, and factors like an unseasonably warm winter could also impact them.

The market is reacting more to the inflation number, but given we already knew Core PCE was at a 4.4% annualized rate for the first 2 months, coming in at 3.7% annualized for the quarter really isn't terrible. \n\nOverall, we shouldn't yet be expecting the Fed to lower rates anytime soon with these inflation numbers, but this also suggests they won't need to go in the other direction and increase rates, either. \n\nThe main point in that post above was that due to the usual volatility in month to month or even quarter to quarter inflation numbers, you don't want to over-react to short term numbers there, and nominal GDP is probably a better measure of whether policy is where it needs to be in the longer run.\n\nInflation itself will have a tightening effect on consumer spending and economic growth.
