It also comes in different configurations like a bundle of eight Gaudi 3 chips on one motherboard or a card that can slot into existing systems.\n\n>Intel said that the new Gaudi 3 chips would be available to customers in the third quarter, and companies including Dell, HP and Supermicro will build systems with the chips. Intel didn't provide a price range for Gaudi 3.\n\n>\"We are working with the software ecosystem to build open reference software, as well as building blocks that allow you to stitch together a solution that you need, rather than be forced into buying a solution,\" Sachin Katti, senior vice president of Intel's networking group, said on a call with reporters.\n\n>Gaudi 3 is built on a five nanometer process, a relatively recent manufacturing technique, suggesting that the company is using an outside foundry to manufacture the chips. In addition to designing Gaudi 3, Intel also plans to manufacture AI chips, potentially for outside companies, at a new Ohio factory expected to open in 2027 or 2028, CEO Patrick Gelsinger told reporters last month.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "1bzvurm", "created_utc": 1712678644.0, "score": 533, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "faulty disgusted sink tan oil lunchroom unite resolute joke air\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": -31, "replies": [{"body": "Wtf", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "\"So why is Intel comparing Gaudi 3 to the H100 and H200 instead of [Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU](https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-unveils-next-gen-blackwell-gpus-with-25x-lower-costs-and-energy-consumption/), which launched in March?

The leftist candidate plans to close down churches when elected\n2. The current president wants to let men use public-school restrooms next to little girls\n3. The former right-wing president confessed to Cannibalism and Pedophilia.\n\nHow do outright lies help voters make informed decisions?

These people getting false information about what they needed to vote, where to vote, and when to vote, prevented them from casting their votes.\n\nHow does being lied to about when, where, and how you can legally vote help democracy?\n\nPeople forget that there are all sorts of laws regulating speech in every country. There are laws against McDonalds taking out adds saying that Wendy's burgers contain rat poison.There are laws against McDonalds releasing an ad that says the CEO of Wendy's is a pedophile.\n\nBrazil's law IS on the extreme end. They are also dealing with extreme and escalating disinformation campaigns. At bot networks become more sophisticated and better able to imitate humans through AI LLMs, this is only going to get worse.

Is it time exit this ride.", "selftext": "Preface this with I'm a big NVDA AI fan been on the AI train for years before this\n\n2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/\n\nI was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE\n\nI had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.\n\nBless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.\n\nEDIT: I just think it’s way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  \n\nMuch like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it’s very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the “street” or “market” pivots quickly.  \n\n5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\n\nWhen you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it’s almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won’t have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.
