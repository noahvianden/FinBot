Better yet, with Nintendo‚Äôs IP flywheel finally in full effect, the earnings snowball you were first told about many years ago is not only rolling and getting bigger, but it‚Äôs set to accelerate as higher-powered hardware drops in the near term and the software release slate normalizes thereafter. \n\nWhich brings us to another key reason to celebrate Nintendo‚Äôs fast-approaching ‚Äúthrough the looking glass‚Äù moment: **It's not just about its dedicated videogame platform business. Nintendo has been taking steps to diversify its income streams for years outside of its core business of videogames by slowly and successfully monetizing its IP via theme parks, movies, and other capital-efficient avenues that are just now beginning to reveal themselves.** It‚Äôs still early innings, mind you, but we‚Äôre happy to report that years of constant assertions that Nintendo would shy away from properly monetizing its gold-plated portfolio of unrivaled IP look positively ridiculous in hindsight. With the blockbuster success of the Super Mario movie, as well as its theme park and other IP-related initiatives approaching critical mass, Nintendo today has multiple sources of high incremental margin revenue that will begin to snowball over the next several years.  \n\nTo say the same thing a slightly different way, the quality and visibility of Nintendo‚Äôs business in early 2024 is radically superior and less risky relative to what it was at any point in its roughly 13-decade history, even if these structural improvements are not broadly appreciated as such. Furthermore, now that Nintendo is armed with the market-leading Switch platform and a self-sustaining IP flywheel on the far side of exit velocity, we remain more confident than ever about its efforts to properly leverage its Apple-like ecosystem of hardware, software, and services across its loyal, 122 million+ strong global customer base.  \n\n**Let's recap why we think Nintendo is slowly but surely sending old bear arguments into permanent hibernation:** \n\n1. Nintendo just printed its highest TTM revenue and operating profit figures in the Switch platform‚Äôs history, seven years into an aging console \"cycle,\" despite having released only two top-tier first-party ‚Äúsystem sellers‚Äù over the previous 18 months.  \n2. Nintendo‚Äôs Apple-like ecosystem (reinforced by a very Disney-like IP content flywheel) has radically improved the economic resiliency and visibility of Nintendo‚Äôs revenue and cash flow, de-cyclifying its earnings power in lockstep.  \n3. With the release of the Switch 2, Nintendo is primed for continued massive margin expansion by reaching a previously untapped market for the company‚Äôs consoles. \n4.

Chipotle said traffic increased 5.4% from the year-ago period, while average check was up just 1.6%.\n\nIn February, CFO Jack Hartung told analysts that ‚Äúunusually cold weather‚Äù hurt January sales. But demand likely rebounded in the rest of the quarter to offset the sluggish first month.\n\nChipotle has become the rare restaurant chain to report rising transactions despite higher menu prices. The company once again raised its prices in October, citing inflation. Others in the restaurant industry have turned to limited-time offers and deals to appeal to customers, particularly those with lower incomes.\n\nThe chain added 47 new locations to its footprint during the first quarter, inching closer to its long-term goal of doubling its total number of restaurants to reach 7,000 stores.\n\nFor the full year, Chipotle now anticipates same-store sales will grow by a mid-to-high single digit percentage, up from its prior range of a mid-single digit increase. The company reiterated its forecast of 285 to 315 new locations in 2024.\n\nIn March, Chipotle‚Äôs board approved a 50-for-1 stock split, one of the largest in the New York Stock Exchange‚Äôs history.

This is most easily visualized for simple classification problems. Imagine you're training a neural net to recognize alphanumericals (OCR), and you've gathered an initial data set. You trained it and deploy it in the real world and it happens to classify 7s and 1s correctly, i.e. the network happened to learn the correct decision boundary between 7s and 1s (even though they look a bit similar), but it did so mostly due to chance, not because you covered these examples well in the training set. Now if you retrain the network on the same data, but with a different random seed, you'll end up with different weights and thus a different decision boundary, and this time it might classify them incorrectly. What you have to do then is to find examples to support the correct boundary.\n\nMy guess is the same thing can happen for FSD, where in one version it seems to be able to handle a type of situation pretty well, but suddenly in a new version it doesn't. What they'd have to do then is to gather examples specific to that case and fine-tune the model a bit further. Maybe there are other safeguards they apply on the model output that they refer to as well, difficult to know.\n\n\\* It's likely been overfit to California somewhat, especially in terms of intervention data since the AI team is there, and many other employees, and also many of the early customers who got V12 are there.

Basically, we'd feed the language model with thousands of examples in an excel file of good requirements (marked by a 1 in the second column) and bad requirements (marked by a 0 in the second column). Requirements are basically just sentences along the lines of \"the system shall ___\".

I'm sure they're just reorganizing to a smaller supercharger team geared towards making more superchargers rather than new types of superchargers. This may have happened because they determined that the v4 chargers are the fastest chargers they need. I also heard it takes around a year for an already constructed supercharger location to get connected to the grid, so they'll definitely keep coming online for at least a while.

For one, past net income doesn't matter, only future net income does, and China has started a price war with Tesla which Tesla simply cannot win outside of America. Layoffs, specifically what Tesla did with regards to factory workers is bad, because car production has flat costs and only is profitable with economies of scale. In addition, Tesla had 5.5% margins last quarter and this likely only gets worse as they are going to have to continue lowering their car prices to get sales. Total company net income divided by cars delivered is down to $3000 the lowest since 2020, and is not likely to get better with the competition from China, running factories under capacity, loss of preferential tax treatment, etc. Tech companies can produce the same with less resources because their margins are so high, and do not require massive capex spending. Tesla does not have that luxury. I know how bond rates affect the economy, and I expect them to be flat or even increase later this year.\n\nAnd on your last point, China is absolutely NOT in a recession, the reason Apple and Tesla are doing poorly in China is because native brands are simply outcompeting them.
