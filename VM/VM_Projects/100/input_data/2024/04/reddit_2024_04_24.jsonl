Better yet, with Nintendo’s IP flywheel finally in full effect, the earnings snowball you were first told about many years ago is not only rolling and getting bigger, but it’s set to accelerate as higher-powered hardware drops in the near term and the software release slate normalizes thereafter. \n\nWhich brings us to another key reason to celebrate Nintendo’s fast-approaching “through the looking glass” moment: **It's not just about its dedicated videogame platform business. Nintendo has been taking steps to diversify its income streams for years outside of its core business of videogames by slowly and successfully monetizing its IP via theme parks, movies, and other capital-efficient avenues that are just now beginning to reveal themselves.** It’s still early innings, mind you, but we’re happy to report that years of constant assertions that Nintendo would shy away from properly monetizing its gold-plated portfolio of unrivaled IP look positively ridiculous in hindsight. With the blockbuster success of the Super Mario movie, as well as its theme park and other IP-related initiatives approaching critical mass, Nintendo today has multiple sources of high incremental margin revenue that will begin to snowball over the next several years.  \n\nTo say the same thing a slightly different way, the quality and visibility of Nintendo’s business in early 2024 is radically superior and less risky relative to what it was at any point in its roughly 13-decade history, even if these structural improvements are not broadly appreciated as such. Furthermore, now that Nintendo is armed with the market-leading Switch platform and a self-sustaining IP flywheel on the far side of exit velocity, we remain more confident than ever about its efforts to properly leverage its Apple-like ecosystem of hardware, software, and services across its loyal, 122 million+ strong global customer base.  \n\n**Let's recap why we think Nintendo is slowly but surely sending old bear arguments into permanent hibernation:** \n\n1. Nintendo just printed its highest TTM revenue and operating profit figures in the Switch platform’s history, seven years into an aging console \"cycle,\" despite having released only two top-tier first-party “system sellers” over the previous 18 months.  \n2. Nintendo’s Apple-like ecosystem (reinforced by a very Disney-like IP content flywheel) has radically improved the economic resiliency and visibility of Nintendo’s revenue and cash flow, de-cyclifying its earnings power in lockstep.  \n3. With the release of the Switch 2, Nintendo is primed for continued massive margin expansion by reaching a previously untapped market for the company’s consoles. \n4.

Nintendo Online services will also be a big factor for growth and stabilisation. At this time Nintendo gets very few third party AAA games, and often times need to „encourage them“ due to the lack of power the Nintendo Switch has.

They released the Mario Film and got a share of the profits and a bit for licensing the IP. Immediately after the movie, sale figures for Nintendo Switch AND various Mario games received a massive boost. The Movie was an 2 hour ad for the game, and the game is an ad for the movie (not even talking about merchandise here). This going forward could be massive. In 10 Years we will be talking about the 2020s, when Nintendo became the new Disney (Disney Shareholder myself).\n\nI think this should absolutely not be overlooked.

Chipotle said traffic increased 5.4% from the year-ago period, while average check was up just 1.6%.\n\nIn February, CFO Jack Hartung told analysts that “unusually cold weather” hurt January sales. But demand likely rebounded in the rest of the quarter to offset the sluggish first month.\n\nChipotle has become the rare restaurant chain to report rising transactions despite higher menu prices. The company once again raised its prices in October, citing inflation. Others in the restaurant industry have turned to limited-time offers and deals to appeal to customers, particularly those with lower incomes.\n\nThe chain added 47 new locations to its footprint during the first quarter, inching closer to its long-term goal of doubling its total number of restaurants to reach 7,000 stores.\n\nFor the full year, Chipotle now anticipates same-store sales will grow by a mid-to-high single digit percentage, up from its prior range of a mid-single digit increase. The company reiterated its forecast of 285 to 315 new locations in 2024.\n\nIn March, Chipotle’s board approved a 50-for-1 stock split, one of the largest in the New York Stock Exchange’s history. The company is seeking shareholder approval at its annual meeting on June 6. If investors vote yes, the stock will start trading on a post-split basis on June 26.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/chipotle-mexican-grill-cmg-q1-2024-earnings.html", "id": "1cc8eo0", "created_utc": 1713989809.0, "score": 477, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 230, "comments": [{"body": "People love burritos", "score": 225, "replies": [{"body": "It's not that they love burritos.

Just trying to understand a specific example of what a safety bug would look like \n\n- You’ve mentioned Tesla overfitting for selected robotaxi cities. Do you think Tesla has already overfit certain cities where robotaxis are likely to launch initially and if so should we see increased performance with future releases in those markets (compared to other markets)? Wondering if we’ll get a better sense of robotaxi readiness if we just isolated the likely markets from the broader data set.\n\nThanks!", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "No problem\n\n\\* First, you have to remember that training a neural network with stochastic gradient descent does necessarily produce a stochastic outcome :) This is a problem for examples that are close to weakly supported \"decision boundaries\". This is most easily visualized for simple classification problems. Imagine you're training a neural net to recognize alphanumericals (OCR), and you've gathered an initial data set. You trained it and deploy it in the real world and it happens to classify 7s and 1s correctly, i.e. the network happened to learn the correct decision boundary between 7s and 1s (even though they look a bit similar), but it did so mostly due to chance, not because you covered these examples well in the training set. Now if you retrain the network on the same data, but with a different random seed, you'll end up with different weights and thus a different decision boundary, and this time it might classify them incorrectly. What you have to do then is to find examples to support the correct boundary.\n\nMy guess is the same thing can happen for FSD, where in one version it seems to be able to handle a type of situation pretty well, but suddenly in a new version it doesn't. What they'd have to do then is to gather examples specific to that case and fine-tune the model a bit further. Maybe there are other safeguards they apply on the model output that they refer to as well, difficult to know.\n\n\\* It's likely been overfit to California somewhat, especially in terms of intervention data since the AI team is there, and many other employees, and also many of the early customers who got V12 are there.

But yes, sure I think \"tuning\" was the wrong word here. They're generating whole new AI models each time after all.\n\nI've worked with generating language models before professionally. Nothing like chatGPT or FSD, but our model was meant to analyze systems engineering requirements. Basically, we'd feed the language model with thousands of examples in an excel file of good requirements (marked by a 1 in the second column) and bad requirements (marked by a 0 in the second column). Requirements are basically just sentences along the lines of \"the system shall ___\". As the data size increased, the model would get better and better at correctly identifying a \"good\" requirement vs a \"bad\" requirement. It had examples of practically every case, but when we were generating models with on a few thousand examples it was all over the place. But when we trained a model with 50,000, it had a MUCH better grasp on what was what.\n\nBasically, it matters *how often* a case appears in the dataset you're training an AI off of, so we would tailor data as well with certain similar (but not identical) examples. As well as larger sample sizes are just better for creating more complex AIs that can deal with more situations. It's basically the same thing as job experience.

It seems like the company is reorganizing around developing FSD.\n\nI don't think so, Tesla still has tons of backlogged plans for building new superchargers. I'm sure they're just reorganizing to a smaller supercharger team geared towards making more superchargers rather than new types of superchargers. This may have happened because they determined that the v4 chargers are the fastest chargers they need. I also heard it takes around a year for an already constructed supercharger location to get connected to the grid, so they'll definitely keep coming online for at least a while. Superchargers also seem necessary for robotaxis, so I doubt they'll actually completely stop building new ones.

They can replace human workers with robots, they can move to a subscription model for transportation by providing millions of robo-taxis which will compete on cost to begin with to drive off all the Uber, Lyft, and traditional taxi drivers and then hike up prices once that model is pervasive.\n\nRobots can end up the same way, lease them to companies on some subscription model at a lower cost then your average worker and then hike the prices after the model takes hold. Same thing happened with contract and off shore labor. At one time the argument was you get more workers for the cost of one employee, then it was you get workers you can get rid of more easily, then it was well they've built so much business knowledge in the two years they've worked for you we want to raise their rate, then it's we switched them to another placement train this new guy for us. It's all investor class shell game kind of crap. Now contractors cost more than employees and come with less skill.\n\nPlus based on Elon's track record it's going to be mostly smoke and mirrors. He's pretty bad about over promising and under delivering.\n\nOnce Elon solves autonomy there will only be an investor class and an indentured class. Because the only way to buy the things you need will be to do the worst, cheapest, slave-like jobs available as everything else is taken by some automation and you will not have been in on the ground as an investor when it started so you'll get none of the residual income from it.

Also accounts receivable increased 400 million YoY, and prepaid expenses increased 200 million YoY.\n\n* Tesla paid a lot of cash for items, which it has not yet sold as finished goods\n* Inventory discussed on page 16: Finished goods 6.75 Billion vs. 5 Billion YoY\n\n**Stock Based Compensation on page 19**: Notably higher levels for R&D, reflecting compensation for AI work.\n\n**Update for 2018 compensation package lawsuit on page 19**: Plaintiff’s counsel have filed a brief seeking a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50. *Tesla’s opposition to the fee request is due on June 7, 2024, and a hearing is scheduled for July 8, 2024.* On April 17, 2024, Tesla filed a preliminary proxy statement which included a number of proposals, including a proposal to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\n\n* Note the dates in June and July 2024.

As a result, we expect to recognize in excess o*f $350 million of costs primarily related to employee termination expenses* in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**Cost of advertising and marketing, page 29** : $41 million increase in promotions, advertising and other marketing expenses.\n\n**Potential director sales of stock p. 34**: On February 5, 2024, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, one of our directors, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement for the potential sale of up to 280,000 shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions.

For one, past net income doesn't matter, only future net income does, and China has started a price war with Tesla which Tesla simply cannot win outside of America. Layoffs, specifically what Tesla did with regards to factory workers is bad, because car production has flat costs and only is profitable with economies of scale. In addition, Tesla had 5.5% margins last quarter and this likely only gets worse as they are going to have to continue lowering their car prices to get sales. Total company net income divided by cars delivered is down to $3000 the lowest since 2020, and is not likely to get better with the competition from China, running factories under capacity, loss of preferential tax treatment, etc. Tech companies can produce the same with less resources because their margins are so high, and do not require massive capex spending. Tesla does not have that luxury. I know how bond rates affect the economy, and I expect them to be flat or even increase later this year.\n\nAnd on your last point, China is absolutely NOT in a recession, the reason Apple and Tesla are doing poorly in China is because native brands are simply outcompeting them. Apple is getting outcompeted by Vivo, Huawei. Tesla is getting outcompeted by the massive amounts of EV companies, most notably BYD.
