The animating studio is now Passione and they are masters of making girls look cute and you can rest assured that not only does Holo now look more like her manga counterpart, she's also super cute.\n\nFrom the very start, it is very clear that they are putting a premium on following the story closely. If you know the story already, then the first episode's opening sequence should be reassuring they seem to be taking that seriously. The show is scheduled for a 25 episodes run, so they seem intent on covering a decent amount of content right away and if enough people watch they might try to cover the entire story from beginning to end with subsequent seasons. Guess we'll see on that. The animation is all very super modern and a notable step up from the 2008 anime, and I feel like they have dramatically improved upon Holo's tail fluffiness.\n\nI was going to watch this one anyways but I'm glad they seem to be trying to do a really good job with it.\n\nOh right, since this is the Lounge, Episode 3 has a pretty good discussion of currency valuation lol", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Do you recommend old one or remake?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Would you say sentiment is at it lowest, since 2019?  \nDo you think there's much difference between now and last year?\n\nBecause that's how I feel, I was wondering who agrees.\n\nNot saying that's a guarantee things will get better, I hope they do, but I don't consider it guaranteed.\n\nEdit: corrected the first sentence to make more sense.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "\"all time since 2019\" sounds oxymoronic.

That's not even mentioning how the share price has mainly gone down recently.\n\nI invested in TSLA because it was a lean, high revenue, high margin, high growth company. Once that narrative went away, I started hedging and stopped adding as much (but still adding). I tried to be a moderate/realistic bull as a contrarian voice in all the 20M cars delivered and robotaxi 2 weeks crew and hope people see why now. Valuations are always an issue with TSLA and you have to be realistic with what multiple you and the market are willing to pay for earnings.\n\nI say this a lot, but once you realize and accept all these peaks/troughs and highs/lows were from pure greed/gamma squeeze options shenanigans/momentum, the sooner you can try to figure out a more realistic valuation for the company. It sucks to accept that you may or may not be wrong in the short term if you bought any peaks, but hoping for another gamma squeeze is not a sound investing strategy. Instead, look at Tesla as a business, how much they're making now, how much they can realistically make in 1-2 years, how much they can make in 5-10 years. Come up with a bad/base/good case scenario and how much you're willing to pay for those scenarios. Don't make any decisions based off anyone else's crayons or spreadsheets as they're not responsible for your money and livelihood. \n\nThen aside from share price, if you're overly emotional about the ups and downs, then reassess your positioning and exposure. It's just not healthy to be overly exposed to 1 company, no matter how good it is or can be. Concentration builds wealth but diversification preserves it. People like to talk about how if they went all-in in the successful companies they'd be much wealthier like how Bill Gates would be a trillionaire if he held all his shares. What people don't like to talk about is how there's significantly more people that have lost it all or underperformed the market by being in the wrong company.\n\nStop buying calls/leaps with any significant portion of a portfolio. They're meant to be shorter term bets on directional movement. They don't replace shares in any reasonable portfolio. Those that are buying calls/leaps trying to recreate 2019-2021 have to realize MM aren't pricing in bankruptcy anymore so risk/reward more than likely isn't worth it.

Many here would reasonably assume that each of the people you’ve named specifically in your comment also live full lives outside their Internet persona.

Apologies in advance.  \n\nModel Y was best selling car in the world in 2023 over a Toyota Corolla that costs about half as much.  Tesla has the highest brand loyalty according to Bloomberg.  Tesla does layoffs every 2-3 years just like this.  This is nothing new.  Shareholders have seen 100 not too long ago. 30b cash, all other sections of the business growing rapidly., Tesla vertical integration gives Tesla an unparalleled agility advantage.  Cybertruck has been selling every car made, not sure where you are getting that sales are struggling.  2m pre orders, Free Tesla promos from tons celebs.  Crowds gathering to see Cybertrucks.  In person they are actually pretty cool looking.  I think people just want something different and to be noticed. \n \nFSD is incredible (I use it and trust my family’s life to it) and me and Cathy wood believe it will shock the world.  Have you tried it? Who else has more testers or compute power to catch up? \n\nTesla used values are rough as Elon chose to lower prices of new makes to gain market share (and it worked) bc Teslas have tons of margin to play with while ice makes most of their money on service.   They still have more margin to play with and as an investor I would be okay if they continued to lower prices because the loyalty is so high you just have to get people to try them. The problem is that people lose confidence in their ability to hold their value and that in itself becomes a detractor. \n\nI have owned vipers, Vettes, and regular econoboxes, hybrids, and while the sports cars were fun, ice cars just don’t make sense to drive on the road after you have experienced a Tesla or similar EV. My wife refused to drive my Tesla for a couple of years and she was forced to when her minivan broke down, and she texted me 3 days later and said she didn’t want to give my car back.  Similar experience for most who actually try a Tesla.  I ended up in a used Honda hybrid after my wife took over my model 3 and while it has good range and is reliable, I can’t wait until I get back in the Tesla on the weekends as the driving experience in the Honda doesn’t compare. \n\nIMO There is a ton of hate for Teslas because they either hate the way Elon carries himself/political beliefs or I think the bigger reason is that he upsetting the norm.  I had trouble accepting it for awhile but the performance you get for the money (esp used) is incredible while getting to enjoy 130 mpge, one pedal driving, incredible tech, no gas stations or oil changes, etc.  \n\nOnce you dig into their engineering practices (see sandy munro), you start to wonder how people can buy anything else.  Sure panel gaps have been a common talking point, but I believe that to be overblown as in owning 4 Teslas there have been no panel gap issues and even if there were it is easily overlooked considering the driving experience.  \n\nAlso it’s refreshing to deal with a click and buy experience rather than dealing with dealerships that bait and switch you and price gouge you.  Price transparency is a big deal and I think we will see many switch to the direct to consumer model as it also provides better margins without the middleman.  \n\nThe reality is a 125 share price is a possibility but bankruptcy chances are minute.  The share price is heavily reliant on the auto side right now and short term auto demand heavily influences share price.  Tesla had a perfect storm of hurdles this quarter and one bad quarter doesn’t equal a trend for a strong company like this.
