In total, the company sold 626,263 vehicles in the first quarter, of which about 300,114 were pure EVs.\n\n> BYD’s strong first quarter performance contrasts with plummeting expectations for Elon Musk-owned EV maker Tesla, whose stock has dropped nearly 30% year-to-date.\n\n> Several analysts have revised down their projections for the company’s first quarter vehicle deliveries (an approximate gauge for sales), after reports of a cutback in production at Tesla’s factory in Shanghai.\n\n> Wedbush Securities cut their estimate to 425,968 from about 475,000. If Wedbush’s prediction is accurate Tesla’s vehicle deliveries will have grown less than 1% year over year, but would still be higher than BYD’s pure EV sales during the same period.

Here are the key numbers:\n\nTotal deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810\nTotal production Q1 2024: 433,371\n\nTesla doesn’t break out sales of its vehicles by model but reported that it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783 of those cars. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.\n\nIn the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.\n\nAccording to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ending March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.\n\nIndependent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.\n\nTesla’s head of investor relations Martin Viecha sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts’ estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.\n\nTesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.\n\nHouthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla’s component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.\n\nIn China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers’ schedules to 5 days a week from 6 and a half days.\n\nIn the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla’s newest model — an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck — which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year.\n\nA series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla.\n\nDuring the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company’s premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn’t make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nShares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company’s IPO in 2010.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/02/tesla-tsla-q1-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html", "id": "1btycxe", "created_utc": 1712063430.0, "score": 1133, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 692, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR the cult status is over.

They just need something they can stick into a package along with the all other other specialized chips, and the APUs/GPUs they've been producing are fine for this, and the separate adapters are just a sideline.

Not for nothing but other than Mobileye there’s not really any reason to not invest elsewhere. \n\n• Intel in a massive AI and Datacenter boom has either consistently lost revenue & marketshare every quarter or stayed close to flat whilst lowering margins into the ground\n\n• Datacenter/AI chips are supposed to be high margin high profit chips. If your margins are at 2% they you practically are giving them away at cost to try to keep hold of any marketshare you have \n\n• GPU wise gaining any marketshare will take time. The issue is their gen 2 GPU’s (Battlemage) can’t have a flop like their gen 1 (Alchemist). **Admittedly this area definitely requires a lot of trial and error so Alchemist having a real rocky start is to be expected.** \n\n• Intel gaining any headway with other companies that want them to make their chips is going to be tough. Being a distant 3rd or 4th place choice means either taking massive discounts on chip deals or somehow beating the snot out of TSMC and Samsung which is not something I see. \n\n• Intel has had a lot of its good faith thrown out the window. A lot of companies left Intel foundries for other fabs. Intel screwing up so much in recent years probably doesn’t inspire confidence. \n\n• Client Computing Group is the only place where Intel is still king but it’s also one of the more volatile sectors. A 2-3% shift here whether it be market factors or competition could fuck them pretty severely.    \n\n• Not for nothing but everyone saying stuff about chip availability needs to realize that both Samsung and TSMC are building massive plants in the US and other parts of the world too.", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "You don’t know why people are shocked and yet they lost $2 billion more than their estimated loss lol seems enough people expected a loss but the amount they beat expectations was the shocker.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "When I saw what happened it was more of oh look it’s a day the ends in Y where Intel over promises and under performs/delivers.
