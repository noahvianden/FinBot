The regular Model X now costs 724,900 yuan and its plaid variant 824,900 yuan.\n\nThe carmaker on Friday cut U.S. prices of its Model Y, Model X and Model S vehicles by $2,000. On Saturday it slashed the price of its Full Self-Driving driver assistant software to $8,000 from $12,000 in the United States.\n\nTesla reported this month that its global vehicle deliveries in the first quarter fell for the first time in nearly four years, as price cuts failed to stir demand.\n\nThe EV maker has been slow to refresh its ageing models as high interest rates have sapped consumer appetite for big-ticket items, while rivals in China, the world’s largest auto market, are rolling out cheaper models.\n\nMusk postponed a planned trip this weekend to India, where he was to have met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing obligations at Tesla. The trip was to have included the announcement of plans for Tesla to enter the South Asian market, Reuters has reported on Saturday.\n\nMusk said last Monday that Tesla will lay off more than 10% of its global workforce as the automaker is bracing for its first annual drop in deliveries.\n\nThe announcement came after Reuters reported on April 5 that Tesla had scrapped its plan to develop its long-awaited affordable EV in favour of robotaxis. Musk posted that “Reuters is lying” after the report, without citing any inaccuracies. He has not spoken further about the model, leaving investors clamouring for clarity.\n\nTesla shares fell 40.8% so far this year.\n\nSince late 2022, Tesla ignited a price war as Musk pursued volume growth at the expense of margins.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/21/tesla-cuts-prices-nearly-2000-in-china-in-line-with-us-cuts.html", "id": "1c9qktm", "created_utc": 1713728258.0, "score": 637, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 186, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In the end puts are perfectly fine if markets are hugely overvalued with a weird economy that is hard to predict and stubborn inflation and a screwed up global economy. Especially if a company has outlandish price rises with promises of a transformed economy ( and robo taxis cough tesla cough ) . \n\nNow for the wider market in general you are right and markets tend to go up over time because companies make profit and do research and development. So most of the time you should stay in the market but man the last couple years are pushing a huge wave of potential fuck up ahead of themselves. A big amount of the great performance of the stockmarket in the last decade were companies leveraging with cheap money. And well that that is gone and doesn't seem to come back. And with inflation high and the deficit already at idiotic level the government can't save us this time, if anything it's a miracle that it still is going so well. I guess uncle Sam is still pumping up the economy with a 6% deficit.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Oh my gourd! \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
