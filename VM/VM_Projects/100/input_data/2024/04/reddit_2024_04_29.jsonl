Since everyone is blindly bullish on NVDA, you should have avoided including the ticker in your question.\n\nTo answer your option related question, you are looking to make the most money because you think NVDA will be under $200 in 2 years.\n\nSay your crystal ball works only 2 years out, and it is cloudy in the meantime, then you need to wait until one week/month/quarter before the 2 year mark and buy all the 300-350 puts you can buy. You could trade other options or spreads to finance the put purchase.\n\nOn a serious note, you have no idea if and when they will be accused of financial misreporting, and you have no idea if they are actually doing anything wrong, yet you are accusing them of fraud. Go easy now, tiger.\n\nMy advice, as someone who has traded options for over 25 years, is that you do not focus your anger and disgust at a company that is doing well, where you see potential pipeline or other issues. I did that with a phone company that was ran by a serial fraudster, and while I ended up being right, and the stock crashed 80% from it's highs, I barely made any money on it. I would trade bearish call/put spreads each quarter, hoping they would come clean about a buried regulatory ruling which pretty much killed their business model, but they never did. I lost or broke even for over a year, close to two years. Then one day they came clean, not only about the ruling but about other shitty issues they had not properly disclosed, and the stock tanked and kept tanking. Then in the end, it was sold to a foreign company. It was a winner's curse - I felt vindicated for being negative and short, and staying short, but I barely broke even on the trades.\n\nPS: being an accounting genius is a rare trait....instead of looking for that one time windfall because of your accounting smarts, look for more frequent smaller wins that will add up, and do not be emotional about it.

{"title": "Tesla jumps 10% in premarket trade after passing key hurdle to roll out full self-driving in China", "selftext": "Shares of Tesla rose sharply in U.S. premarket trading on Monday after the electric car maker passes a significant milestone to roll out its full self-driving technology in China.\n\nThe company’s share price spiked more than 10% just after 7:30 a.m. ET, as investors reacted to news surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s visit to China.\n\nTesla on Sunday said that local Chinese authorities removed restrictions on its cars after passing the country’s data security requirements.\n\nThe move raised expectations that Tesla’s driver-assistance software Full Self Driving (FSD) would soon be available in the country, which is the largest market for electric vehicles.\n\nWhile Tesla’s electric cars are some of the most popular vehicles in China, they have reportedly been banned from some government-related properties due to data security concerns.\n\nSeparately, the Biden administration earlier this year announced a probe into whether imported cars from China pose national security risks due to their ability to potentially collect sensitive data.\n\nFSD is an upgrade to Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistant. Tesla has offered its FSD technology in China for years, but with a restricted feature set that limits it to operations, such as automated lane changing.\n\nData security concerns have been a key obstacle preventing Tesla from achieving a full rollout of the system in China.\n\nTesla also reportedly scored a deal with Baidu that would give Musk’s firm access to the Chinese internet giant’s mapping and navigation technology for Tesla’s FSD feature.\n\nThe agreement would allow Tesla to tap into Baidu’s mapping service license, which is a requirement for intelligence driving systems to operate on public roads in China, Reuters reported, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\n\nCNBC was unable to independently verify the report. Tesla and Baidu were not immediately available for comment.\n\nWith the license, which foreign companies can only clinch in partnership with local Chinese firms, Tesla will be allowed to legally operate FSD on Chinese roads, and its fleets will be able to gather data about traffic, road signs and routes.\n\nThe breakthrough for Tesla toward bringing its FSD self-driving technology to China marks a key win for the firm at a time when it is facing hefty competition in the Chinese market. Local rivals such as Warren Buffett-backed electric vehicle maker BYD, Nio, and Xpeng have ramped up their competition with Tesla in recent years.\n\nBYD was temporarily the largest electric vehicle maker globally, producing more than 3 million new energy vehicles in 2023. The firm recently lost its crown as world’s largest EV maker, after a 43% plunge in sales in the first quarter.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/29/tesla-tsla-stock-up-after-passing-hurdle-to-china-full-self-driving.html", "id": "1cfwypc", "created_utc": 1714390860.0, "score": 709, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 413, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There's legal complications, legislative uncertainty, negative reporting, naming ambiguity, data unclarity,.. Most companies active in self driving have similar controversy. Just because you deny there are many obstacles doesn't mean that there aren't any.\nApplying current FSD revenue as the revenue going forward might seem unfair. But, FSD is also at least one and possibly two orders of magnitude off on number of interventions per million miles compared to for example waymo. Based on that and the lack of open credible neutral FSD data I would assume that Tesla needs an unmanned pilot stage first before a commercially viable autotaxi version makes sense.\n\nDemand isn't increasing across EV. Demand growth does. That's different. The result is that YoY more BEV sold globally (and Europe, China, US), but less Tesla's (amongst some other brands). Tesla has 95% of the sales in 2 models and even after repeatedly decreasing prices couldn't sell everything it produced. Granted, this happened only 1 quarter, but it's a very bad omen. Reducing the prices brought Tesla from operating margins that were close to Ferrari to margins that are now below Toyota. \n\nTesla also has been cutting employees and has been silently scaling down on expansions and new factories. Therefore I believe that even if demand picks up they will respond in a delayed fashion. Similarly for Model2. They are unlikely to make more than 500000 per year without more factories. You can expect scaled up production earliest about 2 years after investment decision (and probably later). So, that's a reasonable upper bound on revenue. Assuming current margins, since competition won't get easier, that's a reasonable estimate for optimistic profits. \n\nTesla retention rates seem to be industry leading according to what I've seen. I'm sceptical of using interviews as data since it's not hard data, but it's the best that was available, so not going to deny that. Actually retention rate on average was over 50% across all brands, so your last claim there was false. Nevertheless Tesla came out markedly higher.\n\nWhat do US politics have to do with this?

From Q1 '24 report, page 10: \n\n>These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be **produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up**.\n\n* Un-boxing process is dead for non-Robotaxi vehicles.  I reviewed the portion of Investor Day 2023 related to un-boxing, and this cannot be backported to current assembly lines.  Un-boxing builds vehicle sub-assemblies in separate areas before integrating them into a complete vehicle.  The current process builds the vehicle body and then adds stuff to that body as it moves down the line.  \n   * **Conclusion:**  Vehicle body likely to be a Model Y derivative;  Model 3 derivative possible, but less likely because Model 3 was just refreshed (project Highland)", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "(2 of 2)  Other Avenues of Cost Reduction:\n\n(1) Next-generation 2170 battery cell due soon.  Source is Bloomberg, de-paywalled: [https://archive.is/jKWWW](https://archive.is/jKWWW)\n\nNamed source stated on the record:\n\n>\"A revamped version of Panasonic’s 2170 cells will begin production at the manufacturing plant the company operates with Tesla Inc. in Nevada sometime in **2024** or **2025**, **CTO Shoichiro Watanabe said in an interview.\"**\n\n>**Raising manufacturing capacity 10% by the 2025 fiscal year doesn’t necessarily require the addition of new production lines or further investment**, according to Watanabe. Decisions on the production timing of next-generation EV batteries at the Nevada plant will be made “not unilaterally, but together” with Tesla, he said.\n\n* Greater economies of scale reduces cell costs.  Higher density cells means Tesla can put fewer cells into each pack.\n\n(2) Revamped electrical architecture\n\n* From Investor Day 2023 presentation page 66-73:  Tesla moves to 100% in-house designed controllers.  Reducing the # of controllers and optimizing connectivity points lowers costs\n* 48V wiring reduces mass of wiring needed, also lowering costs.\n\n(3) Next-generation drive unit\n\n* From Investor Day Presentation: $1000 total cost for drive unit, 0 rare earth metals and 75% reduction in silicon carbide.\n\n(4) Other items where cost can be reduced\n\n* Steel Wheels.  The current Gemini wheels w' covers don't look great, and many Tesla customers end up replacing the aero covers with aftermarket ones, typically black in color.  There's no point in having alloy Gemini wheels.  These cost $200 used on eBay.  Tesla might as well use cheap steel wheels and make some nicer looking hub caps.  That would save several hundred $ per vehicle.\n* Audio System.  I believe the RWD Model Y already uses a less complicated audio system than the LR AWD.\n\nSummary of what I believe Tesla will launch in early 2025 instead of manually driven NGV:\n\nModel Y derivative:\n\n* Same kWh capacity battery packs, using fewer next-gen 2170 Panasonic cells\n* 48V electrical architecture using 100% Tesla designed controller chips\n* All-new drive unit using 0 rare earths\n* Steel wheels with aero covers\n* Simpler audio system\n\n**Estimated Cost (RWD):**  $39,000, or somewhere in the $31,500 range *after tax credit for qualified buyers*.

{"title": "9 reasons why Apple stock will fall dramatically after earnings on May 2,2024", "selftext": "9 reasons why Apple stock will fall dramatically after earnings on May 2,2024\n\nAt least a 5% further drop from\n$169 levels.To $160 or lower.\n\nI just cannot see any good news\nexcept the fairly bullish open interest on the latest option contracts.\nBut is that enough ?\n\nEven Jim Cramer is quietly bearish as of April 24,2024.\n\nReason one.\nApple had a death cross on March 14,2024.Just over 7 weeks ago.\nLong time to be under the 200 days moving average .\n\nCurrent 200 days Simple Moving Average is $181.36 per share.\n\nCurrent 50 days Simple Moving Average is $173.29 per share.\n\nCurrent 14 days Relative Strength Index is a 47.33 \nDefinitely not oversold by any means.\nIn the low 30’s it would be oversold and ripe for a strong bounce.\n\nIn the case of Apple stock, its 50-day “line crossed below its 200-day line on March 14,2024.\n\nThe last time Apple did that was in June 2022, and the stock was already several weeks into a major decline. \n\nThe two lines touched again in September 2022 and the death cross expanded from there.\n\nhttps://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-death-cross/\n\n\nThe Death Cross is a technical analysis pattern in the stock market that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. \n\nTypically, the Death Cross involves the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.\n\nThis pattern is considered bearish and may suggest a potential reversal of an uptrend, indicating that a stock or market might be entering a period of decline.\n\nReason two.\nApple had a double top of $199.37 in December 2023 and $196.13 in January 2024.\nThis is extremely significant.\n\nA double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs.\n\nIt is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.\n\nThe double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that can be observed at the top of an uptrend and signals an impending reversal.\n\nThe double top chart pattern resembles the letter “M”, due to the two equal highs.\n\nA double top is a chart pattern that signals the end of an uptrend. \n\nTherefore, when the market forms a double top, close out long positions (sell)before prices fall. \n\nYou can also take a short position (short sell) to profit from the market's decline or buy put options on the stock. \n\nThe double top pattern can be a very profitable and highly predictable price action pattern.Usually dramatic drops over the next 2 weeks to 2 months of the second peak price.\n\nReason three.\nApple broke below its recent double bottom of $167.19 in September 2023\nand $165.24 in October 2023.\n\nIn April 2024 Apple dropped to a $164 range over 3 days or from April 19 to 23,2024.\nThe 48 to 68 million was not convincing or heavy enough to suggest that a major low had truly formed on Apple stock.\n\nIf it was one day,it would be okay.\nBut for 3 consecutive days of $164 range trading is a bit much.\nTrouble in Apple paradise or further downside coming soon ?\n\n\nDouble Bottom breakdowns on charts are bearish patterns that mark a downside support break.\n\nBut you might say the breakdown was only $1.00 or less from last 6 months highs.\n\n\nReason four.\nApple is below its 20 days moving average of $169.37.\nWhere it has been much of the last 3 months.\nApple stock current price is \n$169.30\n\nReason five.\nApple hit another double top formation recently.\nHit $178.67 in March 2024 and $178.36 in April 2024.\nAnd more worrisome,it broke the neckline of $167 per share in April 2024.\nVery bad.\n\nReason six.\nApple’s market share declines in China by 25% year over year according to Canalys Report.\n\nApple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%. Canalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented.\nPronounced downtrend.\nNot a good trend.\n\niPhone sales spiral 25% in China as Apple drops from first place to fifth.\nApril 26,2024\n\nAccording to Canalys, Apple saw its shipments in China hit 10 million units in Q1 2024, a decrease of 25% year-over-year. \n\nThis gives Apple a 15% share of the Chinese smartphone market, down from the 20% share it held at the same time last year.\n\n\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/iphone-shipments-china-q1-2024-decline/\n\nhttps://canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q1-2024\n\nWith the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.That is a big deal.\n\nApple is expanding its manufacturing outside of China.\nDefinitely a good thing.\n\nBut can the India manufacturing and sales help overcome the 25% China drop in units or iPhones.\n\nHere is a sign of things to come for Apple stock.\n\nFor years, eight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone: “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” The slogan illustrated the tech giant’s two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley and the manufacturing giant it had become in the factory of the world.\n\nApple no longer lists the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase was updated: “Designed by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.”\n\nReason seven.\n\nExpected EPS for May 2,2024 is \n$1.51\n\nThe latest earnings whisper is $1.50\n\nExpected revenue for May 2,2024\nis $90.61 billion.\n\nThe latest revenue whisper is\n$89.79 billion.\n\n\nHow can Apple meet these earnings and revenue with the huge 25% drops in units in China in its most recent quarter,\n\nMake the revenue shortfall from India and Europe.\n\nAccording to revenue and earnings whispers,Apple will barely be under expected earnings and revenue.\n\nBased on this, Apple should drop on earnings date.\n\nUnless Apple gives strong guidance regarding AI or Artificial Intelligence during the earnings call.\n\nBut what about Apple Watch sales.\nAnd Vision Pro sales.\nPlus the iCar exit.\n\nReason eight.\nApple Vision Pro sales tank.\n\nAccording to prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has revised its Apple Vision Pro shipment expectations for 2024 down to 400,000 to 450,000 units.\n\nApple originally expected to sell as many as 800,000 Apple Vision Pro units this year, reports Kuo, who has accurately broken news on the company over the years due to his supply chain contacts.\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro is undoubtedly a flop as of April 2024.When is the last time you heard anything good about it in the news.Disappeared like lightning.\n\nWill the “iCar” Exit Impact Apple Stock.\n\nWhy Apple scrapped its autonomous vehicle (AV) project, while iPhone earnings could be a bigger concern.\nApril 12,2024\n\nhttps://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/248065/will-the-%E2%80%9Cicar%E2%80%9D-exit-impact-apple-stock.aspx\n\nApple Watch X: The latest on Apple’s plans for a major design refresh\nApril 24,2024\n\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2024/04/24/apple-watch-x-design-overhaul/\n\n\n\nAre you bearish or bullish on Apple \nstock.\nCould a steep drop after earnings begin bigger drops in the SP500 index or SPY ETF.\n\nReason nine.\n\nJim Cramer is bearish on Apple stock.\n\nJim Cramer said on April 22,2024 or on Cramer’s Mad Dash that Apple could hit $160 after earnings report on May 2,2024.\n\nThat is a huge $9 drop from current April 26,2024 levels of $169 per share.\n\n\nDespite all these nine negatives,\nthe options market is extremely bullish for May 2,2024.\n\nThe put call open interest ratio is decidedly bullish at 0.57 for the May 3,2024 contracts.\n\nA falling put-call ratio, or below 0.7 and approaching 0.5, is considered a bullish indicator\n\nFor May 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.17 to 0.66\nVery bullish.\n\nFor June 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.32 to 0.72 \nDefinitely bullish.\n\nThe average investor thinks Apple is headed in the wrong direction.\nMaximum pessimism.\n\nMorgan Stanley likes Apple stock.\n\nBut even suggest that there will be post-earnings weakness and that Apple will significantly lower guidance or a 4 to 7% drop for next quarter.\n\nBuy the dip on tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia ahead of earnings, Morgan Stanley says.\n\nWe believe Apple will slightly beat March 2024 Quarter ests, but guide to June Quarter revs/implied EPS 4-7% below Street. \n\nAt $165, this appears priced in but in today’s volatile market, it’s a tricky setup. \n\nThat said, with Apple’s biggest WWDC ever on June 10th, we’d buy post-earnings weakness. Remain OW; $210 PT.\n\nIf Apple drops on opening of May 3,2024 will SPY 1 day options bought on May 2,2024 be a smart play for the next day.\nHint.\n\nIn other words,will the Apple stock drop trigger a 1% plus drop on the SPY ETF.Very likely.\n\nWhat say you regards.\nListen to the option investors or options money flow.\n\nOr is Jim Cramer right on Apple.", "id": "1cfpv4o", "created_utc": 1714363518.0, "score": 169, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 246, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 28 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|18630)calls go BRRR thanks for the buy signal OP", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\"Jim Cramer is bearish on Apple stock\"\n\nCALLS!", "score": 529, "replies": [{"body": "I stopped reading at this bullet point", "score": 180, "replies": [{"body": "Op should have put this bullet point in the end of his post if he wanted anyone to read it.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "she?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I just assumed OP's Gender 😬.

{"title": "Intel : the opportunity of this decade for retails and the \"Duck You Wall Street\" really deserves", "selftext": "OK regards listen up!\nThis is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.\n\nNot surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.\n\nThat's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real \"Duck You\" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  \n\nPersistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.\n\nWall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.\n\nI have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.\n\nAt 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.\n\nAt 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.\n\nAt 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.\n\nToo many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!\n\nNow let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.\n\nIntel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing \"guides\". Literally everyone bushing this company.\n\nThere are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.\n\nIntel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka \"Intel Foundry\" and their chip design units aka \"Intel Products\".\n\nWhen you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.\n\nIntel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.\n\nAll those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.\n\n\"Intel lost billions\" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact \"Intel investing billions to make huge money after that\".\n\nHow much money you ask? \n\nI believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).\n\nIntel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. \n\nAs the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :\"never bet against America\".\n\nI'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.\n\nMost importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.\n\nThis is what Wall Street has always been doing.\nNow let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:\n\nTrading close to their book value as low risk factor.\n\nP/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.\n\nMassive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.\n\nThis is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.\n\nSo how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? \n\nBy buying the stock now!\n\nDon't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.\n\nSo what is the bottom line here you say? \n\nForward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! \n\nOn neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! \n\nThat is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.\n\n120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.\n\nHere are my long term positions: \n\nNO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.\nHodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.\n\nAverage price here of 32.2 \n\nThat is a major position for me, that currently account for more then 70% of my portfolio.

There's also a personality cult around Elon, causing some of his followers to have some misplaced faith in the future of Tesla. The company does have great sales potential, much better than any other car manufacturer I would say. And I think that has played a lot into pumping up their stock price. The piece that many people fail to grasp is a company is only ever as good as its weakest link, and with Tesla, that has always been their operations. They're a much younger company than their competitors and they have a much higher defect rate than their competitors. They've also historically struggled with meeting quotas. A company with an A grade in sales and a C- grade in operations is still a C- grade company. Their operations will improve over time, but they have a long ways to go still.

Basic bitches, bitchy bitches, bossy bitches, slutty bitches, classy bitches, etcetc. Don't matter they all love LV bags.)\n\nReason why is because those who are actually rich/wealthy value their time the most and that's not Mercedes. You don't own the Merc. Merc owns you: cringe salesmen, constant brake downs and error messages, price gouging dealers mechanics, higher insurance, \"recommended\" BS from premium fuel to authentic parts, lifestyle creep, the quality is a lie since most new models won't last 100K+ (for that you want a Lexus/Acura, Honda/Toyota, Subaru or Porsche if you must go German), you can't park it just wherever for fear of damage, you can't max rev it because it's your precious merc, and every mofo trying to rip off your lil'merc logo. \n\nEven the actual wealthy/rich people who drive benz don't \"own\" merc cars: ***they lease them***. That cuts the Merc BS you have to deal with in half: cringe merc dealer will just give you the advertised lease price, breakdown issues are the dealer's problem, overpriced maintenance/parts isn't your problem either, plus the multiple warnings for shit going wrong are all covered, and you'll return it after your lease ends so you can redline that shit as much as you like. One good thing about Mercedes is their service reps and service are decent so most rich mofos like just dropping off the car whenever it has problems/maintenance, picking up some free coffee/breakfast, getting a new service vehicle for the weekend or a concierge to wherever they are going, and then get their car back fixed and washed (cause they value the time/convenience).", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Just gonna leave this here - I drive a Benz built in 2012.
