I’ll explain.\n\nAs a shareholder, you own a part of the business and therefore own a part of the business’s earnings, as well as their assets and any liabilities they have. That means as the company’s earnings and assets increase, the value of the company increases. The share price follows this value growth in quite complex ways. Sometimes a share price follows a company’s value with a strong correlation (over the long term 10+ years it will follow the share price exactly), but sometimes it can lag the company’s true value or go above where it should be. \n\nThis lag or overshoot in the share price can sometimes take years to revert to the business’s true value. Sometimes if it’s really lagging a company will buy back its shares or issue a dividend. But in reality the lag is always temporary because the business has increased its earnings and is therefore worth more. This increase in value represents an increased yield to investors and eventually gets reflected in the share price. You can think of this as a dividend yield if that’s easier to wrap your head around (i.e as a company’s earnings increase they can naturally increase their dividend).\n\nThis brings me back to my original point: you should think of yourself as part owner of a business and look for companies with good financials and high free cash flow. Because free cash flow is what companies use to pay dividends.

Bird strikes show up there.  Turbulence that injures a passenger also falls into that category.\n\nI can't really go further back because I have to do it by hand and most notably this doesn't account at all for flights the planes make.  I don't know for certain but I would bet that Southwest is using its 737-800s on more shorter haul flights than say Delta likely is.\n\nBut just looking at every incident the worst one by far was likely an American Airlines 737-800 that had brake maintenance improperly performed causing it to nearly end up off the runway at Dallas-Ft.

It doesn't even give you stats, I had to manually count things up (one reason why I went for the odd timeframe of 5 months, could see that much on a single screen).  \n\nBut its one of the thoughts I had as well.  My guess is that Southwest is probably getting more flights out of their 737s per day than most other carriers (and again this was only the 737-800 incidents in the US, I couldn't easily pull all 737 data together).  If that is the case though you are going to expect Southwest to be somewhat higher because most of the incidents you see occur during takeoff or landing (bird strikes being a big one).\n\nAnd if you look past the raw numbers and start to consider serious safety incidents that occurred in that timeframe then Southwest holds up even better.  I am going by memory but I think it was something like Southwest had two and United and American each had 1 (with this being one of the incidents for Southwest),  The worst was American which nearly went off the runway on landing because the brake system didn't work properly.  The investigation is ongoing still on that one, but the preliminary report indicates that the brakes weren't set right after the brake pads were replaced (and potentially changed to a different type) which resulted in the failure.

Southwest has a young fleet unlike Delta or Untied Air Museums, because they buy planes new, fly the crap out of them, time the planes out after 20 years and scrap them.\n\nBetween all those factors, I think it’s pretty safe to say Southwest isn’t f’n up any more than any other airline given the circumstances.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You are asking one of the right questions here.
