Don't read BS clickbait on Google, just stay off of it. The articles always make me laugh, especially today \"NVDA plunges\", \"NVDA plummets\", \"Buy this AI stock instead\". Clickbait to the extreme using big, scary words to manipulate investors.

Given that this is just the start of what AI could and will eventually be, it will most likely hit $1000 at some point if not surpass it and or experience a split. \n\nThe best example I can give you is this. If you were to purchase the SP500 towards the tail end of 2007 (the peak before the Great Recession in 2008) this would, at the time, literally be the worst possible moment you could have opened a position. Flash forward to the end of 2023 and that same position would have gone up some 300%+, if you averaged down during the recession that number may have been even better. \n\nMoral of the story, you need to give things time, you may lose money in the short run but over the next 10 years it will without a doubt be worth more than what you paid for it. Just be patient and don’t panic. Not to mention your position size is only 2 shares, if it were to fall to $0 you would only lose $1900, sure that would suck but it’s not the end of the world you know what I mean? It’s not like you have your mortgage riding on NVDA. \n\nImo good investors are the ones who are able to stomach the economic downturns and capitalize on the recovery by averaging up or down (continuously adding to their position) when everyone else is panicking.

Free speech doesn't apply to every place you can speak - it isn't a blanket right to air your dirty laundry anywhere with impunity. \n\nAnd it ONLY applies to the Government! Private companies can remove your posts on their platforms at their whims so long as it isn't blanketing the removal based on protected classes (ie Twitter probably couldn't just blanket remove only tweets from Black people, or only tweets from Men, etc) I say probably because - again - private companies have lots of leeway in running their businesses because they aren't the government. \n\nBusinesses have LONG had the right to terminate employees and in most states without needing any reason at all and thus any reason goes. \n\nMost companies aren't so paranoid about the world to think pandemics and vaccines are anything more than public health crises humanity has dealt with for as long as concentrated population centers spring up in river valleys tens of thousands of years ago, and thus will absolutely implement policies that keep their workers safer and healthier. \n\nIt makes 100% sense to include that in parental custody battles, too. \n\nIf one parent is adamantly against vaccines in the face of all medical science, that is a detriment to the child. \n\nWe have long required vaccinations to *protect* children because it turns out that children fucking DYING of preventable illnesses that we have vaccines for is **a terrible, avoidable tragedy**\n\nThe easiest way to ensure their health is require vaccines for being in public school and to provide programs to ensure even low income and impoverished children can get these innoculations still. \n\n\nSo a quick recap:\n\nFreedom of speech doesn't mean what you think it means. \n\nPrivate companies are free to police their platforms to their content so long as they stay within legal requirements (free speech only applies to the government, and it DOESNT protect direct threats, defamation, etc) \n\nParents against protecting their children from deadly diseases are (rightly) less favored in custody battles because it's better for the children's health and wellbeing \n\nAnd finally we've been vaccinating for a very very long time to the point you don't even know the brutality and devastation that widespread diseases once wrought over all of human civilization and the fact we've developed methods to nearly eradicate some of these blights of human existence is to be CELEBRATED\n\nIt's not brainwashing - it's public health. And there's not a lot of wiggle room for \"Jimbo's opinion from what he heard a podcaster or pundit said\" in that arena. \n\nThe way vaccine conspiracies have you think - mRNA vaccines came out of nowhere with no testing or anything and were forcibly injected into baby's eyeballs or something when the reality is research on mRNA vaccines started last century, there were clinical trials throughout the early 2000s and 2010s, and we were damn lucky it wasn't politicized by pundits on evening \"news\" networks prior to the pandemic so that we had a very solid base of research to move forward using it to develop a vaccine against a virus that is a perfect candidate for mRNA vaccination technically (other forms of SARS CoV viruses were candidates for earlier testing efforts and vaccine research was being done in the mid 2000s on these diseases specifically because the medical community already knew how devastating those diseases and especially new variants of them could potentially be)\n\nSo yes. At the end of the day - after half a century of research and hard work and effort and trials we had the means to engineer the fastest vaccine development yet witnessed by mankind and a few shitty memes about being jabbed with microchips and political pundits in suits on a TV and podcasters with Shure SM7B microphones was enough to NEARLY derail it all and then immediately led to a fucking SURGE of diseases that we had nearly fully and completely drove EXTINCT to start emerging and devastating communities where there antivax conspiracy sentiments took a real hold on the population and so children didn't get vaccinated and then outbreaks occurred and children died. \n\nYou're right to be skeptical of the government, you're right to be skeptical of big corporations ESPECIALLY big pharma, but not everything is out to get you. \n\nVaccines work. They have saved literally billions of lives. But they REQUIRE the population to be mostly vaccinated to work. \n\nVaccinations are like jury duty. It's your civic duty. You absolutely should show up and do it if you're healthy and able. \n\nSame for vaccines. It'd a civic duty to protect those who cannot get the vaccine because the more of us who can get it that have it - the less the disease spreads. The less it will mutate. The less people have it. The less people die from it. \n\nIf there weren't so many people throwing and believing conspiracies about vaccines mandates wouldn't even be necessary. \n\nThe Autism/MMR vaccine scare in England that ultimately turned out to be a hoax by a quack doctor who had his medical license revoked because he was trying to patent an alternative vaccine to rake in millions from investors by staging a sham \"trial\" showing a \"potential link\" to stoke fears around the vaccine in the early 2000s is a great example for that. \n\nBritain didn't see NEARLY the same levels of vaccine hesitancy that other countries (especially the US..) saw with respect to Covid because they had seen before the damage caused by not vaccinating - it caused kids to get measles or rubella and fucking suffer and DIE - and the \"skepticism\" was all fucking faked to begin with.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I’m with you, but do you really think the person you replied to will ever read this?

He knows how to get people's attention, and he talks a good game...\n\n**The many times Elon Musk made a promise that he didn't keep**\n\nElon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, is known for his ambitious visions and bold promises. However, there have been instances where some of these promises were not fulfilled. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Not buying Twitter unless they get rid of all Spam Bots: Musk signed a deal to buy Twitter. But then he later claimed that he couldn’t move forward with the deal, unless Twitter proves that less than 5% of its users are bots.\n* The “420 deal” refers to a tweet Elon Musk sent on August 7, 2018, in which he stated that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share and that funding for the transaction had been secured1. This tweet led to a significant controversy because the statement about secured funding was not actually true. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Musk, alleging that he had misled investors. Tesla investors also sued Musk personally over the tweet, claiming that they were defrauded of millions of dollars, as Musk exaggerated the claim that funding was secured.\n* Self-Driving Cars: Musk’s most consistent promise originated in 2014, when he said people could expect Tesla full self-driving cars within months. The cars still aren’t fully autonomous. So, Musk keeps moving back the target date.\n* The Cybertruck: Musk went public in 2019 with an electric pickup — a Cybertruck, shaped like a trapezoid and armored like a tank, retailing for $39,900 for an expected 2021 rollout. The vehicle drew more attention when a sledgehammer was used on it without causing a scratch. But the Cybertruck didn’t go into production until 4 years later, with a manufacturer’s suggested retail prices (MSRP) at $99,990.\n* The Hyperloop: Musk tweeted on July 20, 2017, that he had received “verbal govt. approval for the Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY to DC in 29 minutes.” A Hyperloop between the three cities never materialized.\n* The Tesla Semi, an all-electric battery-powered Class 8 semi-truck, was unveiled by Tesla in November 2017. After several delays, Tesla finally began deliveries of the Semi in the United States in December 2022. Tesla has built about 70 Tesla Semi electric trucks since they started production in late 2022. However, the expansion of Gigafactory Nevada to build the vehicle in volume has yet to happen.\n* Flamethrowers for everyone. In December 2017, Musk mentioned that The Boring Company would start selling flamethrowers after they had sold 50,000 hats. The flamethrower, technically called “Not-a-Flamethrower”, was a product of The Boring Company, another venture of Elon Musk. The Boring Company sold 20,000 units of the $500 “Not-A-Flamethrower” machines in just a few days. And then abruptly ended the project. As of now, the flamethrowers are not available for purchase through The Boring Company’s website. Musk also denied rumors that he was creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for the flamethrowers.\n\nThese are just a few examples of Musk’s unconventional approach to business and marketing.

For example, maybe the directors sold valuable company assets to a different company the directors own for an unfair price, thereby harming the original company and its shareholders. Fining the directors doesn't actually solve the problem - the assets have still been transferred to the other company, which is an ongoing harm to the company and/or shareholders - which is why the court has the ability to order the parties to effectively return things to the way they were before the improper action.\n\nIn this case, the general allegation is that because the pay package was not negotiated properly shareholders are harmed because they may not have gotten the best bang-for-the-buck they would have gotten after a proper negotiation. Even if you assume the harm is true, fining the board doesn't do anything to address this harm - shareholders still didn't get the best deal they would have gotten, and fining the board does nothing to compensate shareholders.\n\nThe court could technically have ordered Tesla to \"return the difference\" between a \"properly\" negotiated compensation plan and the plan that Elon got, but apparently there was no real way to identify exactly what that difference should have been, so the court defaulted to total rescission.\n\nKeep in mind *Tornetta v. Musk* was filed *three months* after the 2018 pay package was granted.

This is what actually happened.\n- The lawsuit is filed, and the court rules a few months later (i.e., *before* Tesla stock took off) that the compensation plan is invalid and must be rescinded. This doesn't seem unreasonable - courts like to *prevent* harm if warranted - and I think much of the opinion would be the same in this case. In particular, the process flaws would remain the same as they occurred before the compensation plan was approved. There may be some alterations to the price analysis, but I think a fair portion would remain the same.\n- The lawsuit is filed, the court does not rule before the grant expires (i.e., before 2028), and Elon fails to meet any of the milestones. I think the lawsuit might be dismissed as moot.\n\nSo in short, while the performance of Tesla's stock can hypothetically change the decision, that would require that the lawsuit to take ~10+ years to resolve which seems fairly unreasonable.

In this case, the board vote doesn't help Tesla since the board wasn't independent and the shareholder vote doesn't help since shareholders were not fully informed.\n\n> The idea that the board of directors is not independent is irrelevant in my opinion.\n\nLegally speaking, the independence of the board can affect two parts of the decision:\n\n- Whether Musk is considered a controller for the purposes of the transaction\n- Who has the burden of proof for showing the deal is (un)fair\n\nFor the first point, the board's lack of independence supported a finding that Musk is considered in control of Tesla for the purposes of the compensation plan. This makes board independence quite relevant because finding that Musk is a controller means that the \"entire fairness\" standard of review applies. If Musk were not a controller then it's possible the court would have decided that the \"business judgement\" standard of review would apply, under which courts generally do not second-guess company decisions without further extenuating circumstances.\n\nIn short, if the board were independent then the lawsuit could have been dismissed in a fairly straightforwards manner under the business judgment rule.\n\nFor the second point, the burden of proof for proving the deal is (un)fair rests on Tesla by default, unless they can shift the burden by either showing the board was independent or through a fully-informed shareholder vote. Here, board independence may matter depending on whether the shareholder vote is found to be fully-informed. If the vote is informed, then board independence does not matter. If the vote is uninformed, then board independence does matter.\n\n> Both individuals in question were added to the board in the span of 2004 and 2007.\n\nWhat two individuals are you thinking of? There are four members of the compensation committee and two other \"active\" board members (not counting Elon, Kimbal, and another director who apparently had extended leaves of absence during the time period).\n\nIn any case, when board members joined the board is not particularly relevant to the legal analysis. What matters is relationships (i.e., are the relationships close enough to risk clouding their judgement) and actions (did the board members act independently).\n\n> The judge should've just ruled to let the shareholder vote happen again.\n\nI'm not sure that's something Delaware courts *can* order. I think that conclusion is at least somewhat supported by the fact that it appears Tesla did not suggest such a remedy either (or if they did, it didn't warrant a mention in the decision).\n\nAnd even then, remember that the court is there to address problems.

They were developed in the ordinary course, approved by Musk and the Board, regularly updated, shared with investment banks and ratings agencies, and used by the Board to run Tesla.881 Several Tesla executives affirmed their quality, accuracy, and reliability.882 Plus, Tesla hit the first three milestones, **consistent with its projections**, by September 30, 2020.\n\nIn other words they projected all along they would hit the first 3 milestones by 2020 instead of it being some big surprise. They actually gave the second milestone **greater** than 70% change:\n\n>Ahuja characterized the probability assessment as an inherently “conservative approach” from an accounting perspective.472 Still, it is not clear how Tesla management reconciled their views that the milestones were both “risky” and a “stretch” yet simultaneously more than 70% likely to occur.\n\n>Regardless, management stuck to its guns. On April 3, Ahuja told his team that “to be consistent in our methodology of using the operating plan of record, we should assume that the **second EBITDA milestone has greater than 70%** chance of vesting by 6/30/2019.”473 And an Audit Committee presentation dated April 27, 2018 indicated that, based on the March 2018 Projections, Tesla considered the $20 billion revenue milestone and the $1.5 billion adjusted EBITDA milestone more than 70% likely by December 31, 2018, and the $3 billion adjusted EBITDA milestone more than 70% likely by March 31, 2019.474 On May 7, 2018, Tesla filed a Form 10-Q disclosing to stockholders that, as of March 31, 2018, three operational milestones “were considered probable of achievement\\[.\\]”475\n\nProbably also worth noting that they pair the probability with some date very often meaning that even if they didn't hit the milestone by that time they would still likely hit it later date although given they didn't elaborate how likely it would be hit after but probably safe to assume greater than supposed 70%.

What's unhealthy behavior is being so fanatical attached to a political party that you take offense when someone comes to you with criticisms, it doesn't matter if they're correct or not. Democracy is discussion, and being able to criticize our leaders is what makes us different from authoritarian regimes like Russia's and China's. Also, newsflash, if you're a democrat who claims climate change is going to kill billions of people, and you really really believe that, you should STILL be all in on Tesla no matter what because dislike of 1 person should always be secondary to the mission which is saving humanity. This is why I consider myself a true progressive and why I consider all those who have become anti-Tesla as just virtue-signalers who are not true environmentalists but fakes.

This is objective, not my opinion.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Oh I read your points. I literally quoted them to let you know exactly what I was responding to. \"I never even mention Tesla financials,\" sure, but then how come you think it'll go to $0...? Financials seem to be *extremely* important to that, so you can't really make any sort of argument about them going bankrupt (going to $0 is going bankrupt) at all without a very strong argument about why their financials will inevitably fail.\n\n1) did you see the quotes around \"Level 3\" and \"Level 2\"? It's sarcasm because while they're technically Level 3 and Level 2 systems, Mercedes doesn't actually have a level 3 system because of all the restrictions I just listed. Tesla doesn't really have only a Level 2 system given the wide range of situations it's capable of operating in. I use FSDv12 every day now in my model 3, with just cameras, and in my opinion Tesla has already reached Level 3. This current version of FSD is capable of literally going point A to point B without fail, I let it drive me 95% of the distance of most of my drives now, and the disengagements I've had are almost all preference-based (it is safe and capable, but is a little too cautious for my liking so I most of the time I disengage, I do it to speed things up a bit). This is very nearly robo-taxis level imo, and I'm saying this as someone who actively uses it and has tried previous versions.\n\n\"It’s impossible with camera only tech.  You can’t have autonomous taxis with level 2.  These are facts\"\n\nAnd how would you know what's possible or impossible? You clearly don't even know what SAE levels are. Tesla is only level 2 SAE because they haven't applied to be certified higher. If they apply and fail the tests, they will remain level 2. If they apply and pass the tests, they will be either level 3 (defined as \"fully self driving under certain conditions, but the driver must monitor and take over in certain conditions\") or level 4 (defined as \"fully self driving under all conditions, with driver control installation optional\").\n\nSAE level definitions:\nhttps://www.sae.org/blog/sae-j3016-update\n\nSo, no, not facts at all. 100% opinion. And in my opinion, as someone who's actually tried FSD, it is at least SAE level 3 and in many more conditions than Mercedes' system.\n\n2) He made Twitter posts... Yes he's CEO of the company but he can still have an opinion. Opinions are not facts, no matter where they come from. His was just a more informed opinion.\n\n3) I am on X, and I do follow him. And while I do not agree with him fully politically (I am historically a democrat voter), I prefer him to democratic leadership by a long shot. Democrats, while a better pick for government than Republicans imo, are disturbingly corrupt. Just look at what the DNC did to Bernie Sanders. He was supposed to be the presidential primary pick in 2016 but the scandal came out that the DNC literally conspired against Bernie for Hillary because the presidency was \"promised to her\". Elon didn't toe the party line, so the democrats started pulling strings in the media to ruin his reputation. They're the ones attacking, not Elon. I was there on Twitter the day he said he would vote Republican. The *very next day* there were a barrage of articles from (seemingly) unrelated news sources all spamming some \"scandal\" from 2016 (the alleged incident between Elon and a flight attendant). The timing was undeniable, and opened my eyes to the fact that Democrats actually have a lot of control over media sources that we trust, and when Republicans say \"lies by omission\" there is a lot of truth to that. I've watched the media over the last 2 years report only the bad for Elon and none of the good. Inspiration 4, donations of starlink to ukraine (somehow turned bad btw, despite that literally saving the country lmao), sending aid to Hawaii after the Hawaii fires, SpaceX successes, Tesla successes, Hawaii coal free thanks to Tesla Megapacks, etc. etc. All either outright not reported on or very slightly reported on. Only the negatives get amplified. That's the source of this negativity, and a quick fact check will show that 99% of it (the emerald mine, the glass house, the drugs, etc.) are just plain and simply not true.\n\nSo while I don't agree with Elon supporting Republicans over Democrats, I completely understand it. If the democrats were doing such an intense slander campaign against me, I wouldn't vote for them either. Why would I vote for people actively trying to ruin me and my life's work?\n\nAnd also, none of this changes the fact that I'm first and foremost an environmentalist. And since Tesla is the greatest environmental organization in the world right now, based on their track record, I would choose them over Democrats any day regardless of if corruption allegations are true or false.\n\n4) You didn't but you also didn't seem to indicate anything about how *to* sell to conservatives. Elon is making an effort to sell to conservatives as well. As an environmentalist, I fully support this. And btw you keep saying \"why are you bringing ___ up??? I didn't say that\". I'm bringing these things up because they're relevant. You didn't say them, I did. Obviously.\n\n5) um, my guy, you *DID* say Elon's net worth would be brought to $0 by Tesla going down. That is stupid. Yes I think I misread what you said because you mentioned Tesla margin call immediately before saying Elon's net worth would go to $0. So I assumed that you meant Tesla would go to $0 because that's the only connection that would seem to make sense there. But now it's clear you were saying that Tesla would not go to $0 but Elon would, which is nonsensical but I see what you actually meant now. Let me now respond to this:\n\nThat's stupid. How the fuck would Elon's net worth go to $0 if Tesla and all his companies still exist? Wtf?\n\n6) No, that's just your opinion. What are your qualifications? Are you an engineer? Why can't just cameras and a computer get to level 3? We as humans can drive with just our eyes, so why couldn't a computer? I genuinely don't understand how you can't separate that \"I think Tesla vision won't reach level 3\" is an opinion. Tesla has hundreds of engineers, who are the real subject matter experts, who would disagree with you there too. This is some \"vaccines cause autism and that's a fact\" level shit. If you respond to this please tell me exactly what your reasons are that Tesla FSD can't reach SAE level 3 with only cameras. Be as detailed as possible. No, \"its a fact because it's a fact\" is not an acceptable answer.\n\nAnd again, I use the FSDv12 and it only has cameras. It's arguably level 3 right now in my experience. It can drive me wherever I want very successfully. How is that not level 3? Go watch some footage of FSDv12 then get back to me, there's tons on YouTube.\n\nAlso, the Mercedes example is not anecdotal. FSD is superior to mercedes' \"Level 3\" system. That's a fact. I don't give a shit that I could, under very specific circumstances, fall asleep for 2 seconds (because that's about how long those conditions last in practice, and only on specific roads). I care only about driving my car from point A to point B.\n\n(Random FSDv12 video:)\nhttps://youtu.be/4fNvSxEg0Es?si=dz-fXf9_-xeQdewG\n\n(Random Mercedes video:)\nhttps://youtu.be/sNhVHZ6T9k8?si=YuUV-twPfl94UQUD\n\nWhich looks better to you?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I’m not reading this whole thing because you are still not reading my point.

{"title": "Elon Musk’s succession at Tesla, who might be next?", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\nIn the past months I have been collecting several articles around the subject in the title.\n\nElon Musk has always identified with Tesla, and Tesla has always been identified with Musk. But  given the train wreck performance of the business (not discussing here the share price, but just the real numbers and figures of the car business), it might be nice to discuss the topic here:\n\n- Elon was the one deciding for 2.5 million production capacity, and so far its factories are being utilised at 60-70% capacity, with this number going down after the recent layoffs\n- this huge production overcapacity forced the hand of the pricing strategy, and after cutting prices globally for more than 15 months, Q1-2024 was the first big quarter of negative growth. Q2-2024 will have negative growth too (bookmakers are much better than the market, for Q2-2024 they are at 392k vs 480k from Wall Street; last Q2 Tesla sold 466k!)\n- prices have been lowered again in the 🇺🇸, confusing even the stronger supporters of Elon\n- AI investments have been more words than facts, and many executives from the Tesla chip department left in the recent months https://electrek.co/2023/12/07/tesla-head-dojo-supercomputer-out-over-issues-next-gen/\n- China is the big profit center of Tesla, and in the most recent layoffs they have been firing much more workers there. If China dies, Tesla profits simply evaporates (here a link to a Chinese news https://www.eet-china.com/mp/a307257.html where it is said that GigaShanghai will cut production by 30%, with the decision that is really affecting many suppliers in the area since Tesla is their largest customer; Aside from that, Tesla China also cutting personnel in many dept by 30-40%. All Tesla stores seeing cuts)\n\nZhu in November 2022\nThe first one talking about Musk succession was the board member of Tesla, James Murdoch, in November 2022. When the stock was spiralling down and the name of Zhou came out, please note he is the number Two at Tesla https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-china-boss-zhu-promoted-global-role-company-posting-2023-01-03/\n\nHere a general article on who Zhu is https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/02/26/tesla-tom-zhu/\n\nThe CFO in May 2023\nThe name of the then CFO was made in May 2023 on a newspaper (WSJ) controlled by the family of James Murdoch https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-executive-elon-musk-cfo-zach-kirkhorn-b1998ae7\n\nBoth the times the stock recovered and nothing happened to Elon. But note that the CFO was fired/resigned in August 2023, replaced by the Chief of Accounting (that is a red flag)\n\nSince then, Elon was accused twice by the WSJ (newspaper of Murdoch) of being a drug addict \n- January 2024 https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1\n- February 2024 https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-tesla-money-drugs-board-61af9ac4 in this second one it is said that some Tesla BoD felt forced in consuming drugs with him/did not like this addiction of his, and resigned from the role for that reason\n\nOf course Elon is a free man and he can do what he wants. But these two articles force us to ask several questions:\n- why Elon/tesla did not sue the newspapers if the info were false?\n- is then the drug addiction somehow related to the erratic pricing strategy and relentless sequence of extreme promises he has made so far ?\n- what if some shareholders sue the BoD for lack of oversight asking to be refunded from their losses ? \n- does he really deserves a bonus if the BOD has never been independent ?\n\nSeveral articles against Elon are questioning his leadership:\n- Tesla chair under scrutiny for her oversight on Musk https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/teslas-board-elon-musk-robyn-denholm.html\n- does Tesla have an Elon Musk problem? https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/hack/103671570\n- ‘At what point do you decide Tesla is bigger than Musk?’ The time may be right for Elon Musk to step down as CEO, suggest experts  \nhttps://fortune.com/2024/02/03/elon-musk-tesla-ceo-board-directors-corporate-governance/\n\nWhat do you think? 🤔 \n", "id": "1c8v6o1", "created_utc": 1713633446.0, "score": 464, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 475, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 9 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 284 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nthp3b/dd_rng_potential_if_compared_with_hydrogen_bevs/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvgvpc/clean_energy_for_america_act_to_favor_net_zero/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsbfm1/biomethane_renewable_natural_gas_why_it_deserves/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o69314/rng_from_the_usa_weekly_update_renewable_natural/) \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tesla has already lost China.

They at 1b now. They need to get to 6b by the time Robotaxi is built. Giving people cheap FSD is how you do it.

You'll see people not buy a car and rely on robotaxis. addressable market is big, but it's not about selling the car, it's the recurring revenue. Get 5M robotaxis on the road and have all of them making money for you, every single mile driven. \n\nAlso don't forget about people who own non-robotaxi Teslas who will pay for FSD so they can sleep/work/etc while driving. \n\nSay what you want about feasibility, but fully solved FSD is worth more than than any company in existence. You can take some conservative numbers, like $.15/mile profit, 5M vehicles (worldwide), 300 miles per day. You're talking about something in the range of $75b per year, profit. 30 P/E, that's $2T+. \n\nAnyone who thinks FSD is baked into the price of TSLA is a bonafide idiot.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Who would administrate these, in your view?\n\nHard to know. It really depends on Tesla and how much responsibility they want to take in the process. If I was Tesla I would operate the fleet myself, no middle men. Use that $30b cash stockpile up completely, and then take some loans if you need more money. \n\nPotentially in the beginning they might want to outsource some of this work, but I think since it would take time to ramp up production, they can ramp up a robotaxi operating service. \n\nTo operate robotaxis you'll need a few things as a fleet manager. Regular detailing/cleaning/damage claims. People at superchargers to charge/clean/inspect the cars. Some sort of app similar to Uber. IMO this is the only value Uber has, and I don't see why Tesla can't make the app themselves and integrate it with their existing software suite. \n\nTesla could opt to outsource some of this work. I don't think it is necessary. I don't think they will need the cash, and even if they need some cash, loans will be easy to come by since they have no debt. It could be Tesla sells the cars to fleet operators, and maybe Uber, maybe even car rental agencies that will in turn start operating robo taxis, even though such a thing is not really their business. The problem with going to someone like Uber, is that none of theses companies have a full solution. Uber only has $5b in cash. Tesla has 6x that. \n\nIt's hard to say how much Tesla wants to deal with the whole process. We're kind of guessing here, but their cash stockpile and little debt means they can really do the whole thing if they wanted to, and I think that's the way to go. Don't let individuals or fleet operators buy Robotaxis. Keep all to yourself, pocket all the profit of operating the robotaxi. \n\n> Everyone taking taxis every day, electric or not is still a worse environmental outcome compared to public transit use, and governments will push in that direction.\n\nOver time, more and more of the grid comes from renewable resources. Wind, solar, nuclear. And public transport in general is more efficient, but oftentimes is not even remotely efficient. Think about a giant train stopping every 1/3rd mile, when the train is 90% empty. AKA non rush hour. \n\n> Not to mention how many people already use public transit successfully\n\nHave you not seen how many people drive in the US on a daily basis? Only 2.5% of workers in the US travel using public transportation. Your comment is wildly off here.\n\nPublic transit is not a substitute for this. Public transit is only efficient in dense populations. It's also insanely expensive to build, and maintain. The US isn't Europe. We don't have their density, nor their strong desire for trains everywhere.

Once QE is considered, the probability of a recession in 2024 is less than 20 percent, much lower than the estimate based only on the term spread and more consistent with the recent robust real GDP growth.**", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You bears are dumb idiots\n\nIts very clear when a crash comes, but you dumb people will keep looking for signs\n\nShit signs like Crude, DXY, Yield curve\n\nI would suggest you to insert all those into your ass\n\nI know when the crash will come and it aint in next 2 years kiddo", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Everyone dumping a sector can also trigger a crash, with none of those indicators firing in advance", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'm not so good at counting.

It is a reactive metric. The Fed hiked rates at the sharpest speed ever in 2022. They went from zero to 5%+ in a year. Meanwhile, it's clear the Fed sees the long term sweet spot on rates to be somewhere around 3%. It's clear because they continuously show rates moving there on dot plots whenever inflation seems to be moving in the right direction.\n\nRates are really just a reflection of inflation. Inflation is what the Fed is tracking when setting rate policy. The market is forecasting that inflation will go down. The other possible reason for rates dropping is that the economy goes to shit. But if the market was anticipating that scenario, we wouldn't be at ATH's on the S&P500. So that is seen as a low probability risk.\n\nNow, the fact that the yield curve has been inverted for so long does show us something. It shows us that inflation has been stickier than expected. The longer this remains true, the more damage we could see from elevated short term rates. There's no doubt we'd be in a much better situation right now if inflation was below 3% and continuing a downward trend.\n\nI'm not sure the other data points on your graph really have much in common with our current scenario. 2008 wasn't an inflation / rates story. 2008 was a de-leveraging event. Loans were built on top of shitty collateral (overpriced real estate) which started a chain reaction. 1974 was a little more similar, since it was an inflation issue. That being said, the inflation rate was 11% in 1974. That rate stayed highly elevated for years to come.\n\n1929 is a whole other can of worms. Nearly 100 years ago. Markets not comparable to today. I don't think we have much in common with that era. \n\nToday is a whole new ball game. The bank failures of 2023 seem unlikely to repeat. They resulted from the sharp interest rate hikes, crippling the value of long term bonds. But those bonds have since stabilized, and the price impact of interest rates going forward on those bonds should be comparatively insignificant.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
