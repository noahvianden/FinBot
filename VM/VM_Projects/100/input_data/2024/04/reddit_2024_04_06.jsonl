But if U fall for his high-tech hokum that's on U...\n\n**Running a successful auto manufacturing company is much more difficult than it appears**\n\nThe first automobile to be mass-produced in the United States was the Ford Model T. The Model T entered production on October 1, 1907, and the first Model T was sold to a client in 1908. But it wasn’t until 1913 that the car became produced en masse, and the first mass-produced cars rolled out of the production plant in October of 1913.\n\nThe Highland Park Ford Plant in Highland Park, Michigan, was the first factory to mass-produce Model T’s. Once Ford’s assembly line was established in 1913, an entire Model T could be fully assembled in 90 minutes, with a new car rolling off the line every half minute. This method proved highly effective. Because of the money saved by this efficient method, the Model T could be sold at a price that most American families could afford.\n\nIn 1929, the number of U.S. car companies was 98, which gives a good indication of the scale of the automobile industry during that era. The three prominent automobile companies during the 1920s were Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler. These companies emerged as the “Big Three” auto companies during the 1920s.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, the American automobile industry had consolidated significantly, with only 5 US auto manufactures remaining in business. The industry had reshaped itself into the “Big Three”, General Motors (GM), Ford, and Chrysler, along with Studebaker and American Motors Corporation (AMC). The age of small independent automakers was nearly over, as most of them either consolidated or went out of business.\n\nThe fate of the other U.S. car companies varied greatly, but many of them faced common challenges that led to their decline or disappearance. Some are bought out or merged with other companies. Others may have decided to exit the market due to poor sales or a strategic shift in business focus. Many companies foundered because of mismanagement, overexpansion, misjudgment of public taste, and underestimating supply chain costs. Indeed, many of the other U.S. car companies did go bankrupt. Bankruptcy is a common fate for car companies due to the challenges of the industry, such as high capital and research costs, intense competition, and changing consumer preferences. Nevertheless, the Big Three dominated the US auto industry, claiming 94 percent of all automobile sales in by 1959.\n\nBankruptcy is a constant threat for car companies even to this day. Running a successful automobile manufacturing company is indeed a complex task due to a variety of factors, including globalization. Increased global competition means lower market prices (little or no pricing power) for many vehicles. One solution for this increased global competition calls for increased efficiency in order to offset a lower margin of profit, which is often easier said than done.\n\nEven so, the harbinger of bankruptcy still persists for automakers. For instance, General Motors and Chrysler were both on the path to bankruptcy in 2009 and were bailed out by the U.S. government. Economic downturns, trade policies, and other macroeconomic factors can have a significant impact on auto sales. This U.S. government bailout of General Motors and Chrysler saved hundreds of thousands of jobs and likely prevented the Great Recession from becoming a depression. As of today, Tesla and Ford are the only two carmakers in the U.S. which have not gone bankrupt.\n\n \\*\n\n**The CEO of Hertz rent a car recently resigned because he believed the Tesla EV hype**\n\nStephen Scherr, the CEO of Hertz, resigned following a series of events related to the company’s investment in Tesla electric vehicles (EVs). Here’s a brief summary:\n\nHertz announced plans to transform its car rental business by purchasing 100,000 Tesla EVs. The announcement of the Tesla purchase sent Tesla’s market value soaring to a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nHowever, Tesla drastically cut prices of its Model 3 and Model Y EVs, which reduced their resale values. Hertz also found that Tesla’s vehicles were expensive to repair and unpopular with renters.\n\nAs a result, Hertz started selling off about a third of its EV fleet, which was around 20,000 vehicles. This resulted in a $245 million charge for Hertz and its largest quarterly loss since the pandemic. Following these events, Scherr stepped down.\n\nThis series of events highlights the challenges and risks associated with transitioning to electric vehicles in the rental car industry.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Elon musk personally led the spacex team overseeing the lidar for docking to the space station.

Well, 1:1, or at least, one robotaxi per riding group. This is the same as full car ownership.\n\nSo that’s unlikely to happen, because then you have millions of robotaxis idle for most of the day. So instead you have partial robotaxi rollout. Even today, you’re going to wait some time for your Uber or Lyft to arrive, but riders are now competing for access on a scale many times larger. How do we reduce wait times without increasing the supply of robotaxis? Well, the only remaining option is for people to share rides at a discount.\n\nAnd finally, we get to where we should have fucking started, because **we just invented public transport.**\n\nI want to make it clear that the “one robotaxi per person” idea isn’t a strawman I’m killing here, and unmanned taxis are - ideally - less inefficient than manned ones.

And if you think about it, they may even increase the total amount of money individuals dedicate to vehicle ownership if individuals are allowed to purchase autonomous cars.\n\nNow if you can’t afford to own, or you’re unable to. then, you can choose between public transportation or an inexpensive robotaxi service.

Why would anyone want to have to put down the phone and pay attention to the road the whole time?\n\nNonetheless, the question is about ownership vs ride service. And if parents give a teenager the choice between using a robotaxi service or getting to use the self-driving car bought by their parents, I think the rational choice is obvious.

But FSD v12 is impressing people and so true autonomy is just around the corner, and since production of the next gen vehicle will be limited volume early as things take time to ramp so it’s better to have those few vehicles be awe-inspiring steering wheeless robotaxis rather than a $25k subcompact that’s the new Toyota Corolla/VW Golf etc\n\nFSD as is will most likely hit a local maxima requiring either better hardware and/or rearchitecture to get to true FSD. But the current V12 approach is a dang good “supervised FSD.”\n\nAll this is to say, Elon will end up having to change his mind and actually make an affordable car in the near term. True broadly rolled out mass produced robotaxis are still far away.\n\nAnyways all of this speculation about Tesla being a robotaxi company owning and operating a giant fleet of vehicles seems a bit misguided. Providing mass market transportation services has always been a bit of a commodity, is capital intensive, and has generally been low margin unless one has a monopoly or is protected by regulations (e.g. airlines, taxis, rideshare, scootershare, bikeshare, car rentals, turo, buses, subways, etc). \n\nThe real money to be made is not in operating a taxi service where you own all the hardware, but in selling expensive pieces of hardware (i.e. an autonomous vehicle) to consumers and businesses…hardware that can do something their current equipment cannot, and charging them subscription fees or other service fees, and charging third-party app developers fees to develop apps for this hardware. This is the business model that has made Apple the most profitable company in the world.\n\nSo yes if Tesla can make a truly autonomous vehicle by 2025 then it will not need to make a $25k human driven car. And it will not operate a robotaxi service. But it will sell a lot of these autonomous vehicles for a lot more than $25k and it’ll also make a lot of profit via service fees.\n\nCan Tesla license FSD to other automakers? \nSure if those automakers design their cars around Tesla’s hardware. Most likely they would try to develop their own FSD or partner with a third-party provider such as Mobileye.\n\nIs the B-pillar camera inadequate?\nHaving used FSD v12 yes it is inadequate. For unsupervised FSD, Tesla will ultimately need a camera that is located more forward than the b pillar.

There was an adversarial relationship between workers and plant supervisors, with management not considering the employees' view on production, and quantity was preferred over quality.[8][9][10] Like all American car plants, the production lines at Fremont seldom stopped, and when mistakes were made, cars continued down the line with the expectation that they would be fixed later.[8] By the early 1980s, the adversarial relationship had deteriorated to the point where employees drank alcohol, smoked marijuana (at the time, an illegal activity), were frequently absent (enough so that the production line could not be started), and even committed petty acts of sabotage such as putting \"Coke bottles inside the door panels, so they'd rattle and annoy the customer.\"[7][8]\n>Attempts to discipline workers were often met with grievances or even strikes, putting the plant into near-continuous chaos.

It’s not necessarily a new thing but the market is still confirming it is expected.  If there was any lack of conviction, the spread would be decreasing and the inversion reversing.\n\nBasically the bond market is creating a Mexican standoff with the Fed.  If the Fed decides it does not want to cut, the rate spread would decrease, if not inverse again, which would potentially cause another run at the regional banks (as they would have to take writedowns on existing 10 yr bonds due to the lower yields they would be holding as new bonds would be higher), and mortgage rates would shoot up another 1% which would in turn raise PCE pushing the Fed further away from their goal.\n\nPowell’s best move now is to keep applying rhetoric to control the markets while trying to build consensus.  So Kashkari can say whatever he wants - he’s not even voting this year, Powell has been toeing the line by explicitly repeating now that he expects cuts this year.  The market doesn’t care when, so long as it happens at some point.  If it doesn’t happen in June, the bond market may start to lose its conviction though.  Because the bond market has it priced in, the actual Fed rate doesn’t matter as much as the 10 yr benchmark rate is already down 1%.  Cutting the Fed rate won’t really move that much.  The first cut is purely symbolic from a rate perspective.\n\nThe only thing worse than getting bitched at for making cuts at during the last 90 days of an election year is causing a bank run at that same time.  The Fed is aware of unemployment, they know what the market has priced in, and Powell knows he can’t will the market to think any differently.  Goolsbee is on board, Mester is on board, Bostic I don’t think is far behind, Bowman is a lost cause (she didn’t even mention the second half of the Fed’s mandate - unemployment - when she ran her mouth), and Williams will come around when he gets bitched out by Dimon.  At this point Dimon I doubt wants or needs another gift from the Feds to absorb another bank.  Barkin is aware of the unemployment side though his view is hawkish - he is at least aware.  If his thesis is wrong, he’s an easy flip.

June is still on the table and most reasonable to do 25bp still since it won’t really change anything - the market has it priced in the bond market.\n\nIf they don’t cut it in June, they will need to come out and explicitly call out the cut otherwise it could be a bloodbath.  The most logical times then are in Sept and December still.  The market will need some assurance it is actually coming and Powell will have the cajones to do it during an election cycle.\n\nThe problem then becomes the depth of the cut.  If they don’t do June, they could basically destroy the summer home buying season which would mean a 50bp cut right off the bat, which wouldn’t be the best thing in the world.  Instead of small cuts, they’ll be making larger ones to try to keep the market from a complete stumble.  This will probably be the biggest argument for the June cut. 25bp in June is positive but not a news maker - it’s maintenance. 50bp in Sept/December means the Fed fell asleep at the wheel and is trying to prevent a recession (which ironically has a 50/50 chance in 2025 since the Fed tends to be late to the party - so to a point the market does expect them to screw this up).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If anything, it would have to be after the election. I wouldn't wager on Powell doing anything before then. Also, if inflation data and jobs numbers keep coming in hot, wouldn't that eliminate hopes of a cut? Wouldn't hikes then be more likely if we make it to election day with data coming in stronger and stronger?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Not necessarily. The stubbornness of PCE is coming from housing and housing equivalents.  Those won’t go anywhere until mortgage rates come down.  That’s the biggest part the Fed is concerned about.  Volatiles like energy hurt the number but those aren’t as big of a concern as the core PCE values and they’ve been targeting housing specially now for months and it’s been a tough nut to crack.\n\nThe other problem is by end of 2024 the CRE loan issue goes in to full swing. They’ll need to trim rates to keep the banks propped up to avoid every Regional from becoming insolvent as the losses stack up.  A run on the stocks is just as bad if not worse than an actual bank run.\n\nThe hot jobs number is not as hot when you look at the data closely. Two things have happened - 1) Older people have left and aren’t coming back so no longer count as they aren’t participating and 2) Full time employment went down while part time employment went up.  These two things make a hot jobs top line number not as hot and the Fed can read the nuance of that pretty well.  Legal immigration has kept jobs filled, but main street is beginning to buckle - the Black unemployment data is somewhat eye catching.\n\nAn increase at this point would be suicide as it would cause a regional bank run with the CRE loan issue right around the corner.  Housing is unaffordable as is and a rate increase actually makes it worse.  The Fed’s mandate is dual - it’s inflation AND employment.  Powell has said he wants to see a downward trend and other Fed Govs have said they could live with inflation above 2%.  That’s really the long term reality.  The other Central Banks are going to start cutting. If the Fed only focuses on the 2% number, they would need 10% unemployment for a full year to get it - and that’s not really possible.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "It doesn't matter what these people say.
