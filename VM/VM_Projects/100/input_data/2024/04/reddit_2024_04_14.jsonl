I'll go over some of the points that people are not considering/misunderstanding in the following text.\n\n\"They've been doing this for years and it's still nothing more than advanced cruise control.\" This misses a huge detail. FSD V12 is fundamentally a different architecture from all previous versions. V11 had 300k + C programming, V12 has removed all of this, shifting the approach to an end-to-end solution. This has always been the endpoint; end-to-end is scalable and easily trained, it learns by itself instead of being programmed by limited humans. Tesla is one of the biggest customers of NVIDIA's GPUs, Elon Musk tweeted a month ago (see image attached) that compute is no longer a bottleneck. You could claim Elon is just lying but the proof is in the pudding. FSD V12 has been having a steady and fast update release schedule. We are now in V12.3.4 after several updates. The fact that the software shifted to fully self-learning AI means now you just need two things: data (good diversity, non-simulated, and proprietary data) and compute. Compute doesn't seem to be a current bottleneck so let's see how the data is looking.\n\nTake a look at the image attached showing miles driven while using FSD. Data that falls under this category is important as interventions are one of the most important data types; it allows you to see the difference between what the software would've done and where the human disagrees. It's straightforward to see why this is invaluable. As you can see, this graph represents an obvious exponential growth, and it isn't slowing down in the upcoming months. Half the eligible fleet (US and Canada) still hasn't got/downloaded the free month trial. Subscription cost just lowered to $99 a month from $200. People on Twitter are overwhelmingly impressed and shocked at the quality. Whoever has the software, I ask you to give it a test drive again if you weren't impressed at first and you'll be shocked.\n\nThis amount of data coupled with the compute Tesla has, gives the company a SIGNIFICANT advantage in the pursuit of creating a generalized driving solution that is scalable. Tesla has 6 million+ vehicles collecting millions of frames of data a day. No one else has this much access to real-world relevant data, no one. Rivalling Tesla on compute is also extremely expensive, and without the data to train it, it makes no financial sense.\n\nDon't sleep on Tesla, I've never seen such a mismatch of sentiment vs technology in my life.\n\n  \nPS edited. changed 6 billion to 6 million, initial mistake was just a typo\n\n\n\n", "id": "1c3seta", "created_utc": 1713097582.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.25, "num_comments": 313, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "They have been on this cusp for the last 7 years.

The thing is, people's perception of a company is based mostly on the stock price. Have a read at the overwhelmingly positive comments regarding META lately and compare that to this time 2 years ago. Same thing with AAPL, pick any post during the last 2 years and you'll see that it's overwhelmingly positive. Now? Suddenly they're not innovative and have no growth prospects (aside from $3500 VR lol), as if this hasn't been the case for the last decade or so.\n\nSo right now, everyone thinks TSLA is a dumpster fire and they're ignoring belatedly obvious things like this. Yes, Elon is notoriously bad at estimating timelines but generally he does deliver because he has the vision. \n\nAnd the thing is, people don't notice until it's too late. Just like with the Model 3 ramp and Shanghai Gigafactory opening, people didn't catch on to the volume TSLA was planning on delivering until after the stock had 5x'd.\n\nRegarding FSD, TSLA has set the foundation in place since 2018 when they made Autopilot free for everyone so that they collect data to train their LLM. The first 80% can be trained relatively quickly but the last 20% becomes exponentially more difficult. Elon underestimated how long this 20% would take but here we are, 4 years late but as OP is suggesting, at the cusp of solving automated driving.\n\nThis is similar to when ChatGPT was released to the public and everyone freaked out at how good AI had become. The difference here is that TSLA's source code is not open sourced, so they have no competitors. Waymo? Yeah, great performance in geofenced locations but no scalability. Not to mention GOOGL as a company having no vision and having execution issues during the last decade. 50 million miles of data vs TSLA's 1 billion miles. And this is before the FSD trial that will make the next billion achievable in ~60ish days. Elon suggested that 6 billion miles is needed and we are actually close to achieving this when considering that growth is exponential. It's no coincidence that TSLA pivoted to prioritising the robotaxi, because by the time it's released, it might have reached the 6 billion miles target.\n\nIt's ironic how companies that mention AI see their stock price jump despite saying the word just for hype. Yet people are oblivious to practical applications such as automated driving. I know FSD has become a meme but the fundamentals were always there; it was simply a matter of timing.

The turnaround story is now a stunning comeback and revenue growth story. The estimate was 154m in revenues and BB delivered an impressive 173m  with 25% growth year over year in the IoT segment. BB is well positioned in high growth sectors with limitless opportunity especially in automotive which saw huge momentum in 2023 for example global car sales numbers were up 28% in China, the world largest car market hit 30 million cars. UK sales numbers were up 18% and the Philippines and India broke records with India reaching 4 million cars sold for the 1st time in hitory. In the US market Feb alone car sales numbers were up by a whopping 9.6% over last year same month and Ford EV traction and GM both were at record high. BB stand to benefit tremendously from automotive sector momentum particularly in China since they have brilliantly created strong strategic partnerships with top EV makers including BYD which surpassed Tesla recently as the number one EV seller in the world. Another key BB EV maker partner is Xiaomi, they launched an electric car SU7 with preorders started at 10:00pm China time. A surprise firm 30,000 orders recorded in 27 minutes.
