It’s that beating the index over longer horizons is nearly impossible and almost entirely due to luck. \n\nConsider a game where you flip a coin. If it lands on Tails, you win. You flip it, its tails, you win, yay!  Are you good at flipping a coin?  No, it was only one trial. Repeat the experiment 9 more times. Did you get more than five tails?  Maybe. Maybe not. Repeat 990 more times. Are you pretty close to 500 tails?  Again, maybe. Bump those numbers up to 10,000 trials etc. \n\nWith stocks, it is similar. Outperforming the index for a couple of years is fairly easy. But it is probably due to luck and not skill. In the longer run, people who outperform *think* they are skilled, but they might just be lucky. Imagine if March Madness games were decided by flipping a coin. There has to be an eventual winner but that doesn’t mean they’re good at basketball, it just means their coin came up Tails the most. \n\nTechnically, if all we are looking to do is outperform the index, it’s easy to do in the long run too actually. But that’s because expected reward is commensurate with risk, so if I take more risk, I am more likely to outperform the index in a straight up comparison. What we need is a risk adjusted metric so we have an apples to apples comparison. For example, shares of TSLA face a different set of risks than shares of K. So we need to balance that somehow. \n\nWhen we look at risk adjusted performance, almost no one beats the market index over longer time horizons. Something like 90%+ of active equity  portfolio managers are outperformed by their benchmarks over a decade. And the 10% that do win are both hard to identify ex ante and we can’t really say it isn’t luck. After all, if we had 10,000 people do the coin experiment 10,000 times, some one is bound to have the highest number of Tails. Are they good at flipping a coin, or just lucky?\n\nBeyond that, bundles of stocks are generally viewed as smarter investments than individual stocks due to the movement in price of individuals vs groups. Because stocks have different risks, they don’t all move in tandem. So combinations of stocks can actually have lesser variance than individual stocks. In fact, a combination of the right stocks can have a lower overall variance in price (which we use as a risk measure) than either individual stock does. When stock A goes down, maybe stock B goes up and vice versa, so the combo has lower variance (due to negative covariance).  \n\nWhen you buy and individual stock, you face all of the firm specific risk (e.g. lawsuits, bad management choices) as well as overall market risk. If you spread your money out over a lot of stocks, your exposure to that firm specific risk gets really small (to the point where it’s not really significant) and you only face market risk. \n\nSo the extra risk faced by owning individual stocks combined with the fact that it almost never comes with additional risk-adjusted returns to make it so owning individual stocks is not optimal from a purely financial point of view.  Since it has similar flavors to gambling, people still do it for two reasons:  1. It gives a thrill and 2.

You're betting on an incompetent horse in this race, one that's propping up its financials by cutting costs everywhere, including R&D, so they can pay their CEO twice what most S&P CEO's make, and the end result is embarassingly bad. $.53/share per *YEAR*?

I can admit Intel's faults, where you seem to think AMD shits gold nuggets even though its nearly failed more times than about any other company thats still afloat. I didn't invest in Intel until last August when I saw the turnaround plan is actually coming to fruition. Yes they stagnated and struggled because they did exactly what AMD is doing right now, cutting R&D to prop up the financials. In doing so, they lost their dominant position, just as AMD will lose any advantage that it has because they refuse to invest more into R&D in order to gain any market share in their segments. But in order to do that, theyd have to stop paying their CEO double what the vast majority of CEO's are making and actually start bringing in money. Their dGPU market share is a joke for as long as they've been in the game, their server market share is a third of Intel's, and their consumer CPU segment? They hold 20% market share... That's literally it. You shit on Intel at every opportunity, yet Intel is outselling AMD 5 to 1 on CPU's and bringing in massively more revenue, even with all the overhead of their fabs. Intel has dropped 30 billion on fabs in the last 2 years, and still their financials look better than AMD's.

{"title": "Netflix blows past earnings estimates as subscribers jump 16%", "selftext": "Netflix\n will no longer provide quarterly membership numbers or average revenue per user starting next year, the company said Thursday as it reported earnings that beat on the top and bottom line.\n\nTotal memberships rose 16% in the quarter, reaching 269.6 million, well above the 264.2 million Wall Street had expected. However, this quarter will be one of the last glimpses investors get of the company’s subscriber base going forward.\n\n“As we’ve noted in previous letters, we’re focused on revenue and operating margin as our primary financial metrics — and engagement (i.e. time spent) as our best proxy for customer satisfaction,” the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders. “In our early days, when we had little revenue or profit, membership growth was a strong indicator of our future potential.”\n\nNetflix said now that it is generating substantial profit and free cash flow — as well as developing new revenue streams like advertising and a password sharing crackdown — its membership numbers are not the only factor in the company’s growth. It said the metric lost significance after it started to offer multiple price points for memberships.\n\nThe company said it would still announce “major subscriber milestones as we cross them.”\n\nNetflix also noted that it expects paid net additions to be lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter “due to typical seasonality.”\n\nShares of the company fell around 3% in extended trading.\n\nHere are the results:\n\nEarnings per share: $5.28 vs. $4.52 expected by LSEG\n\nRevenue: $9.37 billion vs. $9.28 billion expected by LSEG\n\nTotal memberships: 269.6 million vs. 264.2 million expected, according to Street Account\n\nNetflix reported first-quarter net income of $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, versus $1.30 billion, or $2.88 per share, in the prior-year period.\n\nThe company posted revenue of $9.37 billion for the quarter, up from $8.16 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe streaming company is navigating its transformation from targeting subscriber growth to focusing on profit, as it uses price hikes, a crackdown on password sharing and an ad-supported tier to boost revenue. Investors are looking for signs that these efforts are still boosting Netflix and seeking more details about the company’s foray into video games.\n\nNetflix could also provide more insight into its partnership with TKO Group Holdings\n to bring WWE to the platform. The company has teased that it would like to expand its live sports offerings.\n\n“Today, our share of TV viewing is less than 10% in every country,” Netflix wrote. “So we have plenty of room to add value for our members and grow our share of viewing by broadening our slate, including with live events (comedy, sports, competition shows, music).”\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the company’s stock was up 27% year to date and around 85% over the last 12 months.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/18/netflix-nflx-earnings-q1-2024.html", "id": "1c7e421", "created_utc": 1713473119.0, "score": 1148, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 278, "comments": [{"body": "Bastards betrayed me!

There's a lot of code involved, they're obviously still writing code, but they have shifted from a traditional programming approach to a fully machine learning-based system.\n\n\nIn traditional programming, like with C++, software developers write specific rules and logic to handle various scenarios, which in the case of autonomous driving, would include object recognition, decision making, and vehicle control based on explicit programming. This method requires anticipating and coding for a wide range of potential driving situations, which can be complex and not always sufficient for the unpredictability of real-world driving.\n\n\nAn end-to-end neural network, in contrast, processes input data directly (filtered video feeds) and outputs driving decisions without intermediate steps that explicitly break down the task. This means the network learns to map raw sensory inputs directly to steering, acceleration, and braking commands. The neural network is trained on large amounts of driving data, learning to handle a wide array of driving scenarios based on this data rather than on hand-coded rules. This allows the system to make decisions based on learned experiences, similar to how a human driver might operate.\n\n\nUsing an end-to-end neural network means relying entirely on machine learning models to handle all aspects of driving, suggesting that the software operates based on what the AI has learned and inferred about driving, rather than following a predefined set of rules written by Tesla developers. \n\n\nSo, instead of writing code to explicitly handle every conceivable scenario when facing a traffic cop directing traffic, you simply teach the system by feeding it tons of footage of good interactions with traffic cops and boom now it has a mathematical model that should give you a driving experience that is as safe as the average of all the training footage.

They have a library that is very valuable if it is exploited properly and when they eventually sell or merge the debt they accumulated will be paid off.

Been in TV development, and distribution for 20 years as first at a major Hollywood agency, then at distributor, and as a scripted content producer with shows at linear and streaming services — so I speak with some knowledge about their issues. Not to mention several close friends who work or worked at the company itself with internal knowledge. Since they started we all marveled at what the business model actually was, and this has finally been laid bare for all of Hollywood to wonder. Yes they can pay off some debt but they will be taking out more for production with no way to offset that in a meaningful way currently. Hollywood Studios fund content for exhibitors/networks/platforms to the tune of 10s of millions per season of a series and make back that investment by selling rights to seasons of that content through windowing throughout the world with profit from each airing of the content. Even a moderate hit and running shows pulling in billions over time. Netflix is a platform that has one content window, at a set price, for a set audience that will not increase massively - which is the problem. If they refocus to licensing content from all major Hollywood and international studios as they did at first by serving as the primary digital window for 3rd party content streaming that is a potentially viable business as they won’t be spending billions annually to produce series. However content, Original Series specifically is very expensive esp at the rate Netflix spends which is massively higher than most. There are countless series they have made not to even consider marketing costs that were dismal failures at 10s of millions PER EPISODE —which is just a heart attack inducing price tag. In series content production if you are not licensing content to 3rd parties you will lose money — which is where streaming content production fails. Even Iger at Disney has admitted as much. Both Apple and Amazon (the latter having more streaming subscribers than Netflix by far) will likely bail on major streaming initiatives within the next 5 years likely through pressure by stockholders who are watching them light giant piles of billions in cash on fire yearly with nothing to show for it. Apple streaming is a vanity project with no viable profit model, which the execs openly admit. Also all streaming including Netflix —the actual tiny viewing numbers per episode for 90% of their content would just shock you, and would be cause for cancellation if those numbers were pulled in traditional broadcast and cable. There is a good reason they don’t share viewing numbers and obfuscate through “minutes watched”metrics. Consider as well Broadcast and cable still make up 70% of monthly audience share. Steaming Subs will decline as the economy worsens as well as they are easily cancelled.
