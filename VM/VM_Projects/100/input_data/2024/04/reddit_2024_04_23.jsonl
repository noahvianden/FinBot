This is not the case with short sales, if the share price keeps going higher, you go into the negatives exponentially faster and faster.\n\nso imagine you have a shit ton of shorts, like millions of them bc youre a hedge fund. and so do some other hedgefunds, bc youre great buds and youre gonna do anything u can to fuck over a company together like publishing news reports about how its teetering on bankrupcy and then bet on its stock going to shit. but now if that stock goes up by a lot randomly, they all have to wait for the stock to go back down before they can sell, or they end up selling at a loss + millions of dollars in daily interest. but its ok they can afford to wait, and itll go back down eventually. so they can keep holding and wait for it to correct and goes down like it should, bc its a failing business and business model so why would it go up? well in the case of gamestop its because a shit load of people (redditors) collectively drove the price of a failing business up, knowing about these millions of shares that had to be repaid by a specific date. so these hedgefunds got caught with their pants down, betting that a share would drop but if enough people kept buying it and refusing to sell it, it will go up. and now the hedgefunds are buying shares too, to get in on that action and \"hedge\" their losses on the shorts. and then we keep buying bc this shit is soaring now and then the news hears and a ton of other people start buying and on and on, because its almost a sure bet because we essentialy know the date that these millions of shares are going to have to be bought to cover the short. thats called a short squeeze, theres obviously a lot more to it but thats the gist on shorts. sorry if you already knew all this", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Squeeze deez nuts you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is where most of their chips go (AMD, Apple, Qualcomm and even Tesla's Dojo chip but this is not a big order). I think the 2nd half of 2024 and then 2025 will see an uptick in PC sales as all the pandemic PCs are due for a refresh. The stock market doesn't usually price in things like that so far in advance. \n\nI think TSM will reach 200 but probably not this year, maybe 2nd half of 2025 when it become apparent that AI is not a fad.\n\nINTC is a longer term investment as in 5-8 years. It will take that long for their fabs to work out all the problem.  In 5 years the demand for chips will be 10x what it is today. Robots, automation, AI, smart cars, etc. Only TSM, INTC and Samsung can make those chips and possibly Global Foundries (formerly AMD's fab) All the fabs can win, it isn't a zero sum game.\n\nI think that INTC could reach 300 by 2030.  It is much easier to buy now in the 30s than it will be at 100 even though I still think it will triple from there. If a tech bubble forms then 500-700 is not out of the question.  If they continue to suck then the stock will go pretty much nowhere.\n\nOn a more short term (6-12 months) INTC has their own AI chip which aren't as good as the latest tech from nVidia but there may still be a market for it.  Also some new CPU tech such as Backside power will make Intel CPUs more competitive. On a benchmark Apple's M2 smokes Intel's CPUs (especially with regards to power consumption) but in real world uses the vast majority of people just browse the internet, youtube, facebook, etc. and the CPU doesn't make much of a difference thus x86 cpus will still sell by the millions.\n\nThere is a danger in that the stupid US chip policy vs. China backfires. Because the US is limiting advanced chip sales to China, they will eventually develop their own chip fabs on par with Taiwan Semi.  I think they are 5-10 years behind.

Some of that is growth, some just inflation.  In 6 years US GDP will be significantly higher. Inflation will continue to erode the value of the dollar. I believe the reported levels of inflation are way too low compared to the real value.  I think since 2000 real inflation is at least 100%, i.e. the DJI of 38,000 today is 19,000 in year 2000 dollars.  That means the DJI has only gone from 10K in 2000 to 19K today.  The market (and practically any asset) is a hedge against inflation.  So a large portion of the valuation of stocks is really just inflation.\n\nThe growth that AI will bring is being underestimated.  All the tech will need chips. If Intel succeeds in their fab business it alone will be worth 1T+. Of course there is a possibility that they fail or some other world wide calamity occurs. If investing were easy then no one would make any money as the stock price would never be undervalued.\n\nI am only putting about 1/4 of my retirement savings in INTC.

It only runs on certain  highways in single state. It can not go faster in than 40mph, it must be following a lead car, it only works in fair weather.
