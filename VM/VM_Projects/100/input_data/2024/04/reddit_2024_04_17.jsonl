The only really risks to cash flows is with non-credit worthy tenants(which could default), or if a lease expires and the tenant decides not to renew, or demands big concessions for renewal(offices are a big one here).\n\n>Trading volume has decreased enormously due to the aforementioned scenario. I don't think there will be a massive pullback on stocks, but to this point, CRE is not \"fine\".\n\nIf there was a large wave of CRE defaults large enough to distress banks, it would tank the stock market with it, just like the residential real estate bubble did in 2009. But I don't think it will happen- there is not any data to suggest that there will be widespread CRE defaults beyond a few overleveraged burrowers.\n\nLook at the balance sheets of any publicly traded real estate company, with the overwhelming majority of them, cash flows are sufficient. and their leverage ratios are quite low.\n\nIt would take interest rates rising to ~8-10% for the CRE market to truly start collapsing. But I don't think rates will go that high, I think they've peaked for the foreseeable future.

For 2, the cost would easily be in the $100m+ for IoT devices at every store. So if I’m management, I’m getting as much data as I can from every store on 1.) what products are out of stock most frequently. 2.) how are we ordering those products (scheduled, demand based) 3.) what is the average lead time of said products. 4.) is there a predictable pattern for when we should be ordering these products (bulk up at the end of the week, increase frequency/volume of order, do we run out on weekends, Mondays, or is it random.) based on that info, I would analyze how much revenue we are potentially losing for products out of stock, and justify a solution based on that $. \n\nAlso, in an ideal world, we get customers on a subscription service that way we can better predict daily consumption.

It's really difficult to choose the right path, yes he has the coworkers suggesting this and that but he makes the choices. I reiterate, for your understanding, every auto company since Ford over 100 years has gone bankrupt in the US. These companies were not starved of bright intelligent people working nor were they lacking people with business qualifications . The top CEO position makes the difference in a company and the extensive list of failures by far outweigh the success Elon bred. By bred I mean yes ever CEO will instill a quality of atmosphere at work just like any coach of a team sport. The unsung heroes come out during shows and reveals tech days like AI day, Battery Day, or the big shareholders meeting you know when they speak and talk to the pubic unlike pretty much every other company.\n\n>The moment when market conditions have turned and competition has really ramped up, where is Elon's leadership?\n\nWhat are you mumbling about ? Tesla for 2023 is the BEST SELLING CAR IN THE WORLD. So were you talking about market conditions in 2023 perhaps not . What market conditions are you talking about COVID or the market crash of 2008 , or just the last quarter? Ok last quarter, q1 2024 Tesla sales were down but it regained the title WORLDS TOP EV seller. Competition has ramped up and it's competitive out there but who is over throwing Tesla ? .\n\nElon has previously publicly said if you own Tesla shares to make money just don't buy another stock. It's that simple if you're concerned about valuation don't buy Tesla. Tesla has previously had the world's highest concentration of short positions in the world. The amount of money bet against Tesla almost forced it to go backrupt. Save yourself some stress and sell your position.\nSo for actual company performance you think they have been \" going backwards \" the stock price once valued the company over $1 trillion dollars in Nov 2021. This is perceived value caused by over buying and it has since dropped by over 65%. What has Tesla or Elon being doing during that drop to make Tesla go backwards;\n-Increased the bank cash on hand to $30 billion from $16B\n-Announced partnerships for the Supercharger network for pretty much everyone.\n-Personally called Jensen Wong on the phone to aquire AI chips which has a very long waiting list \n-New END TO END FSD has been mass released \n-Stipulated everyone test driving a Tesla be shown FSD.\n-Released Cybertruck\n-Massively reduction the COGs Per vehicle.\n-Revenue $53B growth to $96B over 80% rise\n-Net income tripped to $15B\n \n>Others car makers, especially the Chinese EV manufacturers have all but wiped out much of Tesla's lead there.\n\nWhat is this talk of value for money ? The lead ? people have decided that the model Y is the best value for money by making it the BEST SELLING CAR IN THE WORLD for 2023 . Are you talking about BYD perhaps ? Yes looking at specs the latest BYD Seal is compelling but I actually saw a review comparing that car and a Tesla check YouTube \"carwow Model 3 vs BYD Seal\" , I will save you some time Tesla is the winner. By the way BYD lost the title of biggest EV seller to Tesla as of Q1 2024.\n\n>They might not be cheap, but they are better than a Model S in absolutely every metric.\n\nYou talking about Lucid ? Omg they have put high performance at the cost of battery life. Every metric ? Have you used the in car software it stinks please watch some reviews please. For every vehicle sold they are negative over $300k, total sales are at 6001 cars for 2023 .You think this company is gonna be around in 5 years ?

The Board believes that our corporate identity is intertwined with our Texas corporate headquarters and that redomiciling in Texas would be consistent with this trajectory.\nIn 2021, we relocated our corporate headquarters from California to Austin, Texas. Since this relocation, Texas has increasingly become a focal point for Tesla’s corporate identity. Executive management is based in Texas, as are manufacturing, operations and engineering employees. Our corporate headquarters and principal manufacturing facility — Gigafactory Texas — covers over 10 million square feet of factory floor. We continue to invest in the expansion of our campus, which we believe is the second-largest building by volume in the world.\nGigafactory Texas is also the manufacturing hub for our new products. It is the manufacturing hub for the Model Y, which, as of January 24, 2024, was the best-selling car in the world, and is home to the Cybertruck.\nOur corporate identity is becoming inextricably tied to our Texas corporate headquarters, and we believe that a change in our state of incorporation would be consistent with this trajectory. Texas is our home state, and we are committed to Texas. Reincorporating in Texas also builds on Tesla’s relationships with the state and local communities. These relationships — with government actors, with employees and with other stakeholders — are critical to Tesla. Academic research reviewed by the Special Committee recognizes that “there is value inherent in home-state incorporation” because it can strengthen such relationships. Fully becoming a Texas company would send a strong signal of Tesla’s commitment to the state and local community that have done so much for it already, and that are so important to Tesla’s future.\nBy comparison, we have no material operations in Delaware. Our executives and management do not operate out of Delaware. We do not have our Board meetings in Delaware, and the Board does not otherwise visit Delaware as part of their site visits. It was chosen as our state of incorporation solely because of its legal framework. As discussed above, the Special Committee and the Board found no advantage to remaining incorporated in Delaware that justifies a split between the Company’s legal home and its physical home.\nThere is Value in Local Decision-Making.   Another advantage of home-state incorporation is that the legislators and judges making corporate law — and the juries deciding fact disputes in corporate cases — are drawn from the community in which the company operates. Corporate law and litigation often overlap with and impact business, employment, and operational matters. And Tesla is not a cookie-cutter public company. The Special Committee and the Board believe that local decision-makers have a deeper understanding of our business, and therefore are best situated to make decisions about our corporate governance.\nHome-State Incorporation is Common and Intuitively Makes Sense.   Successful companies are incorporated in many U.S. states and other jurisdictions outside of the United States. Approximately 35% of S&P 500 companies are not incorporated in Delaware, instead choosing to incorporate in a variety of other jurisdictions. Some of the most successful consumer-facing companies in the United States are headquartered and incorporated in the same state, demonstrating identification with their home state, including, among others, Apple and Microsoft. The following map illustrates the geographic diversity of some of these companies.\n \nWe are not the first to consider redomiciling from Delaware to another jurisdiction. Southwest Airlines Co. is also incorporated in Texas. Some companies, including Microsoft, have reincorporated from Delaware to their home state in order to reunite their legal and physical homes. One of the reasons given by Microsoft when it left Delaware was that Washington was “the location of the Company’s world headquarters and the location of its primary research and development efforts.” Similarly, the Special Committee and the Board believe there is value in unifying Tesla’s legal and physical homes.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Chat gpt generate a page long justification for moving to Texas without disclosing political reason why it had to be done or discussing the increased tax the company will have to pay.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Elon big mad.

{"title": "Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)\n* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)\n* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive\n* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport\n* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [\"Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia\"](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.\n* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**\n\nIn this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)\n\nIn Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.\n\n**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** \n\nWell, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)\n\nStill, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlcvvk9a80vc1.jpg?width=1107&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee317bc8a9f6f642f8700f9f67d94014eb03a24e\n\nMusk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** \n\nThese are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:\n\n* 2024 1'950'000\n* 2025 2'280'000\n* 2026 2'750'000\n* 2027 3'340'000\n* 2028 4'150'000\n\nAs you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? \n\n First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late\n\nSecondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?\n\nThirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. \n\nFourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. \n\nIn conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !\n\n**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**\n\nDespite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:\n\n* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)\n* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)\n* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)\n\nThis is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.\n\nAccording to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2\n\nProbably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nI would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "1c65j7b", "created_utc": 1713346240.0, "score": 217, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 7 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 231 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nthp3b/dd_rng_potential_if_compared_with_hydrogen_bevs/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvgvpc/clean_energy_for_america_act_to_favor_net_zero/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsbfm1/biomethane_renewable_natural_gas_why_it_deserves/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o69314/rng_from_the_usa_weekly_update_renewable_natural/) \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Really surprised tesla spend so little on R&D\n\n\nWhat do PepsiCo even spend it on?", "score": 110, "replies": [{"body": "AI.
