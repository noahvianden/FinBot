It is a typical range of emotions for people who are newer to this type of strategy.  I will give you my 2 cents.\n\nFirst:  Selling covered calls is typically done for 2 main reasons.  The first is because its an income strategy to produce \"income\" selling premium.  Its done in conjunction with selling cash secured puts as part of a wheel strategy.  There's a few universal rules to this.  1: Only do the wheel strategy on \"great companies\" you know will recover if they go into correction. and 2: This strategy works best in a Tax advantaged account like Roth or Traditional IRA (Individual Retirement Account) because you don't pay taxes on the premium received in those accounts.\n\nThe 2nd reason people typically sell covered calls is because they are OK with letting their shares go if the stock goes above the strike price they sell but if it doesn't they plan on holding anyway.\n\nSuffice it to say that selling covered calls SHOULD NOT be done on a stock you will want to sell for a loss if it starts to correct.  Now that doesn't mean your thesis on the stock cant change.  So if your thesis on the stock changes then by all means closing your position is prudent.  But make sure its a factual fundamental reason and not an emotional one.\n\nSo with all that said what you do depends on what you think about Tesla.  If you think they have fundamentally fallen from grace for whatever reason and it doesn't align with your views on the business then selling is justified.  Move on and learn from the situation.\n\nBut if you still believe in Tesla and they have not broken down fundamentally then hold it.  A loss isn't a loss until you realize it by selling.\n\nA final words of wisdom tip I think might help you is this.  When you receive premium for selling covered calls make an excel tracker to keep track of all the per share premium received.  Subtract \"taxes\" from that value to give you an accurate representation of how much your \"cost basis\" has come down per share.  This only works if you keep track of the premium and subtract the taxes from it.  You could also add to that by investing the premium in a high yield savings for the rest of the tax year and then figure out the interest that your premium grew to.  There are many things you can do but the most important thing is to take emotion out of it.

{"title": "Tesla (TSLA) PT Lowered to $115 at JPMorgan, 'We are slashing our estimates and price target'", "selftext": "\nOn Wednesday, JPMorgan revised its price target for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, reducing it to $115 from the previous $130 while maintaining an Underweight rating. The adjustment follows Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers, which significantly fell short of both JPMorgan's and consensus expectations.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan expressed concern that the disappointing delivery figures might impact investor confidence in Tesla's long-term growth prospects, which is vital for upholding the stock's high valuation multiple.\n\nTesla's vehicle sales for the first quarter of 2024 showed a year-over-year decline of 9%, contrasting with the Bloomberg consensus estimate which anticipated a growth of 6%, and the company-compiled consensus which expected a 5% increase. This miss represents the largest discrepancy from analyst estimates on record for the electric vehicle maker.\n\nPreviously, analysts projected that Tesla would sell 626,000 vehicles in the first quarter, marking a 48% year-over-year growth, but the actual sales reported were only 387,000 vehicles, which is 38% below the peak forecast from June 10, 2022.\n\nIn light of these results, JPMorgan has also reduced its estimates for Tesla's first-quarter revenue, now expecting $21.4 billion compared to the previous $25.6 billion, and below the consensus forecast of $23.5 billion. The firm's forecast for earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter has been lowered to $0.42 from the prior estimate of $0.69, which is also beneath the consensus of $0.61.\n\nThe revised EPS forecast is a steep drop from the peak consensus of $1.94 before Tesla implemented a strategy of heavy discounting to boost unit volume in response to softening demand.\n\nMoreover, JPMorgan now anticipates a significant free cash outflow of $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a reversal from its earlier expectation of a $300 million inflow, and contrary to the consensus for a $1 billion inflow. This expectation is based on the assumption of a record increase in finished goods inventory, as Tesla produced 47,000 more vehicles than it sold in the quarter.\n\nThis inventory buildup, according to JPMorgan, suggests that the lower deliveries were due to demand constraints rather than supply issues, refuting any implications that disruptions such as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea or the fire incident at Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory were the primary causes.\n\nJPMorgan warns that Tesla shares, which already saw a 4.9% decline on Tuesday compared to the S&P 500's 0.7% drop, could face further decreases if the company fails to quickly revive unit volume and revenue growth. The firm cautions that investors might reconsider the premium valuation multiple currently assigned to Tesla's stock in the absence of sustained growth.\n\n\nFull article https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/jpmorgan-cuts-tesla-stock-price-target-on-weak-deliveries-93CH-3364609", "id": "1bvc05n", "created_utc": 1712197983.0, "score": 615, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 316, "comments": [{"body": "Bad news always takes a few days/weeks to settle in.

{"title": "Under Armor (UAA) - Looks too cheap", "selftext": "Pre-pandemic Under Armor (UAA) was a bit of a darling stock. It reached $27 in July 2019. Its now trading at $7. A fall of 74% in just under 5 years. Is it a buy? I think it is and here's why (the short and sweet version):\n\n**Valuation**\n\nUAA is cheap on every metric : P/E 8, P/S 0.56, EV/EBIT 12.5 \n\n**Market Cap:**\n\nUAA has a market cap of only $3b (Nike's is $137b). That's borderline small cap territory. Even boring Puma's market cap is more than double that of UAA\n\n**Fundamentals**:\n\nUAA has a good balance sheet with a debt to equity ratio of 31%. Four years ago it was at 87%. It also has a net profit margin of 7% - it's highest for years\n\n**Ownership**\n\nFounder/CEO Kevin Plank owns 12% of UAA. BDT Capital Partners owns 10% and has been steadily building its stake. BDT is a PE firms with a seemingly good record of successful turnarounds.  Bryon Trott (the CEO of BDT) is known to be Buffett's favorite banker. \n\n**Stock price**\n\nI already mentioned this at the start but the stock currently trades at 13% *lower* than the price at the Covid crash\n\n**Brand Awareness**\n\nScores 88% in the brand awareness according to Statista\n\nSo sounds like a slam dunk,. Not by any means. UAA has had quite a few problems. Eg:\n\n**Management:**\n\nUAA has had 3 CEOs in four years, not a good sign,\n\n**Inventory Management**\n\nUAA had a major issue with overstocking which forced to deeply discount its inventory, with obvious implications to the brand.\n\n**Brand Likeability** \n\nOnly scores a lowly 41% according to Statista.\n\n  \nUAA has issues that its still needs to resolve and constant turnover of senior management doesn't help. BDT's involvement should help keep a steady reign on the ship and hopefully turn around a brand which is well known, but seems to be a little lost. At current valuation there looks to be a reasonable margin of safety and its solid balance sheet should give it some resilience.\n\n  \n***Disclosure:*** *I'm long UAA and this is a small position for me (1.5%).

(By the way, an aside - the tests they will be conducting are not nuclear. Nobody is going to be dropping nukes in Utah.) anyway, if you’ve ever worked in anything remotely nuclear adjacent: the government will inspect every screw, every piece of tape, every drop of sweat, every particle of every fart sniffed in the nearest town for nuclear work. It’s a fundamentally different process. And DoD and DoE are embedded in the manufacturing and testing. In commercial aircraft, a manufacturer designs and manufactures their planes, and the FAA reviews the design and manufacturing process to make sure it’s safe. For this, the government micromanages the shit out of the whole project. It’s probably going to go 30% over budget and 4 years over time like every defense contract, and that’s because they spend the time and money they need to make sure you don’t fuck up the propulsion system that, god forbid, is driving a nuke to an impact target.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Because their employees aren’t the one signing off on them.

Any increase between 25% and 50% just needs and explanation. Any increase below 25% is just ignored. \n\nIf a military delivery is delayed, they don’t lose the contract and stock price may not budge. Shutting down the commercial line and delaying deliveries threatens business and can hit the stock price quite a bit. \n\nNot saying the quality is amazing on the military side, but if the testing fails, it would affect the stock, so they actually care that it is at least functional.

Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.\n\nSo Altria’s bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it… until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.\n\n## Altria is Creating Their Own Flavored Bluetooth Disposable Vape\n\nSo Altria wants to ban flavored vapes? Well, sort of but not really. Altria wants disposable vapes to be illegal, except theirs! Theyre working on a [**bluetooth disposable vape with flavors**](https://www.tobaccojournal.com/news/altria-plans-to-use-bluetooth-for-flavoured-vapes/) and they will bypass the laws AND get it PMTA accepted because it has Bluetooth technology to verify if you’re underage or not. And they will get it approved because Big Tobacco basically owns the FDA - [**100% of FDA’s tobacco department funding comes from big tobacco**](https://www.theamericanconsumer.org/2023/03/fda-should-reexamine-incentives-to-collect-tobacco-user-fees-fairly/). The feds are not on r/antiwork theyre big tobacco boot lickers looking for more funding, and they’ll get it if they approve.\n\n## Altria’s On! Nicotine Pouches - ZYNs Biggest Competitor\n\nIn case you didn’t know, all the main nicotine pouches that are popping up everywhere are owned by Big Tobacco. Altria is in on it with their On! Nicotine pouches. Altria had shipment issues in 2023 but they’re expected to double revenues from On! Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).\n\nOne of the best parts about this part of the business is that the ex-commissioner of the FDA [**tweeted that nicotine pouches can**](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1762263657818513615) help smokers quit. At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.\n\n## Altria’s “Moving Beyond Smoking” Plan\n\nAltria is dead set on its new campaign, “[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)”. They know smoking rates are declining so they’re repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That’s why Morningstar says they’re worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it’s a value stock.\n\n## Bonus Altria is planning on selling its shares of AB InBev\n\nAltria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes. Finally, with [**jobless claims at a 9-week high**](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240404273/jobless-claims-climb-to-nine-week-high-of-221000-but-theres-little-sign-of-worsening-labor-market), expect even more people to use nicotine as a way to cope with their shitty lives ([**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896540/), [**2**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255976561_Effect_of_economic_crisis_on_smoking_prevalence_and_number_of_smokers_in_the_USA)) while they’re out looking for jobs and smoking cigarettes, we’ll be eating tendies and banging their wives.\n\nPositions $MO 47.5c 6/21, 50c 6/21, $PM 100c 4/26", "id": "1bvrf6u", "created_utc": 1712247685.0, "score": 366, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 2 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 10 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Interesting.
