{"title": "Here's What the Gulf War Will Do to Your Assets", "selftext": "The world just changed. You think that's too dramatic?   \na) Close the tab and come back on Monday when you see your charts.  \nb) Poke holes into the scenario bellow and argue for a different outcome\n\nGulf War went very quickly from unlikely to happening. One predictable consequence is that Oil prices will shoot up. \n\n**History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes:**  \nThe Yom Kippur War, also known as the October War, was a conflict fought between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria.  It began on October 6, 1973. Geopolitical tension arising from it (OPEC proclaimed an oil embargo against nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War) was a catalyst for 1970s energy crisis which lead into the highest inflationary period of past 80 years. Oil prices went x 4, then some more, inflation followed..\n\n**Two important macro differences from then and now:**  \nDebt levels are vastly higher and labor market is much tighter now. \n\n**Sudden 180 degrees turn:**  \nWorld was expecting and counting on that the interest rates have peaked and it was only the question of how soon and for how much they would come down. This set the modus operandi for all over-indebted entities - and there are many (both private: e.g. commercial RE sector and public e.g. govt. debts) that are underwater (mathematically proven to be unable to service debt payment if rates stay at current levels) who are doing \"extend and pretend\" on their loan maturities, waiting for lower rates to come around to be able to refinance. \n\n**The only Achilles Heel of Central Banks**  \nis the inflation. It paralyzes the Central Banker's strongest weapon: QE. \n\n**Oil prices don't need to go as high (x4) as in 1974 to cause a havoc:**  \nHigher inflation will hinder central bank's ability to reduce interest rates so they will have two options:  \n1. Increase interest rates further and push zombie entities out of business due to vastly higher debt levels than in 1974 (some examples: half of the commercial RE sector with 1.2 trillion debt outstanding in 24 months, third of France's private sector with it's all time-high private-debt-gpd at 280%, Italy's government whose already at current rate levels on a trajectory for missing debt payments...)  \n2. Monetize debt through inflation, which will be nastier this time around with wage-price-spiral in the mix.   \n**Which option would you choose?**     \nIf I were a central bank or a govt. - would definitely go with the second option, it's a lot better PR, hence I take this assumption.\n\n**What happens with your assets?**  \nReal assets survive (housing went x2 in 1970s, gold x4), stock market and bonds tank (higher inflation = higher required return = lower price), cash is trash. \n\nCountdown has started, post your scenarios.", "id": "1c3dxoe", "created_utc": 1713047054.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 273, "replies": [{"body": "I agree, it looks like a mild response from Iran to the Damaskus attack.

The earnings season will surprise to the upside - very strong.  I believe the market will continue to roll up for the following reasons:\n\n1) The recent hot jobs market is due to an increase in leisure/entertainment and medical workers.  These areas were most affected by the pandemic.  Yes a lot of government jobs added as well - it’s an election year for the current Uncle Sam.  I believe the current workers above is fully staffed.  Service jobs will flatten and wages will normalize.  \n\n2) AI is just starting and will drive a whole new cycle in computing hardware from phones to data centers.  The electrical grid will require a rebuild.  A battle for electricity is underway between eV’s and data centers.  Data centers will win as will those companies involved with power generation and infrastructure.   \n\n3) The Fed - get over them.  Interest rates in the United States averaged 5.42 percent from 1971 until 2024.  I don’t see them hiking & maybe throwing in a token cut.  \n\n4)  The shift to global isolation leaves no alternative but to invest in the USA.  Importing disinflation is over, but we have the resources and the digital revolution will drive productivity.  Let Russia and China buy up the gold.  I rather buy the best companies in the world.   \n\n5) We went thru two Bear markets in the past   4 years - many shitty companies were weeded out.   The market is healthy.       \n\nWe are still early in a long cycle Bull market. Average in - buy the dips on SPY.  Small cap’s are bargain basement- buy the Russell.

Your AVC is extremely high in the low production level, before hitting a pit. The reason auto manufacturers want to minimize AVC is of the very complex supply chain that autos have to stay active, and the falloff of revenue from excess supply. If auto manufacturers over produce, the autos are sold at a discount either on a clearance as the next year models will be coming out, or in secondary markets.

You're missing extremely important information and your ass is going to get wrecked for it.  Evidence being this confused post you're making right now.

There's a bunch of limit orders within whatever price range you're watching right now and they're fairly even.   Some news hits or whatever and the price begins moving up, towards $11.  Then it hits $12.  It breaks out of range and is continuing to move, aggressively now.  Plenty of active traders are going to view this as a breakout opportunity, as a new trend, etc and want to act; Now your limit orders consist of tons of prior longs looking to exit and capture profit; however, anyone wanting to buy in at this point is probably only going to actually get filled if they buy at market rather than placing a limit.\n\nThus, a seemingly strange circumstance in which the price is moving up, but the order book is showing outsized sell pressure.  Active orders will continue pushing the price up so long as delta continues piercing through the sell pressure.  It's no surprise that limit orders on the buy side lag when the price is continually moving in that direction.\n\n\n\nI guarantee that if you had a DOM heatmap open you'd be seeing *heavy* amounts of active sells at the same time you saw this order book.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for explaining!!
