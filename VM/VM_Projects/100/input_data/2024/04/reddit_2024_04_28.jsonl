This gave a huge profit bump but resulted in every year Enron effectively needing to creates profits from zero. most of Microsoft’s revenues are guaranteed annually as they only account for profit created in the year so their increase of 5% is easy to achieve.\n2) they shifted losses to external companies and promised astronomical returns for doing nothing except hiding the losses that would be repaid over years.\n3) this allowed 100% of profits to accrue instantly but losses paid over time\n4) when the profits failed to materialise (most power projects failed to meet profit targets), they created complex resale agreements.

I will likely test drive and acquire a 4th vehicle in the near future as I am interested in the capabilities of hybrid. \n\nThere’s too much nuance for Tesla as an investment and I don’t understand it enough to see why it’s not just a car company so I will likely never take a position in it.

We use fatalities per departure.  Basically, the risk of a fatal incident/crash is calculated on a per-flight basis.\n\n[Here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/aviation-fatalities-per-million-passengers) is the worldwide chart of fatalities per million departures over the 50-year period from 1970-1920. It has been a steady decline, [despite the number of flying passengers increasing dramatically over the same time period](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/air-passengers-carried?tab=chart) (there's a drop at the end of the chart because COVID).  It currently, including the Max crashes, hovers around .1 fatalities per million departures.  Put another way, you could fly every day for something like 30,000 years and not be involved in a fatal airline crash.\n\nSo now that there's a baseline established, how do we look at individual models of aircraft?\n\n[This data](https://www.airsafe.com/events/models/rate_mod.htm) is current for the 737 through 2019, and is the most recent I can find.  Keep in mind that that the  current fatality rate for the 737 Max will actually be lower than what is indicated because it has flown for 5.5 years since the MCAS-related groundings without a fatal crash.\n\nSo, as of 2019, if you look at similar categories of aircraft, 737NG (the most common 737 currently flying, despite production ending in 2019) vs. A320 series you'll see that the 737NG actually has a slightly better safety record than the A320, at .07 fatalities per million departures vs. .09.\n\nThe Max data has to be taken with a grain of salt because the chart data was compiled just after the two Max crashes.  Since then, over 1000 more Max airplanes have been delivered and the number of MAX flights has increased exponentially.  Over the last five years, Maxes have completed millions of flights carrying at least tens of millions of people with zero fatalities.  That number continues to improve, so the 3.08/million rate is old and quite skewed because of the lack of time in existence and smaller number of total Max flights at the time the data was compiled.\n\nNotice that the 787, everyone's favorite punching bag, the one everyone is screaming about being \"unsafe,\" is not on the chart, because it has had zero, none, no fatal accidents, no crash-related hull losses,  in its 12-year history. It's currently at or near the top of the list of safest aircraft ever made. The Airbus counterpart, the A350, also has zero fatalities, but one crash resulting in hull loss.\n\nThe 777 is a tough one to compare because it has been in production for ~20 years now and its closest current competitor is also the A350, a much newer aircraft. Probably the more-honest comparison for the 777 is the A330.  777 is at .18 fatalities per million departures compared to A300 at .19. Several hundred more 777 were produced than A330. \n\nSo the data don't seem to support the media and public-opinion noise that specific current-production Boeings are death traps, or somehow more-significantly flawed, compared to their competitors.\n\nNow, if you want to start comparing other 'scary' things like parts falling off, landing gear collapsing, engine cowlings popping open, panels and parts departing in flight, aircraft having sudden nosedives flinging passengers around, wheels and tires falling off, etc.; *all* that happens at about the same frequency between Boeing and Airbus. It's not hard at all to find a 'Bus counterpart for every single 'OMG Scary Boeing' incident reported over the last several months.\n\nSo it's a public-perception thing, which *could* affect sales, but the public is fickle and has a short memory.

Let’s go over each category here\n\nMercedes level 3 autonomy is what they call drive pilot & we all know Tesla level 2 autonomy is fsd.\n\nHere’s the big differences between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot \n\n1)Mercedes drive pilot can only operate in highways whereas Tesla fsd will work on both highways & city streets\n\n2) The speed limit on Mercedes drive pilot is 40mph max whereas Tesla fsd is 85mph, here Mercedes drive pilot needs to follow other vehicles whereas in Tesla case it is not required to follow other vehicles.\n\n3) Regarding the traffic patterns Mercedes is not capable of handling interchange whereas Tesla fsd is capable of most of the traffic patterns\n\n4) Mercedes drive pilot doesn’t work with flashing lights in the area, meanwhile Tesla fsd functions with flashing lights \n\n5) Mercedes drive pilot doesn’t work in construction zones, Tesla fsd operates in the construction zones\n\n6) Mercedes drive pilot usage in day time only whereas Tesla fsd can work in daytime or nighttime use\n\n7) Mercedes drive pilot cannot change lanes whereas Tesla fsd can change lanes \n\n8) Mercedes drive pilot needs the lane lines whereas for Tesla fsd lane lines is not required \n\n9) Mercedes drive pilot is functioning only in California & Nevada whereas Tesla fsd in all 50 states, Tesla in the last 24hr Tesla has launched subscriptions for Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) in China, as many expect that the company could soon launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) in the country\n\nSo if you look above the staggering difference between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot, Tesla is making a steady progress & will be big winner in this category. \n\nNow before you tesla haters, 🐻 open your mouth on how Tesla fsd is still level 2 autonomy & is inferior to Mercedes drive pilot, remember to do some research. Tesla hate on wsb is getting real & constant fudge on how Tesla will fail is laughable \n\nThey won’t go bankrupt, yes they had a shitty quarter but holding 27 billion cash. If tesla can’t make it no other evs. Atleast Tesla is making money on every car they sell whereas wsb darling rivian is losing 40k for every car they sell.\n\nIf Jpow keeps interest rates high rivian is fucked big time\n\nSmall Positions of Tesla, nvda shares\nQqq 436c\n\n\n\n", "id": "1ceweuo", "created_utc": 1714273657.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.36, "num_comments": 138, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 13945 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Poor people will always fantasize about expensive cars.", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "On God", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Some people don't just fantasize, they'd long anything, even a VW Rabbit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "What do you fantasize about bot btw?

The AT&T deal is really encouraging.  I’m not really bullish on Rivian but it has commercial streams which provide better support than consumer streams.  So from a sustainability perspective they stand a better shot than Tesla in this way.  These deals are more important than the rental deals as the rental companies generally flip inventory every 3 years and Teslas do have resale issues given battery conditioning challenges.  This makes them less attractive for these large scale purchases.  The commercial deals are fully capitalized purchases, longer use cycle, but lower barriers to just get refresh orders and continuing revenue since fleet consistency is advantageous (sticky vendor benefit).\n\nHertz dumping Tesla confirms a market direction problem. They can make a great car but it doesn’t mean the market wants it.  As irrational it is, EV range fear is a real problem and winters in the north don’t help change the market opinion.  The Model 2 could potentially confirm it’s not a price issue and more of a usability issue for people which would be devastating.  Given how they are reusing as much as they can for the Model 2, this has to be part of the hedge - why waste time really building something that ultimately won’t sell.\n\nFSD as a feature isn’t really part of the purchase conversation that will make or break a sale for most people.  Consumers are still worried it won’t make it 2 blocks to get them to the grocery store still.  So as far as stock impacting, it pales to actual delivery numbers and frankly probably won’t move the stock since only nerds and techies care.  FSD technicalities are better debated on the Tesla subreddit.\n\nFSD as IP though is interesting and a question on the earnings call alluded to that when Elon did confirm they are in discussions to license out the technology with at least one carrier.\n\nThe market appetite is really around hybrids.  The market is concerned on range and hybrids still use gas which consumers are comfortable with.  If the Model 2 sales are not extremely strong - and I mean significant blow out, Elon is better off changing the narrative by discontinuing producing cars in general. He can claim a win by saying he jump started an industry to develop a platform to then build FSD, charging infrastructure, battery technology, and autonomous technology.  At the end of the day if you put a Prius and a Tesla in front of your average soccer mom, she’s probably taking the Prius.  Gas isn’t going away and techies and environmentalists need to get over themselves and understand this reality.\n\nHe can let the auto industry continue to make vehicles and just focus on licensing the technology and selling components for everything at a higher profit margin.  Who cares if he sells cars for a profit, the stock will get hammered just from the lowering of the multiple as market size critical capacity will be reached if they stay as a car manufacturer.  They are already trying to say they are not just a car company - they need this to justify the multiple and it also gives them a way out.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

I think enough cash, training data and Indian grad students and they can probably pull it off, but the timeline sure as shit isn’t what Elon pretends it is. \n\n1. Mercedes self driving is essentially just the stop and go traffic code + an expensive enough sensor suite that they’re confident enough to allow it to run in very limited circumstances. Good enough radar + lidar and you’re never crashing in straight line traffic ever. It’s why the product is only available as an S-Class add-on, the sensor suite is too expensive to justify inclusion on any lesser model. Toyota has the same thing, but they wont mass produce their level 3 vehicle because they don’t have a vehicle class that they could justify the cost associated with the sensor suite. Imagine paying $150k for a Toyota Camry because it can do stop and go traffic under 40mph, without changing lanes, on certain stretches of mapped highway in California, as long as it’s not cloudy or raining. I worked for Mercedes for 4 years, a lot of Mercedes tech isn’t a matter of being more innovative, it’s just a matter of having the margin within higher end models to include features that legacy auto can’t justify. \n\n2. Waymo has no interest in consumer self driving, it’s purely a taxi play. The vehicles it operates have $70k in advanced sensors mounted to the top of the vehicle. Although I’m sure Waymo uses AI in the stack, the bet isn’t to win via AI, it’s that they can 3D map enough of urban United States that it becomes pointless to use anything but Waymo to get around. I won’t comment on or defend Teslas self driving taxi shit, it’s probably an Elon lie. \n\nIF and it’s a big IF, Tesla can crack self driving with only vision+compute, that’s more or less game over.

Higher productivity allows for higher GDP without putting upward inflation pressure.

There's concern about inflation being sticky at around 3%, but not a lot of concern about inflation heating up (said by Powell himself).
