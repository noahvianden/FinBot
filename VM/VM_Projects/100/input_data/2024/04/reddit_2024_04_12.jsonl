{"title": "r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Apr 12, 2024", "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "1c24v21", "created_utc": 1712914209.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 216, "comments": [{"body": "[Here's](https://substack.com/@spilledcoffee/note/c-53636088?r=23ti9i) a graph showing TSA airline passenger screening by year. 2024 is off to a higher start than the previous two years.

I never criticized espionage I primarily went after China's copying by anyone and everyone. Yes, everyone has secret services who steal the difference is that China encouraged their small businesses to steal designs and make fake brands from Western companies then when Western companies went after them they played dumb and ignored them. In some cases, the Chinese government even defended the blatant stealing of small brand design and such. What I am talking about here is not big government espionage like many repliers misunderstood. I am talking about the difference in the way of thinking and thereby the political ideology of China where they support any small business stealing any design and copying from the West. Thereby completely undermining and disregarding Western international standards and \"international law\". Essentially taking a piss at our standards and morals. Don't tell me that an argument to that is \"France also spies on others\" yes but France doesn't encourage anyone in their population who wishes to do so to steal the look and tech of let's say Mustang and brand it as Mustanģ. If that happened in France where a small new company blatantly ripped off the IP of Mustang an American Mustang would go after them and sue them. That cannot be done to a Chinese company since because of the aforementioned political ideological differences and the disregard for our standards and principles by the CCP.\n\nEdit2:\nOh shit you know what I bet it is.

China already produces 38 billion ballpoint pens a year, according to China Daily, which is about 80 percent of all ballpoint pens in the world. That's a lot of pens, but there was a catch: China had long been unable to produce a high-quality version of the most important part of the pen, its tip.\n\n>The tip of a ballpoint pen is what makes it a ballpoint pen. At the tip, a freely rotating ball is held in a small socket which connects it to an ink reservoir that allows the pen to write or draw lines. Manufacturing a ballpoint pen tip that can write comfortably for a long period of time requires high-precision machinery and precisely thin steel, but for years China was unable to match those crafted by foreign companies.\n\n>While there were over 3,000 companies manufacturing pens in China, none had their own high-end technology for the tip. Instead, about 90 percent of the pen tips and refills, too, were imported from Japan, Germany and Switzerland, according to Chinese state media. This cost the industry $17.3 million a year, according to the China National Light Industry Council.\n\n>China's inability to produce a complete, high-quality ballpoint pen came to widespread attention in 2015, when Premier Li Keqiang singled out the products at a seminar in Beijing, noting that his writing was “rough” when he used Chinese-made ballpoint pens. For Li, China's failure to manufacture a complete ballpoint pen was indicative of the Chinese economy's weaknesses. “That's the real situation facing us,” Li said at the time. “We cannot make ballpoint pens with a smooth writing function.”\n\nThat's the gist of it. It's not propaganda.\n\nThe different between those comparisons is the US has the technological know-how and skills to build an iphone, even if they don't have the domestic manufacturing infrastructure in place.

All in-town driving with a variety of speed zones, in a medium sized city in Canada.\n\n·         Car stopped too far back from stop sign line\n\n·         Accelerated too fast, no traffic, 65km in 50km zone\n\n·         Again accelerated to 67 km/h in 50 zone\n\n·         Approaching a left hand turn, no opposite cars approaching, car came to an abrupt stop for no reason instead of just turning\n\n·         Car seemingly avoiding potholes on right side of road by hugging the center line. Moved back to center when opposite car approached\n\n·         Spoke too soon, car is now driving through the potholes on the right side of the road when it could easily avoid them\n\n·         Continued aggressive acceleration\n\n·         Approaching yellow light where police officer is waiting at red, car slowed and stopped as light turned red. Good job car.\n\n·         Just noticed several minutes into drive that auto-wipers are working quite well. Light rain and wipers are swiping at appropriate pace\n\n·         Car drove past speed trap camera going 66 km/h in a 60 zone. Might get ticket (I’ve gotten tickets in the past for similar speeds, they are ridiculous)\n\n·         When traffic begins moving at a green light, car does not smoothly accelerate with traffic. It accelerates too fast and slows down, repeats again and again. Needs acceleration regulation work.\n\n·         Car ahead of me is aggressively braking hard at red lights. My car slowed down gradually at red light in spite of this.  Good job car.  If I was paranoid I’d assume they were trying to “gotcha” me. They are likely just a bad or distracted driver.\n\n·         Again, car in front accelerated hard into the next red light and slammed on brakes. Again my car slowed down nice and easy. Good job car.\n\n·         Car driving an appropriate 76-80 in a 70km/h zone.\n\n·         Car driving 42 in a 40 zone, very appropriate for residential zone\n\n·         While driving down road, when we approach a slightly slower vehicle ahead, instead of just easing off the “gas”, the car will brake too much, then accelerate to catch up again, and rinse and repeat. Has regulation/going with the flow problems sometimes. Must look silly from behind.  Speed up, brake lights! Speed up, brake lights!\n\n·         One period of time rain was heavier and wipers were a little slow for my taste but overall very good.\n\n·         Car rapidly accelerated to 70 in a 50 zone where there are often police with speedtraps. Could have resulted in a speeding ticket.\n\n·         Car doing well with choice of lanes. Getting into correct lane to make turns well in advance.\n\n·         Excellent edge case – Approaching a new left turn lane, a delivery truck was parked on the opposite side of road blocking oncoming traffic. They were passing the truck in my left turn lane.  Instead of entering the left turn lane at it’s beginning, my car saw what was happening and stayed in my straight through lane until we passed the truck and then entered the left turn late at the last moment to make the left hand turn. Avoided an awkward situation or potential crash where I’d be driving head-on into people passing the parked truck in my left turn lane. Good job car.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Nice write up.  \n\nAgreed on 12.3.3 on the acceleration/deceleration issues (I'll drive 12.3.4 today). For the speed control, I've found it's absolutely great for lower speed and single lane roads but can be excessive on larger city roads when traffic is light.  If you're worried about getting a ticket, perhaps switch back to manual speed control.  They have tweaked the algorithm though where it truly acts as a maximum speed now, instead of a target.  So if you set 50 km/h, it will not exceed that speed, but if it thinks conditions only permit 30 km/h, it'll do that instead.  It just reduces the risk of you getting a ticket while also letting FSD make the safe decision situationally. Set the max speed you'd be comfortable with and let the car do the rest of the work.\n\nOne last thing, the abrupt stop at the left hand turn at the beginning is something I've seen too. I have experienced it when there was someone (pedestrian/cyclist/pet, whatever) approaching an intersection and it seemed like the car wasn't sure if they were going to enter the crosswalk.  It perceives the threat initially and then some movement makes it believe it's now a target and it needs to react. Not sure what else was going on in that situation but going forward, the 8 outward facing cameras having a 360º view around the car while we maintain maybe a 150º arc out the front windshield is going to result in people getting frustrated \"for no reason\" that we sense.

That is why you target a steady growth in GDP. The Stimulus was to keep GDP afloat. The side effect is high inflation.  It was the Feds job to see the stimulus  and counter act the inflationary trajectory to create a stable economy. Instead the Fed decided to do their own thing and wait for the stimulus to take effect. That is why inflation got away from them. However, if by complaining about inflation means it is massive then you have a lot to learn. The inflation was bad, but not massive. \n\nLockdowns didn't cause inflation, that's not even logical. Lockdowns would cause deflation: Demand drops + Supply stays at same level => Prices drop. Instead, it is when Supply Drops + Demand Stays Level => Prices rise. No, it wasn't lockdowns but supply chain disruptions that added to the inflation, but that part was transitory. Especially, since the gov't did a great job of tackling those disruptions before they became overwhelming.\n\nYou should spend more time understanding basic economics, so you don't make illogical statements.

Please, *explain* how shutting down an economy is a way to keep GDP steady, when government caused the worse drop in GDP ever. 3. Supply chain disruption was literally caused by lockdowns. 4. The spike in inflation was because people couldn't spend money during the lockdowns, so when the lockdown was lifted, there was massive pent up demand and supply chains couldn't cope because they had been forced to shut down by government.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. Do a dollar vs Euro or Dollar vs Yen. Any comparison to other currencies since the Pandemic. The Dollar is up, and has held up stronger than those currencies. The dollar vs inflation, well, inflarion being at 3.5% isn't a weak dollar. That is a strong GDP.\n\n2. Stimulus kept GDP afloat to counteract the lockdown. Try to keep up.\n\n3. Supply Chain disruptions were not caused by lockdowns, because supply chain workers were exempt as \"essential employees\", so that's false. Supply chain disruptions were linked to issues like foreign countries not being able to manage the Pandemic well, causing component sourcing disruptions. Across the country, city hospitals were inundated with sick patients from rural areas that wouldn't lockdown, causing major delays in care and workers were stuck at home sick waiting longer than usual to get care. Most of the supply chain workers were concentrated in the city. When city workers realized their hospitals were full, they wanted to avoid getting sick, so they worked even less. The combination of workers getting sick and avoiding getting sick, was what the lockdown was supposed to prevent, but rural areas compounded the problem by not locking down. So after lockdowns, the supply chain disruptions continued. Cities had to try lockdowns again because their hospitals were full. The problem is, they were targeting the wrong population. The beds were taken by sick patients from rural areas, so their lockdowns didn't work in those instances.\n\n4. The Spike in inflation was a result of Stimulus leading to GDP Growth. When supply chain disruptions were fixed, the FED should've immediately began QT. Yes, pentup demand from self-imposed lockdowns, not Gov't Lockdowns was the reason people wanted to spend. The Stimulus money they had saved, made it possible for them to spend frivolously. QT would've tempered that demand by causing a price increase in anticipation of that demand. That price increase would also drain money out of savings, reducing that stimulus cash pile people were sitting on.\n\nIn the end, this is why some of us were yelling from the rooftops that the Fed was late. That they were going to have to raise interest rates quickly, because they were late. After their massive interest rate hikes, several issues were created. Treasury Bonds lost value overnight, SVB and First Republic fell because of it. The Fed panicked and did something ridiculous. They kept their Fed Discount Window at the same rate, but increased the interest on reserve balances above that rate. Basically, they offered high interest rates to banks willing to put funds in reserve while charging those banks a lower fee rate to take out a loan. Well, what were the banks to do, but take out loans and place in reserves to get an interest rate net positive. Of course this occurred for months until the Fed realized they messed up and banks were taking advantage of their move. This is just one of the side effects of a Fed being slow to react. They solve one crisis until another one pops up, and like whack a mole they have to keep hitting each crisis until the entire economy stabilizes.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\"Stimulus kept GDP afloat to counteract the lockdown.

This way Fed is lender of first resort rather than last resort.\n\nHere are some good interview quotes:\n\n>Yahoo Finance. You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to 2 percent inflation. As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3½ on core. On a six- month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent, though when you look at supercore and shelter, they are, of course, stickier. So when looking in the different components of the data, how much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates?\n\n>CHAIR POWELL. I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates is that policy would be, it would be too late. I mean, you’d want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot, if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity. You know, it takes—it takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation\n\nWaller said rising real rates is enough of reason:\n\n>If inflation continues to cool “for several more months — I don’t know how long that might be — three months, four months, five months — that we feel confident that inflation is really down and on its way, you could then start lowering the policy rate just because inflation is lower,” Waller said in remarks at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. “It has nothing to do with trying to save the economy or recession.”\n\nRecent interview from 60 minutes:\n\n>Pelley: Why is your target [interest] rate 2%?\n\n>Powell: Why isn't it zero, I guess, is the question. And the reason is 2% is interest rates always include an estimate of future inflation. If that estimate is 2%, that means you'll have 2% more that you can cut in interest rates. The central bank will have more ammunition, more power to fight a downturn if rates are a little bit higher.\n\n>Pelley: Are you committed to getting all the way to 2.0 before you cut the rates?\n\n>Powell: No, no. That's not what we say at all, no. We're committed to returning inflation to 2% over time.

As Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told a congressional committee in June 2021, \"Those who have historically been left behind stand the best chance of prospering in a strong economy with plentiful job opportunities. And our economy will be stronger and perform better when everyone can contribute to and share in, the benefits of prosperity.\" **One of the reasons most Americans had not shared in the economic growth over the previous 40 years is that the Federal Reserve had tended to raise interest rates just as wages started to rise to fight inflation.**\n\n* Powell, a lifelong Republican, also said to Congress:\n\n>“There’s a growing realization, **really across the political spectrum,** that we need to achieve more inclusive prosperity. These things hold us back as an economy and as a country.”\n\n>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says two major long-term issues facing the U.S. economy are sluggish productivity growth and low participation rates in the job market by prime-age workers.\n\n* Powell on anemic job participation that needs to go up.\n\n>Powell says that the United States currently lags most major industrial countries in the percentage of workers in prime working ages who are in the labor force. He says one hopeful sign is that this participation rate is finally beginning to move higher, but more needs to be done.\n\n>**“We lag just about every wealthy country in the world in labor force participation** and that is not where we should be,” Powell said Wednesday in testimony before the congressional Joint Economic Committee.\n\nSo if you look at unemployment it looks like full employment.

{"title": "Intel DD - Underbought and Oversold: Why You Should Be Investing In The AI Revolution's Cheapest Stock", "selftext": "It's 2024 and Intel has not exactly performed admirably. While its competitors - AMD and NVIDA - have hit the moon and then some, Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was. If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype, they'd have been wrong to choose Intel. Problematic!\n\nThere are reasons for this, of course. Intel has not come out with a cutting-edge product - Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water. Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure. Intel has been, since way before this subreddit existed, known for being a limp stock that trading sideways. China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips. All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI - and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it - became clear.\n\nIn spite of all this, I think Intel is a strong buy right now. Why?\n\nFor one, it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year. There's been a string of bad - but not structurally undermining - news coming out about the company recently, similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago. Google is now at 160, because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column. The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up. If you want that in technical analytic terms - RSI is below 30. Buy.\n\nIntel is also catching up. [It's releasing a chip](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-artificial-intelligence-ai-chip-085500073.html) that can beat the H100! That's not the whole story, of course - there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year. But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking. We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level, which requires a lot of hardware. Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance - people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting-edge chips for a long, long time. And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap. \n\nThere's also the national security angle. Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker, and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries. Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts, and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash. \n\nTheir earnings call is on 4/25, and so [here's my 4/26 call spread](https://imgur.com/a/kNWdyfT). I expect these to pick up a lot of IV as we get closer to 4/25.

I agree with most of what you're saying there; I meant the government will keep them from going to zero; I did not mean they'll be profitable from government alone, and the reason I cited Boeing is other than the Starliner space craft and 787 Dreamliner, all their products for the last 20+ years are just new variants of 30 to 50 year old planes with slight modifications. Their current flagship military project is a new F15 variant, and that's a great plane, but 2 generations behind modern fighters. So they've basically been a dog shit company this entire century, and here we are 24 years in and they're still in business. And not only are they still in business, but they're valuable enough for whistleblowers to commit suicide to the back of the head and \"nothing to see here folks\" is about all the info we got about that.\n\n\nWith Intel, I think they have a moat because manufacturing and foundries take too long to build for any true Anerican company to become competitive on that scale in the next 3 to 5 years. By then, Intel should have had at least some opportunity to cash in on their manufacturing mega zord.

They basically bet the company on High-NA EUV to make it happen to. TSMC 3nm-refresh is said to be on par with 20A in terms of performance and power consumption. Their 2nm process is scheduled to be in full production ahead of Intel's 18A and there is no reason to suspect it won't destroy Intel on every metric - including price. High-NA has half the optical resolution as traditional lithography. That means any large form facture dies, like we see on HPC or high-yield server parts, are going to need double the number of exposures. Traditionally that isn't a huge problem, most chips need 50-100 difference masks, but the power output is also halved. This means greater chance of stochastic defects with double the chances for error. It's a receipt for poor yield. You might as well do what China is doing and just use a million mature Hyper-NA DUV passes where the science is at least fully modeled and can be predicted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, Intel should spin off their foundry division like AMD did, focus on design (their expertise) and let the government prop up the domestic fab business without killing the company. Setup a Public/Private board with industry and government leaders and utilize a funding structure with grants, government backed bonds, and public equity similar to what the auto industry got in 2008. You want to save Intel? It's gonna be on the same scale as that.  You will need 80-100 billion over the next 5-10 years to get their fabs up to par with TSMC. More if you want to surpass them. And that is just the fab side of their business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir design side has their own problems as they try to separate from China. China is their largest geographic sales region by both revenue and profit. As the sock-puppet OP mentioned their AI play is improving and it's one of the few AI chips not export controlled to China! Or at least it wasn't.

The growth in the industry is mobile phones. Period. Apple carved out a huge industry. Redundant sales and new software sales. Google grabbed an even bigger share and Samsung too. \n\n\nThis all propelled by TSMC. Now the GPU is benefiting from all of this too. They had established businesses already ready to take advantage of this all.

They come with motherboards that are 5x smaller than a normal desktop.\n\n\nEven the datacenter is now benefiting from the push in mobile data consumption. Because there are more devices than ever before.\n\n\nSo Intel won't boom. They have to spend to catch up and grab customers. They can't survive without any mobile customers. \n\n\nThat is the crux of their problems. The CPU (laptops) and datacenter will still be there making them money to go for foundry.

That's it. \n\n\nHere is the problem though. The industry is near saturation. Consoles, laptops, ipads, phones, gpus, and now Ai servers. We are near saturation in the amount of computing that we have.\n\n\nIt's why NVIDIA has an Ai upscale algorithm to enhance visuals and scale up for 4K resolutions. 4K maybe our maximum resolution. It's like a movie theater film screen or your phones screen.\n\n\nThere is a maximum limit to what we need in terms of resolution. It's why film can't move past 3D.
