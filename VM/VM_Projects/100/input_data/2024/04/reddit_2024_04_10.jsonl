On a macro basis, increased rates is essentially an across the board tax, so businesses are forced to raise prices to maintain relative earnings.  The higher prices decrease buying power across the board, which triggers wage dissatisfaction and therefore increased wage demands, ultimately setting up an inflationary cycle. However, it also inhibits capital investment due to both substitution on the supply side and decreased ROI on the demand side, which ultimately decreases future labor spending in the aggregate, which is counter-inflationary. The wage impacts are asymmetrical, so you get the largest impact in high-demand areas, like Tech, and unionized bargaining sectors, plus the occasional minimum wage adjustments - thus both high-income and low-income jobs move first, and both small business employees and middle-class non-union employees go last and tend to lose permanent buying power.  \n\nA higher-tech approach would be to control money supply more efficiently - lower the cost of high-grade consumer credit while increasing commercial rates, while concurrently increasing money supply.

Claus was building houses in Florida when the bottom fell out.\n\n>\"A lot of my tradespeople found other work, went and got retrained for new jobs in law enforcement, all sorts of jobs,\" says Claus. \"So the workforce was somewhat decimated.\"\n\n>A few years later, as Americans started buying more homes again, building stayed below normal. And that slump in building continued for more than a decade. Meanwhile, the largest generation, the millennials, started to settle down and buy houses.\n\nThis is a similar problem to what U.S. shipbuilders faced after the Cold War ended: a disastrous loss of work, which caused people to permanently leave for other industries.  American shipyards today can't build enough ships to keep Navy fleet numbers stable.  The high cost of labor means that even a medium sized warship costs over $1 Billion for just the hull (double that figure for fitting out the ship with equipment and weapons).  \n\n\n\nLow interest rates won't solve the housing crisis quickly, but high interest rates are adding harm on top of an already difficult situation.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Good little NVDA", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm up 300 bucks thanks to deadmoney convincing me to buy some NVDA.

(Edit: lol idk why I kept typing like anyone is gonna read all of this)\n\nTheir issue on defense is not really poor contracts… It’s poor execution (i.e. T-7 delays, various KC-46 issues over the years, etc.), missing out on FLRAA (went to Bell’s V-280), FARA getting canceled, and so on. The picture there is mixed and long term success will come down to execution going forward, NGAD program selection, and NGAS program (last two not really worth speculating about this early). Further tanker orders are anticipated ahead of NGAS, so that’s a plus…\n\nOn the commercial OE side, I’m not sure where you’re getting info about bad contracts, though I suppose there are likely some... If anyone has gotten bad contracts, it’s their suppliers that got locked into long-term pricing before the high inflation kicked in. They weren’t exactly flexible for any suppliers that weren’t sole source.\n\nInventory issues are largely an industry problem due to supply chain issues (mostly on the engine side right now) that have been taking a long time to subside… They’ve only delivered one 777 this year so far as others are parked as they wait for GE engines. Though stocking for their 737 ramp prior to rates being stalled hurts, too. They weren’t at “full” production to begin with as they were early in a multi-year ramp up on MAX, but the FAA has stalled rate hikes and it’s anyone’s guess how long that will take.\n\nAftermarket is doing fine and may even get a *slim* benefit from its inability to ramp deliveries (as older aircraft remain in service and in need of repairs), though it’s probably immaterial. The good news there is that demand for aircraft remains strong enough that these older planes will keep flying for awhile.\n\nAftermarket is where the margins come from for most aero companies, so you’re right about needing to lean on that segment.\n\nThe next year is going to be tough for Boeing, at the very least.

I try to take the bigger picture into consideration as to where things are heading and keep that in mind when making a trade. \n\nRecently day trading strategy has worked almost every time with a profit. Ive learned over the past 3 years through trial and error on what works for me. learned some expensive lessons and this is what I've been doing since. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not buy options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI buy block shares on major break outs and keep a tight stop loss. It works 99% of the time with a gain or break even. The other 1% I take a small loss. Over time I'm building back my portfolio. \n\nExample: I use technical analysis mostly on my day trades. I'll scan the premarket for the volume movers and I check the news in the morning for anything that might have happened over night or could be a catalyst for an upcoming trade. Once i find an attractive set up ill establish small position on what I see as a steady level of support. Ill slowly start to accumulate until it reaches a massive breakout range and then ill buy a block of $5k ( by starting my small positions first i am always in the green starting off) . Ride that parabolic move up and wait for a cool off or pullback to establish its price discovery to see where buyers are stepping back in. I then set my stop loss to break even average to give it room to breath. That way worst outcome is break even with some transaction fees. I will usually ride the momentum until it breaks the closes level of support and then I'm out of the trade completely to reassess reentering or being done with it completely. It might be a small gain or a massive gain depending on the break out but it almost guarantees me something in the green. Shares also allow you to turn your day trade into a swing or a long if the trade starts working against you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is instead of buying a contract for 100 shares on a timeline. Buy the 100 shares outright and allow it to work on your time instead of the markets. \n\nSince I started using this day trade technique I've been able to make up a large portion of my losses already from some of the losers Ive had over the years, I still have a ways to go but as for now I'm gonna stick to what's working. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nbiggest lessons learned \n\n1.

As far as my day trades I don’t go by percentages I got by technical analysis of major areas of support/ resistance. I look for volume and momentum and will nibble until it picks a direction. I use 5k blocks to day trade with. Sometime I’m scalping these trades within seconds to minutes to mitigate my risk and taking what I can. \n\nI’ll start a position with $200 at a major level of support and usually it will bounce from that and enter my position, that gets my foot in the door. I then use the 5 min to slowly accumulate off that support or in that zone as I increase my position. Usually there’s a major breakout ahead and up until that point I nibble. At the major break out I’ll dump the rest of the 5k and let it ride. If it drops I’m still in the green because of my average and I will set a stop loss at break even. This will give it time to pick a direction. If I get stopped out I reasses sometimes leave the trade all together , if it climbs I ride it through the major break out and wait for it to retrace to see where buyers begin to step in again. Once I see that first level of support start to build (even if it is weak) I set my next stop loss at a 100% to ensure I made all the gains even if it is small. As it begins to climb to new levels and building new support I dial back my stop loss from a 100% to 75% and quarter it down. That way if the first support gets triggered I lock in profits and still allow my break even stop to ride incase it continues up. That way I have like 4-6 brackets and maybe a Hail Mary to let ride incase it runs parabolic or turns into a swing to squeeze more out of it.  \n\nThis might be confusing but hope this helps a little", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Where do you keep track of all this data.

These funds are all currently positioned bullish. \n\nThere are two key things that trigger systematic deleveraging of CTAs: 1. spot price moves below key levels, and 2. volatility expansion. If you see both, then CTAs in aggregate are selling off their shit and positioning bearish. Once CTAs start selling, everyone follows suit and at that point we are basically selling into a hole. Once that sort of momentum kicks off, nobody is buying. Every strategy sells into this setup - systematic macro, vol dealers, your grandma, everybody. \n\nBut if you don't see a significant volatility spike, macro funds don't give a fuck.

The current elevated VIX levels relative to last week are due to downside hedging (read: funds buying puts) after last week's jobs report.

If there's no big downside kickoff, then the hedges just expire and the market continues upwards. The next meaningful news event is Q1 earnings season.
