Here was a comment I made a few weeks ago regarding my thesis on Amazon:\n\nOver the past few years Amazon has been HEAVILY reinvesting all their cash flows aggressively back into their business, building out their logistics and fulfillment centers and over-hiring. It appears as though Andy Jassey has finally decided to utilize all those years of reinvestment to finally grow the cash flows. This last quarter over tripled their free cash flow from around 8 billion to 28 billion and I think next quarter they will over double that number again easily. If they double their free cash flow again that would put them trading at around a 3.5% FCF yield. I personally believe Amazon deserves to trade at around a 2.5% FCF yield based on how reliable of a company they are and how predictable their revenue growth is. This would leave considerable upside with their projected future cash flows even in the short term. \n\nThey are increasing fee’s on third party sellers on their retail side. This may make some sellers upset but they won’t be going anywhere, selling stuff on Amazon is just to effective and still cheaper then self-fulfillment. I believe their margins on their retail side are only going to increase and become more profitable in the future.\n\nTheir advertisements are arguably the most targeted and effective in the industry with people literally entering into their website exactly what they are looking to buy and their high margin ad business is only growing and becoming more dominant. \n\nThey have been running Amazon prime at a loss to build their subscriber base for years in an attempt get to scale. They are now finally going to drop ads on all their prime subscribers only increasing their ability to monetize their millions of prime subscribers. And they probably won’t have a lot of churn as a result of this because prime is SO much more than just a video streaming service. \n\nTheir AWS cloud business is arguably the backbone of the internet and the most dominant player in the cloud industry and only going to continue to grow and scale and become more important as the AI revolution continues. \n\nAlso, Amazon is an easy way to get some AI exposure and appears to be a leader on that front as well along with Google and Microsoft.\n\nLastly, I’m super bullish on them getting into healthcare. People are fed up with huge lines and horrible customer service getting their prescriptions at CVS and Walgreens. I think home delivery of prescription medication and fulfillment through prime will be another huge source of revenue for them.\n\nAmazon is:\n\n1st in Online retail…\n1st in Third party online retail…\n1st in Cloud hosting…\n3rd in Advertising…\n2nd in Streaming Video…\nHeavily investing in AI \nAnd just stating to enter healthcare. \n\nCurrently trying to grow my position in Amazon as much I can right now over any other big tech company.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "interesting. i was thinking about msft after getting burned with tsla", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I like Microsoft a lot to for many reasons.

I found a nice write up on [BLDR](https://www.wsgresearch.com/p/builders-firstsource?utm_source=homepage_recommendations&utm_campaign=1860211&utm_medium=email). \n\nTo save some time, the company is massively different than in 2018, so please don't compare it's earnings to that period.....they company has done multiple mergers, acquisitions, and deleveraging since then. \n\nI still think homebuilders offer one of the best deals in the market right now. Systemic supply shortages will likely last for a decade or more. Also, migration to the Sunbelt requires more and more homes to be built. You can't take a home with you when you move, so these areas in being in demand creates an even bigger deficit of homes. \n\nHomebuilders have been valued like highly cyclical companies, and historically they have been very boom/bust. However, modern homebuilders operate in asset light models, i.e. they don't have tons of debt to own tons undeveloped land. So in an economic slowdown they will be able to weather the storm. Look at the debt/fcf ratio for [DHI](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/dhi/financials/ratios/). It's plummeted from 10x in 2017 to 1x now. Yes they are cyclical with he economy, but that's not really disqualifying. Most businesses are. \n\nSo, you have companies that earn 20%+ ROIC in good times, can weather downturns, and sell into a chronic shortage of their products. These companies trade at 10-12x earnings. The average market multiple now is 17+.\n\nSo are they mispriced? Possibly. I think worst case (long term) is the stock prices increase with earnings. Best case they get re-rated higher. \n\nInteresting note, DHI has outperformed GOOG and MSFT over the last 5 years. BLDR has smoked them both. As a note, [XHB](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/xhb/), the homebuilder index, has a lot of tangential names in it.

In the meantime though, you have Amazon talking about spending 150B on data centers over the next 15 years (and I'm sure Meta/Google probably similar ballpark) and utilities like Constellation Energy have slides in their earnings slide deck about data center growth over the next several years and rising energy usage.\n\nWhen you look at utilities and some industrials, there's data centers but also consideration towards EV usage (and while that growth story has cooled considerably lately, Quanta discussed in their earnings call that use by current vehicles is starting to cause a strain in some areas) and re-shoring with new factories being built. VRT is really a play on data centers.\n\nThis theme oddly hasn't gotten much media coverage and I don't see it talked about that much online, but clearly these names have been bought and heavily. Something like VRT - up 85% YTD - feels at this point very \"stock only goes up.\"  Boring utility VST is up over 95% YTD. These sorts of moves can go on for longer/much longer than I can imagine but the move that you've seen YTD imo is not sustainable w/o a pullback at some point (again, from where I don't know) but the eventual pullback in a situation where something has basically \"only gone up\" for months on end is often not slight.\n\nHow much is priced for a VRT given the best case scenario for data centers? What could happen in the next few years that could cause downgrades to spending expectations? What could realistically raise them? I think that VRT at this point is somewhat ahead of itself/pricing in a fair amount. That doesn't mean that it can't go any further, but 1) risk/reward is less appealing than it was - if all things stay the same regarding expectations and 2) It can absolutely go higher in the short-term than I'd imagine (and has) but if the \"up every day/buy every dip\" nature of VRT and some of the other names paused (news, broader market pullback, etc), a crowded name could unwind notably - which would make for a buying opportunity.\n\nSo, I think the data center/energy theme is long-term interesting, but names up 70-80-90% YTD - these things feel ahead of themselves and I have to imagine there will be better opportunities.  Maybe I'm wrong and great if I am given that I remain long but I'm not adding any further and if we were to go much further I'd have to think about trimming.\n\nWith the names focused entirely/more on data center spending, you really have to be watching for any changes in spend/expectations. Something like VRT up 600% in the last year, any news that is negative for data center spend (what that is/if/when I have no idea) would likely be a real setback.\n\nI like PWR as a broad play; something that nobody really talks about is Stella Jones (stljf; be careful as some brokers do charge major fees for foreign ordinary trades -- names where the symbol ends in F). Stella Jones is a huge maker of wooden poles for utility use. Those will be in need if we're going to be spending more on infrastructure and building but beyond that if climate change = more storms then over time more storms = more utility poles that will need replacing.\n\nThere's certainly others - EME, IESC, FIX, LMB, MOD, HMDPF, VST/CEG/NRG/TLNE in utilities, etc - but it's hard to find anything related that hasn't ramped already. A name with a lesser connection would be WSC - if you're going to build and have more construction/infrastructure work, then you're going to need modular offices and that's a name that is well off 52 wk high. Sort of the same way of thinking, URI W/equipment rental but that has run up nicely YTD. \n\nSo, I think if someone wanted to invest in this theme I'd really be cautious and really be long-term. Buy a very little, then really wait for opportunities (not every one % down but a little bit every maybe 5% lower) and DCA and patiently/opportunistically slowly build the position over time.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Do you have a source on Vertiv supporting Intel's accelerators?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Do not overlook $HON - Building Automation", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Do international currency ETFs that go long in a certain currency naturally lose value through decay  like normal stock options?

Musk accused Reuters of “lying.”\n\nTesla’s robotaxi project, according to Musk’s past remarks, would allow Tesla vehicles to use self-driving technology to autonomously pick up riders for fares. In 2019, Musk said that he expected to have over 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Author Walter Isaacson also mentioned the robotaxi project in his biography of Musk, published in 2022.\n\nCurrently, Tesla offers advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS,) including its Autopilot option, as well as a premium Full Self-Driving “FSD” option, which costs $199 per month for subscribers. However, Teslas currently cannot operate without human intervention.\n\nThere is significant competition in the market for taxi services that use self-driving cars.\n\nAlphabet’s autonomous vehicle unit Waymo operates driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and is now ramping up in Tesla’s home base of Austin, Texas.\n\nGM’s Cruise service previously offered self-driving car services in San Francisco before being wound down under regulatory scrutiny after an accident. Since the incident, Cruise’s robotaxi fleet has been grounded, local and federal governments have launched their own investigations and Cruise leadership has been gutted.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/05/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-unveil-its-robotaxi-on-aug-8-shares-pop.html", "id": "1bwtyff", "created_utc": 1712353183.0, "score": 991, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 734, "comments": [{"body": "I feel bad for the people responsible for making the robotaxi who learned about the project in Elon's tweet today", "score": 2146, "replies": [{"body": "I think you mean the engineers working on FSD learning that there’s a new robotaxi project.", "score": 487, "replies": [{"body": "...picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue...", "score": 141, "replies": [{"body": "Picked the wrong wk to stop jamming pharmaceuticals up my ass", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Martin Shkreli, that you?", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Serious question...

For example if road work starts somewhere (the most common case of confusion for those systems), non-taxi (and taxi) Tesla cars driving around can detect it, feed that info back to the servers, and then the robotaxis can decide to use alternative routes so they don't have to \"deal\" with the roadwork (or the taxi service just straight out \"closes\" that route).\n\n>There's zero proof they ever will beyond \"hopefully.\"\n\nThey can \\*\\*right now\\*\\* (under some conditions)\n\nJust set it up so the car is extremely careful (that would be annoying for a \"daily driver\", but isn't as much for a taxi), never putting itself into a situation where a normal misidentification would put it at risk of an accident.

The news about the cancellation of the Model 2 project is a lie. Do you really think that Tesla will not be able to make even an electric car?\n\n2. Robotaxi Unveil on 8/8. It is not a place where robotaxi will be commercialized that day, but rather a specific plan for robotaxi is announced.\n\n3. In the beginning, Tesla will operate robotaxi exclusively in certain areas (most likely Austin) and gradually expand the market by coordinating with local governments.\n\n4. Until V11, the verification time was long because all the corner cases (unusual situations that occur at the limit of extreme conditions of the algorithm) were piled up, and even if you tried to solve them by writing code, it could have an adverse effect. He said he couldn't even decide which problem to solve first. This is the situation that competitors are facing right now, and they have lost a lot of power after understanding V12. A situation where you can't stop or continue on the wrong path. (In fact, what many competitors' engineers envy most about Tesla's engineers is Elon's determination.)\n\nStarting with V12, it becomes very easy to solve corner cases; you just need to train on similar images. Verification time is shortened as no adverse effects occur.\n\n5. Waymo’s driverless taxi costs are 5 to 8 times higher than Tesla’s. And people may not know it, but in fact, whenever a problem arises in the field, a service person drives remotely and solves it. It is a business model that is virtually impossible to expand. But Tesla is different. The cost of the vehicle is low (cost expected to be lower for robotaxi vehicles), and there is no need for remote service personnel. If a robotaxi is operated in a specific area, it will perform much better than now by intensively learning only data from that area, and the price will be much cheaper than a manned taxi. It is expected that the general public's perception can change in an instant and that it will be easy to expand to other regions. Ultimately, people will not own cars.\n\n6. The strongest AI player on the planet is Tesla.\n\nAlthough it is a different area, what makes it stronger than ChatGPT is that the method of obtaining quality data (Safety score) has been made very smart. It also receives the data for free!\n\nOn the other hand, ChatGPT is difficult to distinguish between good quality (non-false) data. The larger the model, the more difficult it is to set it up correctly. Elon's Grok can obtain high-quality data by utilizing X's community note function. As learning progresses, performance will improve. Elon always first considers whether the direction is right.\n\n7. FSD 14 or 15 is likely to be a version of AGI that can communicate with humans.\n\n8. Elon's announcement of robotaxi Unveil on August 8 means that he is back to startup status. Engineers will be having fun and suffering for a while.\n\n9. Thanks to xAI, talented AI talent like Ethan are no longer lost to openai. I know Ethan well, and it is usually impossible for a talented person like this to stay in one field for more than 3 years. There were love calls from openai, spending a lot of money, but in the end, they chose xAI. This means that money is not everything.

I agree with this. Gonna be an incredibly interesting year.\n\n“Elon responding to this post by Sawyer with 👀 followed by the robotaxi unveil announcement shortly after is tacit admission that the Reuters article is mostly correct. Maybe not 100% correct bc Elon gave a vague \"they're lying\" with no details, but the gist of things is this: Tesla will develop the platform that will be capable of building both vehicles, but the consumer version with pedals/steering wheel etc will be de-prioritized with talent/resources being focused on the Robotaxi.\n\nThis can be viewed as bullish if one believes that Tesla will solve autonomy in the near/not-too-distany future. Why sell a mass market car if autonomy is solved? I can see the argument.\n\nConversely, this can also be viewed as incredibly bearish if one does not believe that Tesla will solve full autonomy because it basically guarantees that the auto growth story is dead. Energy has a few good years ahead, but the long term story here is also decreasing margin and value. Mexico keeps being delayed...there will be no high volume, mass market vehicle for many years. Probably 2027+. Semi has great potential but also years away from contributing. 4680 also has great potential to transform the margin profile of 3/Y...worth watching this closely.\n\nAs I have expressed in the past, I view this approach as unnecessarily risky. With this course of action, Tesla is either worth very little, or very very much. It also depends on an individual's risk profile. I consider myself conservative. I used have all my assets in $TSLA and I felt very comfortable.

Are you?”\n\nThat's basically how I view things, but how this affects Elon, and how this affects the vast majority of us, are 2 different things.\n\nElon has so much wealth that he will literally never have to worry about keeping a roof over his head, buying food, paying his kids' college tuition, or maintaining and fueling his private jet.\n\n* If Tesla's FSD efforts fail and TSLA is trading at $60/share 5 years from now (which is my baseline for Tesla on current automotive and energy alone, similar range to Morgan Stanley's estimate) Elon's approx. 410 million TSLA shares **are still worth $25 Billion**.\n* He has his equity in SpaceX, Boring Company, Neuralink, and Twitter on top of that.\n\n**Make no mistake, Elon is NOT \"dying\" on** ***any*** **hill, regardless of FSD outcome.**\n\nThe same is not true for small dollar investors, especially those with most of their wealth in TSLA.  Nateleb's account (if he is for real and not trolling), is probably the most well-known past example of that in this sub.\n\nHypothetically:\n\n* Someone with 500 TSLA shares, or about $85,000 market value at today's prices, could see that shrink to $30,000 if FSD doesn't achieve what Tesla intends and the stock is trading at $60/share in 5 years.  This is a possibility nobody should dismiss.\n* The practical impact for small retail investors is much more severe.  $85,000 invested in The S&P500 at 6-7% compounded annual return, stands a reasonably good chance of turning into 114k - 119k of wealth in 5 years (1.34x-1.4x).\n* What's the difference in having $30,000, vs $120,000 for the average person?  A lot.  That's the difference between \n   * paying of a home loan, or affording college for kids, \n   * and being stuck with a mortgage for a few more years or telling your kids that their choices for college are now much more limited.\n\nAgain, Elon will not die on this hill.\n\nThe average Redditor's finances and family's future wellbeing, could very well die on that hill, **and Elon won't care or help you if that happens.**", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "My memory is trash; what was that advice?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Speaking straight to me.

{"title": "In one of the most chaotic market sessions of the year, the S&P500 went from a 52-week high to a 10-day low in a few hours. Here's why.", "selftext": "[Original](https://pro.thestreet.com/market-commentary/dramatic-shift-in-market-takes-everyone-by-surprise)\n\nThursday was supposed to be a quiet session as market participants awaited the very important March jobs report, which will be released Friday morning. Instead, it turned into one of the most chaotic market sessions of the year.\n\nThe day started with a gap-up open mainly due to chatter that there is weakness in the job market and that there is a good likelihood that the March jobs news may be softer than expected and trigger a Fed rate cut in June. It was a questionable premise, but it created a little squeeze action and some underlying support.\n\nLater in the day, headlines hit that Fed member Kashkari commented that “if inflation continues to move sideways, it makes me wonder if we should cut rates at all this year.” This isn’t the first hawkish comment from a Fed member, and it probably wouldn’t have had too much of an impact, but then some other more dramatic news hit.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, Israel, residents were confused when their GPS applications showed that they were located in Lebanon. The reason was that the Israeli military was scrambling GPS signals in preparation for a possible drone attack by Iran. Reports circulated that Israel sees indications that Iran may launch missile/drone attacks from Iranian territory, possibly on Friday. Israeli officials informed the U.S. that an Iranian attack would trigger a response.\n\nThis news caused oil to spike higher, defense contractors to rally, and the market to sell steadily into the close.\n\nThe S&P 500 went from a 52-week high to a 10-day low in a matter of a few hours. This has only happened four other times before, according to Jason Goepfert.\n\nIt was a dramatic shift and caught almost everyone by surprise. Sharp intraday reversals are often major turning points.\n\nWe still have the jobs news to deal with Friday morning, and we will see if there actually is an attack on Israel, but the market is now very unsettled.

I don't think anyone will be close to them for a good few years in their ability to manufacture desirable cars at the cost levels they can achieve.\n\n2. Self-driving is an AI problem, and my understanding is that data is the number one need to solve it. No one comes close to the data Tesla has and every day their ability to collect data is increasing faster than anyone else. With FSD12 I think they are on the cusp of solving it and expect within a couple of years to see substantial revenue from that, including robo-taxi and self-driving trucks.\n\n3. Going all EV requires substantial improvements to electrical infrastructure with local and grid batteries underlying that. Tesla with its 4680 dry cells seems to be on the path to become the leader at making batteries at scale for a lower cost than anyone else. The profit potential here is immense.\n\n4. Optimus might be a huge deal, but we can ignore that.\n\nPoint 1 and 3 this ties into the concept that moving to clean energy will be beneficial in many ways to mankind. I think reduction in pollution and the health benefits associated with it, the reduction in greenhouse gasses (even if you are not convinced this is an issue), avoiding the geopolitical risks, and so on make this all inevitable.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "When Marty Mcfly gets an updated truck", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I am 20% up and it feels like a perfect moment to sell.
