{"title": "U.S. Money Supply Is Doing Something No One Has Witnessed Since the Great Depression, and It Foreshadows a Big Move to Come in Stocks", "selftext": "[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-money-supply-doing-something-090600755.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-money-supply-doing-something-090600755.html)\n\nAmong the five measures of money supply, M1 and M2 tend to garner most of the focus from economists and the investing community. M1 is a measure of cash and coins in circulation, as well as demand deposits in a checking account. It's money you have easy access to that can be spent immediately.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, M2 money supply accounts for everything in M1 and also adds in savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs) below $100,000. This is still money you can access, but you'll have to work a bit harder to get to it. This is also the money supply metric that's raising eyebrows right now for all the wrong reasons.\r  \n\r  \nMost economists and investors tend to pay very little attention to M2 money supply because it's grown with such consistency over time. Since the U.S. economy expands over long periods, it's only natural that more cash and coins are needed to complete transactions.\r  \n\r  \nBut in those extremely rare instances where a notable contraction in M2 money supply has been observed, trouble has historically followed for the U.S. economy and stock market.\n\nTwo years ago, in March 2022, M2 money supply reached approximately $21.71 trillion. Based on the latest monthly data release from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, M2 clocked in at $20.78 trillion in February 2024. As you can see in the chart above, this represents a relatively minor 0.5% year-over-year decline, but a more pronounced 4.29% drop-off since March 2022. It's also the first meaningful move lower anyone has witnessed in M2 since the Great Depression.\r  \n\r  \nIn one respect, this 4.29% retracement in U.S. money supply may simply be a reversion to the mean after M2 expanded by a historic 26% on a year-over-year basis during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple rounds of fiscal stimulus flooded the U.S. economy with cash and consumers who were more than willing to spend it.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, more than 150 years' worth of history has been pretty clear about what happens when M2 money supply retraces by more than 2% from a record high.\n\nLast year, Reventure Consulting CEO Nick Gerli shared the post you see below on X (the platform formerly known as Twitter). Gerli leaned on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve to track M2 movements since 1870.\r  \n\r\n\nGerli noted five instances where M2 money supply declined by at least 2% on a year-over-year basis, including the significant year-over-year move lower observed in 2023. The previous four instances where M2 fell by at least 2% -- 1878, 1893, 1921, and 1931-1933 -- were associated with periods of depression and high unemployment for the U.S. economy.\r  \n\r  \nTo evaluate this data agnostically, it must be noted that the nation's central bank didn't exist in 1878 or 1893. Further, monetary and fiscal policy have come a long way since the Great Depression. The probability of a depression occurring today given the wealth of fiscal and monetary tools available is low.\r  \n\r  \nBut this data set is pretty clear: If the amount of cash accessible to consumers is declining, and the prevailing/core rate of inflation is at or above historic norms, there's a good chance consumers will pare back discretionary purchases. In short, it's a historic blueprint for a U.S. recession.\r  \n\r  \nEven though stocks don't move in lockstep with the health of the U.S. economy, a recession would be expected to adversely impact corporate earnings. History shows that the lion's share of drawdowns in the S&P 500 have occurred after an official recession has been declared.", "id": "1bynxsa", "created_utc": 1712547263.0, "score": 1004, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 286, "comments": [{"body": "If you keep saying a recession is coming long enough then you always end up being right ", "score": 2604, "replies": [{"body": "A lot of people have almost been right for years now.", "score": 463, "replies": [{"body": "A recession is coming soon but I am not going to clarify on what soon means!", "score": 231, "replies": [{"body": "When someone tells me \"soon\" I ask if they're speaking as an integrated circuit designer or as a geologist.", "score": 172, "replies": [{"body": "Hahaha that’s a good one", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Sometime after today.", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "The recession will be transitory.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "The recession will be televised.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "...but the Revolution Will Not Be...", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No, the Revolution will be streamed.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "The recession will be transient, and poop on the streets", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I lost a good amount of money thinking there would be a crash during COVID.

You put a good PR and press shop out there, with a reaction force, and every time there is a piece of news about a Tesla malfunctioning, catching on fire, or being defective there should be a balancing piece of information included. The responsible news media would *always* run it. Every single story about a GM or Ford or Toyota vehicle having a problem there's a balancing quote from a spokesperson expressing regret, sympathy, and promising a reassuring mission.\n\nMusk and his team initially felt like there was no value because the enthusiastic response from early adopters masked that there's *millions* of consumers who have been convinced that Tesla is a product that's not trustworthy - either because of Musk's actions, or the lack of counter-messaging. \n\nThe legacy auto industry hasn't even started marketing against Tesla yet in anything other tentative feelers. Once the actual hand-to-hand fight for sales actual gets going, Tesla is going to find out how loyal their customers are. In my own case, I have owned two Tesla vehicles, one they voluntarily repurchased because of a series of service issues, and the second one I forced them to repurchase under my states lemon laws after a series of embarrassing \"new car\" issues that frustrated me for an extended period of time without resolution. Before switching to Tesla, I had purchased a bakers dozen new VW's over my car buying career. Then two Tesla's, and now, I'm back to VW (including one EV). I have another \\~7-10 new purchases in my lifetime, and I can pretty much promise they won't be Tesla. \n\nThe softening demand for Tesla's across the board likely has many factors, including quality, service, price and image. Once degraded, Musk will likely learn that restoring a company's image and product trust is *really* expensive and possibly impossible. The best plan is to never squander it in the first place. A prime example is Boeing. Decades of excellence tarnished by a relatively short-period of cost cutting and poor performance.

{"title": "PAA - Why it can go higher, even if oil doesnt", "selftext": "This is a long term play (at least through the summer and into US elections).  If you are trying to trade every few days at the bid/ask with more than a handful of contracts, you are leaving a bunch on the table and getting screwed by the spread.  PAA gets paid based on oil volume (NGL is hedged) so the play here is the econ forecasts were low, oil demand forecasts were low, other factors will limit supply, and  options buying requires some hedging on what is a normally low vol options stock.\n\nI was originally inspired by the DD in “Drill Baby Drill” to look into PAA.  While I thought his reasoning of “why” the options were cheap was off a bit (its a divi company, that's partly why they are so cheap) - upon further looking into it I agreed based on the following and jumped on 3/28 in the afternoon with more purchases subsequently.  This was originally started last week but did not get out until Monday after close due to some family items.  (Originally I said I would be happy with $19 by end of April and ecstatic with $19.5 as this is a slow bleed up play)\n\nI have \\~2.500 contracts of varying strikes through 2026.  I will not look to exit until around elections or end of year **by exercising** (not selling as MMs are low balling bids).\n\nI will attach some screenshots of PAA Q1 2024 investor presentation from:\n\nIn general, the thoughts are this:\n\n**PAA Business**\n\n**Location of Pipelines** - good locations for non sanctioned oil demand (US and Canada)\n\n**Crude & NGL** - NGL is 90% hedged.  Most crude in the US is from the Permian, where their pipelines are. 85% of their EBITDA is tied to crude. OECD inventories are at multi year lows.\n\n**Volume play** - demand is going to increase more than anticipated, leading to substantial more volume in their pipelines (economies are better than anticipated, oil is higher than thought, location location location, etc)\n\n**PAA earnings assumptions** - PAA assumed $75 average cost of oil per barrel (Q1 investor presentation) for earnings, which we crossed mid march, we are going to get better forward guidance.  See price of PAA since mid march as well.\n\n**PAA Permian Pricing Contracts -** PAA have not updated their pricing for Permian since October or earlier last year, maybe with higher oil we get higher fees they can charge on trunking/gathering further boosting earnings.\n\n**Dividend -**  Most traditional buyers of Oil/Gas are dividend guys. (Yes technically this is RoC) They are happy with 7% a year.  PAA diverged from ET/EPD etc a \\~+7% since 3/28 when we all bought options. These divi guys might jump ship to PAA leading to more demand for stock and driving up prices.\n\n**“Undervalued” -**  Well the concept of undervalued always rubbed me wrong (I prefer incorrectly valued based on faulty assumptions) The market already had PAA up by \\~50% over trailing 12 months prior to our 3/28 options buying.  Summer before covid it was $24+.\n\n**PAA Army**\n\n**Options buying -** Most options are LEAPs in 2025/2026 and there are a shit ton compared to normal.  In a nostalgic review of the history of a certain stock I was reminded it got kicked off originally with long dated calls and subsequent hedging with upward price movement.  While there will be no short squeeze (its the least shorted stock of its peers), we might be able to get some gamma action from the delta hedging as we overloaded the normal call volume by a ton.  This is also why ET/EPD etc **will not see the same price action regardless of oil surging.  Its all of the other reasons +  options buying that is the recipe for this cake.**\n\n**Delta Hedging -** Unless we are buying covered calls from the institutions holding PAA (unlikely but is good regardless as they want the price to increase as well), the MMs will likely delta hedge the long dated call options by buying more stock.  (This is why we seem to spike and then trade in a range for the day, they sell when its too high, and buy when its too low.  It could also explain why we tend to end the day in the highest volume areas reached earlier in the day or the high from the previous day like last week).\n\n[Volume is trending over average by 20&#37;-50&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/3petzkbmdctc1.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=74d953061f2a3a6967bbd9e26b87c4289f45486a)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bev413gfdctc1.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc3ee9af7c38cd1e18e5dd0427e3e492d4584aee\n\n**Macro**\n\n**Inflation** - Biden needs lower inflation to win.  ‘Muricans are pissed.  Oil is in everything and people see the price of gas all the time. To quote J Pow - “this shit will be a bumpy road over the next few years on our way to 2%.”  Only way to decrease the price of oil when demand is hotter around the world than previously thought is to increase domestic output.  Also if Brent gets too high, we might be exporting a bunch more.   Other countries have incentives to keep the price higher (see geo political)\n\n**Economy -** Generally speaking the economies of the world are doing better than thought.  US is growing faster than anticipated (sorry bers). China also seems to be picking up steam after some stimulus, so they can drink up the Russian oil.  This is increasing demand over what was previously forecast.\n\n**Crude -** Most estimates I have seen have been for crude to be high 70s to low 80s for the year based on economic forecasts which are turning out to be low balled.\n\n**Institutional/Retail Ownership -** According to Ortex, the free float is \\~65%, but also >50% is held by institutions.  This might lend weight to the divi guys being familiar with/owning PAA and jumping ship from others oil gas divis to PAA for divis and capital growth.\n\n**OPEC+** Opec reaffirmed voluntary cuts into June, this will limit supply from OPEC+ (as much as that can be trusted).\n\n**Geopolitical**\n\n**Saudi budget -**  Fitch ratings estimated the Saudis need >$90 **average for the whole year** to balance their budget. If Q4 is the same as Q1 (\\~$75), that would mean an average of \\~$105 for Q2 and Q3 for this to hold based on napkin math.  If Q2=Q3=Q4, thats an average price of $95.  I think the first is overly optimistic but is still higher than the $75 PAA used for guidance in Q1.\n\n**Brazil -** lets see what happens here…\n\n**Russia/Ukraine** - Ukraine is trying to take out Russian refineries with new drones.  Can they succeed if it could disrupt US aid in an election year?  Russia also had to put off its new nat gas facility in the arctic due to lack of arctic ships.\n\n**Middle East** - Speculation is that Bibi wants to pick a fight with Iran to bolster his standing in the gov (he might have been ousted had the Hamas situation not happened).  Who knows if this is true, but its a wildcard.\n\n**Election** Biden is a known commodity.  If Trump wins, I think positive perception will flow through to oil/gas domestically (regardless of whether he pumps more).  Other countries might have vested interests in high oil as a proxy economic war against the US (likewise they might not want the US oil to grow too much)\n\nSome sources:\n\n**PAA Business**\n\n**Location of Pipelines**\n\nPAA operates pipelines in the US (e.g. Permian) and Canada.  These locations are important for Macro/Geopolitical reasons, i.e. they are from the “good guys” (who has ever sanctioned the Leafs who are walking Christmas cards for example). OECD inventories are at multi year lows (and economies are doing much better than anticipated following rate hikes, China seems to be taking off after some stimulus)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qywuf2eecctc1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e1b0ec24b59f75edbffcfc738edaeba6741fec5\n\n[With inventories at lows, and SPR \\\\\"drained\\\\\" and economies heating up, its a recipe for more demand](https://preview.redd.it/adbh9elfcctc1.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6655397cc68a0175bf9656900299ff98b34b129)\n\n[Saudi needs \\> $90 oil to balance budget.

PAA doesn’t need a specific price for oil per se, it’s paid on volume pumped thru their pipes. Price can be a proxy for this (ie more demand, so price goes up) but it’s not the only thing (ie if oil was $1b a barrel bc there was only 1 barrel left, price would be high but volume low) so it depends why it’s spiking as well. ATM the market is focused on rates being higher (hence the sell off) this concept negatively affects pricing, especially on dividend companies, given it was .1% off, I’m not overly concerned but let’s see next months data and their earnings guidance first. So to answer is it depends on why oil is high, and more importantly regardless of the price of oil how are all the things going to affect the volume in PAA pipes going forward (how they make money).

The fact that retail spending was up this month is a good sign that things are still rocking along here. The worry about sticky inflation is that if rate cuts don’t come this year we could slip out of current growth period which could cause further slippage and falls in the market and possibly recession. But as long as there isn’t any serious news about further hikes, we’ll probably keep squeezing upwards as long as there are rate cuts somewhere in the horizon, even if it’s far off. A lot people are holding the sentiment that even if rate cuts don’t come this year it shouldn’t send the economy into a recession. I don’t think the FED comments from yesterday are gonna move the needle in either direction very much. I think we trade sideways for awhile til more news comes out. \n\nThere has been some bullish development with the Middle East though. US and EU are working towards more sanctions on Iran’s oil exports. While that doesn’t absolutely mean demand and volume will go up, it definitely doesn’t hurt. \n\nIn relation to oil price, I think as long as price stays where it currently is, (85-90 range) it’s a good spot for this play. Most economists are expecting barrel price to stay in this range til Q1 of next year which is good news for us if PAA ups their trunk rate off those numbers. \n\nLike OP has said many times in the comments, time is on our side. All of the macro still points towards a higher than expected demand going into the summer with some pieces still moving that could cause volume to skyrocket at any moment. But even if those pieces don’t come into play, things still look pretty good as long as we don’t get hit with more hotter inflation news. One Dovish comment from the FED on the next CPI next month and all this worry will wipe away. \n\nBut conversely, any more hawkish sentiment skewing towards further hikes or no rate cuts this year confirmed could wipe out any chance of gains til Q3/Q4. Either way it’s a wait and see game. If you’re looking to exit on this play, you should at least wait til the run up to earnings and exit right before the news.

If any of these things had been by itself or this news staggered at all, I think we would have already seen a recovery but we’re beyond that now so all we can do is hold on for those of us who can stomach it. \n\nI think once liquidity starts entering the market again we’ll see this rebound to around the $18 mark and hopefully from there growth will resume at a similar rate. Q1 projections still look good and hopefully their guidance will be good for this year, especially if barrel price hovers anywhere near $90 for the rest of the year. If the stock averages a measly .8% rise in price each week over the next five months, even if we go down to $17, we’ll be at $20 by mid September with room to grow even more if oil stays hot and summer has even close to the projected demand.

As soon as I saw the second red day I mentally prepared myself for seeing big red through this week, though we’re already around at 50% loss from our entry and that came quicker than expected. I did expect this much of a loss after Friday, I just thought the bleed would be slower throughout this week. But like I said, “hopefully” at the floor now. My hunch is we are pretty close to the floor for now but we’ll probably trade sideways from here til earnings hype come late next week leading into the next. We bounced off 17.15 back to 17.25-30 in the last hour when the last few days of closing trends has been to trickle towards the lower end of the day before the bell. \n\nThis is also the most I’ve ever invested into a single play, so while the red numbers are scary, remember there are plenty of variables at play for the perfect storm for an even bigger reverse, it cuts both ways. But I think it’s fair and relatively safe to assume we will at least have a better exit ramp in the future before these expire. Even if it’s still in the red, it shouldn’t be nearly as tough to swallow as the mini blood bath we saw this week. My current strategy is to wait and see what happens closer to Q1 and beyond Q2 earnings. I will probably add another 5-10 contracts towards the end of this week to help average down my cost and recover more profits on the way up, as the current price is hilariously when I added it to my options watchlist before pulling the trigger on watching consecutive up days. But I am going to wait for a couple of days in the green or at the very least, sideways days before I double down.  \n\nIf we don’t see a better shift upwards by mid summer,  I’ll cut losses and look for the next one but I have a feeling this will play out closer to how OP forecasted than to the lower end of things we’re seeing now. PAA after all is actually doing great even without our help trying to squeeze it up so as long as it continues on the trajectory it’s been on for three years we should find way healthier exits on this then what’s on the table currently. It’s easy to zoom in and see how fucked we are, but unless you were playing puts this week, a lot of people got smashed. You at the very least, have company at this level if that’s of any comfort, and I’m still holding. \n\nif rate hikes get mentioned in any official manner, be prepared to jump ship unless some other macro news is also in play to counter balance it, but I think what we currently just priced into the market was the possibility of no rate cuts or only one before years end. Though I wouldn’t be surprised if that news came out officially and we took an even bigger hit.

Why might they do this? Well, my guess is that they’re incentivized to keep the stock price as flat as possible, that way any time the stock dips, they can lower bids and asks on contracts, thus causing us retailers to panic and scoop up anyone who sells out of fear. I have this estimation because the contract asks never rise with meaningful intraday gains, meaning that there are MM now only lowballing bids, but keeping their listed asks low too because they know if they can keep the price of stock within range, they can always buy them back at the same price or even lower. But I could be wrong and this is just the choppiness of the market right now ping ponging on inflation data. Probably a bit of both. But it is odd to me that good news inflation data sent the stock on a dip. Rate cuts at all this year would be good news for us. Still ample time for your calls. Yes, even the august ones.
