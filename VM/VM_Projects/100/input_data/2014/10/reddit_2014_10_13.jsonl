They are very small compared to their competitors. They have a great product, sure, but so do the other car companies. The premise that Tesla is the only manufacturer capable of creating a high-performance EV is a bit ridiculous. Basic economics will show that if Tesla is able to earn above average profits than more competitors will enter the field until it's gone. This will happen. If Tesla proves its business model and shows profit, I highly doubt Toyota, Ford, GM, etc. will just sit back and say \"hey, good for them!\"\n1. The biggest problem plaguing EVs is the battery. This issue has been beat to death, I know, but it still deserves a mention. The battery is the most expensive part of the car and it depreciates the value the quickest. This is why we saw Tesla in April of 2013 institute that resale guarantee. Temperature, number/frequency of recharges, and a multitude of other factors affect battery life. The current consensus is that the packs should last 5-7 years, up to 20 years in lab conditions, before they reach 80 percent capacity and lose performance. \n1. The resale value guarantee, which is only available for 36-39 months from the date of purchase, is going to represent a major drag on profitability for the company. You don't have to look far down the financial statements to see that they added $55 million to their resale value guarantee liability this quarter. That is going to be a huge drag on profitability in three years, not to mention the $290 million they had at the start of this quarter. That's a pretty big potential liability for them to have to swallow in the next three years and it grows with every sale they make. My guess is they're making this bet with the idea that they can produce batteries for these cars for significantly cheaper in the future (i.e., three years), buy these cars back for cheap, replace the battery for a third of what they cost today, and resell them to the market in the hopes of making a profit on the transaction. This seems like a good idea, but if there are any setbacks this could literally cost them millions. Their gigafactory plans are pretty bold too. As of now they have no finalized agreements for the cell precursor materials, the cost of the factory is likely to be higher than they expected (they've never built one before), and nonetheless they have no experience in building lithium-ion cells. \n1. They're issuing more debt (about $3 billion as of now) and they're not profitable. \n\nI could probably go on and on about why it is a bad idea to buy stock in this company, but I'd rather let someone else write it out.

Today, all of the technicals that I mentioned (supports, RSIs, etc.) have all been broken except one (the strongest one): the 200 day moving average, which is ~$220 right now. The stock hasn't gone below that average in 2 years, and has found strong support near it or at it 4 times. Personally, if it goes below this level, I might take profits and wait until a real doom and gloom time to buy back in because I believe in the long term fundamentals of the company.\n\n\n**Fundamentals**\nThe reason Tesla is so highly valued is because they have met all of their business goals with excellent execution, and are taking many steps to be selling at least 500,000 cars at an average selling price of ~$58,000 by 2020. They also have the goal of getting to 15% operating margins in the future. So if we take this information and add a tax rate of 25%, then the net income in 2020 would be $3.26 billion and using a 20 P/E (this is a slight premium to the 15 P/E average for the auto industry because of high growth) will get a valuation of $65.25 billion in 2020. If we assume that the amount of shares goes up significantly to 145 million from today's 124.6 million, the per share price in 2020 would be $450. Discounting that at a high market rate of 8% per year over 6 years, we get the stock is worth $284 at the end of 2014 assuming that the company executes their plan. Currently, many people believe that Tesla will execute decently well on their plan as the stock is at $227. Using all the same numbers, the stock is currently pricing in that Tesla will sell about 400,000 cars in 2020 and that will represent all of their revenue. However, the stock does not take into account that Tesla plans to enter the battery storage industry, or that extra revenues can come from developing electric cars for partners, or allowing other car manufacturers to use their fast charging network for a pretty penny.\n\nSo overall, the main idea is that Tesla is a growth company, and it burns through money because it is expanding in so many different ways. For example, it is reducing battery costs below its already industry leading low costs building the Gigafactory. Also, Tesla is also rolling out a supercharging network, which has the fastest charging of any EV chargers. Without a Gigafactory to reduce costs or a fast charging network, the competition will not be able to take Tesla's market share, which means Tesla could easily do 500,000+ cars per year by 2020 assuming EVs catch on. Since Tesla already has a great product and is investing all of its profits into creating future excellent products, there is no reason for their EVs not to catch on. Within the next few years, Tesla will become more and more profitable and sell more and more cars and grow into their valuation. When looking at the fundamentals of a growth stock, you can't look at their current financials and say they are overvalued and look no further. You must look at future potential and likely-hood that they will execute their goals (a lot of investors currently believe in Tesla, thus the high price). So eventually, Tesla will grow into their valuation as long as they execute.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "> Tesla could easily do 500,000+ cars per year by 2020 assuming EVs catch on.\n\nDoes Tesla even have the capacity to produce that many cars?

In fact I probably take more value risks than most people trading here. \n\nThe fundamentals argument is made over and over on any stock that has a price spike. This is a fine and legitimate point of view to have, but keep in mind the concept of fundamentals. Fundamentals look at historical data to predict future data that is projected on growth dictated by the past, then applies a discount value for risks and money structure. This gives you the best approximation of the intrinsic value of the stock today. The question is do you believe stocks like this are fairly valued at intrinsic value alone, or do you believe that first mover advantages and moves to maintain a long term competitive edge (referring to battery factory here as one of many examples) deserve to command a premium in valuation multiples?

A year ago people couldn't believe Tesla was trading over $65, is that still a fair valuation for a year ago?

It makes sense there because historical data applies better to those stocks.
