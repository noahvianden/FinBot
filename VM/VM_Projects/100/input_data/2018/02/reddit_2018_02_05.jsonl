It's defined as the \"Closing Indicative Price\" which today was $4.22. The Closing Indicative Price is calculated at 4:15pm based on SPVXSP (Short-Term VIX Futures). But the 80% termination event condition is \"Intraday Indicative Price <= 20 % of prior day's Closing Indicative Price\", not the other way around. So if $4.22 is the Closing Indicative Price, then the Intraday Indicative Price tomorrow has to go below $0.844.\n\n> As discussed in more detail under “Specific Terms of the ETNs—Acceleration at Our Option or Upon an Acceleration Event” in this pricing supplement, an Acceleration Event includes any event that adversely affects our ability to hedge or our rights in connection with the ETNs, including, but not limited to, if the Intraday Indicative Value is equal to or less than 20% of the prior day’s Closing Indicative Value.\n\nIf that reading is correct, they will be required to shut down only if the other conditions for an \"Acceleration Event\" are met, the most likely one being their own liquidity/hedging requirements. But that puts things largely at their discretion.\n\nThere's also language in the prospectus that would make it easy to classify the Closing Indicative Price as a \"Market Disruption Event\" (basically, they say there wasn't enough liquidity/volume to justify the price, etc.).\n\nThere's **lots** of room for them to keep XIV from \"Acceleration\"--and certainly Credit Suisse will be motivated not to liquidate. Regulators will also probably not press for liquidation for fear of triggering a wider sell-off.\n\n", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Lol this is awesome.
