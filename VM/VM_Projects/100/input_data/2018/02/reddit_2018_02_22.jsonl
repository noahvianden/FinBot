But you will see Disney in Every single department, and as far as I can tell, that’s about the only brand that does that. I don’t mean just toys, books, or video games, but also wardrobe, grocery and even automotive. Disney’s evrywhere in that store.\n\nThink of how Disney’s expanded with Marvel and Star Wars, and let’s not forget Pixar’s branding. (Don’t forget to scope out the baby aisles.) Amazon grew to aquire more and more of Walmart’s customers-many being small town America and college towns who have had basically no other choice. In the midwest it’s important to understand what Walmart takes in from nearby Indian Tribes who have also had no other viable option...until Amazon. So, to me, not only do we see a massive hit from simple competition, but you also see a power flux in the way of their-or at least one of their biggest affiliates-Disney-gain a more level playing field and even maybe the upper hand. The relationship has been one of mutual benefit and balance, but what happens when people quit going to by Marvel and Pixar films at Walmart? What happens when people no longer even venture all the way to the back of the building, past all that Star Wars and Captain Amickeya, and BB8 oranges? And then what happens when sooner or later, Disney streams their catalogue for a monthly fee, and no one wants to spend $30 at walmart for a 50 year old cartoon that they can stream at home anytime for $20 a month.

But now Walmart is going to need Disney a hell of a lot more, while Disney may find it beneficial to pull back on that relationship.\n\nWalmarts dip has as much to do with the competition as it does with their surging investment in e-commerce. [This older article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/where-walmart-makes-most-of-its-money-2017-8) highlights this and points out Walmart has been **”shelling out billions of dollars in building up its online infrastructure in response to the long-run shift toward digital shopping.”**\n\n[This newer article](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/business/walmart-fourth-quarter-results.html) states that Walmart **”expected online sales to rise 40 percent over the next year.”** With plans that seem to follow Amazon’s path with Whole Foods. I believe that a good amount of that is in the way of subscriptions. And if there isn’t a streaming service planned somewhere in that, then I have severely overestimated them. Because if they can’t compete in the streaming market, Walmart will continue to decline as a retail leader, because **the physical copy is dead.** And with it, any electronics department and whatever cross revenue it may have promoted. Has this not been coming for some time now?\n\nSo in short, I’m saying Again that Walmart is behind in the streaming wars. I’m saying they are not only being hit by e-commerce competition, but also getting caught up in the shift of the consumer moving from physical copy, to monthly subscription fees.

I take ideas and run with them. I probably shouldn’t put such epicly speculative ideas here.

And I suppose I am thinking of the Disney Empire as a whole and the raw benefits of that relationship. Both in profit and exposure, and even in how it cultivates brand loyalty, for lack of better terms. Generations as consumer targets. And I have been speculating for a while what play retailers have in the streaming wars. And all the shifts in partnerships and investments lately has been really interesting to say the least. But I still wonder: if Walmart is to compete with Amazon do they not have to introduce a streaming platform, along with whatever major changes to internet and subscription services they have planned? Maybe not, but I think the subscription bubble will grow and quickly burst, as people realize they can’t exactly afford monthly subscription fees adding up to the thousands. So when Disney opens their streaming service, I feel like Netflix won’t be the only one losing some customers. Before long, with no need to rely on retailers *or* theaters, Disney will make their movies instantly available. No more middle man to pay off.\n\nLike you made clear though, I’ve missd that Walmart may have no desire or see it as particularly fruitful to put money in the Streaming Wars and doesn’t mind letting the electronics section wither away.
