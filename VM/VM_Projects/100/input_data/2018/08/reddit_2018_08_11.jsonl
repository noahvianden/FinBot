You're 23, this is the time in life to make risky plays. You have lots of time to recoup any losses.

This doesn't mean apple could never go down simply that even if it goes through a down cycle you have time to wait for it to rebound. Sure it's smart to not keep all your eggs in one basket but you can put future eggs in the new basket and apple is one hell of a solid basket.\nA lot of people don't actually fully understand diversification. It makes sense for people who have money and want to protect it not those who are trying to get money/grow it. Look at it this way, should you fund your 20th best idea because the first one isn't a sure thing? The reason diversification is so important for people with substantial assets is if you have enough investing all/ a lot in one company could actually substantially affect the share price and work against them. If you're buying a ton of shares which jumps the price it might inspire others to sell causing you to instantly lose money. So instead you spread your bets out lowering your risk (also usually your performance) in the name of safety for the whole shebang. You on the other hand are a kid with a few k invested.
