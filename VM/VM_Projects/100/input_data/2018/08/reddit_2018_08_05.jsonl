{"title": "Making a case for uranium miners. Why the market is poised for large profits. Tell me if I'm wrong, and why. DD inside.", "selftext": "Disclaimer: After reading several tips on /r/investing, and spending about three months completing research, I have built a position in Energy Fuels (UUUU), and will continue to do so. I am also looking at UEC, but I don't feel as strongly about them. A lot of this information I gathered has come from online research, as well as comments from reddit and other investing forums. It is economically clear that uranium is at the end of a prolonged bear market. \n\nThe current spot price of uranium is near an all time low. This is largely due to a surplus of uranium and an increase in decommissioned reactors. Both of these are the result of uranium reaching the apex of its previous bubble, and the events of Fukushima. However, that has all changed over the last year, and should continue to change at a parabolic rate. [Cameco](https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/mining/cameco-indefinitely-extends-mine-and-mill-shut-down-hundreds-to-be-laid-off) has shut down their uranium mining operation indefinitely, and Kazakhstan has initiated a [20% reduction in uranium mining](http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/UF-Kazakhstan-to-cut-uranium-production-0412177.html). Additionally, Paladin Energy has [discontinued uranium mining](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/energy-investing/uranium-investing/paladin-energy-pulls-plug-langer-heinrich/) on Langer Heinrich This creates a massive decrease in supply. \n\nThe World Nuclear Association states there are currently [50 reactors under construction](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide.aspx), with another 150 on order, and an additional 300 being proposed. This is approximately 160,000 MWe of power, all requiring uranium. These factors contribute to a massive increase in demand. \n\n[Several countries](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/30/world-powers-rush-build-huge-missile-laden-submarines/711058002/), including [Russia](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-o-s/russia-nuclear-power.aspx), [United States](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/usa-nuclear-power.aspx), [UK](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-royal-navy-building-nuclear-missile-submarine-could-kill-24835) [China](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/05/14/future-of-nuclear-power-in-china-pub-76311), [France](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/france-building-new-nuclear-powered-submarine-here-what-it-25808) are building numerous new nuclear reactors, submarines and aircraft carriers. This is what many are calling \"the beginning of a nuclear energy race\".\n\nJapan, who previously idled almost 60 nuclear reactors after the Fukushima incident, has [brought their nuclear energy market back to life](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2017/09/08/japan-may-be-coming-full-circle-after-its-fukushima-nuclear-energy-disaster/#3d67d36430e8). Five new reactors have been brought online, and \"many more may be on their way\". Japan, like all other countries has a desperate need for nuclear energy, and they are now shifting toward increased nuclear use. \n\n> \"One consequence of the accident was a gradual shutdown of all nuclear power plants, which has led to a significant rise in fossil fuels use, increased fuel imports and rising carbon dioxide emissions. It has also brought electricity prices to unsustainable levels,\" the International Energy Agency (IEA) reports.\n\nAt this point, I believe it is clear that the uranium market is in the beginning of a large turnaround. I evaluated several ETF's, miners and holding companies, and I believe Energy Fuels (UUUU) is the best positioned company over the next 1-5 years. They are at the beginning of a turn around. Their [recent earnings report](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/energy-fuels-announces-q2-2018-results-including-55-million-of-working-capital-2018-08-03) indicates,\n\n* $55 million in working capital\n* $27 million in quarterly revenue\n* $7 million quarterly net\n\nEnergy Fuels has been able to innovate, cut costs, and remain cash flow positive, while maintaining the largest uranium mining operation in the United States. During the previous commodity bull run, this company traded at $200. It current trades at approx $3.50, and has almost doubled its share price and volume over the last 6 months. This is the bottom. \n\nThe United States has launched a [Section 232 investigation](https://agmetalminer.com/2018/07/19/this-morning-in-metals-doc-launches-section-232-uranium-investigation/) in an effort to analyze security threats from massive uranium imports. \n\n> “Our production of uranium necessary for military and electric power has dropped from 49 percent of our consumption to five percent,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a release. “The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security will conduct a thorough, fair, and transparent review to determine whether uranium imports threaten to impair national security.”\n\nCurrently, [less than 3%](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2018/04/10/top-u-s-uranium-producer-files-section-232-petition.html) of the uranium consumed in the U.S. is produced domestically. The Petition seeks a remedy which will set a quota to limit imports of uranium into the U.S., effectively reserving 25% of the U.S. nuclear market for U.S. uranium production. The petition also requests \"implementation of a requirement for U.S. federal utilities and agencies to buy U.S. uranium in accordance with the President's Buy American Policy.\"\n\nIf passed, Energy Fuels stands to be the largest benefactor, as they are the best uranium mining organization in the United States. \n\nIn addition, Energy Fuels has [resumed Vanadium production](http://www.energyfuels.com/news-pr/energy-fuels-to-resume-vanadium-production-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-2018/), and \"expects to recover significant quantities of currently dissolved vanadium (as V2O5) from pond solutions at the Company’s White Mesa Mill\". \n\n> Vanadium prices have risen by more than 400% over the past 24 months to about US $15 per pound V2O5.\n\nI can continue to share my findings, but I don't want a really big wall of text. I'd like to hear comments and criticisms from people smarter than myself, which is most people. \n\nTLDR: The uranium market is poised for large gains over the next 1-5 years.

With the price so high everyone with a drilling rig became a uranium explorer. Like all commodities, uranium went through yet another boom bust cycle aided by the Fukushima incident. Today there are less than 40 listed companies in the uranium space.\n\nThe cure for low prices is low prices\n\nAs Cameco recently demonstrated the price of uranium is UNSUSTAINABLY low. It is not profitable to mine the stuff under $50 and no new production will ever come online until a sustained price closer to $70 is reached. This means, in simple math, the supply is and will be less than the demand thus forcing the price of the commodity back to a sustainable level.  It really is that simple\n\nWould you have turned your nose up when oil was in the teens a few years ago?  Was oil going out of style? Of course not. The time to buy oil was after the 08 financial crisis when no one wanted it and everyone was screaming that it would never recover...it's $80 now for Brent.\n\nThe same logic applies to uranium now.\n\nAs the topic post points out the demand is surging and the supply is diminishing...that can only mean one thing...higher prices. It's not an \"if\" question only a \"when\"  question\n\nEnter UUUU. UUUU has a very specific catalyst on the near term horizon...section 232 and a mandated quota requiring US utilities (100 of them) to buy 25% of their fuel from domestic sources. UUUU is the best capitalized, most liquid, largest producer with the ability to ramp up production quickly of the very few remaining US miners. The fact that there really are only 3 or 4 names to invest in is a huge bonus as is UUUUs ability to tap other markets like Vanadium which is at an all time high near $20. There simply is not other play with the leverage, skill, resources and advantages to take the lead in the new uranium bull market that MUST see the price recover to at least double the current spot price\n\nIf you study up on the two previous bull markets...2006 and 2011 you'll see that nothing but bitcoin can rival uranium. The market has a captive audience that cannot resort to alternatives. Nuclear is the ONLY carbon free base load provider of electricity and it's place in the world energy mix is very very secure.\n\nI'm certainly talking my book here but it's because I've done the homework.

They actually have built their fuel for the next several,cycles years ago. \n\nWith plants shutting down, as well as starting up the demand side is questionable. \n\nThe commodities price is very low...as in way too low for a mine operation. So eventually the supply will get depleted and price will return to “mining” price levels. \n\nI will watch and follow. Interesting story here.

You do not buy these things or evaluate them as you would AT&T. Because they are extremely cyclical they go through booms and busts routinely. You buy them when they look the worst in anticipation of the next boom cycle.  The reason for UUUU is NOT about the past, it's about now and the future. There were 900 uranium related stocks a few years ago...now there are 40 and in the US there's only 2 or 3 with UUUU being the clear leader. It's all about the future not the past. It's about section 232 giving UUUU a $30 premium over global contact prices, it's about uranium having to return to $60 or more, it's about net reactor builds globally etc. It's about what will be not what was.
