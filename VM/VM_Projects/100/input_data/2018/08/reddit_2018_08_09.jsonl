Although unit growth may slow, prices should continue to rise, yielding continued sales growth.\n* Lack of ability to estimate brand equity and ecosystem value. These are intangibles that don't show up in the company's EPS or other financials, so many investors don't know how to ascribe value to them.\n   * Apple's brand and closed ecosystem creates a loyal community of users with high switching costs, where even if they might prefer some non-Apple device better, the ecosystem (iTunes, apps, etc.) keeps them with Apple. This gives Apple a wide economic moat.\n* Classification of Apple as a hardware company instead of a consumer brand. Hardware companies are typically valued at much lower multiples of earnings and cash flow due to the cyclicality of products and the existential risk of technological obsolescence.\n   * Apple is becoming more and more recognized as what it really is: a consumer brand, not just a hardware company. This is a key tenet of Buffett's long thesis on Apple.\n   * Its unique ability to combine beautifully designed hardware with its easy-to-use software/app ecosystem makes it more of a consumer company than a technology company. It's priced far too cheaply for a leading consumer brand.\n* Ignorance of \"moon shot\" growth investments that penalize near-term earnings but could yield massive long-term payoffs.\n   * The consistent free cash flow from its software and services business enables it to enter markets that investors don't yet anticipate.

In case you want some \"justification\" for your \"thoughtful investing decisions\", here is some Micron DD\\* (see footnote). Micron is in the business of making memory chips including: 1)  [DRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory), used in everything from computers and graphics cards, to video game consoles and mobile devices for dynamic, volatile memory storage; and 2) [NAND memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory) used for persistent storage in things like SSDs and USB keys. If you've been subscribed to this subreddit for any length of time, you're probably well aware that their forward P/E **is below 4.6** and their 12-month trailing P/E similarly attractive (just under 5.4). They've worked this year to become net cash-positive by paying down debts and announced plans to commence a $10B stock buyback program and otherwise return 50% of free-cash-flow back to investors starting in the next fiscal year (September).\n\n**DRAM**\n\nDue to the ubiquitous and interchangeable nature of DRAM chips, many analysts consider DRAM manufacturers to be producing a commodity--while this is true to an extent, there are barriers to entry that make competition from new entrants somewhat difficult, and the interchangeable nature of memory chips helps to mitigate some of the downside (e.g., tradewar) concerns that people have. Typically, commodity manufacturers have to work to distinguish themselves -- either really push efficiency and squeeze every last ounce of margin out of the product, or have flashy branding, or better quality, etc. Soybeans are a commodity; toasters are a commodity, GoPros (i.e. mobile recording cameras using relatively unsophisticated technology in their manufacture), are a commodity--cheap knockoffs are trivial to manufacture, so GoPro may lose market share if they don't aggressively market their brand.\n\nDRAM has one characteristic that distinguishes it from the above products: it is still hard to manufacture and requires skilled, technical know-how and execution. It's only \"easy\" in the sense that the process is *straightforward provided you already have* established fabrication labs and process technologies-- look at how much trouble Tesla had establishing a car production line from scratch, despite employing smart, capable people. Now imagine building from scratch a process that creates physical chips requiring nanometer scale precision with fewer than 1.4 defects per million chips. For reference and sense of scale, a human hair is \\~100000nm wide, a human cheek cell is \\~60000nm in diameter, and a strand of DNA is \\~2.5nm wide. Samsung and Hynix, two of the three primary global manufacturers of DRAM, each experienced in DRAM production and efficiencies, both have announced difficulties and delays in manufacturing the next generation of 10-nanometer (i.e. sub-20nm) DRAM, showing that it's not easy for even sophisticated incumbents to roll out the required tech. I mention all of this to address concerns people have about Chinese entrants into the market; these manufacturers are only now beginning *trial production* of 30-nanometer DRAM, and plan to scale down to 20-nanometer DRAM later this year. Even if fully successful, volume will be very low, and additional capacity won't come online for several years yet. It's unclear whether these producers even have the IP rights to sell chips outside of China (the counter argument is that China doesn't care about selling outside of China when they have such a large domestic population; this doesn't seem to be an unreasonable argument, but realization of this is still years away and organic demand growth will certainly help mitigate this -- perhaps the tariffs will cause movement on Chinese policy here, perhaps the TPP will come back, perhaps there will be some other solution in the intervening half-decade that brings China to western norms of IP protection). All of this is not to say that that China won't eventually be able to be a viable competitor in the marketplace, but that it is, at best, many years away.\n\n**NAND**\n\nThe other major item that Micron produces is NAND \"flash\" memory, used in USB keys and SSDs. This carries lower margins generally, and is limited in margin/sales price by the availability of HDDs as a competitor for long-term storage. There are five total major market participants in the NAND memory space, which lends itself to a higher risk of incumbent participant overproduction than the three participants in the DRAM space, which accounts for some of the lower margins. Similarly, manufacture of the chips requires somewhat less sophisticated technology except for when pushing the extremes of memory density. Moore's law has come close to running it's course in a the X-Y plane, forcing memory chips to build layers in the Z-dimension to add memory capacity; this is also not trivial feat, but something that Micron (along with Intel) is doing well in.\n\n\\*Breaking DD: Chinese competitor in NAND market\\*\n\nThere was a [thread last night]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95ryef/china\\_to\\_mass\\_produce\\_3d\\_chips\\_next\\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95ryef/china_to_mass_produce_3d_chips_next_year/)) about an upstart competitor from China producing 96-layer NAND chips. [This thread from a few hours ago]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95uqb5/why\\_that\\_article\\_on\\_yangtze\\_memory\\_going\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95uqb5/why_that_article_on_yangtze_memory_going_to/)) has a reasonable rebuttal, and I would like to add just a few things to it: 1) the second thread is indeed correct to question the notion of a NAND \"glut\" -- prices are simply off record levels, and have stabilized; 2) [this article]([https://www.anandtech.com/show/13166/yangtze-memory-unveils-xtacking-architecture-for-3d-nand-up-to-3-gbps-io](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13166/yangtze-memory-unveils-xtacking-architecture-for-3d-nand-up-to-3-gbps-io)) mentions them using 180nm technology in it which is seemingly ancient technology and this tech supposedly **doubles** the throughput of their competitors' highest-end product? If true, could be very good for them, but I'll wait to see this magic chip. In any case, I'll have to, as the lab is supposedly small and capacity won't scale for years at the earliest.\n\n**Industry-wide (Non)-Ease of Scaling to Provide Additional Supply**\n\nScaling to provide new additional DRAM is, following on the above reasons, much more difficult than it was in previous years.\n\n[https://imgur.com/AW72QOq](https://imgur.com/AW72QOq)\n\nThat means that any attempt to scale will require much more CapEx than past generations of DRAM--the barriers to entry are higher, and also the incentives to not overproduce.\n\n**Growth Case**\n\nThe vision for growth in the memory space relies on four major areas: 1) Cloud; 2) Mobile; 3) Automotive; 4) \"Internet of Things\"; 5) Consumer PC. Each of the four above growth areas rely in part on the \"virtuous cycle\" thesis, wherein the potential for data-driven decisions push demand for data storage (NAND-based) and then building software that can effectively mine this data using DRAM to provide in-process memory for that software; a marginal investment in one drives marginal investment in the other, and as computer learning gets better, there is more justification for either of the above. Growth for DRAM is expected to be \\~20% y/y for the foreseeable future and \\~40% for NAND.\n\n*Cloud*\n\nFar and away the biggest market segment for Micron and industry participants is the Cloud and server/PC sector. Accelerated compute ideal for AI applications have been driving, and are expected to drive, premium cloud offerings over the next few years and are DRAM intensive. Please note that every. single. company. connected to cloud services this earnings cycle continues to show good profitability and good forecasts for profitability into the future (if you are able to show me a company that reported bad cloud forecasts, please do, and I'll show you a company you should probably short). It's worth noting that one of Micron's competitors, Samsung, reported in their most recent earnings good sales and forecasts for DRAM and NAND memory in the cloud sector going forward (consistent with everyone else). Every graphics card that AMD or NVIDIA that becomes operational in the cloud for emergent computing needs, or is sold to a consumer, might have Micron memory underlying it.\n\n*Mobile*\n\nEvery cellphone/tablet/ etc that is manufactured requires both flash storage and DRAM for in-app memory. There have been some \"storm clouds\" here as consumer replacement cycles for mobile devices have increased from 23 months to over 30 months, and (for example) Apple reported approximately flat iPhone unit sales (even as iPhone revenues increased) in their last quarterly earnings. Even so, current projections still anticipate rich mobile application needs to drive average DRAM/phone to double and NAND usage to triple over the next few years. Anticipated enterprise mobile client requirements are 12GB of DRAM and 1TB of NAND in flagship products.\n\n*Automotive*\n\nAs autonomous and quasi-autonomous vehicles begin to be produced, I want you to imagine a world where all of the data collected by every sensor on the car is stored and uploaded to the cloud for future analysis/datamining --- driving not only better autonomous algorithms, but being used to identify locations on the highway or particular intersections where lots of \"near misses\" occur -- things like this already happen in modern commercial aircraft, where things like airspeed and flap position and engine parameters are recorded every 0.25 seconds for the duration of the flight, uploaded instantly via wifi to servers upon arrival of the airplane at the destination, and datamined with all of the other available data. Every sensor on every quasi-autonomous vehicle manufactured in the future will not only require storage space onboard the vehicle, but storage to analyze the data later. Even if companies like Tesla aren't currently storing all data generated by every car, eventually one of them \\*will\\* move to an opt-out data collection process; it's just a matter of time.\n\n*Internet of Things*\n\nThis may feel like one of the more \"pie-in-the-sky\", perpetually 10-years away growth opportunities, in part because the current market segment is extremely small and somewhat abstract, but allow me to point out one current market on this list: \"Smart\" internet-connected security cameras (home or otherwise) -- these are cameras capable of storing and uploading video footage to the cloud; this requires not only cloud space, but memory on the device to buffer against temporary internet outages; memory growth needs in this segment is anticipated to be 16x for both DRAM and NAND within the next five years. It's worth pointing out that this is the smallest current driver of projected growth and current business, so if none of this segment pans out, little of Micron's value is affected, but if it does pan out--it'll be good.\n\n*Other Consumer*\n\nThere's not too much to say here -- consumer laptops and PCs aren't going anywhere and storage/memory needs continue to grow.\n\n*Additional DD from the Flash Memory Summit 8/8/2018*\n\n[https://www.anandtech.com/show/13184/flash-memory-summit-2018-micron-keynote-live-blog-qlc-flash](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13184/flash-memory-summit-2018-micron-keynote-live-blog-qlc-flash)\n\n**StOrMy ClOuDs**\n\nRecently, a Chinese court issued a preliminary injunction against Micron, prohibiting them from selling *certain* DRAM chips in China. These chips in China account for \\~1% of annual revenue and Micron has since reiterated that this action does not change their forward-looking revenue guidance range. Here is where the commodity-like status of DRAM and NAND chips, together with the relatively inelastic supply of these chips, work into Micron's favor. Chinese consumers of these chips need to get them from *somewhere* \\-- so they'll go to Micron's competitors. These competitors, however, only have a limited supply, so to the extent that they are able to supply Chinese consumers, they are similarly unable to provide chips to other world-wide consumers-- allowing Micron to step in and fill the gap world-wide and serve those consumers that SK Hynix and Samsung no longer have the capacity to supply. This is similar to what happened in soybeans -- initially, after the soybean tariffs were announced, the futures markets crashed due to traders in Asia offloading risk from US soybeans to Brazilian soybeans. Then, hours later, as Europe woke up -- they don't have a preference between US and Brazilian soybeans, so they'll take the cheaper US soybeans -- soybeans futures recovered fairly quickly.\n\nI don't mean to understate it--soybean farmers have been having a tough time--but a good part of that is weather-related: this has been a good growing season for soybeans (and so lots of available supply). Soybeans have since rallied a fair bit off the lows driven by tariff speculation. Even if everything blows up and China kicks ALL of Micron out of China -- all that means is the market shifts around. Yes, it's disruptive to existing supply chains and relationships, but also n.b. that is not a positive or desired outcome, from China's perspective, for their internal consumers of memory chips scrambling to fill supply from the two remaining supplier, at higher prices. N.b., further, that China has still specifically not targeted Micron products in the trade war.  I believe the trade war fears have been oversold.\n\n*US Tariffs on Semiconductor Industry*\n\nDiscussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95gmh3/rip_mu_tt/), the US announced tariffs on semiconductors from China. This isn't as bad for Micron as it may first appear-- they have manufacturing facilities outside of China for import of those chips *into* china, for inclusion in other derivative products. They also have manufacturing facilities within the US that sell to and around the US. The primary hit that Micron will take from the tariffs would be the impact of reduced demand for derivative products (e.g., cellphones, laptops) manufactured in China using Micron components and then exported back to the US. Much more directly impacted would be the companies selling those laptops and cellphones (i.e., Apple, Dell, etc). The exact impact on demand is likely to be complicated and dependent on the specific product and niche it occupies -- Apple may be willing to eat most of the cost of the tariffs (by taking a lower margin on the phone) to keep demand up, but low-margin, super cheap laptops and knock-off phones may not have any choice but to pass increased costs onto the consumer; the ultimate impact on sales then depends on the elasticity of the demand curve--which I suspect is at least somewhat inelastic: cellphones are not highly discretionary purchases at this point.\n\n**Return of Shareholder Value**\n\nHere's the kicker that really sweetens the pot. Micron has already approved a stock buyback program wherein $10 billion will be used to purchase Micron shares, starting in September and lasting for nine-months. For context, using MU's average daily trading volume of \\~45.5 million, and let's assume an average buy-back price of \\~$60/share (n.b. that if micron stock price stays deflated, the following number goes UP), then over the next nine months, approximately ($10B / $60/share / (5 trading days/week \\* 4.5 weeks/month \\* 9 months ) / 45.5 million shares) \\* 100%  = \\~1.7% of Micron's daily trading volume, each trading day, will be used to *indefinitely remove shares of MU stock from circulation*. This should theoretically produce \\~$8 of stock rise in the absence of any other input. Additionally, they have pledged to return 50% of free cash flow to investors starting in FY 2019 -- we will see in earnings what these might be projected to be, but holding 2017 numbers steady would equate to a yield of \\~10% based on current valuation, assuming no potential for future growth in an industry that everyone believes will have future growth -- eat your heart out ALLY SAVINGS.\n\n**Conclusion/Reiteration of the Fundamental Case**\n\nWhen previous market cycles found an overproduction of computer memory, there were far more market participants and hence higher pressure to produce chips and drive down margins; marketplaces with so few participants more rarely see overproduction, and with such a recent history of it, the management of all the incumbents are likely to be hesitant to expand production beyond what they view as surely sustainable. Micron just doesn't carry the same risks the industry had several years ago to warrant a P/E ratio of 5, trailing earnings: they do not have unsustainable dividends; they do not have a flooded marketplace likely to overproduce (indeed, Samsung and SK Hynix announced plans to delay expansion, precisely so that the industry would be sure to not overproduce); they are producing into and for a sector with organic growth, increasingly (if not completely) isolated from the cyclicality of the PC and mobile phone markets; concerns over the Chinese ruling are overblown, with the ruling not even affecting the company's guidance for the quarter.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* [Sanjay and Papa Bezos be like](https://imgur.com/b90Dmgi)\n* [Sanjay and Satya Nadella be like](https://imgur.com/4bc1L23)\n* [Sanjay and Larry Page be like](https://imgur.com/khb4U6h)\n* [Sanjay and Lisa Su be like](https://imgur.com/31BEfXq)\n* [Sanjay and the entire cloud-based industry be like](https://imgur.com/sCMnuG5)\n* [It's time to get on the MU train](https://imgur.com/sHI5jHP)\n\n**Proof of long position**:\n\nAlbum link b/c I've got money spread across several different brokers/accounts: [album](https://imgur.com/a/FUo7BpM)\n\n**Footnote/Disclaimer**: I am not an investment advisor and none of this is investment advice. \"FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY\"... you fucking sheep\n\n\n\\* Edit: formatting\n", "id": "95vtp4", "created_utc": 1533816158.0, "score": 414, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "I read the first few paragraphs and then saw how much more reading there was and then scrolled to the bottom without reading the rest to comment the following.\n\nThe length of this DD has given me enough confidence to buy 2k worth of calls.
