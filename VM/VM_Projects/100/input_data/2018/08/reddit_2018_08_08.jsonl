Oh and red dead redemption 2 and NBA both come out in October.. Meaning they won't compete against winter games like cod and battlefield.\n\nDoes this mean you can't buy and hold? Of course not. Any of them are solid picks. I suspect ttwo will kill it for a while now. They killed it with gta5 for half a decade until the profits came raining down last year...which is insane for a game to be popular for so long.. Red dead might do the same but until that game is out and we see it's full potential... It's hard to say and predict 1 year from now. Gta online was the 5 decade catalyst..

Even earnings can be (aside from a few). You wont know where it will land, and when it does land you wont know what the sentiment will be the next day either. This side of trading is pure gamble and should be avoided. As amazing as the stocks you mentioned can be post ER... theres those that drop after open too... For me it was Canada Goose & Weibo, I sold at open and didn't think twice about it, they dropped... the same has happened to me where I sold and it moved up 5%... but the fact that I walked out with gains should be good enough)\n\nBecause... sometimes a stock does well on earnings moves up/down and then continues to move up all day... other times it does horrible sinks and moves down/up after open. Dont focus on this shit, you will set yourself up for failure and learn the hardway.\n\nSo it all comes back to fundementals and what the stock revealed in the earnings. Is the company a legit stock but just dropped (sell off possibly), then its a buy. Did it not do good and its going back down?... I would just avoid man. The way I see match for example is that it tells me that there is momentum beyond current price it landed yesterday... Did I miss out on it today? Sure...but everything falls eventually (who is to say when I buy it, the sell off begins)... so its better to wait for the opportunities to buy. And if it never comes, so be it. Have 40 other stocks on your watchlist, some are bound to drop eventually for nothing that is a good enough of a reason to justify it(i.e. Apple in Feb). Otherwise buy and forget it, it wont matter in years to come if you just want to hold. Like nobody expected DBX to move like this today. The momentum picked up and people bought in, which caused a chain reaction. Who knows what earnings will do in an hour... could just be a sell off. Point being these are all examples of pure luck. The bold limit luck as much as they can in this game.\n\nIdeally and the easiest to \"predict\" and make money on..is the run up game (1 month to 2 weeks before earnings). If the stock is legit and you see its far from ATH and has strong momentum., and its down because of either macro economics affecting the stock or just bad PR... There is a good chance it will have a solid run up (And possibly a solid earnings too). If its not (at ATH, horrible guidance, bad news truly is bad, etc)... it could stagnate or even sell out of fear further before ER (but these if they prove otherwise get a shock jump of 10%+ too...). Then there is always news that could push a company up and down, if you follow it with enough effort you can catch it early enough to make some money in a few hours. Some news are just so bad/good that there is an inevitable reaction in that direction. Like Tesla announcing it going public (Great opportunity to buy for a few hours)... but when everyone goes... \"hey.... with what money Mr. Musk, you broke as fuck?\" It is bound to go down. I managed to buy it at open today and sell it for 300% on a FD because of this, for this very reason. The analysts were all questioning him and calling him out on his bullshit.\n\nAt the end of the day, you dont want FOMO and make mistakes. What you want is consistent wins and if those exist on the run up. Focus on it. Theres 1000s of opportunities and with earnings each stock has those every 3-4 months.   You are always better off holding cash (if your goal is to trade) and wait for opportuntiies to open up. Usually a sell off on b/s news on a company with lots of mementum is the way to go.... i.e. Miron right now is at a fantastic price, could it go lower? sure, tariff shit is still to come in the coming weeks... however by Jan, I dont see it mattering one bit.

I'm trying to focus on evaluating how much companies are worth at a given price, but it's proving difficult since I'm still trying to understand what sources to use and what metrics to evaluate.\n\n>The longer I keep thinking I could make more at this very point the more likely I am to finally fucking up and fuck ups can cause a chain reaction (you fuck upon position A... so you open up a position in B to go back to where you were on fuck up A... only now you have fuck up A and fuck up B to deal with... this kind of reaction also happens with my dumb monkey brains)\n\nAgreed. Kinda like chasing losses when gambling.\n\n>Also remember the 300% gains that some one posted... those folks are only posting their winnings that got upvoted for you to see. We have 100,000 people with a dozen or so posting major wins every day. The reality is, they are the outliers in this very moment. In the future you will hit that and make a post and give some one else feeling like you are feeling the same feeling. We all have our moments of winning and our moments of losing. The key is to have the discipline and the mindset to take play it safe and steady. A few 15% wins can catch up to the one 300% win very quick... because each 15% win in the future is compounding the previous 15% win inside it so the returns are even higher.\n\nThis makes sense. We tend to forget the wins we have and get greedy for more. I just won on Twilio the other day, but completely forgot about it and was focusing only on what I didn't have. If I bought in now, I could potentially lose all my profit and possible more. Regarding the compounding returns, this is also why I can't wait to get a steady income to contribute to build up my portfolio even quicker.\n\n>As for Micron... I feel you bud, I have been burnt by this stock many times too but I have won from it at equal amounts to still not completely hate it. Are you holding options? If so what is the expiry? And if its not options... DO NOT even worry about the price.\n\nI don't own any options and quite honestly I don't think it's a good idea for me to consider them yet until I get more comfortable with regular shares. I don't see too much value in options in my situation because I'd be essentially paying a premium to make a prediction on where the stock price will be at a certain point in time when most of the times I have my hands full trying to predict whether the stock will even go up or down from where it is at currently. At least with most companies, I would be able to hold and eventually profit.\n\n>1 year from now it wont even matter. Everybody has lost money on this and with time (if they held) gained it back.\n\nThis is why I was considering doubling down on my position since it's relatively cheap right now. The only concern is that my portfolio allocation would be messed up heavily towards Micron.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The twilio feeling reminds me of something I realized working in IT. IT (at least network administration side) is 60% customer service and 40% technical (At least the good one that companies pay a premium for). I could do 100s of good things for a client but 1 or 2 mistakes... and I will forever be remembered for the mistakes. I will have to scale a mountain of doing good things to gain back the trust that I had before and erase the mistakes that now reside in my clients minds. Its not always the case, some people aren't as bad and understand that human error is part of the equitation but for others it definitely like that.\n\nI think again like FOMO being hard wired... this is also hard wired at some evolutionary level. You dont need to remember and fixate on the good... because well.. the good brings good things that are what they are. However the bad.. that is where we SHOULD fixate because they can harm and damage us if we are not carefully pondering it. At a caveman level for example... fixating on a sabertooth tiger makes sense right. Cant be complacent when there are monsters out there and only think about the caveman pussy you will get back in the cave. So it making sense at that place/time in life. Those that fixated on the caveman pussy got eaten alive while those who focused on the negativity survived long enough for us to get here. Made total sense... But in the world we live in now... problems like these in certain aspects of life (like trading) are almost alien, we have evolved socially/technologically WAY beyond our primitive biology. Its why sociopaths are very good at this because of the lack of feelings they generate from not just wins... but more importantly being indifferent to losses.   \nI won big this week, I was elated for maybe the first 10 minutes at open until I closed my winning positions. Now? 4 hours later... all that's in my mind is my MU bags at 54. I cant help but not give this my center of attention whenever I open my portfolio... and think about the weeks to come. This is what makes \"trading\" exhausting and just buying and holding for years... peaceful (at least until a major correction/recession occurs). But its not all bad, becoming more seasioned has gotten me to jump in with FOMO less and less. I have transformed my bad from being something that was impatient driver for failture to something who realizes we live in volatile times now and patience is the tool we need to come out on top.... everything can and will crash (correction level of <10%) with a tweet form the POTUS alone.\n\nWe gotta overcome mental barriers that our primitive brain sets (Whether its FOMO, focusing on the bad, forgetting the wins, getting impatient, etc) and evolve them to work for us. Only experience like all things can mold this.\n\nIf its stocks and not options you got... Dont worry! Will you miss out on potentially 20% or so ? sure... but whats that in the grand scale of things? Every single person has FOMO from last years price. Nobody expected Apple to hit 1 trillion a few years ago... I certainly didn't expect Netflix to go above 200 from last year and never played it after. It hit 400+ this year.\n\nIf you want to trade... just know there are a lot of bear catalysts in the upcoming weeks. I personally would avoid buying anything until it clears off by late September.
