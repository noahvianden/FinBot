Let me clarify specifically.\n\n> But going down to 200 or even 150 is extremely unrealistic \n\nThis seems to be an example of recency bias, if you consider the average analyst projected EPS for the current year (2.7), then the P/E ratio sits at about 119, a high valuation by most standards. But even when considering the average analyst projected EPS for 2019 (4.36), the forward P/E sits at 73.8. Hypothetically speaking, if NFLX was to drop to 200, its forward P/E (using this same 2019 estimate) would be 45.8, and even at 150, this forward P/E is at 34.4. For a frame a reference, using the average analyst projected EPS of FB for 2019 yields a forward P/E of 20.8, well below the even 50% drop price of 150 for NFLX. I am not saying that P/E is the be-all-end-all of valuation or that FB is the best comparison, but to say that these prices are unrealistic is not accurate. Also keep in mind these ratios are after NFLX has taken \\~20% decline from its high in July.\n\n> Netflix's user base has been constantly,  rather exponentially, growing until the last quarter \n\nThe problem, as foreshadowed above, is that Netflix is priced to be the global titan of steaming, with massive growth expectations currently priced into the valuation. If there are any signs that the user growth is slowing, these expectations will not be met, and the share price will be reduced accordingly.\n\n> Disney has pulled out some of its contents from Netflix \n\nThis is a minor list of Disney content which had licenses expire, not the massive content exodus Disney is planning by the end of 2018 into 2019. And while I agree that users will not switch immediately, this industry has relatively low switching costs, as all memberships are electronic and not contract-based. The main point being here that NFLX loses some of their content while a competitor emerges, which could affect the growth of NFLX, an important aspect of their valuation. It is also important to note that the market is very forward-looking, which is why so much growth is priced into NFLX and why Disney pulling content in the future (and launching their own streaming service) is relevant now.\n\n> Netflix has a $140B market cap at the current price, $322.  Putting its share into $200 would make it roughly a $85B market cap. $150 (really?) would make it a $64B. \n\nMarket cap is a relatively abstract concept, especially when only comparing a company to itself. How do we know what the market cap of NFLX should be, or what is high/low for NFLX? This is why other valuation ratios or measures like P/E, PEG, P/B, DDM, etc are used.\n\n> By next year, Disney streaming service will be a new feature. It will have tons of bugs and tons of issues which users will have to experience. \n\nIf the Disney/Fox deal goes through as I read it, Disney will own a controlling stake in Hulu, potentially opening the door for that platform to become their flagship streaming service. Disney also recently launched ESPN+, getting their foot in the door of subscriber-based streaming content, and has had WatchESPN for a few years now. I also believe they acquired the MLB streaming platform of BAMTech, giving them more expertise in the streaming area. These concerns seem to be minor, and the real issue of launching a new streaming service would be marketing and convincing users to switch/add their platform.\n\n> We can also see this same pattern from $TSLA (smaller market cap - around $50B - meaning more volatility expected) which used to be $360 dropped down to $270 (lost about 25%) and bounced back up to $360 again (now 330).  \n\nI strongly disagree with this comparison for several reasons; this is a completely different industry, the company is at a very different stage of its life (and balance sheet), the companies are valued based on different measures (net subscribers added vs cars produced). But more importantly, the TSLA moves were entirely news based: Q2 earnings were not great but guidance said will be sustainably profitable, then Musk announced he was taking the company private at about a 20% premium. Note that he would NOT be moving out of the company, because he currently owns a 20% stake and would maintain ownership and role as CEO if the company goes private. NFLX does not have any similar news driving the price and thus similar claims regarding its future movements should not be made. Then considering that these \"news\" types are vastly different, TSLA \"going private\" vs a NFLX competitor buying intellectual property from a similar competitor, I do not see any similarities worth noting for attempting to project NFLX stock movement from TSLA.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I think a price increase is inevitable. as the poster of this mentions, no one really pays attention to the cost. a $2-$5 increase in price will be meaningfully accretive. not if, but when they raise prices, they won’t see many users leave as it’s still a good value.
