However, I think they should only be for children, working people, and people who worked all their life. However, I don't believe in a $15 minimum wage. If the minimum wage is indexed to COL, it should be indexed in a way that makes people doing menial jobs still feel poor. I'm sorry if that sounds heartless, but no one is motivated to do anything unless it hits them in their wallet. The friend I described only started working again after a homeless stint when everyone else kicked him out and his friend's parents gave him an ultimatum to start working. Unfortunately, even with the alternative being working poverty, many still don't have that drive. But in a capitalist society, that's all we have to motivate people. Just because people exist doesn't mean they automatically should be entitled to a portion of other's earnings, or wealth, which is a product of their earnings and sacrifice.\n\nI don't feel that thinking that should be construed as me siding with billionaires. That's me siding with people, regardless of how much they're worth, who had the drive (and yes, luck) to start and be successful at a business; or the drive to study hard, go to college, and get a good job. Either of those two outcomes are more desirable, as they are more likely to be fulfilling, and less likely to be automated away in the next Industrial/AI Revolution, than menial, currently low-wage jobs. \n\nIf you think, like I do, that the most effective incentive is financial, then taking from those with more to give to those with less motivates the opposite of what you want to achieve. Sure, it will make you feel good, just like giving a homeless person money. But it won't solve that person's problems, because their root problem isn't lack of money, it's something more complicated. Perhaps it's alcoholism, or lack of drive (whether that's physical or intellectual) or both. \n\nThe only time I'd say perhaps differently is inheritance.

It's to give people who were born without an opportunity a chance to make something of themselves by allowing them some level of financial freedom so that they can spend their time and energy going to school and bettering themselves rather than spending all their time paying medical bills, student loans, rent, food, etc especially if they don't have a reliable financial safety net at home which many Americans don't have.
