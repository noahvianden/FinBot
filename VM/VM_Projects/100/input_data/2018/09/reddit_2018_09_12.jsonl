Now your stocks are worth $110. 10% profit on you $100 investment, not too shabby for a day’s work!\n\nScenario 2: Option Gain\nYou buy 50 options for $2 each totaling $100 and the share price jumps to $55 right after. Because the option gives you the ability to buy the stock at $50, and the market price of the stock is at $55 the intrinsic value of each option is $5 (ignore time value for now). So you sell your lot of options for $250. Taking into consideration the original $100 you spent to buy them you walk away with $150 in your pocket. A 50% return, significantly more return than investing in the stock. \n\n\nWhy? Because the value of your stock portfolio increases $1 for every $1 your stock investment goes up and you option value also increases roughly $1 for every $1 that your stock goes up (assuming strike price>market price). The key difference is you put up significantly less capital to buy an option than you do to buy a stock so you can buy many more options than you can buy shares. \n\nScenario 3: Stock decline\nYou buy your two shares for $50 each and you wait a week and after little action the stock declines to $49. You lose 2%, leaving you with a portfolio valued at $98.\n\nScenario 4: Options steady\n\nYou buy your 50 options at $2 each with a strike price of $50 and they expire the next week. The stock doesn’t move and at the end of the week it sells at $49. What is the value of your investment?\nWell, why would someone pay you for the option to buy a stock at $50 when they could just buy it in the open market at $49? They wouldn’t... so your portfolio is worth $0.\n\nThings I didnt touch upon for the sake of simplicity: time value - the longer the option has until expiration the more valuable it is.\nVolatility of underlying asset - the more volatile the stock is the more valuable the option.

Can anybody even explain to me how Robinhood would let this happen, and whether I should keep the shares or sell them at an extreme loss? (I am assuming any negative account value will be sent to debt collections so I will have to pay if I do sell). \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Q2YoP9r\n\nEDIT: Do you guys think there's a chance I might not owe money if I keep the stock since I'm basically owing RH 1300 shares and I still have 1300 shares in my account? I feel like as soon as I sell, I lock in the loss and then I will definitely owe money. Also, is there any legitimate chance MU at least comes back up and I can benefit from being essentially given 1300 shares for \"free\"?\n\nDOUBLE EDIT: Maybe somebody can try selling a bull put spread on something like amazon, time it so that you get assigned that week and then sell the puts to get a free margin loan of AMZN shares \n\nTriple edit: so I contacted Robinhood and the only response I just got was literally them saying they will be liquidating my shares since I have an overdue Reg T  call, yet I WASNT SUPPOSED TO BE GIVEN THIS MARGIN IN THE FIRST PLACE. So now I think I'm going to be liable for whatever negative balance I have after liquidation?", "id": "9fb207", "created_utc": 1536781755.0, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "Your history doesnt make sense.
