Tesla is spending a lot on R&D specific to these types of vehicles, and securing battery production second to none. I think saying \"we'll just copy them and do it in 12 months\" is a gross oversimplification of what would need to happen and just isn't possible, and this gives Tesla a unique advantage.\n\nI think you're right when you say manufacturers aren't trying to copy Tesla right now, overall.

Tesla will need to get through the storm before those really pay off vs their competitors, but I think they will.

Declining YoY % growth in operating cash flow. \n\n2. Negative YoY% FCF growth. \n\n3. Increasing debt to equity.\n\n4. Increased days sales outstanding and declining inventory turnover. \n\n5. Declining fixed asset turnover -a signal for over investing.\n\nThen there are two more observations that raise a red flag:\n\nSerial acquirer which destroys value (GE and CSCO being great examples of this. CSCO luckily broke the habit). Whole Foods is a great example, increased revenue but losing the highest margin customers to smaller competition (WSJ). \n\nIs the business dying? Not exactly, but Amazon is aware their retail businesses is close to peaking in its growth, which is why they’re expanding to combat this. The future of retail no longer lies in purely e-commerce, but a combo of e-commerce and physical stores that are meaningfully intertwined.\n\n> 2.\t⁠It has valuation that does not reflect potential challenges going forward.\n\nBesides the valuation being absolutely ridiculous by any model, here are a number of long-term challenges the company faces that would make it decline:\n\n1. Declining receivables turnover.\n\n2. Declining quick ratio and current ratio -e.g. less liquidity.\n\n3. Declining interest coverage, although it has recovered from 2014 lows somewhat. \n\n4. Chinese knock-offs taking away business from supplier brands. \n\nCouple all these with rising interest rates and we might have a recipe for disaster. Those customers who purchase heavily on credit may not be able to pay Amazon back, this includes AWS. Retailers on Amazon’s website may no longer be able to participate if sales decline further from knockoffs and credit continues to tighten. Throw in a recession where sales can decline, then Amazon might hurt a lot. \n\n> 3.\t⁠It has incompetant management that doesn’t know how to fix problems before they get bigger.\n\n\nHere are a number of things Amazon’s management continue to fail to address.\n\n1. Poor delivery services (does not fulfill orders in specified time periods, drivers failing to follow regular postal procedures, and items packaged poorly). \n\n2. Proliferation of knock-offs and scams. Customer service does not address people getting ripped off from these (including myself).\n\n3. Poor work conditions for employees i.e. abusive management policies (that’s according to management themselves), poor work/life balance, poor benefits, and low pay.\n\n4. Failure to attract exclusive brands or extremely popular brands (excluding third party sellers that sell at big markups). \n\nIs Bezos an excellent manager? Yes, absolutely. Is everyone under him extremely competent? That is yet to be observed. In contrast, despite its failings now, GE has produced top tier managers that excelled  greatly at other companies. Amazon has yet to follow. Also the best employees will eventually turn on Amazon if the company proceeds to treat them poorly. \n\nAnother example is that I didn’t take a job at Vanguard because of low pay, dumb rankings, and overall cheapness taken to the extreme, but I can say they offered great benefits and offered a great work-life balance. This is observed company wide for Vanguard at most levels, it isn’t only anecdotal. Amazon has a similar low-cost mindset, but addresses all those aspects mentioned very poorly. \n\nIs it a good short? We’ll see... One has to be willing to potentially lose a lot of money before eventually profiting. The market can be irrational longer than you can remain solvent. \n\nEdit: I made a typo earlier stating declining debt to equity instead of increasing debt to equity. Meant to say increasing", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": ">Is the business dying? Not exactly, but Amazon is aware their retail businesses is close to peaking in its growth, which is why they’re expanding to combat this. The future of retail no longer lies in purely e-commerce, but a combo of e-commerce and physical stores that are meaningfully intertwined.\n\nAssuming you meant e-commerce, I don't believe e-commerce has come close to their peak yet. E-commerce only accounts for 10% of retail sales at the moment, so there's certainly room to grow. You see the death count for retail growing at an astounding rate (for a variety of reasons, Amazon just being one of them). \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_retailers_affected_by_the_retail_apocalypse\n\nNext year, we are probably gonna see Sears go under, and Burlington Coat Factory, Stein Mart, Guitar Center, Bebe, and Bon-Ton could all join them. Every death in retail gives Amazon a little more market share to absorb. Yes, other physical retailers could fill the gap too, but its a net negative for them overall. \n\n\n>Couple all these with rising interest rates and we might have a recipe for disaster. Those customers who purchase heavily on credit may not be able to pay Amazon back, this includes AWS. Retailers on Amazon’s website may no longer be able to participate if sales decline further from knockoffs and credit continues to tighten. Throw in a recession where sales can decline, then Amazon might hurt a lot.\n\nAmazon benefited from the last recession. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/24/amazon-recession-profits\n\nAs a company with healthy fundamentals, they can weather the storm of another recession. A lot of the retailers I just listed are already on thin ice, and a recession would simply cull the weak and allow Amazon to fill the void. \n\nI don't know much about how businesses would use AWS on loan money or how they might not be able to repay it. So many companies rely on AWS for their basic infrastructure that they would cease to exist without it. Netflix would vanish overnight. Even the company I work for would be heavily undermined by cutting off its use of AWS. In other words, only companies who were truly going bankrupt would cut off AWS. \n\n>Is Bezos an excellent manager? Yes, absolutely. Is everyone under him extremely competent? That is yet to be observed. In contrast, despite its failings now, GE has produced top tier managers that excelled greatly at other companies. Amazon has yet to follow. Also the best employees will eventually turn on Amazon if the company proceeds to treat them poorly.\n\nAmazon is notorious for being rough with its employees. I've personally spoken with several Amazon employees (at least in the operations side) and I certainly haven't heard anything to contradict the overall-negative consensus on Glassdoor. \n\nWith that said, Amazon will be automating its operations more and more over time. They can afford to treat their operations employees like shit because they are easily replaceable and their role might not even exist in a couple of decades. \n\nIn terms of upper management, Amazon is poaching top executives at 6x the rate of Google. That's despite Google having a reputation for being relatively good for work-life balance. \n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-poached-30-former-microsoft-executives-2015-to-2017-vs-google-report-2018-6\n\nThe reason this poaching is so easy is because Amazon will compensate them more than their competitors will. Even you did not take the Vanguard position because of the low pay and \"overall cheapness\". People will stomach difficult working conditions in exchange for a higher salary, and Amazon is willing to pay them for it. \n\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Buying ATH if you were already in but not if you weren’t is illogical.
