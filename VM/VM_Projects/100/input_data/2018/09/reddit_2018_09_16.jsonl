Please advise!", "selftext": "I have approximately $300k saved for covering my taxes next year. Rather than letting it sit in savings, I figure I should try to put it to work in the market...\n\nI did intraday-trading a few times with success of making $300-$1000/day I traded (2-3 trades  intraday, using $50-$100k each time) but I’ve decided I need to use my time more wisely to do what I do best for a living, not day trading for next 7 months, stuck staring at the computer. \n\nI’ve come to the decision to take the money, divide it up amongst maybe 10-20 blue chips and hold for the next few months. I want to go with he safest stocks of course, as I really do not want to lose anything, rather make gains of course, so I’m thinking the top tech stocks (CRM, etc.) and such... but also other industries such as gaming (TTWO, EA.. etc) and id also like to diversify further. I’m thinking also put less money (respectively) in one or two more risky stocks, such as the Canadian cannabis stocks... but not sure if that’s so smart.\n\nWould love to hear some insight as to what one would do with $300k if they knew they’d have to buy today, but sell by April 2019. How many stocks should I diversify amongst? Any portfolio recommendations? Any other ideas of how to use the money in the market without day trading? I don’t think I will be able to make as much money buying and holding as compared to $300-$1000/day I’ve day traded, but of course that’s assuming all goes well and I don’t fail at all (which I was day trading only top stocks... which brings up the idea of even day trading the NASDAQ)... \n\nThoughts please?

Maybe the reward isn’t worth the risk in this case. I fortunately do have more capital to cover me if I lose money in the stocks, but clearly not what I want to do.\n\nMaybe I should just put in about $100k into 4 different stocks and hold as an investment and forget about this all... or maybe I should go back to my original idea which was to day simply one very strong stock (let’s say AMZN) and if ever my position goes down dramatically intraday, I’ll just hold my position overnight or continuously hold it until it comes back up. So the question is basically, if you take AMZN as an example, are there greater chances AMZN will see $1970/share ever again in the next 7 months, in the event I bought today and the stock went down? I think the chances are yes it will come back to $1970/share so maybe I should just continue random day trading of let’s call it AMZN, and if ever it goes down, I’ll hold my position until I’m back up. If I daytrade, I limit some extend of market risk since nothing is held overnight and I will not be vulnerable to a stock opening at a gap much below the previous day close.", "score": -4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Would anyone consider the gaming stocks such as TTWO?
