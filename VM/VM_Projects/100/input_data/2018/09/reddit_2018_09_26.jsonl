If you look at Hulu, they have a far better lineup of content, in house produced and otherwise for a more affordable price. The only thing Netflix has over Hulu is the amount of movies available as compared to TV shows. However People often struggle to find films on Netflix because they don’t have most classics or most good films in general. All they have is a few good movies they managed to license along with a huge gorge of their laughably shitty low budget content. Netflix is a huge household name in the entertainment sector no doubt, and they have a big advantage by being established in a market that is poised for growth when cable tv really starts to die. It’s just my opinion however that for a new content streaming service to come along and hugely disrupt their market would not be very hard, and that public opinion of Netflix is going to continue to decline in the next few years.
