But in late 2016 finally got around to figuring it out and bet it all on AMD (have been letting it ride ever since). However, even with 215% gains, I find myself feeling unfulfilled/unsatisfied. I think it is because while the gains are great, it's not life changing, not enough to retire (even with LT capital gains tax rate).
