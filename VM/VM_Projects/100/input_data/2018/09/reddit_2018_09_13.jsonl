[Tobacco farmers have been known to switch to hemp with relative ease](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/hemp-farmer/505604/), and (from my understanding) cultivation conditions for hemp [isn't much different from cannabis](https://www.westword.com/marijuana/marijuana-vs-hemp-whats-the-difference-8526551). However, the differences between cultivating cannabis and hemp appear to be spacing, which is a similarity with tobacco cultivation.\n\nIn some cases, it would appear it is rather expensive to cultivate cannabis, but that may be based on [limited conditions](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/working_papers/2010/RAND_WR764.pdf). As the linked working paper states:\n\n>It is not clear how labor intensive outdoor legal marijuana cultivation would be. Current production of cannabis is labor-intensive, but that may be because of some combination of (1) small operating scale thwarting mechanization (2) typical grey literature descriptions are of boutique quality, whereas farmed cannabis would be generic sinsemilla or even commercial grade, and (3) what Reuter (1983) terms “structural consequence of product illegality”. Legalization may allow for technology innovations\nthat will reduce labor as a percentage of total production costs. \n\nThe last sentence opens up an interesting point, that economies of scale may reduce the cost of production for cannabis. \n\nThe article uses cherry tomato production costs as the basis for cannabis costs. There is this [research for past costs of production for tobacco](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/41740/15859_ages001ei_1_.pdf?v=0) and tobacco appears to be more expensive than tomatoes, but I don't know how that compares to cherry tomatoes. If it is cheaper, there is the caveat of cannabis yielding less than tobacco, but the difference or similarity in yield on a full scale operation is hard to come by.\n\nHonestly, I don't know much about horticulture and I am not an expert. Serious, could you explain it more in depth if you know more about why it's harder to grow cannabis vs tobacco? It would seem the conditions are quite similar.\n\nThese are the two sources that explained cultivation simply enough for me to understand:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_cultivation\n\nhttp://www.newhopeseed.com/tobacco_growing.html", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Sure they could, but it would likely be cheaper to buy out a few already established operations.

There's a few tables at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\\_income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income) which measure it in different ways (international dollars/PPP, USD, per household vs per person etc.) but Australia is 2-3 places behind Norway in each case. I'm not sure using PPP or not changes that comparison much since both Norway and Australia are high-cost-of-living countries with consequently similar purchasing power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Median wealth**\n\nIf we are talking median *wealth* (accumulated savings, investments etc. per person or per household )*,* Australia is at or near the top no matter how you measure it. I remember this factoid from the hundreds of articles out there that contain one of these charts:\n\n[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/07/medianwealth.jpg](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/07/medianwealth.jpg)\n\n[https://medianism.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/median-adult-wealth1.png](https://medianism.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/median-adult-wealth1.png)\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/r/europe/1TzF6eN - here’s one that actually mentions the source...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nThose charts were based on Credit Suisse OECD rankings but were used in hundreds of articles from dozens of countries all over the place some years ago. One example is [https://www.businessinsider.com/us-trails-at-least-15-oecd-countries-in-median-wealth-2012-7](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-trails-at-least-15-oecd-countries-in-median-wealth-2012-7) , but there are many many more. Do a reverse image search on those charts and you'll find them used all over the place (usually in comparisons involving the middle classes of two different countries, or talking about how the US ranks very highly when measured by *average* wealth, but aren't doing so great on *median* wealth). The figures used in those charts are a bit old and include only OECD countries, but show Australia to comfortably rank 1st among those countries (which include Norway).\n\nIn more recent years Australia seems to have fallen to second place in the OECD behind Switzerland, or third place among all countries, due mostly to the fact that the AUD has weakened significantly against the USD since 2014, and most of these rankings measure in USD:\n\n[https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/List\\_of\\_countries\\_by\\_wealth\\_per\\_adult.html](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult.html) \\- 2nd in OECD behind Switzerland, using more recent Credit Suisse data (2016).\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_countries\\_by\\_wealth\\_per\\_adult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult) : 3rd among *all* countries, behind Iceland and Switzerland, and that's measured in pure USD without PPP adjustments.

The price in the country depends on supply and demand, as well as a lot of other factors, but not mainly their salaries. Even though it's a poor country some exotic fruits might be quite expensive there, possibly even pricier than Australia, because only a tiny elite of super rich people will be able to afford them (not talking bananas specifically). Ethiopia isn't a major producer of bananas, but it's relatively close to Uganda, which is. My guess is they're going to have some \"local\" cultivar that's going to be cheaper (still not 0.20 cents/lbs cheap), but there is no way a Cavendish is going to be that cheap in the country. Developing countries aren't as cheap as some people in the first world imagine. Yes, officially people might earn that little but that isn't all they have to survive. This $1 a day gets thrown around a lot and many people do not understand it. Many people do live on that little in the third world but they're self sufficient farmers and certainly don't go buying bananas in the supermarket. ", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}
