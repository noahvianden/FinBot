Am leveraged about 30% my account in NVDA and about 20% TSLA. Made a nice BMW 3 series on NVDA and then lost a model 3 long range AWD in TSLA. Just made it to the green on TSLA yesterday too, doubled down heavily the last dip. I added some $500 2020 calls. All these pundits and experts from every corner can suck it, they will never know what’s going on. \n\nEVs are happening whether big oil, automobile elites, hippy haters, and climate change deniers disagree. You can’t beat systemic change. And Elon may get removed as CEO for a tweet, poor guy definitely is on the spectrum doing his best, but I’m still betting on him. He’s not leaving TSLA, maybe as chairman, but his soul, blood, and tears are in it. And this man never gives up. Call him a fraud, someone that has billions yet puts in work weeks none of us can imagine, call him crazy for dreaming to reignite our lost space program and help progress our change off fossil fuels. \n\nEvery day in LA I sit and look up at the polluted skies and dream of being able to have the chance to look from the skies back onto earth. Dreaming is all we have, to progress, to be better, to want more. And I’ll put my money on the dreamer any-day. \n\nModel 3s are everywhere, I see them every day, once you drive one you’ll realize it’s better then any car you’ve ever been in. It’s the future and change is scary. But it doesn’t have to be if you dream. \n\nAnd the dream is like a stream of change that infects people one at a time, how do you think TSLA sold almost 100k vehicles last quarter ASPs at 75k. They’re gonna hit 15%GMs accelerating at incredible paces. All TSLA needs to do is keep up with current progress and they’ll be hugely profitable. \n\nIt’s not even a dream anymore TSLA is fundamentally in the strongest position it’s ever been. \n\nSorry for the rant, I just can’t believe people can hate something so much, for no other reason but they think it’s a “poorly” run company or how the abnormal CEO acts. Those are the type of people I stay away from in my normal life, those that can’t dream and hate those that do. I want to live in a better place then before, not worse, but people’s selfishness will never seize to amaze me. \n\nProof:https://imgur.com/gallery/RaEAUBn\n", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just what Tesla needed - drama. \n\nA fan of Elon but he has inflicted a lot of damage to people including himself.
