But here are some things people look at when trying to answer that question:\n\n1. **Has Microsoft become overvalued?** This is subjective but some common things people look at: Price to earnings (Microsoft trades at a P/E of 30 compared to 18x at Apple), price to sales (8 x at Microsoft compared to 4x at Apple) and price to book (10 compared to 9). So growth is definitely priced into Microsoft stock price. Determining if a stock is overvalued is the job of thousands of professionals so I can't realistically tell you if it's overvalued, but you can look at factors like revenue and earnings growth and return on equity and operating margin to paint a picture yourself.\n2. **Will Microsoft continue to grow at the rate I've seen it grow at?** Personally I think Microsoft's investment in the Cloud with Azure (second behind AWS), a really fucking good product in the Surface tablet, and their core office products will allow them to grow continuously at their current rate. I also believe they've made smart investments in vertical integration and I really think they could tie together everything really nicely if they could migrate consumers over the way they've done with business. But I'm a dude on reddit.\n3.  **Is this stock overhyped/is it due for a correction?** Question 1 is fundamental analysis, and this is now your technical analysis. My answer to this: the market has hit a new record high as of three days ago I believe and this bull market has lasted a long time now. People are worried it could end any day, but people have also said that for the last 2 years. I don't see anything that makes me believe Microsoft will be heavily corrected itself, but the whole market could turn down, taking MSFT with it. However it's product diversity and market cap make it a much safer bet than many less static companies, like the MUs or CGC's or other hype stocks.  Technical analysis is for me the hardest part as I go long on companies I believe in and like fundamentals more, but if you're interested in market timing and such, the MACD, RSI, and candlestick charting are best places to get started IMO.

Think about the worse-case scenario implications.\n\n\\#3) I personally find myself spending less and less time on FB. Coupled with the fact that FB is unable to appeal to the millennial population, this could place significant strain on their ability generate ad revenue.\n\n\\#4) If you compare the one-year trend of FB with QQQ, you will see that only began to diverge after FB’s last earnings release in July. Because the problems suggested in #1, #2, and #3 are longer-term issues, divergence can easily extend for 3 quarters to 1 year, to the same extent as Netflix’s pricing issue in 2011 or Chipotle’s E.coli outbreak in 2015.\n\nDue to the above reasons, I predict that after this information will be better recognized by the market after FB’s earnings release in early November. November 16 was chosen to capture a post-earnings announcement drift due to the negative shock of the results.\n\nWith a 10% chance of happening, I believe that FB’s stock will decrease by 20-25% from current prices. At the current stock price of about $165, a 20-25% decrease will cause FB to drop to about $120 by 11/16, accounting for both the earnings release and drift. Cost analysis would suggest that buying $1,000 of $130 put at 0.42 each would allow you to buy 23 puts. A $120 stock price will result in a payoff of $22,000, at which point, I would suggest to exit out of your positions.\n\nAgain, I think the chances of this happening are 10%. This means you will lose $1,000 nine out of ten times, but it comes with a 22-fold payoff.\n\n(Disclosure: I currently own a small short position in FB in a diversified portfolio.)\n\nTL;DR Buy 130 FB puts, expiring on 11/16. Risk $1,000 for a 10% chance to get $22,000. Don’t get greedy/over-confident.\n\n[Ask prices after market close on 9\\/24\\/18.](https://preview.redd.it/gz9ooax309o11.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=62a7d4bc8b3f42c8339d7a21518530f575e06b37)\n\nRecent news:\n\n9/24:  [FB privacy issues, co-founders of IG leave](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/instagram-co-founders-leave-the-appare-facebooks-privacy-struggles-to-blame-2018-09-25)\n\n9/25:  [FB regulation (Harvard report)](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/09/25/2018/harvard-report-calls-regulation-facebook-big-tech?cm_ven_int=homepage-latest-headlines)\n\n9/28:  [Security breach of 50 million](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-hack-50-million-people-175400821.html)\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "9ilhm0", "created_utc": 1537820592.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "Proof of 500k, proof of career and proof of university", "score": 158, "replies": [{"body": "Or ban", "score": 78, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "No he's definitely a professor but uses the phrase \"worse-case scenario\" instead of \"worst-case scenario\".
