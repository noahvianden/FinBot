Reason to do so would be to avoid dilution, obvs. But! Tesla's board and investors seem super happy about converts that dilute, so I agree with you it's a BS short thesis from that angle. The angle I'm more interested in is when those expire OOTM, and they're expected to cough up cash. One of the big points in the bull thesis is that they'll make 8K$ per model 3 in profit and sell over 100K of them in q3 and q4, and this is enough money to pay off the convertibles that are OOTM.  \n  \nIt would seem to me that if this isn't the case, then tesla will be forced to raise capital via more debt or by diluting equity.

Not sure they will make that much on each Model 3 yet. Hope they do but will be interesting to see. But I'd say by Q4 or Q1 19 maybe they make that much.  \n\nAlso, if they change the conversion rate, it essentially is dilutive, but (albeit in my limited experience) it's not unusual for things like this to be buried in prospectuses, and in the past, shareholders haven't seemed very perturbed by dilutions. I think the short thesis is greatly diminished if they're profitable and pay off the 2019 notes. \n\nBut yes, I think they will need to prove that he honestly thought he'd need that threshold.

Firstly, he started the tweet with \"I Am considering\" and not \"I am going to.\" Thus, it was not an absolute statement, and any shares bought with a specific outcome in mind would be a highly speculative endeavor. You cannot reasonably conclude from that tweet what the outcome will be from that statement. Second, the \"funding secured\" portion of the tweet is highly ambiguous and subjective. Clearly, since the decision had not been finalized, funding could not have been \"in-hand,\" opening up a much more subjective definition of the term \"secured.\" How liberal the reading of this term is will be up to a Jury. He clearly did not specify a specific funding source, nor any funding terms. You may disagree with his definition of \"secured\", but does that mean it was illegal given his personal understanding of the definition? Also relevant is the medium itself; tweets are a shorthand communication and often abbreviated. This could easily be chalked up to an error of omission (see trump's Helsinki \"would\" vs \"wouldn't\" shenanigans). \n\nSo it all seems to come down to interpretation; there does not appear to be objectively false information in the tweet unless a very narrow interpretation of the language is followed. I'm not aware of any legal requirement for corporate officers to abide by specific definitions or interpretations, so IMO this will be tough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, unless they can prove there was a premeditated intent to deceive investors via contemporaneous witnesses with intimate knowledge of the matter.\n\nIt seems more likely that the more objective wrongdoing is the timing and manner of the disclosure rather than the substance. The tweet was sent during trading hours, which is avoided because it causes extreme volatility before investors have been able to digest the information. Additionally, twitter is not a preferred dissemination medium, and best practices would be to pre-announce a press release at a specific time, to give investors an expectation of incoming material news and ensure they can all receive the information simultaneously. \n\nMy guess is they will settle with a slap-on-the-wrist fine and he will remain in control of tesla.

Say I buy a Microsoft 110 call at 9:30am, and then magically it’s value shoots up 3.00 in value by Noon. Fuck! I want my gains but don’t want a PDT ban. Well, if you sell a call at 115 (one strike price higher), you will notice that that price difference between the call you bought and the call you sold is your profit. So by doing this you lock in almost all of your gains due to the way options are priced. This works especially well on high volume options where the bid/ask mark is closer.
