But then I read articles on big financial sites that say it's not really possible and that advisor sites wouldn't need to have website and sell training and picks if they were able to make a living trading which makes sense.  \n\nI'm just trying to figure out if it's possible to make a living if I follow the right strategy and am consistent and conservative about it?  Also some people say you can make money regardless of the market while others say it's only possible in a bull market to really make money", "id": "a6rizu", "created_utc": 1544985436.0, "score": 183, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 225, "comments": [{"body": "I trade full time and while I have other sources of income, I do make a full time income trading options.\n\nWhat does it take to do this?  Here is my 2 cents:\n\n1) 2 to 3 years of experience is required before you usually see reliable results.  This is a detailed and complex profession that takes time to learn, just like you cannot be a professional commercial pilot, or plumber, or any other profession of this caliber without the training and experience, you cannot be a successful options trader without knowing what you are doing and have a lot of experience.  Fortunately, we can paper trade without putting real money at risk to get a lot of the experience, but not all.\n\n2) A minimum of $50K to trade with.  This is so you can weather some downturns and still have enough to build back.  $100K is even better and trading gets lot easier when you go around $100K.  Think about it, if you can make 20% trading options, which is a decent reliable return and not out of the question once you have experience, at $50k this will be $10,000 income for the year.  At $100K it will be $20K income.  Those who say you can make fantastic returns are taking huge risks and you will lose your account quickly (look up OptionSeller.com).  As cash is the fuel you need to make this income, once you lose so much and get below a certain amount it becomes very difficult to make it back.\n\nAs you might start a coffee shop or any other small business you need starting capital.  Under capitalization is the #1 reason most businesses fail. \n\n3) Treat it like a business and have a solid plan.  To many trade casually or emotionally and so lose often.  If you have a really good trading plan that you have honed and has proven to be successful, and you follow it, you will have an edge most do not who just jump in.  Learn and know a top notch trading platform as this is just as critical as learning how options works. \n\nFar too many throw a few thousand into Robinhood and start trading only to find they lose all their money and say “options don’t work!”.  \n\nIf you want to trade options seriously then set up your business, get the deep thorough education and training necessary (it is all available for free online), become an expert on both options and a top flight trading platform, then develop a trading plan that proves over time it can make money.  Sideline your emotions as more money is lost through emotional trading then by the stock going the wrong way.\n\nEven if you start now, and already have the required capital, you may be able to be a full time trader by 2020 or 2021.  If you’re starting with less than $50K it will take you a lot longer to build up your account while still working to pay your bills.  Options are NOT a get rich quick thing or super easy to really understand in depth!\n\nWith all the above said, this is a really enjoyable profession!  You can work from home and trading takes very little time once you have your plan dialed in.  It is fun in that you can consider it the highest level video game made, you are playing against other traders for real money.  :)  \n\nI’d be happy to answer any reasonable questions, but the above should be totally clear.

And not that they are being deceptive, it’s just that emotional and psychological factors are make or break. There are thousands of profitable systems you can find online for free that have great returns, like 400% gain (over multiple years) with 50% max drawdown, and the reality is very few can remain viable emotionally facing a 50% drawdown.\n\n- I do not believe anyone who does it successfully is using dead simple strategies that never change. To this point, the most insight has come from following people like Kirk from OptionAlpha and **watching him breakdown real trades**. He has the basic framework he uses that he can describe in 2 sentences, but once you see him break down real trades, and once you hear him answering email questions, you see that **his approach is much, much deeper**. For instance, I have seen that he often makes adjustments to trades based on technical analysis and directional assumptions, even though he uses “non directional” strategies. Many times he will get an email question, and he replies rather aggressively that he has never said something (which I thought he had), and it turns out that I had a really vague understanding of some topic and he goes on to clarify some subtle difference. So his basic framework is simple, but there are 1000 important details that are not immediately obvious. \n\n- People who can remain profitable in any market exist, but they’ve been trading for decades usually, and they have learned by fire how to navigate nearly all market conditions. A big part of this is just learning to recognize when things change and when it’s time to switch strategies.\n\n- People sell their services as another income stream. It is mathematically true that if you have some side income (from a job or anywhere) that your risk of ruin in trading is nearly zero and your risk of ruin is reduced by orders of magnitude.
