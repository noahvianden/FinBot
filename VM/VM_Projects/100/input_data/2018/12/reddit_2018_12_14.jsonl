And I know, Apple was once a company that makes great products, but they aren't as great as they were.\n\nFor one, they're losing market share to Samsung and Huawei even with the iPhone Xs and Xs plus on the market.\n\nAditionally, their laptops have not been doing really well. They're an entire generation behind in terms of CPUs and while Apple used to be praised for its brilliant build quality (it's still pretty good to this day), other companies such as Dell with their XPS line and HP with their Spectre line have started to catch up.

Perfect cohesion with macOS\n2. Unified, stable, & high-quality ecosystem, software, & updates\n3. Privacy & security\n4. Hardware build quality\n\nIt's all subjective and depends on what your needs are. macOS is my anchor because Windows is a nightmare, so iPhone is the best--and an excellent--option.

And the iPhone X wasn't the first phone to come out with the notch design - it was the Sharp Aquos S2. So rather than every android being a \"shitty imitation of an iPhone X\", the iPhone X is the true imitation.\n\nNext, I'll analyse all the Apple products. There are many android products with innovative and useful features, such as an screen on both sides (Nubia X), headphone jack (all Samsung galaxy phones), and great specs for a cheap price (pocophone f1). Not to mention all those products I've mentioned are cheaper than the iPhone Xs.\n\nNext, for desktops, the iMac is terribly late in terms of performance. The screen may be nice, but they're using 7th gen Intel processors while they're on their 9th gen already. This means that for enthusiasts, iMacs are not a great choice. For the everyday user, the price of iMacs is just too high to attract many customers.\n\nFor laptops, Apple's controversial butterfly keyboard (which I personally enjoy) is enough to lose customers, and with the high price and thermal throttling on the Pro line, the Macbook Pro is not a good buy. The Macbook air is already outperformed and is heavier than other premium laptops such as the HP Spectre and adding a few tenths of a pound to the weight of the laptop could get a Dell XPS 13 for the same price, which has arguably better build quality, battery life, and much better specs. Finally, the Macbook is in too niche of a market to even be considered as the price is too high for last gen tech.\n\nI'm not trying to say that Apple is a terrible company, but I'm trying to say that if they want to keep their customers, they need to lower prices. There are many alternatives on the market and sure, you have your own opinions, but the rest of the world might not agree so much with you. ", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}
