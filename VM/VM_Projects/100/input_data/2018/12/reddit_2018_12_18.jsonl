AT&T own the 5g line (can bundle mobile subs with streaming subs), no net neutrality so can throttle competitors on their network if they wanted, and have a huge catalog of popular shows and currently amazing HBO titles.

Fox 20th Century.... only someone inbred could stop that streaming service from gaining market share.  I don't own any of the above, but I only watch HBO original series (WestWorld / GoT - ya know, like everyone else).\n\nAMZN probably still has a long long way to go.  I'd bet eventually they'll be broken up due to anti-trust laws.... so owning them would be fantastic for that event!  Never owned any of their shares though, I thought an online book store was a stupid ass idea in 2000... and I was right.... but then they stopped selling books and started selling everything worth a shit.  Tough miss on that one.\n\nAAPL hmmm.  Cult like following from consumers despite inferior products (in terms of hardware - not design).  I wonder if that is a fad that will likely continue forever... I see a lot of \"older\" folks with apple products... and we all know that once \"older\" folks get on the band wagon, that's when the cool factor ends.  Lower sales, higher prices, older owners...
