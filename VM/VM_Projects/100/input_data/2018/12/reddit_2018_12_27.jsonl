Everyone uses the US Dollar to trade for oil, making our currency a petrodollar.)\n\nHowever, our recent discovery of the largest oil reserve ever to be found in the Texas area will remove our dependency on foreign oil (and thus the petrodollar) as we return back to the gold standard. Saudi Arabia knows that the jig is up, so they are selling us oil for MUCH less because it is now worth less due to the newfound supply. They‚Äôre scared, basically, because they now know that they aren‚Äôt the big dog in the oil exporting game anymore. \n\n\nIn March, a bill will be brought to the floor legitimizing and legalizing the return to the gold standard. \n\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs about damned fucking time.
