We now have enough gold to return back to a gold-backed currency (we are currently using a fiat currency backed by physically nothing—albeit our currency is currently a petro-dollar as it’s worth is dictated by the sale of Saudi oil. Everyone uses the US Dollar to trade for oil, making our currency a petrodollar.)\n\nHowever, our recent discovery of the largest oil reserve ever to be found in the Texas area will remove our dependency on foreign oil (and thus the petrodollar) as we return back to the gold standard. Saudi Arabia knows that the jig is up, so they are selling us oil for MUCH less because it is now worth less due to the newfound supply. They’re scared, basically, because they now know that they aren’t the big dog in the oil exporting game anymore. \n\n\nIn March, a bill will be brought to the floor legitimizing and legalizing the return to the gold standard. \n\n\n\n\nIt’s about damned fucking time.
