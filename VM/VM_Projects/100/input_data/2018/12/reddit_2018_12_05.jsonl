{"title": "The Wheel (aka Triple Income) Strategy Explained", "selftext": "**Original Post:  See Edits at the bottom for updates.**\n\nI've been asked and have explained The Wheel strategy many times, so I thought it may be a good idea to write it down all in one place for posterity!\n\nThis is the only options strategy I use ~~most often~~ and IMHO it is about as low risk and reliable as options trading gets.  You will NOT get fantastic returns and it is quite boring and slow, but with the proper stock and patience, it can result in reliable profits and income.  A 10% to 20%+ return is not difficult depending on a few factors, mostly based on stock selection, experience managing short puts and calls, plus the trader's patience.\n\nThe Wheel (sometimes called the Triple Income Strategy) is a strategy where a trader sells cash secured Puts to collect premiums on a stock or stocks they wouldn't mind owning long term.  If the options expire, or closed early, without being assigned the premiums are all profit.  The goal is to set up trades and avoid being assigned, but it is understood that if the put is assigned the account will buy and hold the stock.  Rolling puts to collect more premiums while helping to reduce the chances of being assigned is a tactic often used.  Through the collection of premiums from the initial puts and from rolling, the initial cost basis of the stock will be lower that the strike which can help the position to recover faster.  \n\nIf the puts can no longer be rolled for a net credit they are left to expire and be assigned.  The next step of The Wheel is to sell covered calls (CCs) on the shares.  To avoid having the shares called away for a net loss it is best to sell a call with a strike higher than the stock's cost basis.  This is repeated over and over to collect even more premiums that continue to lower the stocks cost basis, and along with any rising stock price movement, works to help close or have the shares called away at a break-even or a profit.\n\nAt some point the call is exercised and the stock called away, or you can simply sell the stock.  When adding up all the premiums collected from selling the puts and calls, along with any stock gains from the CC strike being over the cost can result in an overall net profit, results in the Triple Income .  If the stock pays a dividend while you own it then you can collect that as well (Quadruple income).\n\nBelow in this post is a graphic showing a simple spreadsheet to track the Credits and Debits to keep track of the overall position.\n\n**Step #1: Stock Selection** - Most traders who have had a bad experience with the wheel have chosen the poor or volatile stocks that drop and stay down.  The stock(s) you chose must be a good candidate and one **you don't mind owning for some length of time, which could be weeks or months.**\n\nThere are no \"perfect\" or ideal stocks to trade the wheel with as the key factor is that the stocks be those you are good holding for a time if assigned.  If you are unsure how to analyze of select stocks then this should be learned first and before trading the wheel.  See this as a way to start learning -  [How to Find Stocks to Trade with the Wheel : Optionswheel (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionswheel/comments/19fmoyl/how_to_find_stocks_to_trade_with_the_wheel/)\n\nDevelop and use **your own criteria** that fits your account size, and personal risk tolerance as there is no one-size-fits-all way to choose stocks.  Only you can determine if you think the company is a good one to trade and hold if needed.\n\nI'm including my general guidelines below, but each trader must use their own:\n\n* A profitable company that has solid cash flow\n* Bullish, or at least neutral chart trend and analyst ratings\n* Share price where the account can easily accept being assigned 100 shares if needed.  (I stay away from sub-$10 stocks as a rule)\n* A stable to bullish trending chart without wild gyrations (especially those caused by CEO tweets)\n* A nice dividend is always a good thing, both that you may collect it if assigned the stock but also that dividend stocks tend to be more stable and predictable\n\n**Edit -** Adding more criteria below from another post.  It needs to be kept in mind that any stocks one trader may think is good to own will not necessarily work for another trader, or all traders.  Account sizes will limit the share prices to choose from, risk tolerance, and trading experience will all factor into what stocks are selected and traded.  There is little to be learned from someone else's stocks they trade.\n\n* *A \"moat\" around their business to ward off competitors, quality products and services, and a reasonable amount of debt.  Add to this an exceptional and stable executive team who has had good plans plus executed them well.*\n* *Stocks spread across the 11 Market Sectors is a common way to reduce risk as it is seldom all sectors will drop at the same time.  See this post for those sectors, but keep in mind this is an older post so the stocks mentioned may not be up to date -* [*https://www.bankrate.com/investing/stock-market-sectors-guide/*](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/stock-market-sectors-guide/)\n* ***It needs to be repeated that the criteria used must be your own as the stocks you choose may have to be held so you need to hold yourself accountable for selecting and trading any stock.  If a trader does not know how to select stocks they would be good holding, then IMO don't trade the wheel until you learn . . .***\n\nDevelop and use your own fundamental analysis criteria to create a watchlist of 10 or more stocks to trade.  While I prefer trading stocks as I can learn more about the companies business and leadership, plus find these have higher premiums, some may trade ETFs.  These can make good candidates due to their normally steady movement, no ERs, and no CEO tweets.\n\nI find it important to review my watchlist every few weeks and change or update it accordingly.  This means the list is in near constant flux adding or removing stocks, or sidelining others, based on the analysis.\n\n**Step #2: Sell Puts** - To start the wheel begins by selling short (naked) Puts, or (CSPs) Cash Secured Puts (indicating the account has the cash, or cash+margin to buy the shares if assigned.  Be aware of any upcoming ER or other events that could cause a spike or movement in the stock and it is best to close or have the Put expire prior, in effect skipping it to then continue selling puts afterward if the stock still meets the criteria.\n\nSelling Puts Process - Below is a suggested model, but details are up to the individual trader:\n\n* Opening at 30 to 45 DTE offers a good premium as the theta/time decay starts to accelerate\n* 70% Prob OTM (\\~.30 Delta) offers high probability of success while collecting a good premium\n* The number of contracts is based on account size able to handle assignment\n* Opening at 5% max risk to the account is good practice, and keeping \\~50% of the trading account in cash helps manage market downturns, assignments and trading opportunities\n* The Put can be closed at a 50% profit with a GTC Limit Order that can close automatically.  A put can then be sold on the same stock, or another based on your opening criteria.  Closing early will reduce early assignment and gamma risk to take the lower risk \"easy\" profit off the top\n* Enter the Credits received, and any Debits paid to close or roll, on the Tracking P&L file\n* Setting an alert in the broker app if the stock drops to the put strike price will signal it is time to review and consider rolling. Note that rolling seldom has to be done quickly, so this can be reviewed and managed later if needed, and many times the stock will dip and then move back up to negate needing to roll \n* If challenged Roll out in time, and down in strike, for a net credit when possible.  Roll for as long as a net credit is possible.  See this post for details on rolling puts to help avoid assignment:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionswheel/comments/lliy8x/rolling\\_short\\_puts\\_to\\_avoid\\_assignment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionswheel/comments/lliy8x/rolling_short_puts_to_avoid_assignment/)\n* If a credit cannot be made, then it is best to let the put expire to take assignment of the stock\n\nPuts can be sold, and rolled, over and over to collect as much premium and profits as possible with the shares rarely assigned.  Those having frequent assignments should review the stock selection and trading processes as it should be uncommon to be assigned.\n\nIf assigned, then Sell Covered Calls as shown in Step #3.\n\n**Step #3: Sell Covered Calls** - Using the tracking file to determine the net stock cost which may already be below where the stock is.  As selling puts is usually the most profitable, some traders just sell the stock and move on to selling more CSPs or sell a very high-value ITM Call that is sure to be called away and adds to the profit.\n\nIf the net stock cost is above the current market price and you keep the stock, then the goal is to sell CC premium to continue adding to the Credits and lowering the net stock cost below where the stock is trading before it gets called away.\n\nSelling CCs suggested process:\n\n* Sell a Call 7 to 10 DTE at or above the net stock cost whenever possible.  Note that I will settle for a lower premium to be at or above the net cost rather than sell below and risk being assigned for a loss.  Allow the CC to expire, then sell another if the shares are not called away.\n* If CCs cannot be sold at or above the net stock cost, then waiting until the share price rises may be needed.  This is why it is noted to only trade on stocks you are good holding if needed.\n* Track net Credits, plus any Dividends captured, on the tracking file to know the net stock cost.\n* Continue selling CCs until the net stock cost is below the strike price at which time the stock can be left to be called away (some note that it cost less in fees to close the option and just sell the stock which accomplishes the same thing).\n* Advanced Strategy - Some may consider selling a Covered Strangle, which is a CC with an added CSP that \"doubles up\" on the premiums to help the position recover faster.\n   * Note the risk of additional shares may be assigned, so it is critical to ensure the stock is still a good one to hold, the account has adequate capital to purchase additional shares, and that this does not make the stock position too much of a risk to the overall account.\n   * In addition to the double premiums, if more shares are assigned the net stock will average down quickly that can help repair the position more quickly.\n\n**Step #4: Review and go back to Step #1** - This is why it is called the wheel as you start over again.  The tracking file makes it easy to see the P&L, review the trade to verify the numbers and then look for the next, or same, stock to sell CSPs in Step #1.\n\nAs they say, rinse and repeat.\n\n**Risks and Possible Problems:**  The single biggest issue for this strategy is the stock price drops significantly.  Note that this is slightly less risk than just buying the stock outright due to collecting put premiums.\n\nStock Drops:  The reason to make these trades on a stock you wouldn't mind owning is because of this risk, and if a good stock is selected then this should be a very rare occurrence.  Solid quality stocks may drop less often and by a lower amount, then recover faster.\n\n* The price of the stock may drop well below the CSP strike, and rolling for a credit will no longer be possible, causing assignment with the stock cost below the assigned price.\n* If puts were sold and rolled over and over the net stock cost should be much lower.\n* Management is to sell CCs repeatedly at or above the net stock cost, or to hold the shares to allow time for the stock to recover. This can take time, but with the CCs added to the put and roll premiums this can recover faster than you may think but still takes a lot of patience.\n* There may be rare occasions when a stock is no longer viable and the position needs to be closed for a loss, again this shows the critical importance of stock selection.  Closing for a loss can include selling the shares, or selling an ATM or slightly OTM CC at a near expiration date to collect as much premium as possible as the shares are sold.\n\nStock Rises: Many see this as a problem, but I personally do not as if the CC strike is above your net stock cost, then the position profits, but just not as much.\n\n* In this situation the stock is assigned and then sell CCs only to have the stock run well past the strike price.\n* In most cases closing the CC and selling the stock outright can cause a bigger loss than just letting the stock be called at the strike price.\n* Rolling CCs out in time, and possibly up in strike, for a net credit can help to capture some additional profits.  It should be noted to watch for ex-Dividend dates as the shares can be called away early in some situations.\n* Many lament the profits that were \"lost\" by having the CC, but selling shares at the strike price is the agreement made when opening a CC.  If you know the stock may spike up then do not sell a CC and instead hold the shares.\n\nImpatience: By far this causes the most losses from this strategy.\n\n* If you can't roll for a credit let the CSP play out.  If you close the CSP early and not accept it being assigned, it may cause a loss.\n* If you get assigned the stock and sell CCs, do not try to \"save\" the stock through buying the CC back at an inflated price.  If you can't roll for a credit, then let the stock be called away and sell more puts to start the process over again provided the stock is still a viable candidate.\n* Recognize it may take months selling CCs to build the premium up to a point where the net stock cost is less than the current stock price, but in nearly all positions it will happen eventually.\n* The key here is to be patient and not try to sell CCs below the net stock cost or close the shares early.\n\nA Tracking P&L File graphic is below and shows Credits and Debits to know what the net credits, debits and net stock cost is.  Note the stock price can be entered as a Credit to show where the position is at any given time.  This is simple to create and use.  NOTE:  I do not send out copies as it would take me longer to do that than you recreating the 3 formulas.\n\nHopefully, this is a thorough and detailed trading plan, but let me know of any questions, typos or suggested improvements you may have.  -Scot\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5qrik6c6nc221.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=3782998ff4249e61e92edc05ae81d188f12871dd\n\n**EDIT #1:**  Hello all, the response to this post has been amazing, thanks for the many who have contributed or inquired.  Wanted to add a few things up front that seem to be causing confusion.\n\n1. The goal of this strategy is to collect the premium, NOT be assigned stock!  While being ready and able to take the stock is part of the plan, being assigned is always to be avoided.  If you sold a CSP 1 time and were assigned, you are either doing something wrong or are terribly unlucky by picking a stock that tanked.\n\nCSPs should be sold over and over or rolled for a credit, to avoid assignment.  You should be collecting 4 to 5 or more premiums worth several dollars before getting assigned.  Some who have contacted me sold a CSP and just waited to be assigned, this is not the strategy.\n\nIf you are getting assigned more than a couple of times a year you may want to look at the stocks you are trading and how well you are managing your position.  Getting assigned the stock should be a very rare occurrence.\n\n2) As you select the stock and sell the CSP expect to get assigned.  Be sure it is a low cost enough stock so that you can handle the shares and still make other trades.  If you're trading a $150 stock, be aware you could have $15K tied up for a while and be prepared to do that.\n\n3) Going along with #2 I trade small and use lower to mid cost stocks.  The premiums are not as juicy and the attraction of a TSLA or AMZN is hard to resist, but you are better selling 1 contract at a time for 10 positions than 10 contracts in one position and have to take 1000 shares.\n\nIt is always good account management to not trade more than about 5% of your account in any one stock to avoid news or movement from the stock from blowing up your account.  It is also a good idea to keep 50% of your buying power available for safety and to take advantage of opportunities.\n\n4) There have been negative nellies telling me this won't work and being critical.  Note that this is not my strategy, and I don't make any money from it being used or not.  My time was spent in an effort to show one method options can more safely be traded, so if you have had a bad experience or think there are better ways, then feel free to post them!\n\n5) Lastly, I have not done any research on this vs buying and holding stock.  I've traded for more than 20 years with most of that time focused on stocks, and I did well!\n\nWhere I see the main differences are that options give leverage so I can collect premium from more stocks than just buying a couple, so this spreads out my risk.  Also, I very much like the shorter time frame as I can move on to other stocks should one drop or run up.  If done well, you may only get assigned a couple of times a year and often be out of the stock in a couple of weeks.\n\nOK, I think you will see this is not sexy or exciting trading, it is boring, and you make $50 per position in many cases, but they add up.  For those looking at huge returns and the excitement of major risk, this is not for you.  If you want a more reliable way to trade options, then this may be good to check out.\n\n**EDIT #2:**  I've updated this post now that it is unlocked.  Some changes include:\n\n* Stock price minimums moving up as I now have a larger account\n* Selling CCs based on if the net stock cost is above or below the current stock price\n* Added a rolling put link.\n* There are many different wheel strategies today with some selling ATM puts, others only selling covered calls (not sure how that is a wheel), and several other variations.  This is what I trade, and it is up to you how you trade.\n\n**EDIT #3:**  Various updates, including most steps to clarify, along with adding details to Step #3 on Covered Calls.", "id": "a36k4j", "created_utc": 1543968236.0, "score": 1952, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 496, "comments": [{"body": "Why roll a tested put or call?

It needs to be up to you what risks you are willing to take, but of course, the concept still holds that a max/full loss would be crazy unusual.\n\nTrading the wheel requires a decent amount of capital to keep the risk manageable, and perhaps should not be attempted with a very small account as the risk percentage would have to be very high.\n\nI'm not a fan of spreads as each pay for a long leg that is a drag on profits. When trading the wheel, you still need to be able to pay for shares if assigned so this means being forced to take a loss which defeats the main benefit of how the wheel works . . .\n\nHopefully this is helpful, and I tend to keep risks lower than even 5% as I work to open with a 1% to 3% max risk per trade, and then limit 5% to any one stock.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a lot for your answer, this helped a lot! Unfortunately it kind of confirms my understanding that trading the wheel is rather for bigger accounts than for smaller ones. I agree that a max loss is not something that occurs very often.

Of course, all trading is better and easier with larger dollar returns with a $25K to $100K+ account . . .\n\nSmaller accounts can trade the wheel and make a good return percentage, which will logically be smaller in dollar terms, but what is the alternative? If you can find a way to make a larger return with the same risk then that would make sense, but there is no way I am aware of. \n\nLess capital does result in only being able to trade lower cost stocks which limits the number of trades. Trading costs should not be a factor as even lower cost stocks can still bring in $30 to $50 in premium which should make the average .50 per trade a minor factor. Compare the single leg wheel trades to spreads or ICs that have 2 to 4 legs means the wheel is more efficient from a cost perspective.\n\nAny options trading requires a reasonable size account to make decent returns, so the answer is to keep saving and finding ways to add to your balance and it may make sense to practice paper trading in the meantime.

Not sure if this is already a strategy out there, but something occurred to me and not sure if this is a viable strategy. One of the issues I have with CSP is that the money just sits there not accruing dividend, or appreciating, especially when you keep rolling out. So I thought of halving the wheel, where you'd buy a stock outright, ideally this is one of your AAPL, MSFT, etc, where it doesn't hurt to hold \"forever\", and just write CC. And keep rolling it out if you have to. That way the money doesn't just sit there and dividends can be collected, the stocks slowly appreciate. My thinking is, if the goal is to NEVER get assigned stocks on a CSP in the wheel strategy, then it essentially becomes a single income strategy, as you're just selling puts, conversely, if the goal is to NEVER get your stocks called away on my strategy, you're getting double income (CC premium, dividend), and with the potential of an additional income once you sell the stock (stock appreciation).

While the trade may not make the 50% profit, if it doesn't have a realized loss it doesn't really hurt anything other than taking time and pay a small broker fee.\n\nSomething I don't want you to mistake is that this is not black and white!  \n\nMy most profitable wheel trade was one where I sold a put, then spent months rolling and collecting more credits, only to let the option expire to finally be assigned the shares.  Then the stock started moving back up and I was able to sell weekly CCs above the stock price to collect some very rich premiums.\n\nAfter collecting a nice overall profit I wanted the shares to be called away to move on.  I began selling very high-priced ATM calls every Friday, only to have week after week without the shares being called away.  \n\nEventually, the shares were called away at a significantly higher price.  When I added up the initial credits from the puts sold, the many rolls, then the calls sold, plus the much higher stock price than what it was when assigned I had made thousands of dollars in profits!  \n\nThis shows that it does require trader skills to take what the market is giving and then \"milk\" a position to help it be more profitable.  \n\n**To be very clear, how I trade is not black and white where I do X or Y or Z every time on every trade, meaning you need to make some decisions based on your judgment along the way as I do.**", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much once again.

For a new trader, it would be 5% if the shares were assigned.  A $50 stock would cost $5,000 to buy 100 shares, which would be 5% of a $100K account.  For those with larger accounts, more experience, and a track record of knowing how to avoid assignments this can be calculated based on the buying power effect or collateral margin which might be less dollars.  Keeping 50% in cash is also how I trade, so in the example above this would amount to $50K in options buying power being available.\n\nThis does result in small accounts making lower dollar returns as the wheel requires a good amount of capital to trade.  Looking for a 10% to 15% return means a $20,000 account would make $2,000 to $3,000 per year, or about $165 to $250 average per month.   \n\nThis is a very conservative way to trade, but it also helps avoid having any stock take down the account, which we see posts about all the time.\n\nAs you make dozens to hundreds of trades you will start to establish your own data.  \n\nAre the stocks you select to trade good ones that \"behave\" well?  \n\nAre you effective at rolling to avoid assignments?  \n\nWhat is your assignment rate?  \n\nHave you been able to complete a \"full wheel\" of selling puts over and over, then being assigned to sell CCs over and over, to finally have the shares called away for at least breakeven or a profit?

It is exactly the information I was looking for when I signed up for r/options. It is an awesome explanation, far more detailed than my \"rules\".\n\nTL;DR - I am looking for good data to tell me why I should wheel 30dte-45dte days rather than 1dte-2dte (which I am currently am making 10% on for the past year). I'd love to make more.\n\nI'm hoping to find guidance on why longer is better.\n\nHere's my current position on the topic and I'm hoping to get enough info to be convinced to switch:\n\nFirst off: This is the first time I have seen an explanation of the type of processes that I figured out the hard way and have been following since October 2022. I learned great lessons and made 10% last year being very conservative (that doesn't even include the 4.5-5.0% MM SPAXX interest). So, thanks again for letting me know there are others out there doing the \"wheel\". \n\nHere's why I currently  sell 1DTE puts, instead of longer dated:\n\nI sell the puts the with enough cushion that it will finish OTM 98% of the time (yes, that is a real number as I downloaded 3 years of history and analyzed it), and if not, I can roll forward before expiration, and usually even make some more premium in those cases, as you outlined. I get the benefit of time decay every afternoon, usually beginning around 2:00ish, as the cost to close the Puts declines, if the underlying stays flat, or even starts to decline. I sell when it gets to .02-.03 and reopen at around .08-.10. If it doesn't go to .02, I won't close, and in the morning it will get there or close 90%+ of the time, unless the underlying dropped overnight. At that point I'll roll, usually looking for an additional .12 to .20 (with a target of .15). At 2200 shares, that is $330 minus costs, but plus interest on the cash that covers the Put assignment value. \n\nThe other reason is that I can usually be confident that when I sell a put with a 2% cushion, I will usually be OTM, NTM at the worst. Rarely have I allowed myself to get ITM and then usually only <$1.00 over. Then came New Years weekend this year and that's when the trouble started, which has me questioning my 1dte strategy.\n\nJanuary 3,4,5 this year is the first time I ran into deepish trouble, when QQQ sank $16 over those few days. I wound up getting 1900 of my 2200 shares called away at 1:00AM the day before expiration (first big error since I started-lesson learned). I wish I had seen this write-up beforehand, as I would have been less stressed-and more patient as I sold the CC to recoup and probably wouldn't have gotten called. I learned an awful lot of what you mention the hard way, but this post will help me considerably if it ever happens again.\n\nBTW - In answer to the obv. question, why did getting assigned bother me if I should only use this strategy on securities I wouldn't mind owning, I really would have been fine owning QQQ, except that i got assigned at 405 on the night that QQQ went down to 396.36 (insta-loss of $15K+ if I hadn't started the CC rolling process ). All-in-all, I wound up losing less than $4.5K, but also lost income for almost 2 weeks, about $5.5K for a total of almost $10K. Not a major hit, but almost 3 weeks of revenue lost. Killed me that I couldn't get out of the CC cycle and capitalize on the run up 1/18-1/19\n\nLesson learned 1 - don't let the Puts get so far in the money, that they may get called and I get stuck.\n\nLesson learned 2 - do a better job on rolling away the loss using the CC process if I do get assigned do to some major unexpected event.\n\nIf you can, please direct me to the information that will support the idea of moving to a 30-45dte strategy. Thanks in advance.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Glad you found this post helpful!\n\nI'll tell you why I sell longer duration and I have posted many times, which I think is logical and stands on its own, but if you want more details then do an internet search as it is a common practice and where you should find the support you're looking for.\n\nAs you learn more about options trading you will find that the focus should not only be about making as much profit as possible, but the focus should be to make the most profit while limiting risk as the prime directive . . .\n\nPart of the reasons are what you just experienced which may have been avoided and a non-issue is sold farther out in time and strikes.  By selling at 30-45 dte I can normally get more premium while having the strike be farther OTM at the same delta. If rolling is needed there will be plenty of opportunity to do so, and by closing for a 50% profit it virtually eliminates any early assignment or gamma risk.  \n\nIf and when a rare assignment occurs (a 2% or even lower assignment rate is not unusual) the strike will mean the net stock cost will be less, and with the higher premiums plus rolling credits, this means CCs can be sold which will help the position recover faster.  Selling 30-45 dte around a .30 delta is by far lower risk . . .\n\nWill selling shorter duration bring in more premiums to make larger possible profits?  Yes, but at a higher risk of being assigned which can slow down the process or even cause losses.  This is the trade off IMHO. \n\nI'm going to presume you did not trade over the covid crash in March 2020 when these risks would have been very clear to you.

For example, I trade a number of sector diverse stocks which lowers risks even more, and, generally stocks bring in much more premiums than ETFs like QQQ.  With that said, the 10% gain in 2023 is low compared to most and 2023 was a very good year for traders.  You can see the many posts on r/thetagang showing 30%+ gains.   \n\nAgain, I say how I trade and am not trying to convince you to change if you don't want, but you should try different things for yourself.  For example, why not try trade a small percentage of your account see how 30-45 dte works, and maybe try trading on a couple solid quality stocks?  \n\nI'll close with one more reason I prefer trading at 30-45 dte, and that is I am not sitting at my desk all day making trades . . .  With my trading plan and process it usually only takes 15 to 30 minutes max per day to make or manage trades.

This is an awesome read. I love how you clearly show the \"playbook\" for this strategy. I've been investing in stocks for 20+ years but I'm new to options. I've bought and sold options in the past but not as an income strategy. I've mostly used to boost the stock picking part like your #1 (I'd sell puts for stocks I would love to own especially at a lower price), but that didn't seem systematic. The wheel strategy has a very systematic and repeatable feel to it. I will be trying it out. BTW, the comments and your responses are also very fascinating and informative.\n\nA few questions.\n\n1. My friend recently professed bull / credit put spread strategy. I like that too (I know you don't from your comments). I understand the rationale behind the bull put strategy is that you reduce/limit the margin requirement for the trade (sell $105 put and buy $100 put = margin requirement is the $5 of risk as opposed to simply selling the CSP for $105 which makes your cash/margin requirement the entire $105). If you made that trade with net premium of $0.75, then your simple return is $0.75/$5 = 15% over the time period of the option. If the stock falls you can repair by rolling your trade to lower strike prices like the first part of the wheel. With lower margin requirement, this allows you to do more trades. In addition, how my friend explained, which is also how I'm looking at it, is I'm using the credit spreads to boost my long term investment portfolio and take advantage of the margin that that existing portfolio has (that may not matter). For example, if I have a $200K portfolio, I have another $200K of margin/buying power I can use. If I sell the CSP say 10 contracts at $105, then I've used up $105K or half of my margin on this one trade. If I sold the credit spread 10 contracts, then I've only reduce my margin room by $5K (still have most of my buying power still in tact). I am I looking at that right? Do you have a different take on that? \n2. As a newbie, I would also like to know what key resources you use so I can set up my \"system\". Do you use like X different sites for options data and analysis and what are they (eg, I want to look and compare historical IV to current IV. My broker system only seems to have current IV, so I'd have to go outside to look up historicals). Anyways, a short list of your key tools/resources you use would help me get started with my setup.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your feedback!\n\nHere are some answers:\n\n1) Spreads almost plan on having losses and the long 'insurance' leg is a drag on profits and a significant cost for an event that should very seldom happen. Spreads make less profit, and profit slower, incur more fees, and are harder to roll, so there are a lot of downsides to spreads . . .\n\nWith the proper account the buying power required for selling a naked put (backed by cash+margin) can be 10% to 20% of the stock value. In this case a $105 put that would cost $10,500 if the shares were assigned would cost as little as $1K to $2K of BP. And, in some brokers the cash held as collateral can earn 5% interest, so the idea that spreads are ore capital efficient is not always true. If you want to trade the wheel in a serious manner, then upgrade your account to have this level.\n\nIMHO, spreads are planning for losses but selling puts on high quality stocks is planning for profits. I prefer planning for profits and to make as much as possible on the 90%+ of those puts that just profit and close, then managing those that drop by rolling which can still have many wins and take assignment of those when needed to sell CCs that with patience can often result in at least a scratch if not a win. This can mean win rates in the high 90's, and some even have 100% rates as they are very patient. \n\nThe entire wheel plan and process should result in very few actual losses. These should only happen when a good stock has some unexpected fundamental change when it makes sense to dump the shares and move on, which should be rare.\n\nPutting it simply, spreads plan to lose and give a false sense of security as they lose more, profit less, are harder to roll, profit slower, and are far more often to be closed for a loss. \n\n2) I've posted that I have TDA, soon to be moved to Schwab, with TOS, and a Fidelity account that helps me find and analyze stocks.

I like your plain speak - very straightforward and easy to understand. \n\nAs an \"old to investing but new to options trader\", I'm looking to focus on a couple main options strategies to build my experience (I don't need to get exotic at this point; just stick to a couple bread and butter methods while I build my knowledge).  I feel that the wheel and your \"plan for profits\" bias works with me for stocks that I wouldn't mind owning. However, for more opportunistic trades with stocks that are more \"risky\" and I am less inclined to own, I think the credit spread also fits my style (defined maximum exposure). So I'm using/learning both of these strategies for now. Here are a couple trades I made - would like your thoughts and I also have some questions.\n\n1. Wheel. ZTS (Zoetis pet drug maker spun out of Merck current price $190). I wouldn't mind owning, so I made a naked put today after seeing the stock drop $7 today (unclear why it dropped). Sold to open 5 contracts of ZTS $175 Puts exp 4/19 @$1.40. I'm level 3 at my broker, so like you said the margin requirement/BP was $12K (\\~13% of the $175 x 500 = $87,500 exposure). Delta was -0.15, Prob ITM 17.4%, IV 25.9%. I'm getting $700 on BP of $12K = 6% max return over 49 days or \\~2 months. \n2. Call credit spread. CVNA (Carvana I'm bearish on this, highly volatile so I did a spread, current price $83). Sold $100 C 4/19 and bought $105 C 4/19 for a $0.95 net credit. On 10 contracts, premium collected $950 with margin req/BP $5K (the difference between strikes) = 19% max return over \\~2 months. Deltas .26/.21, IV 89.99%/90.67%, today's Prob ITM 41%/35%.\n3. Considering Wheel or Put Credit Spread for ARM (bullish that I think AI and semis will keep going up over near term, but highly volatile so risky. Current price $141). $105 Put 4/19 is $3.75, Delta -0.14, Prob ITM 22.33%, IV 88.62%. $100 Put 4/19 is $2.77, Delta -0.11, Prob ITM 18.19%, IV 88.86%. If I did the wheel and just sold the $105 Put, 10 contracts would net me $3.75K with BP $10.5K = 37% return. Spread would be $980 with BP of $5K = 19%. I would probably lean toward the naked put here because premium is so good, but high volatility stock is a big risk - if so, selling 5 contracts would be more of the equivalent comparison as that would be $5K BP.\n\nSo my questions.\n\n1. In your Wheel write-up, your trade guide is opening 30-45 DTE and 30% Prob OTM (.30 delta). Do you target a certain IV range - I think you said you like more stable stocks but then premiums are lower? Do you key in on any other option metric/greek or is it really just Prob OTM and Delta? \n2. What kind of return do you target? ZTS 6% over 2 months (3%/month) seems low. Or is that pretty good and I should instead think that that 3%/mo translates into 36%/yr?\n3. With the above in mind, what do you think of the trades I listed?\n4. I did the CVNA spread a couple days ago. It dropped $6 yesterday, but popped back up +$7 today, so back to starting position. I could have closed out the trade yesterday and made $2-300. Now that I think about it, I should have just taken that quick 1 day win instead of theoretically tying up my capital for another 47 days to make only $600 more. With 30-45 DTE trade guideline you have, when do you try to close out a trade or how do you think about letting go to expiration? Or are you targeting to make x% of the trade premium (eg, for my CVNA trade $950 spread. Should I have a target of 50% of that as profit as an example and then look to sell?)?\n5. Any other comments/critiques or future action advice about the trades above would be welcome.\n\nThanks again for sharing your wisdom.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If you have experience investing with stocks and know how to analyze them then you have a big advantage as this is core to the wheel strategy.\n\n1) ZTS - never heard of this stock so had to look it up. If your analysis is it is one you are good holding, then that is all that matters. I will note that it is a low volume stock without weekly options chains, so this will limit the flexibility in being able to roll if needed. As a less liquid stock it may also be harder to roll or close for a good price.  Options are best traded on liquid stocks. My other comment would be that 5 contracts at $175 would cost $87,500 to be assigned the shares. With good risk practice that tries to keep stocks at 5% max risk to the account, this would require an account of $1.75 million to keep this risk at a manageable level. I don't see where you post your account size, but this is a massive risk trade for someone new to options . . .\n\n2) As you know I don't trade spreads and have posted why many times, but how and what is traded is up to each of us. Again, 10 contracts are a lot, so be prepared for a possible loss of $4K or so if that happens.\n\n3) I don't follow ARM so have nothing to offer about the stock, but if you are good buying and holding share then this is what matters. Again, 10 contracts would be 1000 shares of a $100+ stock would be $100K required, so this is a lot of risk.\n\nI candidly marvel when new or newer traders make these large trades on high cost stocks without possibly understanding the amount of risk being taken. I'm going to presume you have an options account worth several million such that these are lower risk to your account, but if not be very careful as all these trades can have losses, and with the amounts at risk these could be substantial losses.\n\nNot a specific recommendation, but why not try 1 or 2 contracts on F or T that risks less than $2K? To me, this would be the more conservative and cautious way to trade, but it is your money and account.\n\nTo your questions -\n\n1) I largely ignore IV . . . If I have vetted the stock as one I am good to hold then the IV doesn't matter. Stocks with high IV are often also higher risk. If I have available capital to make a new trade, then I'll look to see which stocks I'd be good opening and then choose the one that has the best premium. This is likely to be the one with the higher IV, but I don't even look. Far too many traders use IV to make stock decisions which is why we see so many complain when they are bag holding shares, they don't want . . .\n\nOther than the research to find out if the stock is one, I am good holding, I focus on delta which give the Prob OTM. Note that liquidity and OI are obviously important which should be a given. Learning and understanding the Greeks is good to know but are not really necessary with the wheel IMO. \n\n2) I've had this conversation several times recently. I take what the market is giving and do not \"target\" returns. In some years the market can give 12% and other years 30%+, but there is no way to know what kind of market we will have until very late in the year or when it is over. Setting targets can drive bad trading behavior in that if the target is not reached the trader may try to make more and/or higher risk trades to \"catch up\". This is called revenge trading and can see high risk trades creating losses, then more high risk trades and more losses, etc.\n\nI'll take what the market is giving for individual trades. If there are 3 otherwise comparable and with all things being equal stocks I could trade and one has a $50 per contract profit, another a $60 and the third having a $65 potential profit, then I will choose the $65. Sometimes the market may see this number higher or lower, but I just want to sell the put, close it for 50% and move on to the next trade, which frequently happens, and the profits can add up very quickly. \n\n3) See my comments above, and that you are taking a lot of risk for a new trader.\n\n4) Spreads have a number of issues and problems, one of them is that they profit slower due to both legs having to decay before showing a profit. Short puts will profit faster. \n\nAs you will see I am a conservative trader who wants to make some side cash, so I'm not interested in optimizing or trying to eke out every last dollar from trades. What this means is that I open a trade and set a gtc limit order to close for 50%, and also an alert if the stock hits the strike to look at rolling, but then I go about my day. If the trade closes for 50% in a short time, then this frees up the capital to go find another trade to open and repeat. I just like the hands off and simple approach vs. having to constantly watch and make decisions on trades. \n\nI never let puts expire as it can take a week or longer to collect the last few dollars.\n\n5) You should work to develop your own style of trading as this is important. IMO starting out low and slow is critical to see how trades that get challenged and have to be rolled or adjusted works, and what it looks like when a loss has to be taken. The market has been amazingly smooth for a while, but it will not stay this way forever and being prepared to handle assignments and manage them is the hard part of trading. \n\nThere is a saying - \"New traders focus on profits to make as much as they can as fast as possible which can often result in problem trades and losses. Seasoned experienced and successful traders focus on lowering and managing risk that may help avoid problem trades and losses but keep losses to a manageable level if they happen.\"\n\nHope this helps and best of luck on your trades.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks again Scot. Lots of good advice.\n\nThrough your comment about risking $87.5K, I had an epiphany and realized that I was being confused by some posts that seemed to equate risk as the same thing as BP/margin requirement (or maybe it was just me assuming those were the same), which was confusing me. For the case of the ZTS trade, the margin requirement/BP is only $12K which is different from the potential risk/exposure which is $87.5K. But for a spread, the BP is the same as the risk exposure (in example trade above it's $5K BP and $5K max loss) - this is why I had a bias to spreads as I knew the max loss exposure. \n\nWhile you mention doing a trade for $50 or $60 profit, I still don't really follow how you think about what a good trade is. It's hard for me to know if you are choosing trades that are close to ATM or deep OTM, etc. For example, F is trading at $12.45. I see April 5 $12 Put (33 DTE) with premium of $0.22, Prob OTM 66%, delta .31, IV  27.6%. You could sell 2 contracts and make $44, BPE \\~$400, risk $2400. But do you look at that saying, that's too close to ATM and you prefer further OTM? Do you look at the $44 premium on the BPE of \\~$400 (is 11% over 30 days good enough) or the $2400 risk (is 1.8% for the risk return not enough) - or do you say 11% return on BPE is good and overall exposure of $2400 can't be 5% of my total portfolio?\n\nIt would be helpful if you wrote out a specific example of a recent trade you did and why you picked it based on the Prob OTM, delta, contract size, premium, DTE, BPE, etc. That would help me in how to think about what a good conservative trade looks like.\n\nAgain to your recommendation, I will look for smaller dollar stocks and do 1 or 2 contracts as I start out.\n\nThanks again for sharing your wisdom.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Spreads seem to be safer as they have lower risk, but have many flaws that can make them higher risk. \n\nI’ve posted many times about how spreads have lower premium & profit due to buying a long leg each time, profit slower due to both legs having to decay, harder to roll as there are two legs, more fees, and while they do have defined risk will also lose more often.

A specific practical example helps me process it better. \n\nAnyways, in the prior replies above, I looked at Ford F after market close on Friday and wrote this sample trade. (Copied from above). \"F is trading at $12.45. I see April 5 $12 Put (33 DTE) with premium of $0.22, Prob OTM 66%, delta .31, IV 27.6%. You could sell 2 contracts and make $44, BPE \\~$400, risk $2400.\" To get a $50 or $60 profit with your GTC limit order when the trade makes 50%, then you'd probably have to sell 5 contracts not 2, so you'd be collecting $120 premium and risking $6000. GTC limit order when profit is $60.\n\nThe delta is .31 and the Prob OTM is 66% (so may not be quite the 70% you want).\n\nIs this kind of trade you would do? Why or why not?\n\nWhen I look at the Ford trade above, the $12 strike is only 3.6% OTM and I like to be further OTM (but then the premium diminishes to make it not worthwhile). Are you not that concerned with being that close to ATM because you mainly rely on Delta and Prob OTM that says likely to be OTM even though it's currently not that far OTM?\n\nYou said you try to do trades to make $50 or $60, but I don't know how much you are risking on the trade. For Ford example, is $120 premium enough on $6K of risk? Is this in the range for your normal trades or do your look for something different collect $X premiums on $Y risk?\n\nThanks for your time. Just the back and forth with you has been helpful in helping my thought process.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My thought process is spelled out in my post, and I do not know why you are having so much trouble understanding it. Thousands have used this post as a starting point to help them develop their own plan, but you are the only one who is struggling to get it . . .\n\nLet me spell it out even more clearly - (Note that I am not currently trading F so the following is an example and not a recommendation)\n\n* Does my research and analysis indicate that I would be good holding F shares for a while if assigned? If yes, then move to the next step.\n* Are there any events like an ER coming up in the 30-45 dte timeframe? If yes, then move to the next qualified stock. If no, move to the next step.\n* Based on the F options chain (premarket) the 32 dte 11.5 strike has a -.17 delta and Prob ITM of 19.5% or 80.5% Prob OTM with a .10 premium. \n* What capital do I have available which would keep 50% of my account in cash, plus keep the risk of F at 5% or below? 5 contracts would have a max profit of $50 with a BPE of around $773 on my account and would cost $5,700 to buy the shares if assigned. If this fits my risk and account profile, then I'll open the trade.\n* Based on the above the trade outline with an 80% probability of success, I see this as a high probability trade that has relatively low risk to make $50. F is a solid stock and pays a 4.82% dividend so if assigned I would be good to hold it for weeks or months if I had to.\n\nThe \"max risk\" of the F trade is $5,700 **IF the company went bankrupt** and the stock dropped to zero, which we can hopefully agree is not going to happen anytime soon or without some warning. How much risk is there really?? F could have bad news and the stock drop to $10 or lower, but this would not be a 100% loss . . . How can we calculate the actual risk? The answer is that we cannot . . .\n\nThe BPE of $773 is the capital required to make the trade, which is small for my account. \n\nWhy would I make this trade with such a seemingly low dollar return? Because the chances of it being successful are very high. Between the 80%+ probability, and the ability to roll the put for more credit, if necessary, means the odds of a profit are likely 90%+.\n\nDo I look for other stocks and trades that make higher premiums and possible profits? Of course! But what they all have in common is that I am willing to be assigned and hold the shares if needed.\n\nLet's contrast this against another stock - AMC\n\n* Does my research and analysis show this is a stock I would be good holding? No! Do not move to the next step.\n\nWhile a similar 32 dte 18.2% Prob ITM set up to F above would bring in $90 with a $1,455 of BP required, the stock is not worth the risk.\n\nWorking to compare dollar risk, 20 contracts of AMC would bring in $180 with a $5,800 risk, which would be very tempting as the premium and possible profits are much higher, but as AMC could go bankrupt at any time, so I would never make this trade . . .\n\nI'll say it again - \"A new trade focuses on profits and how much they can make. A more experienced trader will focus on risk to make many small wins without putting too much of the account at risk.\" The above is a clear example of taking a small profit from a higher probability and lower risk trade.\n\nAs my final comment on this thread, you do seem to have some problems understanding what a fairly simple concept this all is, and some have confidence or temperament issues that means they may not be cut out to be a good trader. Perhaps you have 'analysis paralysis\"? \n\nWith that said, and trying to help, I'd strongly suggest reading the book **Trading in the Zone by Douglas** as this addresses the important aspect of maximizing a trader's state of mind and that developing your own mindset and plans which are critical to success. **Your extensive effort to try to see how I think is the wrong path as my goals, style or trading, personal risk tolerance, account size, and many other factors means you are going to trade significantly different than I do, so you are wasting both of our time.** \n\nI wish you the best in your trading, and I have taken a lot of time to explain in as simple terms as I can, but if you are unable to get it from here then options trading may not be for you . . . -Scot out", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
