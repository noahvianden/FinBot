Just 6 months later, with the Great Recession in full swing and the stock market in free fall, a share of Apple was under $13 (split adjusted), even though Apple's potential as a company was still very strong.  It took another 6 months for AAPL to recover, followed by a couple years of steady growth and then a substantial pop in late 2012 as iPhone 4s and then iPhone 5 revenues exploded.  This propelled AAPL well into Megacap territory.\n\nWith this in mind, it would not surprise me at all if a major financial panic caused TSLA prices to fall 40-50%.  This would not alter my outlook for the company at all.  If the company eventually sells millions of high-margin automobiles, lots of battery storage systems, and solar roofs, the stock could do very well in the years after a downturn.
