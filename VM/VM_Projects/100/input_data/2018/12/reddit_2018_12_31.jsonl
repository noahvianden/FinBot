Here is their financials.\n\nhttps://abc.xyz/investor/\n\nGoogle accounts for it in \"Other\".  But NOT to be confused with Alphabet \"Other bets\". It makes it a bit confusing to people.\n\n> People hate ads. \n\nPeople get ads are part of life and what they care most about is appropriate ads.  Not things like huge graphics in the screen.  Or ones that take control, etc.\n\nGoogle ads in Search are very low key and do NOT think anyone has much of an issue.   They also do provide some value because of how Google runs the auction.  The auction was key and really smart how Google did it.  I was listening to a podcast yesterday and apparently they stole the idea from someone I had never heard of.   But you have to know what to steal.\n\nYouTube the ads are also handled pretty well.  Do not think they are too obnoxious.    Today with TV there is 18 minutes of ads for every hour.  You do NOT get close to that with YouTube.   \n\nYT really does not have competition and is growing like crazy.  It is now over 1.8 billion hours a day consumed.  So apparently the ads are NOT hurting business.\n\n> A lot of YouTubers don’t like YouTubes bugs. \n\nI have ZERO idea of what \"YouTubes bugs\" you are referring to?  I use YouTube everyday and a lot and do NOT experience any bugs.  So can't help you there.\n\nI do think if there were \"bugs\" we would hear about it.  When you have 1.8 billion hours consumed a bug is going to be well known.  It is the #2 most popular web site in the world and one of the most popular apps.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_websites\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_smartphone_apps\n\nGoogle actually owns 5 of the top 7 most popular apps used on ALL smartphones in the world.  They also have 2 of the most popular web sites and 26 of the top 100.\n\nThere is some bitching about YouTube in the process of them trying to clean it up.   But we can see the growth continues uninbated so does not seem to hurt business.\n\nAt this point it would be impossible to create a true YouTube competitor.\n\nThe reason is Google lucked into the timing.  Something like YouTube became possible and that is where all the video content was posted over the 10+ years.    It would be impossible to get people to post all of that video again.\n\nBut it is the efficiency from scale that would make it very difficult in addition.  Google built out the infrastructure through the years and now has far less cost then someone just starting up.  \n\nCost would be huge to create a new service.   Scale is a strong moat builder.\n\n>  but that came at the cost of being a very scummy company. \n\nActually do NOT think Google is any more scummy then any other company.     Take China.

IT is a perfect area to fuel growth for decades.   It is like Amazon and ecommerce.  Huge market that has fueled their growth for over 2 decades now and continues.  But then it created the AWS opportunity.\n\nSDC is perfect for Alphabet.  Ads will slow down as their is just so much available.   Google and FB now have, I believe, over 50% of what is spent.  Do NOT hold me to that numbers but a material amount.  Eventually that will slow.\n\nSDC - Self Driving Cars.\n\ni will make a wild prediction.
