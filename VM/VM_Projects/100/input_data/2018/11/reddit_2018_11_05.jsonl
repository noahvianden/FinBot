An area they are clearing growing in and pushing hard. So it isn't just the sale.of the phone itself that makes them money, but they are continuing to make money off of the customers as long as they are using the phone.\n\nI also disagree that this move means that they think phone sales are going to drop or completely stall.

At some point their margin will no longer grow either and will likely shrink as phones become more commodities.\n\nPeople have been saying this for a decade or more for Apple products, and yet they still get away with charging ridiculous amounts for their phones and other devices. \n\nCommunication technology has never just been a commodity, communication as a service certainly could be seen more as such, but not the technology that drives it.

Until a technology comes along to replace smartphones (whatever that may be), there will always be demand for the newest and greatest and people will eventually need to replace their old devices.
