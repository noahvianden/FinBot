They cost him $11 each, and there was a lot of vol pumped in there, but if it does crater this hard, there will still be a lot of IV, so maybe that’s a wash. The real problem is that that is not a terribly liquid contract (less than 100 open at close today) and closed with a $1 wide spread. Why he wouldn’t have just done the 12/21 (for $1 less/contract, half the spread, and with 1600 open) is beyond me. Anyway, figure it might go for a few bucks more than it’s intrinsic, so let’s say (again, assume we open at $170) that it’ll go for somewhere in the neighborhood of $22 or $23 per, but they cost him $11 each.
