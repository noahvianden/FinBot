Its unlikely that a college kid could re-invent the Google Search algorithm/write a phone OS like android. Or set up a massive logistics infrastructure like Amazon has. Or make a similar product to Windows or Azure.\n\nFacebook, on the other hand, is a fancy, glorified web forum. There are probably thousands of clones that would work the same or better if all Facebook users migrated over. Why is everyone on Facebook? For most people, the answer is simply \"because everyone else is\". They were the first \"grown-up\" social media site, and that's why they ended up with all the users. \n\nSo what do they bring to the table? A clunky forum-like service. Its true value is the userbase, and they would be nothing without it. If I presented an objectively better version of facebook that cared about your privacy and had no ads called myfriendpals.com and said you should switch over, would you? No because all your friends and family are on Facebook. I wouldn't switch over either.\n\nNow you'd think Facebook would try to treat their users well to encourage them to stay for a long time, but they are constantly in the news being caught fucking them over one way or another to squeeze every bit of possible short-term profit out. The platform is so full of ads and spam that the content you actually logged on to see is buried. Facebook has stopped caring about pleasing its userbase. Its working out for them now, but will it always? I've never met a Facebook fanboy. Everyone uses it because they \"have to\".\n\nIf a new platform actually finds a way to get a chunk of Facebook users to bother switching over, it will snowball and people will start leaving Facebook at an exponential rate.\n\nI know they have bought out other popular companies, and facebook.com isn't their only source of revenue, but same deal with Instagram. Its a simple platform that doesn't really bring much to the table except the other users which could leave at any time.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "id": "9tb027", "created_utc": 1541089896.0, "score": 246, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 194, "comments": [{"body": ">So what do they bring to the table?\n\nTens of billions in cash, no debt, and a [long list of mergers and acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook).

With how many users they have (billions), it's a very complicated system. It's by no means \"easy\" to create.\n2. What clones are you referring to? The closest attempt I can recall is Google+/Circle and that failed miserably.\n3. You're right, their true value is user base, and that alone is very powerful. They got users across  Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and Whatsapp. People are not going to switch into a new network since friends and family are on it. In addition, they're able to continuously improve on their product by doing research (A/B test) on their huge user base. So it's even MORE difficult for some other company to build a better product because they don't have the data to do so. It's pretty much a network monopoly.\n4.

They are extremely savvy and have executed better than any company in the world in my opinion as they’ve navigated every twist and turn transitioning from the web to mobile. They spotted trends way before anyone else and continue to do so. When they bought Instagram for a billion I thought it was completely idiotic. Then $19 billion for WhatsApp. But now it makes sense. They want to own your free time on your phone. Any trend away from spending time on the Facebook ecosystem they will attack head on.\n\nLast point- it’s not only the user platform that would be very difficult to replicate it’s the advertising platform. They’ve essentially built a system for advertisers to leverage and measure ads to over 2 billion people in one place. The value of that is immeasurable. The market is scared because it’s not sure they will be able to grow revenue by having people view more video and personalized content than spending time on the newsfeed. I think this is the wrong way to look at it. They are smartly realizing that the important thing is to keep people coming back and spending as much time on the platform and then figuring out how to monetize it. They spelled this out in no uncertain terms on the call on Tuesday.

Yahoo, for example, had a history of acquiring companies only to have them die due to mismanagement. That ain't happening here, and that's a good signal.\n\n5) Heavy investment in Oculus and VR shows Facebook isn't afraid of thinking in the long term future and taking riskier bets even if they don't pay profits right away.

If any other platforms rise up FB will just buy them out (shown by IG). If they can't buy them out FB will just clone the platform and make it better (as shown by IG stories & snapchat). For these reasons - and more i could go on - i don't think facebook as a company going away any time soon.\n2. Superior ad targeting: The value of FB is the value it provides to advertisers. No one is able to offer the targeting and scalability of Facebook/IG except maybe Google (Search & YT). This is due to the nature of the platforms. While Google has people actively searching for something, and sells advertisers on that, Facebook/IG is by its very nature a platform where people divulge shit tons of personal information - their age, their likes, their dislikes. We follow brands, companies, other people, influencers etc.. For that reason, FB offers the best targeting capabilities of any company.\n3. Scalability - No one offers advertisers more scalability than FB and Google. You can spend $30 a month, or $30M.

For what it's worth I apologize for not getting in touch with you about it because you're important in WSB but at the time I was on my phone at like 4 in the morning and about to go to sleep and my shovel thumbs can barely navigate reddit mobile to get to the modlist as it is.\n\nThis is what it looked like:\n\nA useful and somewhat controversial script I made to lessen our workload removes some user's against-the-rules dumb shitpost which is just a generic /r/funny meme with a WSB title, which is something we're actively trying to cut down on (and even made a new rule about). They're only just tolerating the fact that people can vote remove their posts through WSBVoteBot even though it's having a hugely positive affect on the subreddit, so I view it as somewhat of a precarious thing from a PR  (I know, it's kind of cringey but we are talking about 350k people here and it only takes a few people to pitchfork) perspective. I don't want people to have reasons to be annoyed at automod/votebot/mechafuckboy/us in general.\n\nThen for whatever reason an unknown mod (read: general average users don't know you enough to cut you slack) ends up posting this content back to the sub as their own. When the users get annoyed and respond with possibly the most negativity I've ever seen toward a mod action in wallstreetbets you tell them to suck lemons because \"gg nerd I got your karma\" or whatever you said.\n\nI feel like a community is an ongoing PR project and that in WSB there is a dynamic where the somewhat newer people keep things going and the older guard occasionally comes over much like an out-of-the-loop executive in a company who isn't on the ground, and does something that is suboptimal at best, harmful at worst. Not malicious, but just not the way to go. Good will with the users is a commodity that I try to bank and people spend it for no reason.\n\nRemember spez editing those comments? Shit mods do to a userbase is like when you say something dumb to a girlfriend and she throws it in your face forever afterward every time she's pissed enough. Now we're the karma-stealing faggots who will use our bots to poach your content and tell you \"fuck you nerd I got your karma\" in the comments. There is really no way for me to distance us from that shit unless I make you the sacrificial lamb because then you're not a mod and we're not the kind of people who would do that or tolerate it. Stealing the credit for a post or the karma or whatever is like the house cheating someone at a game of chance. That will piss people off really quickly so I felt like I had to diffuse the situation and show that we'd removed you.\n\nThen I wake up and you're added back because of the same upper management affect (and rightly so, I'm not protesting their ability to do it, just the prudence. It's their sub). Users already noticed what had happened and pointed out that you got added back. Another setback.\n\nIf someone tells you you have the reigns and then someone occasionally yanks them out of your hand and does things you do not agree with you eventually just want to say fuck it because feeling like you have to get back on track due to someone else's actions is tiring. What else can I do but remove people who are making trouble and try to keep our userbase from branching off? It can happen. It hasn't yet but that doesn't mean much.\n\nIt's nothing personal. People get annoyed at me for removing friends and WSB long-timers but whether I feel like I can trust someone to act in our self interest as a community and whether I like them as a person and want to chat with them are two separate things. This just seemed to me like such an unpopular and potentially festering move that I needed to act quick and distance us from it before half-joking scorn turned into a pitchfork mob. I like the irreverent management style but it can be functionally equivalent to not examining your whims and how users might respond to them, which appears to be what happened.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people come here to gamble their life savings with friends, It's a silly place but I gotta do what I feel is right to keep it on the right track because it matters to me for whatever reason. If the elder gods disagree with the things I do I think they should replace me or tell me what to change because I am just doing what I think is right and I don't get a whole lot of feedback. If my priorities are consistently wrong then it is possible that I am just not the right guy for the job and that's OK. Should be someone else then because I'd like to see WSB hit a million with no successful off-branches or user uprisings.\n\nIs it right to give every mod two or three mulligans? That means every couple of weeks I can expect something random from a mostly inactive mod. Just doesn't seem tenable. I kind of want to just remove anybody who is inactive and lower the chances of random mods coming out of the woodwork to jam a stick in my spokes. I don't see the downside besides hurt feelings and that doesn't seem like a good reason not to.
