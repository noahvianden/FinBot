It will also depend on Intel's competitiveness with their next generation of CPUs. But all indications point to severely delayed 10nm node for Intel. While AMD's 7nm node is on track from both TSMC and GlobalFundries (beginning of 2019).\n\nAlso this is the first time AMD is going to fab their CPUs on both TSMC and GlobalFundries (all current Ryzen CPUs are Global Foundries).\n\nNow consider this. Zen2 is a first ever iteration on the very competitive Zen architectures, and the lead architect Mike Clark has already hinted at some obvious improvements they had to table in order to meet the Zen1 deadline. In other words architecturally and IPC speaking Zen2 should pack some serious uplift in terms of IPC.\n\nIf Zen is competitive today, with the inferior process (Global Foundries 14nm process Zen products are built on today is not as good as Intel's 14nm process). How competitive will Zen2 be with architectural improvements and a superior process?\n\nAnd then finally a piece of news that came out recently:\n\nWhen asked the CFO of GlobalFundries how he felt about AMD taping TSMC for the first time for their performance CPUs. GloFo's CFO had this to say:\n\n> [AMD] will have more demand than we have capacity, so I have no issues with that\n\nSource: https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?_mc=RSS_EET_EDT&doc_id=1333326&page_number=2\n\nSo to recap:\n\n- Zen2 should have a significant IPC uplift over current Zen.. which is already 98% of the way competitive to Intel. Due to low hanging fruit optimizations being that this is a brand new from scratch design. Whereas Intel has pretty much been squeezing all they can get out of their same architecture for a long time now. (in fact in light of some recent security issues on Intel chips which impact performance Intel is actually behind AMD).\n\n- For the first time in the history, AMD will not only be on the same playing field, but potentially ahead of Intel, as far as the Fab process is concerned. This means leadership in perf/watt and leadership in performance.\n\n- One of the fabs has pretty much confirmed that they think the volume will be insane. Not enough for one fab.\n\nAMD already has superior server CPUs from Intel in terms of value per core and IO, and very similar performance in terms of perf/watt and IPC. Fast forward to 2019.. AMD should have superior server CPUs in every conceivable metric. Last time AMD was competitive they reached 45% consumer and 20% server market. Despite the fact that Intel used illegal rebates to keep AMD from OEMs (something they got convicted of both in US and EU). This time OEMs are jumping on board and this time AMD has a multigenerational roadmap designed to retain that marketshare. With a superior product 50% is very much achievable. \n\nHalf of the server market alone is a $10B TAM and growing. The total TAM AMD can address for Servers, Laptops, Desktop and derivative products + GPUs is $70B.\n\nApple has dropped Intel from their future Macs as well.. there is an indication that their next CPU Kalamata might incorporate AMD via semi custom.\n\nIntel has been caught sleeping. In semis it takes a long time to come up with an answer (took AMD 5 years). AMD has never been in a better position.
