Some of the best bull run returns come in the final year.\n\nBond flows well outpacing equity flows\n\nWhile analyst are bullish, forward P/E may be high as prices have outpaced increased earnings and some firms are still adjusting their models for increased earnings due to tax bill\n\nS&P 500 statistically expensive relative to past years\n\nExpect this year an opportunity to buy S&P 500 5-10% off it's highs due to a pullback\n\n11 of 19 bear market indicators have been triggered\n\nTax reform was largely priced in at the start of the year on a price standpoint, but price/earnings estimates may be revised upwards as firms include tax related aspects into their estimates\n\nTax reform may add 10-11% to EPS for 2018. Discretionary and telecom the biggest benefiters\n\nWeary that tax reform benefit for financials (thought of having the biggest impact) will remain due to competition\n\nTax reform good for small caps, but large caps have pricing power while small caps competition is tough\n\nNet margins for companies look **extremely** good and are at all time highs\n\nSector opinions:\n\n* **Overweight**: Information Technology, Materials, Financials\n\n* **Marketweight**: Health Care, Consumer Staples, Industrials, Energy, Telecom\n\n* **Underweight**: Real Estate, Consumer Discretionary, Utilities \n\nSector specific highlights:\n\nOverweight\n\nTech: semiconductors and tech hardware\n\nMaterials: Metals & Mining, Chemicals\n\nFinancials: banks and cap markets\n\nMarketweight\n\nConsumer staples: Food & Staples Retailing\n\nIndustrials: Machinery\n\nUnderweight\n\nRE: Specialty REITs\n\nTech only sector with positive net cash (cash - debt)\n\nCompanies likely to use repatriated and excess cash to pay down debt instead of buyback shares or companies\n\nWatch out for surprise inflation; would lead to quicker fed tightening than expected, and be a strong bear market signal.\n\nWage inflation has put some pressure on margins\n\nTax break/cash windfall has companies looking more towards one-time employee bonuses and wage increases than capex\n\nLarge caps over small caps\n\nDividend growth over high dividend yield\n\n", "id": "7sxdow", "created_utc": 1516898886.0, "score": 315, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": ">S&P 2018 target of 3000. \n\nPack it up boys this analysis is legit ", "score": 129, "replies": [{"body": "Lol, 3000 will be hit by March if not next week.

Been fucking around with low and mid cap stocks in the Canadian market for the last few weeks now like literally sitting in front of my computer (currently unemployed, looking for work and doing this is my day) and I've managed to turn $20k into .... $19.8k. Honestly it makes me feel like a complete and utter failure especially in a bull market where you frequent this sub and people are pulling huge gains. I'd love to make a decent trade to actually make the work feel like it was worth it and it's starting to feel like solid blue chips in the American markets ($SHOP feels like it's due to run out of momentum) are the only way to go. Funny enough you mention MU because I was going to swing trade it when it hit $42.15 the other day but not having US capital in my account would amount to 3% in forex fees and recouping 3% on MU would most likely take me a lifetime ... or longer. Very much looking forward to my lackadaisical bank finally enabling option trading after 2 weeks of prodding them and to get greenbacks in the account so I can invest in quality stocks, not our shitty beaver buck market. \n\nAnyways, the TLDR version of this is you're so fucking right.

Eh I'm more so a little displeased with myself for globetrotting about for the past year with my money stagnating in a low interest TFSA when it could have been potentially doubling itself in this crazy bull market and paying for the trips rather than losing to inflation. Also really unimpressed with how slack-assed CIBC has been to bring things live but it is what it is. Can't go back in time (fuck! if only haha). \n\nThat's amazing. Sounds like regardless of how much more you could have pulled during the bull run, you've at least done yourself some justice financially which puts you at a distinct advantage in life. It's a fucking savage world driven by greed so any time you can make your own little part of it easier to live within that's a bonus. \"$25k onto random plays\" sounds like it's only a matter of time. Hehe yeah I do that too with the \"if I had\" or \"I should have\" but after mentally flogging myself with that mindset I've just decided to learn from the mistakes and trudge on. There will always be more opportunity to achieve financial freedom. \n\nHehe you are! Blue chips are high volume, household names that do well. I agree, stocks like Netflix, SHOP, etc. have grown disproportionately and it seems what gain is left isn't worth the risk. You know? Like measuring upside vs downside it's very lob sided because everything is so god damn expensive now. Hard to find something with a forward P/E below 20x. \n\nAnyways thanks for the suggestion. Going to use DLR ETF to convert to greenbacks and get into the US market. Canada is all fucking weed meme stocks, not much tech, shitty retail, and a lot of commodity-based and with our crude being subject to WTI pricing not Brent we're at a pricing disadvantage. US markets are the place to be! Thanks for the tip on the dips as well, it's going to be one hell of a fall when it does. \n\nCheers and best of luck to you, sir!
