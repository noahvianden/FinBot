If I wasn't already in MSFT, I would have. Its one of those stocks I am actually debating if I should jsut gamble my 100% portfolio on an earnings. lol (but I am too conservative and a pussy to pull the trigger).\n\nI work in IT, specifically as a IT consultant/cloud architect.  Every company/client of ours wants to transition to office 365/azure.\n\nRight now is a critical moment to get in because a lot of servers are retiring (bought around the time windows server 2012 came out, usually companies buy it a year later in 2013 with physical servers that have 4-5 year warranty). Warranties on servers are VERY important, it is foolish to not have them or you will be paying a shitload of money to replace parts. So when servers warranty retire thats usually when companies just upgrade and alot of them are now debating between two paths they have available (for a mail server specifically):\n\n- 1) Getting a dell server, Getting windows server operating system & then installing exchange on top of that. Or....\n\n- 2) Getting office 365 and migrating everything to a very secure, easy to use, efficient & problemless (relative to on premise) setup. Which provides a file server, office suite and loads of other softwares as well.\n\nAnd right now Office 365 is actually cheaper for most companies to go in the direction of. Not only year to year cost comparison wise but also because of they dont have to spend the initial $15k+ just to get a mail server rolling. We get so many questions and projects regarding this now that we might as well be a company that specalizes in msft cloud migration/deployment/supporting only company. This change taking place was evident at the last earnings (when msft hit their 2020 cloud revenue goal in 2017!) and will continue to be so for the next 8 earnings at the VERY least. so dont miss out and get FOMO! \n\nJust my two cents.\n\nedit: The reason why this is big is because you now pay msft money for the full service rather than partial. That mail server you used to buy.... part of it would go to Dell or whoever makes your actual physical server. By part I mean 60-70% of the money you spend.\n\nNot any more. This money goes to MSFT now.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the solid DD. I am sold on MSFT for their cloud services, it's just a question of when to enter.

Our clients and many of my peers at other MSPs will tell you otherwise in toronto & new york. AWS is great but it is not replacing microsoft nor is G suite. You can easily test this. Go to job posting site & type aws. See how many weekly job postings (weekly because these jobs fill up fast and get taken off the job post sites whereas AWS postings last longer because not enough people specialize in it. Not to mention a part of AWS job postings are for programmers not server admins) come up related to AWS then type office 365, Microsoft server & azure and see how many job postings are related to Microsoft. Regardless of city you will get the same results that favor my point of the current skills employers want from new IT staff.\n\nThe difference between the job postings are night and day for AWS & Office 365 / Azure for the simple fact that 70% (might be more) of all network administrators use primarily Microsoft. You dont HAVE to know anything else to be a network administrator but you HAVE to know microsoft to some degree in today's industry(unless you a linux admin of course).  Microsoft being such a common service among companies is the same reason Linux couldn't compete with microsoft at microsoft's scale. Not that it wasn't successful, just not at the scale.  And now that cloud is starting to become the norm the transition will be towards microsoft. And the transition for them is a lot smoother going with tech they have experience with versus tech do not they have experience with (i.e. easier/smoother to build a hybrid environment with on premise msft servers combined with msft cloud services). But again the selling point for microsoft from my business' perceptive right now is Office 365 not so much Azure (though Office 365 is built on azure) .  Compare amazon's cloud growth versus microsoft cloud growth to get a better picture. its Microsoft thats swallowing the percentages away from AWS in 2017 not the other way around. https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/27/microsoft-azure-growing-faster-than-aws-google-cloud-behind.html\n\nThis isn't to shit on AWS, its a beast and I love it (my company does support it, especially their storage services). AWS still holds the majority of the cloud market because AWS had a massive early start and alot of companies are indeed built on it & utilize AWS's storage infrastructure especially (ie Dropbox, though last i heard they left and made their own infrastructure). By the way servers that run on AWS are either linux or windows. AWS is just an infrastructure they dont have their own OS...  so microsoft still gets paid with an AWS setup. I mentioned alot of companies are built on AWS cloud already but that \"alot\" does not come even close to the majority of companies that are still on premise using old school Microsoft setups. They are far more likely to go the azure route now (especially one they get a taste of what O365 can do over their on premise exchange / regular office suite).\n\nOffice 365 is the first taste every company gets of the cloud as its the most logical one to do for its price and purpose. And that service is the selling point itself of cloud and azure which will be the next big step to move AD and other services offsite.\n\nFYI: I am bullish on both amazon and microsoft. Both are excellent at what they do. \n\n", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I do consulting. I am moving people from G Suite. I don't have time to deal with Outlook integration.

Sharepoint really sucks and google docs/sheets are what people actually like.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sharepoint is ALOT better than before. The problem with sharepoint isn't sharepoint itself but rather the administrators who design it for companies. I will admit sharepoint 2010 was horrible and should be taken out any company asap. Sharepoint online however is legit and will be the standard soon enough that companies will flock to it... if they can hire professionals to do it instead of their 20 year veteran network admin who just read a book on it. It gets a bad rep because of them screwing up when they designed it and made it more complicated to use than it should have. You really need to know what you are doing and specialize in SharePoint to get its full potential in an effecient way. Best practice weren't in yet so its kind of understanble because it was a brand new thing that admins were playing around with. Us having to fix shitty designed sharepoint in our clients system and upgrade them to the latest iteration has been one of the most nightmarish experience, I will say that.\n\nAs for docs/sheets argument, this is not true. You can not do alot of the things that accountants need to do on sheets that they can do on excel. All the Excel keyboard shortcuts around formatting and filtering are essentially left out in sheets. This means building financial models or anything requiring more than just listing out numbers requires Microsoft Excel. Things also load faster in Excel if you have a lot of data in your worksheets. Index matching is also done excellent on a installed version of excel. What sheets had was collaborative work before Microsoft caught up and did it right in Office 365. So that selling point is gone for them too. \n\n This isn't to say google cant get there, they definitely can but as of right now if you want to capitalize on this as an investor. Microsoft is the way. And I do hope google does better because both will force each other to try harder to make a better product than just be a monopoly who controls everything. Because in my opinionAWS was the best thing to ever happen to Microsoft. Microsoft for a while was just coasting along not doing ambitious things with their successful products (too busy trying out other things like making a console, making phones, etc) They forgot their roots and what made them great.
