I was devasted, and down to 150 BTC total.\n\n>After evaluating the situation, I came to the conclusion that the pump to 16k was a dead cat and that we are going lower. Therefore I shorted. At 12k. Added at 13k. Added at 14 and 15k. Got liquidated at the top at 17k. Another 50 BTC loss. Down to 100.\n\n>Think, ok we made a higher high at 17k, uptrend back on. Went long.
