I was sure Amazon was something I should buy at $400, but my stock broker talked me out of it, which is why is my former stockbroker now.\n\nThen there was the time I was at some convention in New York a few months before Paypal was to have their IPO, and some some representatives of the company at a small booth. I took a moment to tell the staff how great I thought their service was, praising it highly, and a few days later I got a phone call, inviting me to invest in the company is IPO because I was such a fan.I had recently lost some money on an IPO and stupidly turned it down, but of course it would've been great to pull the trigger. The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that a younger Elon Musk must've been standing there listening, and it was probably his decision to invite me into the IPO, but of course none of us knew who he was at the time.\n\nSo what are your investing horror stories?", "id": "7rqn2w", "created_utc": 1516458272.0, "score": 84, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 124, "comments": [{"body": "Oh so many mistakes; but not a lot that can easily be articulated.
