This package will grant him over 500 million dollars for market caps reached at 100 Billion and at 50 billion increments above that, vesting 1% of the shares outstanding per increment up to 12% of shares outstanding. It is reliant on market based milestones, which musk can influence with his public brand and on acquisitions to further integrate the company as a renewable energy company. The exercise price is that of TSLA shares on Jan 18 2018, around $350. Additionally the vesting is reliant on operational milestones involving increased revenues and EBIDTA. The operational requirements may be achieved through aggressive accounting practices and wouldn't be hurt by strange depreciation accounting that would improve FCF. In the current compensation plan, Musk is required to have TSLA achieve 30% or more in gross margins for several consecutive quarters. We have instances of capitalisation of expenses that has helped get TSLA’s margins close to that number in previous years. If Musk believes or sees that these milestones are unreachable, even with the zeal that he can inspire in his followers, he may very well jump ship. When you realise that they don't expense R&D as cost of goods sold then you realise what is being done to inflate the gross margin figures.\n\n**Exhibit 2**\n\nSolarCity acquisition should have been illegal from a corporate governance point of view. Six of Tesla’s seven directors have clear ties to SolarCity. Tesla’s board includes SolarCity’s former CFO, a SolarCity director, and two VCs whose firms also have seats on SolarCity’s board, along with Musk’s brother, Kimbal. Musk chairs both companies and is SolarCity’s largest shareholder. He has taken out $475 million in personal credit lines to buy more shares in SolarCity and Tesla when advantageous. SpaceX, his aerospace company, has purchased $165 million in bonds issued by SolarCity. Some analysts cautioned that Musk might be self-dealing, rescuing his own investments and his cousins’ company through this purchase. Hedge-fund manager Jim Chanos, who had shorted Tesla and SolarCity, called the acquisition a “shameful example of corporate governance at its worst,” a “bailout” of SolarCity that “strikes us as just the height of folly.” SolarCity was not doing well, Chanos believed that it was on its way to bankruptcy, with its bonds yielding over 20% by the time that they were bought.\n\n**Exhibit 3**\n\nMusk’s public popularity raises valuations of the companies who he attaches himself to. He has been touted as the world’s Tony Stark. Just go to YouTube to watch the drivel that fanboys post about him. Recently and notably, Youtuber boyinaband has begun to celebrate Musk with his audience and the amount of absurd “thug life” and “MUSK DESTROYS” compilations on youtube is beginning to rival that of Jordan Peterson.\n\n**Exhibit 4**\n\nAlong with these liquid stock grants that further dilute shareholders, TSLA equity finances a lot, especially, it seems, when they assure shareholders that they have no plans to. They also issue a lot of debt, and are not transparent with their plans to raise capital. When asked about TSLA capital needs in last year’s Q2, Musk responded, “And now that said, there may be some wisdom in having a cash cushion for unexpected events. You just never know if there's going be some significant force majeure events in the world. It could be an earthquake in California, for example. But we're not at this point considering an equity raise. We are thinking about debt, but we're not thinking about an equity raise.” Considering that the Company announced the debt raise less than a week later and is already on a roadshow, management was clearly well past the “thinking about” stage at the time of Q2 earnings. In fact, the Company seems already well on its way to a raise in contacting debt rating agencies and planning for a roadshow. Readers can determine whether Tesla’s representation during earnings call was accurate. There are many other instances of this kind of behaviour by TSLA management, and is not a credit to their credibility. Their only positive cash flows come from financing activities and they now have a D/E of 2.22. It is clear from a quick look at their cash flow statements that even in 2017 they are raising far more debt than they are paying back. Also they keep claiming in their 10-K that they are innovative manufacturers, and are supremely safe, meanwhile they have to borrow Panasonic employees and are hand-assembling batteries, and they change their production forecasts downwards many times a season.\n\n\n\n**Exhibit 5**\n\nThey are becoming increasingly unprofitable as their revenues scale. This is highly unusual as one would expect that fixed costs would begin to be spread as they scale. This points to a break even point at lower rather than higher than current sales volumes given the current infrastructure. This of course would run completely contrary to their plans of becoming an all round provider of sustainable energy vehicles and other products. Their interest expenses have also more than doubled moving into 2017, with precipitous increases in SG&A expenses. These lower incomes are not as a result of higher R&D costs, as those have risen less than proportionally. Their EPS fell by 200% from 2016 to 2017.\n\n**Exhibit 6**\n\nOther than Elon Musk, CFO Deepak Ahuja and CTO J.B. Straubel no other executives are listed on its website, its investor relations page or in the annual report filings. Over the last year over 30 Executives and directors have left the company including chiefs in accounting and the CFO and the head of the Autopilot engineering division. This is an especially bad sign and is the hallmark of a failing company.\n\n**Exhibit 7**\n\nTSLA are no longer leaders in the most vigorous part of automobiles, which is autonomous vehicles. Among the largest market cap automobile manufacturers, TSLA has relatively unsophisticated autonomy in cars so far, trailing even behind GM. Considering that they were touted as pioneers in this field, with their first forays with NVDA, this does not bode well. Also given the lack of scrutiny that investors place on Musk, most likely the stock price still has expectations of leadership in autonomous vehicles baked into the price.\n\n**Exhibit 8**\n\nMany other incumbents are catching up to TSLA in high end EVs, and already has a presence in economy EVs segment. The market is very competitive and there is no reason to expect that TSLA will become leaders. Also TSLA has huge reliability issues according to TrueDelta.com, ranking as the most unreliable car purchasable in America.\n\n**Exhibit 9**\n\nTesla may not be eligible for the subsidies granted by the government, given that the Model S pollutes more than a Jeep on a per mile basis in the US, when accounting for the pollution in production and recharging.\n\n**Exhibit 10**\n\nTax credits in the US will no longer benefit TSLA in its Solar Energy provisions post December 2021. The services that they provide will no longer be tax exempt for residences. Expenditures only include set up costs, set up services are also provided by TSLA. By 2025, economic benefits for electric cars will also disappear in Norway if gas cars become banned. People will then flock to other auto manufacturers producing electric cars as the demand for TSLA exceeds supply.\n\n* Quoted from the 10-K risk section:\n\n>We currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles. In the U.S. and abroad, such incentives include, among other things, tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on non-recurring vehicle fees, the 25% value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. Notably, the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided to gas-powered vehicles through the oil and gas industries. Nevertheless, even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced, eliminated or exhausted. For example, in April 2017 and January 2016, respectively, previously available incentives in Hong Kong and Denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired, negatively impacting sales. Moreover, under current regulations, a $7,500 federal tax credit available in the U.S. for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles with at least 17 kWh of battery capacity, such as our vehicles, will begin to phase out over time with respect to any vehicles delivered in the second calendar quarter following the quarter in which we deliver our 200,000th qualifying vehicle in the U.S. We currently expect such 200,000th qualifying delivery to occur at some point during 2018. In addition, California implemented regulations phasing out a $2,500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for high-income consumers, which became effective in March 2016. In certain circumstances, there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interests to bring about such developments, which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles.\n\nThis will all further fuck their shitty cash flows.\n\n**Exhibit 11**\n\nReservation deposits are another way to finance the company.\n\n**Exhibit 12**\n\nVerbiage is relatively extravagant, overstating or emphasising features of their products that are not differentiating and are completely expected given their sector. For example their use of inverters, that they write their own software, make their own UI, the autopilot feature which is reportedly not better than many competitors and the fact that their power storage is infinitely scalable. Also they claim that they have core competencies in powertrain engineering, vehicle engineering, innovative manufacturing and energy storage, then they disclose in the risk section that they HAVE NO EXPERIENCE TO DATE IN MANUFACTURING VEHICLES IN HIGH VOLUMES. Clearly they are not competent in their core competencies. In producing the Model 3, they were so incapable of meeting demand that some of the production line is by hand, there were constant bottlenecks, quality control employees were totally inexperienced is automobiles. Batteries could be defective and management apparently didn’t care. Apparently their stress tests aren’t efficient either.\n\n**Exhibit 13**\n\nSolar City’s lease agreement model is highly risky for homeowners to agree to, it puts their house to a commitment to pay rising prices for a technology whose efficiency and cost is decreasing in the long term. It’s like buying a 20 year bond when you know rates are going up, it’s totally retarded and becomes a huge liability on the house when you need to sell it, because only a braindead idiot would want to buy a house on which they are forced to pay a coupon out to Solar City on a less than optimal solar rig. It’s like a subprime lending company. And Solar City won’t be able to compete against highly subsidised and technologically advanced solar manufacturers like DQ in China in the regular solar panel sales market. They have no claim on the residential market. Also it’s worth mentioning that Elon’s cousins run the company, and Elon is majority shareholder. So he basically bailed his family out of this shitty company when he bought it. It’s as cancerous as Goldman Sachs.\n\n**Exhibit 14**\n\nOut of warranty, Teslas become extremely expensive, especially since the way they’re built and service policies require less modular servicing. The battery costs 12000 dollars to replace for the Model S, and 40000 dollars for the Roadster, door handles cost 1000 dollars to replace each, and apparently they’re highly unreliable, 5000 dollars to replace the touchscreen which can become discoloured or even misaligned leading to freezing. Drive unit replacement would cost 6000 dollars out of pocket, which is composed of the entire so called power train, this is the source of the lack of modularity in repairs. Also TSLA does not support the used car market very well, apparently parts for salvage vehicles are impossible to acquire for “safety reasons”, even though competitor electric car makers do provide salvage parts, and it is not possible to see the service history of a used car.\n\n**Exhibit 15**\n\nTesla has a penchant for forecasting very unrealistic production numbers. Their forecasts for weekly production at the beginning of the year were 5000 units of the Model 3 per week by Q2. They said they’d have this production rate by mid 2017 before, and now they're making about 700 units a week, when they said they'd pull off 2500 by the end of Q1. Also TSLA has started issuing VIN insequencially, so it is more difficult to track production rates and service rates of newer vehicles.\n\n**Exhibit 16**\n\nWhile most investors are aware Tesla had received 518,000 Model 3 reservations as-of early August, 63,000 of which had been cancelled (12.16%), few know the problems Tesla has faced trying to get their own employees to convert Model 3 deposits to reservations. Tesla and SpaceX employees placed an estimated 13,000 Model 3 reservations and Tesla was counting on this army of employee beta testers, bound by NDAs and the threat of being fired (or worse, losing their stock option grants) to beta-test the Model 3 without leaking details to the public. Quite surprisingly, on November 15th Tesla sent out the first batch of Model 3 configuration invitations to non-employees (Electrek reported non-employee configurations on November 21st) with the first known non-employee VIN assigned November 22nd and the earliest confirmed non-employee delivery on December 20th. Based on Tesla’s fourth quarter production and delivery press release, a total of 1,892 Model 3s had been produced prior to December 21st - indicating the estimated 13,000 employee Model 3 reservations translated into perhaps 1,500 firm orders (11.5%).\n\n**Exhibit 17**\n\nThe price is just too high on the Model 3, which is supposed to be their mass market product. Tesla is only shipping the ‘Long Range’ Model 3 loaded with mandatory options: Not only are there very few $51,000+ compact sedans in the world (for good reason), reservations holders initially believed they were purchasing a $35,000 vehicle ($25,000 net of Federal and State tax credits) with $5,000 to $10,000 of potential options. The shift in pricing likely explains our estimated 11.5% conversion rate on Tesla’s 13,000 employee Model 3 reservations - these are primarily hourly workers, after all! Apparently sales in the Model 3 price range is just 1/6th of the sales in the 20k-30k. So much for mass market.\n\n**Exhibit 18**\n\nOn the gross margin front, due to Tesla’s ‘unique’ accounting, we forecast gross margins of 15% to 20% for the Model 3 at average sales prices $46,500 per copy - but this will merely be an accounting mirage: If we apply traditional automaker accounting to our Model 3 forecasts - reducing the sales price by 10% to re-allocate SG&A (19.41% at Tesla versus 7% for Ford and GM) as well as include expensed R&D in COGS, the $46,500 Model 3 would generate gross margins of –7.48%. The irony is that Tesla’s bull case (a mainstream car) is finally here, quite possibly bringing about their downfall (via massively flawed business model). The way this happens is by reducing the gross margin by the 10% discount that regular automakers give to dealerships, that save them SG&A expenses, TSLA’s gross margins look nothing special. But when you realise that TSLA expenses R&D costs that should be in in COGS in a separate line, since it’s development on current vehicles, the gross margins are actually much worse than the other companies.\n\n* Cost of Revenue - TSLA\nAutomotive\nCost of automotive revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead (including amortized tooling costs), shipping and logistic costs, vehicle internet connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses.

At the moment, they're building M3s at roughly the pace of 2k/week, which will eventually be expanded to 5k/week sometime between the middle to the end of this year.  Assuming that they stay at 2k/week, that's 104k M3s a year, assuming 42k average price, that's 4.3B, on top of their 11B/year from S/X.  That said, if they stop growing, they'll end up with a 15B/year revenue and it's currently valued at 50B, which sounds about right.  \n\nIf they hit 5k/week, that's 22B in revenue per year, which makes the current stock price undervalued.\nIf they hit their fabled 10k/week, that's 32B in revenue per year, which makes the current stock price comically undervalued.  And that's not even their final goal for the M3.\n\nFor reference, Tesla and Netflix has about the same revenue for 2017 (11B-ish), and Netflix has a market cap of 133B to TSLA's 50B.  Yes, yes, profitability, I know, but that will come in time.  The profit margin for an M3 is about 20%, or 10k per car.  It's just a matter of time until Tesla turns cash flow positive, in my opinion.\n\nThis is ignoring all the potential revenue from things like Tesla Energy, Semi, roof, ride sharing service, etc etc.\n\nThe only risk involved is whether Tesla, or rather Elon Musk, can pull it off.  I'll grant you that Tesla has a history of being late.  That's because they always set relatively unrealistic expectations of themselves, but they always pull through in the end.

Tesla's capital expenditures are of course WAY more than a traditional automaker.

There are so many reasons why the short thesis is basic af, but I'll just leave it at this. Why do you think NOW is the time to short Tesla?

Tesla ran into some headwinds and integration was their solution.  ICE dealerships have a negative incentive to sell EV cars from a start-up.  Not only are then unfamiliar with the tech, but they are ill equipped to service them.  Thus Tesla needs to build out a dealer/service network either with completely inexperienced third party franchisees or take the path they are taking with company owned stores.  The path they took gives them more control, but clearly more initial overhead expense pushing profits downstream significantly.\n\nSame thing with the charging stations.  In order to make an EV usable in the US, they need charging infrastructure, but here we have a chicken/egg problem.  Not enough cars to support the stations/ no stations, no sales due to limited area of usage.  Again, Tesla chose capital to solve this problem.  In the long term it should be easy to recoup the install cost, but it will take several years for this to become a profit center due to very high initial cost.\n\nI'm sure you are right about it hurting profits in the short term.  In the long term, no one can know.  If they do manage to overcome the staggering debt and optimize production it will be a very interested situation.  They will own the entire value chain from energy production and distribution to vehicle manufacturing, sales and maintenance.  In fact if the vision is to be believed, they will also own the transportation as a service portion of the value chain via ongoing profit from the Tesla network of cars \"on duty\" that are owned by a third party.  \n\nWhether or not they achieve this enormous goal is going to be interesting, but my opinion is that analysis of Tesla's value relative to automakers is missing the point by a wide margin due to the other factors.  \n\nI point to the Chevy Bolt for comparison.  It is ugly, but that is not why I'm buying a Model 3.

Legacy companies don't put enough emphasis on the electronics of a car.\n2. They offer an end to end solution. So the idea is that they will be able to provide better service than a fragmented solution, and consumers will favor their product. Ex. Tesla is able to show you where all the chargers are on a map. If a new charger is built, they can communicate that on your map faster. If they need a new feature that tells consumers how many stalls are taken, they have all the information to provide that over a software update.\n3. The argument is that do you believe EVs are the future? If yes, then which company is best positioned to capitalize on that future?
