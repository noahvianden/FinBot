{"title": "Cheap, high-risk options plays for next week", "selftext": "Some of you liked my last thread on a cheap but potentially very rewarding options play with [Portola Pharmaceuticals](https://redd.it/88wm6p). Since most of you are casuals and probably on Robhinhood, I thought it would be fun to write up a thread on some plays I’ve been thinking about for the month of April. I’m also drinking alone at home, so why not. These plays are risky. If you lose, you **will** lose over half (or all) of your initial “investment”. If you win, you could make a lot more. \n\nAll prices I use will be the middle point between today’s closing bid-ask spread. Come Monday morning, these prices and values may be wildly different, but the theory behind my reasoning will be the same (assuming underlying share price stays around the same). I also may or may not already have positions open for some of these plays. I promise you I’m not trying to pump options prices or sell you overpriced calls. None of these plays will be on penny stocks or low volume companies, so I can’t move their share price. If I had that kind of clout, I wouldn’t be typing up stuff on this retarded subreddit. \n\nThese plays will also be simple. No spreads or exotic options plays. I might save that for another thread if this takes off. \n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Wells Fargo ($WFC)**\n-\n\nThe play that comes right after this one is objectively better in almost every way, but I’m putting this play first because it’ll give you some insight into my theories. \n\nWells Fargo and other banks (bar JPM) have been struggling really hard this year. Wells Fargo has been struggling the most. I consider this pick to be a badly cut diamond in a pile of other, slightly worse, badly cut diamonds. But here’s the thing with badly cut diamonds like WFC: they have really cheap premiums. Their premiums are low because investors expect these companies to do poorly (because of recent performance), have low volatility (because of their generally stable nature), and/or are simply overlooked. \n\nWFC has not been stable this year. It’s down over 20% from its highest point this year ($66/share), which is a lot for a largely stable company, let alone a large financial company like WFC. Despite its downward trend, WFC has not fallen below $52 very often. Even during today’s huge red day, and other red days alike, WFC had a hard time staying below $52. This makes me believe that it has reached its bottom and that investor sentiment cannot realistically drop lower until we have more material information. \n\nWFC’s earnings report is on April 13th. When I see companies like these, where share price has tanked but then refuses to tank any further on horribly red days, I see a potential buying opportunity. Call prices are usually low, implied volatility is low, and investor sentiment is rock bottom. That means that even average news can increase share price. Above average news can send it flying. This news is coming up very soon and is a gambling opportunity in my book. Note that this is a *gamble*. You will most likely lose 100%, so put in only what you’re comfortable losing. \n\n* **April 13th 52.50 Calls**\n\nThese calls are stupidly cheap for an earnings play on a recently volatile company. An increase of 2.3% in the underlying makes this call profitable. WFC *today* dropped almost 2%. [Edit: To elaborate on this point, a reversal of Friday’s drop would alone make this play profitable. And on top of that, these calls would still be priced for the earnings report coming up later that week.] Personally, I think investors have overlooked this company, and its options, far too much. I think that average news will increase WFC’s share price to $54/share, which is an around 3% increase from today’s closing price. Anything more is great, but I’m banking on average and hoping for more. I’m also hoping for an increase in share price next week before earnings. The play here is to buy April 13th 52.50 calls. \n\nIf share price goes up to $54, these calls will **profit 56%** (again, using prices derived from today’s closing bid-ask spread). If share price goes up to $55, these calls will **profit 160%**. If share price goes up to $65, near its highest price from this year, these calls will **profit 1200%** (unlikey to happen). \n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Financials ETF ($XLF)**\n-\n\nI was debating on whether to share this pick in this thread or not because I haven’t bought calls yet myself. But then I thought, who in the hell with enough money to pump up prices on an ETF this large would also listen to my advice? Anyway, this play is a variation of the play I shared above with WFC, but better (less upside, though with much greater chance for success). This ETF is impregnated by Warren Buffett, and other financial companies and banks.\n\nThe premium on these calls is ridiculously low. They’re low because 1. this is an ETF filled with very stable companies, so it’s doubly stable; and 2. sentiment among financials this year has been lackluster. But with earnings season kicking off on April 13th with banks, I expect this ETF to be extra volatile. It’s not priced for volatility because investors don’t think this earnings season will start off with a bang, but I think it will because I’m smarter than those fucks. \n\n* **September 21st 30.00 calls**\n\nThis play isn’t all-or-nothing. In fact, even if the play goes south, there will still be plenty of premium left in it for some semblance of recovery. But the point isn’t to baghold. What you should be doing is selling these calls come April 13th no matter what happens — unless you believe trade war fears will die down and the entire market will recover. This play *does* leave that avenue open to you. Still, don’t do it. Just get rid of it and move on. \n\nIf the underlying goes to $28/share (~3% increase), these calls will **profit ~50%**. If the underlying goes to $29/share (~6.7% increase), these calls will **profit ~140%**. If the underying goes to where it was before trade war fears came up ($30/share), these calls will **profit ~220%**. \n\nThe above values are rough estimates of what you could realistically see. They’re conservative estimates and on the lower end, so you don’t feel like I jipped you if share price goes up and calls aren’t as profitable as I advertised. \n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Amazon ($AMZN)**\n-\n\n* **April 13th 1500 calls**\n\nThe timing for this play has most likely already passed if Monday opens green. It’s also incredibly risky. It depends on a single green day early in the week, and if that green day doesn’t come, it’s over. I only put $2000 into these calls today at closing because the likelihood of this succeeding is basically nothing. \n\nWe all know Trump hates Amazon. Share price dropped from almost $1600 to $1400 with Trump’s tweets coupled with trade war fears. However, $50 swings in this company’s share price are not uncommon. In fact, this thing had a $100 swing just this week, in less than 2 full trading days, before today’s tariff announcement. \n\nAll I need is for share price to go back up to $1450 before Wednesday mid-day. If it does, these calls will **profit ~300%**. If share price goes up to $1475, these calls will **profit ~600%**. If there’s another $100 swing up to $1500, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. \n\nThe above estimates are, again, a bit on the low end. Timing also matters a lot here. A 300% profit one day may only be 100% the next (with the same change in underlying). \n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Micron Technology ($MU)**\n-\n\n* **April 20th 50.00 calls**\n\nDon’t buy this shit. \n", "id": "8afnsr", "created_utc": 1523073924.0, "score": 429, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "Shit i come here for.
