Hold long for a few months ? \n\nAs usual market analysts have differing views on the stock. Some are still bullish and continue to maintain their target price and advice to buy/hold, and some are screaming its over - sell, sell ! In the meanwhile Tesla and Elon Musk are strangely quiet. Does Elon have a rabbit up his sleeve or is he too in a quandary, is difficult to know.\n\nPlease provide me serious advice. Everyone makes mistakes in the stock market. I probably made a big one. I don't know.\n\nEdit: I will definitely take my own decision and am not that stupid to hold anyone responsible if I follow anyone's advice and it turns out to be wrong.\n\nEdit: I set a stop loss and sold all of my Tesla stock at a big loss this morning.

Any accident is unfortunate, but Tesla vehicles with Autopilot are in 40% fewer accidents than those without. The NTSB is doing their due diligence, as they should, and as they have with past Autopilot accidents. As usual, they will find that Autopilot functioned as described by Tesla. Automatic emergency braking is not designed for stationary objects, it is designed to quickly respond to moving objects that have stopped or appeared suddenly. This is all in the manual, and this is similar to other automakers. Just because the stock fell on this news does not make the news material to the fundamentals of TSLA.\n\nThe recall is because of a faulty part from Bosche, a massive supplier to the whole industry. Bosche is covering the costs. There have been no safety issues due to this recall yet. Recalls are a part of being an automaker. Can you list examples of other automakers that have not had recalls? It’s immaterial.\n\nI fail to see how your fence building plans are relevant, but your argument appears to be that Tesla has too much demand. As an investor, I’m ok with that problem. They are obviously ramping up production to fulfill that demand as fast as possible, and production is increasing each month.\n\nMoody’s downgraded the credit rating based on information we had in January. Anyone that is even sort of paying attention is aware of the state of production. Moody’s said that if production improves they will evaluate the rating again.

If we are in the first couple of months of a bad bear market, I can easily see TSLA under $100. If in April the Nasdaq has a recovery rally, TSLA will be over $300.  I don’t see any reasonable prospect of TSLA going above $400-$500 in the next few months, at least in this environment of elevated VIX.  Given that risk/reward it seems to favor selling.  \n\nOf course TSLA is a great company, visionary, etc. but this is about the stock which is a whole different thing. Over the last 20 years AMZN went from $1 to $1,000 and back to $1 and back to $1,000.  It happens. Same company the whole time.
