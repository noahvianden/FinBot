{"title": "How to play extremely high-risk FDs with 1000% upside. With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.", "selftext": "Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I've been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.\n\nSince you all love throwing your money away, I'll share how I play FDs. I cannot ~~understate~~ overstate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won't go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you're serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.\n\nI only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I'll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It's possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I'll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don't go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. \n\nIn my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn't a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you're only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don't mess with FDs if I'm only looking at a realistic upside of 500%. \n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**\n-\n\nI haven't bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I've bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. \n\nSo, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn't like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ's results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn't have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.\n\nThus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.\n\n-\n\n**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you'll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. \n\n1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. \n\n2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We're banking on some unexpected volatility. \n\n3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it's all over. \n\n4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. \n\n5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ's average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I'm predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that's more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it's a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ's yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday's close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.\n\n6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren't really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.\n\n-\n\nAnd now onto the actual play.\n\n* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**\n\nThese are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday's closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. \n\nIf this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say \"Wednesday noon\", I don't actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. \n\nThese estimates are going to be off because we're dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you're trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I'm not wrong often.\n\nBy the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you're down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.\n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n**Apple ($AAPL)**\n-\n\nI personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I'll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. \n\n* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**\n\nThese calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. \n\nReasoning in decreasing significance: \n\n1. Apple's earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. \n\n2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn't only because they're both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. \n\n3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. \n\n4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn't a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don't go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. \n\n5. With the tax cuts and Apple's big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they're good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.\n\n-\n\nAs always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there's a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn't go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat.

If earnings tomorrow morning are very good, it could also spark a Dow rally, which could carry Apple far enough up to let us dump and never look back.

This is because a full day's worth of time, or a half day's worth of time, could shave off a lot of value from the option.

I would've then made a decision whether to buy in again towards the end of the day. That's sort of how I try to minimize risk on FDs. \n\n$AAPL play is still on, but tech is pretty volatile right now before earnings.
