But if the President of the United States is talking about it, there is probably some merit there.

That's the whole fucking story right now.\n\n\"...if the President of the United States is talking about it, there is probably some merit there\" Just like he said trade wars are easy to win? Trump will completely parrot whatever he sees on Fox News. He's never had a firm grasp of any policy. For examples see tax law, healthcare repeal attempt, current trade stupidity, DACA. He's so undisciplined in what he tweets out that he's his own worst enemy. See Travel Ban.\n\n\"And yes, there are alternatives for authors besides Amazon, but I know from firsthand experience that those alternatives are drying up.

End of story, metaphorically and literally. Are they ruthless in achieving their market superiority? Absolutely. Anything else would be in violation of their duties to shareholders. You don't like it, fuck off to Russia or Venezuela where they aren't capitalists.\n\n\"It also discusses the “special pricing” we offer to Chinese shippers, which Trump has also talked about. It’s not “all” parcel pricing. It’s big retailers getting deep discounts that also put smaller retailers on the ropes\"\n\nJesus fucking christ, you can't be bothered to read the whole article you sourced. \n\n\"Sandbulte’s [the guy on whom this entire $1.46 nonsense is based] investment firm holds FedEx stock, meaning he has a direct interest in critiquing the USPS, and his analysis is debatable on several points. He disingenuously describes the pricing situation as “a gift card from Uncle Sam,” which implies there’s tax money involved. But the USPS doesn’t receive tax revenues.\n\nAdditionally, USPS’s legal duty to provide universal service means that even at a discount, shipping boxes for Amazon helps it generate revenue from potentially unused capacity. Fixed costs aside, USPS package delivery is profitable, helping subsidize rural service and letter delivery. So there’s room for disagreement about whether the situation is actually unjust.\"\n\nAmazon issued the following statement in response to Sandbulte’s claims: “As is the case with all of its customers, our partnership with USPS is reviewed annually by the Postal Regulatory Commission, which has spent decades reviewing and approving USPS costing and pricing practices. The Postal Regulatory Commission has consistently found that Amazon’s contracts with the USPS are profitable. Amazon has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in a network of more than 20 package sortation facilities that inject directly into the USPS last mile network bypassing most of USPS network. This investment resulted in more efficient processes as well as thousands of jobs and related economic benefits in local communities.”\n\nEither way, Amazon is hardly alone in getting a boost from the USPS’s complex pricing. Thanks to international agreements through the United Nations, international shippers—especially those sending small packages from China—often get services at substantially below cost. That puts U.S. stores and domestic online sellers alike at a persistent disadvantage.\"\n\nSo what to take from this? Why the fuck is Trump targeting Amazon, a company incorporated in AMERICA, with AMERICAN shareholders? Especially when if anyone is taking advantage of USPS low pricing it might just be small business outside of the US?
