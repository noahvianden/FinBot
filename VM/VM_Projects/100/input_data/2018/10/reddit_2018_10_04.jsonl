It has only become more and more an element in markets as they became deregulated post-Glass-Steagall / while those deregulations can bring higher highs about they also bring volatility and destabilization. \n\nYou can build an unstable structure but the larger it gets the more likely gravity will bring it down - much of this recent economic growth was brought about through the neutering of regulations and a short-term tax cut that companies used largely to buy back into their own stocks - we are riding a market high (like a sugar high) the crash will always follow because the rise of the market did not come about naturally and circumstances changed. A credit-fueled and deregulated market is what turned the \"Roaring Twenties\" into the Great Depression. The party will never end, until it does.\n\nSome may consider this FUD but throughout history market metrics are largely predictable even if it is not a precise science - deregulation and tax cuts lead to sugar highs followed by market crashes - in recent history we have the Reagan economy, Clinton's dotcom bubble, and the Great Recession which is far more sharp volatility in a thirty year span than we saw in nearly 50 years following the implementation of the banking act of 1933 and Glass-Steagall in 1932. An asterisk can be put on the Reagan crash because it occurred before Clinton's deregulation but it directly coincided with the most massive cut to the marginal tax rate (applied only to money earned at excessively high levels of income - varying by inflation and income averages in respective years) that the nation had ever seen in its history - down from nearly 70% to 28% which was absurd for the public sector but did stimulate more volume and risky investment.
