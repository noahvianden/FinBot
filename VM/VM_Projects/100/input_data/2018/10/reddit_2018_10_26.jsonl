{"title": "Not actively investing, portfolio getting crushed.", "selftext": "Hi Guys,\n\nIts a shame to say that I am down \\~16% all time (starting from August, 2017), especially in the bull market that has been going for quite some time. It wasn't always like this--for a majority of the time that I've been investing I've had pretty solid returns. I made some investments that I now regret (specifically MU @52), and being in college now, I have been almost too busy to keep up with my portfolio. I am now at a point where I've suffered through some pretty tough losses and I am not sure what steps to take going forward. I don't know whether to sell for a loss, or hold longer term and break even (hopefully).\n\n**My current portfolio consists of the following:**\n\n* MU-32.41% of portfolio (down 32%)\n* MSFT-33.26% of portfolio (up 6%)\n* FB-13.83% of portfolio (down 18%)\n* AAPL-13.63% of portfolio (up 16%)\n* SGMO-6.87% of portfolio (down 26%)\n\nAs you can see, I've made some questionable decisions. My rationale for my losers was I believed MU was undervalued in its industry (before the China tariffs and other bad news) based on various factors, I thought that FB would bounce after the unpleasant earnings report in August, and I have followed SGMO for quite awhile and have confidence in what they do although they haven't had great news recently. I have been stubborn with not selling for a loss but I can't sit and hopelessly watch some of my holdings continue to fall. Hindsight is 20/20, had I known to buy more AAPL or MSFT I would've but I can't change that. I want to transition into some ETFs (SPY, QQQ, VTI, etc.) in order to limit my exposure to volatility and risk. As I mentioned, I am wondering whether to sell out of some of my positions or keep holding. I will  then change into less risky holdings. Thank you!\n\n**tl;dr:** Made bad investment decisions with some stocks; have not been tracking my holdings as frequently as I should have lately. Need to know whether I should hold or sell for a hefty loss. Current holdings listed above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "9rjkuh", "created_utc": 1540550023.0, "score": 159, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "You have 0 diversity. 4 tech stocks and 1 biotech.

Tesla‚Äôs philosophy has always been to set truthful targets ‚Äì not sandbagged targets that we would definitely exceed and not unrealistic targets that we could never meet. While Tesla gets criticized when it is delayed in reaching a goal, it should not be forgotten that Tesla has achieved many goals that were doubted by most. We are enormously proud of the efforts of the whole company in making it through this difficult ramp and getting us to volume production.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/26/tesla-faces-criminal-probe-over-allegedly-misstating-production-numbers-and-misleading-investors-wsj.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/26/tesla-faces-criminal-probe-over-allegedly-misstating-production-numbers-and-misleading-investors-wsj.html)\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "That was a good response by Tesla.

R&D spend goes through cycles based on the project phase. When the shift is on fundamental research, the funds spent by R&D are low. When it's only development, the funds spent on R&D are high. Note that this is only a generalization, but clearly shows how spend is not an indicator for restrictions tightening on R&D. \nLower CapEx is due to improved efficiency and execution across the board.
