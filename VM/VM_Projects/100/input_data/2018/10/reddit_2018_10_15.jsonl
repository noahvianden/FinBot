It will continue to grow at a steady rate. I rather not turn this thread into a tech talk, but the easiest I can explain is: \n\nAzure is better than Oracle, IBM, and Google (in most use-cases, not necessarily technologically. I am not going tit for tat on the specs, just use-cases and what I hear from all of my customers). There are reasons IBM is really good, and why Google is pretty good, but we are talking market-wide adoption potential.\n\nFrom what I have seen I would rate the clouds:\n\n1)Azure\n\n2)AWS\n\n3)IBM\n\n4)Google\n\n\n1 and 2 are very very close. The main difference is the breadth of offerings, and time in the market, but Azure can catch up easily as many of the offerings are not extremely hard to match nor propriety.\n\nAlso, something to keep in mind, even if you disagree with the technical evaluation. AWS is not a re-sellers cloud. They offer little to no incentive to sell their platform, so other companies make almost no money pushing it (other than offering services on top of it). Azure and all the other clouds heavily incentivize their partners to sell their cloud with decent margins and assets to help them sell. \n\nAnyway, thats why I think IBM and Azure are ok in the space, AWS is going to stagnate. AWS is a club in the IT departments and not something I ever really hear about in the management offices unless IT throws their weight around a lot.\n\nEdit: added the word 'stock' to clarify something.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I work with startups, and literally every company I've worked with either uses AWS or Google. >90% use AWS.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, as I said, small companies are big with the two of them.

That being said they and IBM cloud are the only ones that allow you to purchase dedicated rack space.\n\nAs I mentioned, AWS has cool features... but none of them are propriety in nature and are done by other services like VMware VSphere. Once the other cloud close the gaps on some of the features AWS doesnt have anything but IT fan clubs pushing their stuff. \n\nMost large companies that I work want dedicated co-location. That is only available on Azure, IBM, and Google.
