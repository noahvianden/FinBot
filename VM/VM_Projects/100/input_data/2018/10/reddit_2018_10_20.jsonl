This is a complex issue and you have to pay attention, not just regurgitate bullshit talking points about how \"more competition\" and \"less choice\" as if they are actual policy options. They aren't. Now, read on, please.\n\nThe ACA already allows interstate insurance sales.\n\nA provision in section 1333 of the Affordable Care Act allows states to establish what are called “health care choice compacts,” which permit insurers to sell policies to individuals and small businesses in any state that participates in the compact – provided they abide by specific rules. And several states have explored the possibility. In fact, a few have even enacted statutes pertaining to interstate compacts.\n\nBut as of yet, nothing has materialized. \n\nIf insurers were required to be licensed in any of the states in which they market plans, they could choose to “domicile” their firm in a state that has little regulation of the nongroup (i.e., individual and small business) insurance market. If, as one could easily see happening, the majority of insurers choose to domicile in the state or states with the least restrictive regulations, consumers would likely lose out, and in a large way.\n\nWithout benefit standards, interstate sales offer plans another way to risk select. An insurer could market policies that provide only minimal benefits, at low premiums, to attract the healthiest of individuals who only need this type of coverage. That same insurer could possibly deny coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions, or discourage them from applying by making coverage so expensive it would be out of reach for most. That insurer could also raise the price of its more comprehensive plans—even for healthy individuals who want to buy them for peace of mind—again making it difficult for the average household to afford.\n\nIf the healthiest individuals in State A decide to purchase insurance in State B because the premiums are lower, the risk pool in State A then comprises a sicker population that requires more medical care, with fewer healthy people paying into the pool to offset the cost of providing care to those sicker individuals. As time goes on, the situation spirals downward. Those who need insurance the most will find it obscenely expensive, and eventually State A can no longer afford to provide care for its residents who need it.\n\nOther states might also find it necessary to eliminate some of their consumer protections just to remain competitive with State B. In the end, the quality of coverage is eroded, premiums for all but the healthiest of individuals increase, and many consumers could find they have far fewer plan options to choose from.\n\nWhat you're advocating for is insurance plans from out of state with no insurance compacts which will not work.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "I like how you got 3 upvotes, and my response which is highly reasoned and cites the ACA itself, has zero.
