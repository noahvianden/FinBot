Am dumb. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Options are valued based on a number of factors.\n\nSo options are a derivative. That means their price is *derived* from some underlying asset (often called the \"underlying\"). In your case, the underlying is a stock.\n\nAn option contract gives you the option to buy (call contract) or sell (put contract) 100 shares of the underlying at a given strike price. If the value of the underlying is above the strike of a call, or below the strike of a put, you can exercise the contract. That means you either buy 100 shares at the strike price, or sell 100 shares at the strike price.\n\nLet's do a practical example.\n\nYou buy a MSFT call option contract with a strike price of $200 that expires in 6 months. Let's say the value of MSFT stock goes up to $250. Because your contract is in the money, you can exercise and buy 100 shares of MSFT at $200, which nets you $50 of profit per share, which is $5,000 all together. That said, you still need to pay $20,000 in order to buy those shares. The price you paid for the contract is just a premium. It's the price you pay to the seller to convince them to take the risk, it's not actually enough money to buy the shares if you end up exercising.\n\nA lot of people don't have enough money to buy a few hundred (or thousand) shares of blue chip stocks. That's why a lot of people buy a contract, hold it as it goes up in value, then sell it to someone else for a profit.\n\nWhat makes a contract go up in value? That depends on a few factors, which are called the Greeks. These are delta, gamma, rho, theta, and vega.\n\nDelta is what happens to the value of a contract if the price of the underlying goes up by 1 dollar. So if the delta on your contract is 0.5, and MSFT goes up by $1, your contract will increase in value by 50¢ per share, which is $50 total. Fun fact: delta can be used as a rough estimate of how likely a contract is to expire in the money.\n\nGamma is the first derivative of the delta. That's a fancy way of saying that it tells you how much the delta will increase if MSFT stock goes up by $1. The closer you get to being in the money, the faster delta increases.\n\nRho describes the effect of interest rates on your contracts. This doesn't change often, so I won't get into it.\n\nTheta describes how much value the contract will lose as time passes. Option contracts decrease in value as they get closer to expiration, which makes sense. If I bet you $10 that you can't lose 10 pounds in the next 5 minutes, that'd be a bad bet to accept. But If I bet you can't lose 10 pounds in the next year, you could probably win that bet. The value decreases because you have less time to get the stock to go in the money.\n\nVega describes the way the price responds to a change in implied volatility. Volatility is a measure of how much the underlying's price is moving. Options get more expensive when stock prices are choppy because the sellers are taking more risk. This makes it dangerous to buy options when volatility is high, because your contract will rapidly decrease in value when volatility goes back down to normal.\n\nSo you've got a few things to keep in mind. Is the price of the underlying moving in the wrong direction? Are you buying when volatility is unusually high? Are you planning to hold the contract for a long time? These are all things that can hurt you.\n\nYou can sell the contract so long as it hasn't expired. The sooner you do it, the less penalty you're going to take from theta decay. Keep in mind that it's really hard to unload a contract in the last few days before expiration. Not many people want to buy a far out of the money contract with 2 hours left before expiration.\n\nIf it expires out of the money then you lose the premium you paid for the contract, and that's it. The contract expires, and that's the end of that. You don't have to buy any shares.\n\nIf the contract expires in the money then your broker may force you to buy the shares. Most brokerages have an auto-exercise rule for contracts that are more than a few cents in the money at expiration.\n\nThis isn't as bad as it sounds. So long as you sell the shares right away, you should make a profit. They should give you some margin to make the purchase if you don't have enough money in your account. That said, you're going to pay them interest on that margin, and you're screwed if the market gaps down before you get to sell the shares. That could get you a margin call.\n\nThat's why most people prefer to sell contracts before expiration. It's much less risky.", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Buy crazy OTM puts on the large highly liquid emerging market index ETFs dated as far out as possible.
