Currently there are a lot of laws that limit the number of hours that truck drivers can drive in any given day / week. When these laws went into place the national capacity to move freight basically got cut in half, driving prices way up. You used to be able to move a load 1000 miles overnight if you had a good driver, now its limited to 400-500 miles in a day.\n\nWhere does TSLA come in? If you can get a truck to (legally) drive its self for part of the journey (highway) you can enter a whole new generation of national logistics infrastructure. Imagine if every major city had a huge truck port outside of the city near a major highway. All trucks delivering to that city would drive all the way from pickup to this truckport through the night without stopping because a driver ran out of hours. Once the truck got to this \"harbor\" a human would hop in a drop it off at the last leg, then get back to the \"harbor\" and do it again. \n\nOne problem.... Trucks need fuel. Even without a person you still can go as far as the tank. TSLA already has a supercharger network in place that would get the job done for most of the biggest shipping lanes in the country, and I imagine adding self driving tech to plug into a charger would not be that hard to implement.\n\nCurrently TSLA is closer than anyone to this tech (that I know of - you could argue waymo/GOOG is closer), aside from Uber which bought the company otto (self driving truck addon tech for semi trucks) but shut their self driving division down because they killed someone.
