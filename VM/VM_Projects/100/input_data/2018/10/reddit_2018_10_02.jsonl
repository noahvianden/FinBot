You can just believe it's way overvalued\n* The stock going up doesn't prove that shorts are irrational, any more than a stock going down doesn't prove that investors are irrational.

My understanding of the short thesis is that there are a few catalysts that might drive the stock significantly lower:\n\n* Tesla has [a $920 million 0.25% convertible issue](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stocks-surge-puts-convertible-bonds-in-the-money-1533667505) due Feb. 27, 2019, which would be convertible into common at a price of $359.8676 per share. If $TSLA is trading below that, they'll have to pay back that nearly-billion-dollars in cash. That'll be a huge hit to their sheet.\n* Similarly, $1.4B in convertible bonds are due in early 2021 with similar terms.\n* Musk has promised both [profitability and positive cash-flow](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/13/elon-musk-tweets-late-at-night-tesla-will-be-profitable-and-cash-flow-positive.html) in both quarters of 2H 2018. A failure to hit those metrics will put further pressure on Musk via the board to be more restrained in his forward-looking statements. A TSLA without bombastic growth promises is not a $50B TSLA, as no DCF or industry comp analysis prices it there without some *aggressive* growth assumptions\n* A debt raise will be difficult and expensive for TSLA, as bonds are rated as B-.\n* An equity raise will almost certainly force those convertible notes to be paid as cash, rather than equity, due to dilution.\n* In 2019, competition will be entering the market with Jaguar and Mercedes entering at the high end. These challenge Tesla's more profitable models, putting downward pressure on both volume and margin.\n* All of this tight cash in 2019 means they will not have the funding to open up new plants. That means the Semi is vaporware, and there isn't significant upside on the production side of things for existing models. By 2020, the Model S & X will start to show that they're a bit long in the tooth, and so the plant will need to be re-tooled to update the body styles.

However, the South Koreans found a loophole that they used to rapidly industrialize during the 80s.\n\nI'll just use the experience of Dow Chemical in South Korea - but this was repeated in almost every industry during the time.\n\nThe South Korean government invited Dow Chemical to form a joint venture with several domestic Korean firms, with Dow providing most of the initial capital.  Once that capital had been invested and the JV's facilities built, the South Korean government did everything that it could to make the business environment in the country hostile to the JV, and installed a majority of directors onto its board who were instructed to run it into the ground.\n\nThe JV ultimately went bankrupt in 1983, and Korean bankruptcy courts sold the company off to its original Korean investors for a tiny fraction of its actual value.  At the end of the day, Dow spent hundreds of millions of 1970's dollars to build several massive chemical plants which the South Korean government decided to donate to the South Korean Chaebols on behalf of Dow.\n\nThis loophole has since been closed, but we're now seeing that the Chinese have found a new loophole, here is how it works:\n\nThe Chinese meme company launches a US IPO, attracting billions in predominantly US investment.  This investment is used to construct the majority of the company's facilities, but is not sufficient to fund the company until it becomes profitable.  To bridge the gap to profitability, the Chinese meme company obtains a high interest rate loan from a Chinese state backed bank.\n\nThere is absolutely no hope of the company ever paying back this loan - the terms of the loan were specifically designed so for that.  Rather, after a few years the company defaults on the loan, causing the Chinese government to take control of it.  The Chinese government then sells it back to the original Chinese owners for a fraction of its value.  The original Chinese owners now have a new, expensive factory and, because you paid for it, a very low debt load.\n\nIn 10-20 years there will probably be some mechanism by which this scheme is policed, but for now its completely legal.\n\nSo whenever you see a Chinese company that's experiencing explosive growth and looks like it has the potential for unlimited gains just remember - you're exactly right, it does.
