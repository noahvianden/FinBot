On average, Bezos will save $1500 on low tier labor costs. Sure the short-run analysis is Bezos is a cuck, the long-run analysis is Bezos played Bernie like a fiddle. \n\nHe literally got Bernie to cheer for the homogenization of worker pay, the cutting of additional benefits that rewarded consistent hard work. That is what Bezos has wanted to do but couldn't until Bernie created the political capital for Bezos to use. Now low skill workers are no longer given any kind of stock, they no longer partake in the privilege of their own company's growth, 30-40 years from now when Amazon owns an even larger percentage of the world retail market, and when their stock price is sky high, when all these workers are looking to vest, and cash in for retirement. They can't. \n\nAlso, RSU contracts typically are temporally vested, meaning that they only get the benefits of that stock after a certain time frame. So let's say you're a worker with 10 years of experience in the warehouse, you were making let's say $14/hr(and this is a pretty low ball estimate for 10 years experience), you had lots of unvested RSU. You are now bumped up to $15, but you now have a pay ceiling of $15.55(at least that's the word on the street, I don't know how true it is, but I don't think it sounds too farfetched). Basically, you've been told you are not getting any more RSU, whatever RSU you own won't vest for quite a while, and your raise is fucked. Even with that much experience, in the current labor market, there isn't a guarantee that you would get paid more than $15, and even if you could negotiate upwards, you certainly aren't going to get RSU from the next retail company. So now what has happened. Bezos has put experienced workers in a catch 22. The experience warehouse worker can't leave because of the RSU, no way they'll get more value from another company. Bezos is a genius, he got a license to fuck his experienced workers and they may not even fully realize how badly he fucked future AMZN workers. \n\nTo be serious for a sec:\nI'm bullish on amzn long run, but I'm a bit concerned by this move as it disincentivizes experienced workers. In my experience on the ground, the experienced workers ground a company like management, if they aren't on the floor correcting the newbie fuck ups, that creates a fair amount of deadweight loss. So I'll be very carefully watching production numbers and quotas from various large suppliers of amazon. Lastly, I'd be carefully watching labor market sentiment regarding low tier amazon workers. Without that incentive, I do think amazons efficiency with labor capital will go down a bit long run. That said, this will likely be offset by increases in economic capital investment(aka automation). Of course as I said, pay attention to supply metrics, and in particular, amzn production numbers and quotas. If you see them consistently not meeting targets, it would be worrisome and I would think back to this move against their executive floor employees(and I use executive loosely lol).\n\nMore importantly, Bernie gave bezos political cover for the move. Even if the information is released eventually, we all know that reddit will care, it may even be in the papers, but Bezos can respond with a Bernie-esque response of how he is homogenizing incomes so hard workers aren't rewarded as much. This also gives political capital to the republicans who can go to their hard working warehouse workers and say \"hey, look at this jagoff Bezos, him and Sanders colluded to take your benefits!\", and the sad part is, that wouldn't be entirely untruthful. \n\n", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "yo that bezos guy be smart", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Guy?
