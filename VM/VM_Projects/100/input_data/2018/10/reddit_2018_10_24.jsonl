Its entire stock price is based on people's expectations of how much money Tesla is going to be bringing in once the Model 3 production is completely ramped up. Except the production has been bottlenecking for a while. There are many issues here, among them Musk's overreliance on automation, unrealistic timetables, etc. The biggest issue, however, is how much cash Tesla burns on a daily basis. This Bloomberg article estimates that Tesla spends $6500 a minute That's 3.28 billion over the last 12 months. All with no actual results.\n\nWhich would be fine, if Tesla made money. But they don't. They haven't posted a positive quarter in years, if you account for depreciating and amortizing cashflows.\n\nMusk also made absurd promises (which he reaffirmed many times) about how many Model 3s would be produced weekly by April 2018. The current production number is well below his estimations. WELL below. Add on top of that, the only factory that produces Models 3 (in California) will shut down for 10 days this month, for reasons related to Tesla's overreliance on automation.\n\nSome of the customers of the Model have been waiting over a year for a car they have already paid for. (EDIT: poster pointed out this was only a down payment of a $1000 dollars.)\n\nCue several days ago when Tesla posted their worst quarter yet. Musk was giving a conference call, when one of the analysts asked whether some preorders were being configured by customers (meaning, will those customers be spending extra money on extra features?) The analyst actually had an overall positive outlook on the stock at the time (he has since downgraded his outlook from 300-something to $285), and in my opinion, was trying to justify an expensive valuation by searching for cash flows that analysts may have missed in their value models. Musk cut him off for no reason, called his question boring and then took a question from a youtube star and spent twenty minutes answering that instead.\n\nMusk is obviously an ideas man, with little to no knowledge of how to actually run a public company. Compounding this is the electric car market is about to be flooded by other companies looking to actually make the revenue Tesla has only promised.\n\nEDIT: Since some people are interested in Tesla's financials, here's the last ten years of income statements from Tesla: https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSLA/income-statement/annual?reportPage=1\n\nSome notable features. Tesla's gross margin has been declining for some time, i.e. production costs are going up, not down. This is not how healthy companies operate. An argument can be made new companies are supposed to burn money ramping up production, but Tesla is a decade old at this point.\n\nAlso note their operating margin is non existent. You can only spend so much money while not making any before something has to change. At what point will they actually start making money?\n\nHere's the last ten years of balance sheets from Tesla: https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSLA/balance-sheet/annual\n\nLook at the deferred revenues under liabilities. Those are all pre-orders. Look at the sky rocketing debt.\n\nHere's the last ten years of cash flows from Tesla: https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSLA/cash-flow/annual\n\nLook at the rate of new debt issued. Look at the increasing debt payments. Look at the increasing use of Depreciation Amortization to offset net income. At some point, this has to reach critical mass. Either the Model becomes the most successful vehicle in the history of vehicles (in which case, it is still not a foregone conclusion Tesla will be able to survive) or Tesla goes under.\n", "score": -36, "replies": [{"body": "You replied to the wrong comment, you mong.", "score": 84, "replies": [{"body": "i blame the new reddit redesign", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Was hoping this was a copypasta", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Me too...then I scrolled and saw the edit note", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I thought it was gonna turn into a copypasta", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "But did he really deserve to get shit on that badly?

Basically, you determine what expected rate of return you desire and plug that into a model and it spits out how much of your portfolio to devote to each asset. This also involves minimizing risk, which is what the Markowitz bullet illustrates graphically. Every rate of return should have different ways of weighting the portfolio that result in the same return, but different variances. (Edit: when i say this, keep mind we are talking about expectations and the law of large numbers. The same return *on average*). You want the one with the minimum variance.\n\nEach asset contributes a certain amount to the overall variance. This is measure by the so called beta. It tells how that asset is correlated with the overall market.\n\nAlright. How do portfolios usually breakdown? Well, if you desire a certain rate of return, you want to allocate a certain portion of it to riskless assets. US bonds are theoretically riskless and have a beta of zero (this isn't actually true, a lot of portfolio theory is over simplified garbage). This is money you don't have to worry about. The rest is diversified across more risky assets.\n\nWell, if the risk free asset has a higher rate of return you are free to devote a larger percentage of your portfolio to that asset to achieve the same rate of return with less variance, i.e. risk. \n\nBasically, investors chase yields. The bond market has not had a substantial yield in quite some time. This forced money into the stock markey to generate a desired rate of return. This is now changing. Interest is rising. More money will flow into the bond market.\n\nWhich is why I think the bond market and stock markey are going to become uncorrelated. The bull market in bonds forced investors into stock, which I think is what has been the main driver of the stock bull market the last decade. \n\nI don't think the stock market is going to crash, without a substantial catalyst.

If everyone expects the market to keep going up, it doesn't really matter what the interest rate is or what the market PE ratio is or how much debt we have or how large the Fed balance sheet is. Those things only matter insofar as people use them to inform their exoectations, because markets are literally just expectations expressed as prices.

Then you have rising tensions with Saudi Arabia, which has caused a fear of $100+bbl crude, and it’s already up a lot this year around $70/bbl which has put pressure on input costs. Coupled with wage  pressures, this led to an increase in volatility - which has been historically incredibly low. And you have algorithms that offset selling when volatility rises to a certain point. CTA funds sell when vol is high, which has been known to increase volatility more and thus keep the selling happening.
