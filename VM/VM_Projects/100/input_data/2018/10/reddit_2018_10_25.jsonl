Most of AWS's big customers are tech startups which are only minimally or not even profitable at all.  They have very high costs of capital.  Using AWS is a way of accessing capital assets (ie: servers) to run their businesses at a lower implied cost of capital than they could finance their own acquisition of server hardware in the marketplace.  There are a lot of characteristics that are in common between AWS customers and subprime borrowers.  Poor income relative to the value of the assets they wish to control.  A high cost of capital.  And generally less stability in their overall business models or lives.  The very definition of subprime from a credit perspective.\n\nSo if the tech startups run into trouble, eventually AWS will feel it in a big way.  AWS is effectively their financier, and currently does a very good business at such due to the strength in the startup sector.\n\n>My personal use server costs $5 a month. \n\nYour particular \\*personal\\* case is rare, and isn't too meaningful in the overall discussion of AWS's customer base.  \n\n>It's not like they just lend you a server rack and you pay a mortgage on it. \n\nThat's basically what they do in the financial sense of things.  And remember, a loan is only as good as the ability of the borrower to pay on it.  Yes, the actual server rack sits on AWS property, so if you stop paying the loan, they can seize and sell the capacity to someone else.  But if a significant number of tech startups simultaneously fail, AWS could conceivably have a large amount of capacity sitting idle and certainly not earning those great returns that they're accustomed to.  \n\n>It's more like you pay a guy at the beach to rent the jetski.\n\nI don't see a lot of difference.  The jetski rental guy is vulnerable to the economic cycle as well.  And if his rents get out of control, then others set up jetski rentals right a few steps away.  Hence reducing the upside, and potentially amplifying the downside.  I guess my point is, AWS is very intertwined with the economic fortunes of its customers, and from what I can see, its customer base is dominated by a lot of unprofitable or only minimally profitable tech startups who use AWS as a way of accessing infrastructure for a lower implied cost of capital than they could achieve with their own access to capital markets.

The more complicated explanation is that Tesla isn’t doing reservations anymore, and are only tracking new orders. I would expect, from ancedotal social media evidence, that a lot of people are ordering the medium range version, and the reason why they raised the price $1,000 is because otherwise they’re not going to be able to make all of them before the low range version becomes available for order. The other thing that I would expect, is that in the markets where Tesla has a heavy presence (like socal) they are receiving a ton of new orders, but in places like Europe and China they are not receiving as many since people aren’t able to test drive them or have sat in their friend’s model 3. I think the biggest driver for new orders is, and will continue to be, current owners/tesla evangelists/cult members showing off their Model 3s to friends. If Tesla told us the most recent new orders numbers right now it would probably look great in California and terrible everywhere else. I think it’s a case of: “New orders are coming in where Model 3s are, and slowed down where they aren’t being delivered yet.” In 6 months this will probably be very different and then they will be bragging about new demand.

{"title": "What you need to know before tomorrow, and other things to avoid ass blasting. DD inside.", "selftext": "To preface this entire post, the question is whether the following is priced in™️.  \n&nbsp;  \nNow let's begin.  \n&nbsp;  \nThe entire market is likely to get fucked right at open on Friday. And I mean BIGLY.  \n&nbsp;  \nIf you didn't know Friday at open is when US GDP data comes out, and nothing will fuck you dry like a bad report. But Widsoms_Son, there is supposed to be Q3 GDP growth of 3.9% with a large basis point increase for Q3 YoY GDP growth, what gives? Oh don't worry baby birds, I'll feed you.  \n&nbsp;  \nPART 1) Over Estimation Of Personal Consumption Expenditure  \nAccording to the Atlanta Feds documents, they were expecting a PCE growth of 3.7% for the entirety Q3 at the end of September. This is likely too high since we already have the data for PCE in the first and second month of Q3 which would lead us to a Q3 PCE of 3.1%(They made note of this and said it was a high estimate). In order to make it to that 3.7% we would need to see real consumption increasing .3% in September. Their numbers were revised to a more sensible estimated 3.2% growth for Q3. This might even be high still since we just received the housing data(which you might remember as the great 93rd recession of 2018). New home purchases are down bigly due to inflated prices and rising rates.    \n&nbsp;  \nHow does this correlate? If people aren't buying homes because they are stupidly expensive that means they are forced to save. If they are trying to save for stupidly expensive homes that means they aren't spending as much money which makes the increase needed to reach estimates questionable. Could they be spending on other things that would allow this number to be reached? Sure I guess they could, but the saving money narrative is helped in my opinion by the CPI information released for September. Over the last 12 months essentially everything has gotten more expensive(as it should). Shelter is up 3.3%, Energy commodities are up 9.6%, and food away from home is up 2.4%. Rising prices of essentially everything over the last 12 months coupled with people trying to save for expensive homes would make the argument of people spending less more credible not less. Also when you get to part 3 this may be even more pertinent.  \n&nbsp;  \nPart 2) GDP Growth Is Propped Up By Inventories  \nAt the beginning of Q3 and all the way until the start of October, PCE was considered to be the driving factor in GDP growth. As it should be since consumer spending roughly accounts for 70% of the economy. At the start of October that paradigm started to shift. As of October 17th PCE is only estimated to account for 2.22% of GDP growth while... drum roll please... CIPI(change in private inventories) is estimated to account for a whopping 2.20%. Compared to early estimates of Q3 in September which had PCE and CIPI at 2.54 and 1.87 respectively.  \n&nbsp;  \nWhat does this mean? It means there is a massive amount of inventory stockpiles causing a sense of \"growth\" in GDP. To give it a little more weight, 56%(!) of Q3 GDP growth is being driven by large inventories, not necessarily a trend of growing GDP. The issue with this is that over time CIPI will always average out to zero(you are supposed to sell what is in your inventory after all). So when Q4 comes around we will see a decrease in GDP growth as inventories lower, and possibly a quite drastic one in Q1 2019. More importantly to think about is the fact that if inventories weren't playing such a big role we would be seeing a deceleration in GDP in Q3 not a ninth YoY acceleration. Don't forget that CIPI can be negative overall, and in fact just to mess around think about a CIPI that is zero or possibly negative since it is likely to happen due to the oscillatory effect. With the current numbers and a 0 CIPI we would only have a Q3 GDP of 1.63%. Not exactly a tale of wonderful growth. If consumer spending continued to lower due to above reasons, and we had a CIPI of less than 0 we could very well have a negative GDP growth rate in the coming quarters.  \n&nbsp;  \nPart 3) Purchasing Managers Index and Gross National Income  \nFirst off let's start with GNI. GNI and GDP are supposed to essentially be the same. If you plot their values over time you see that there is a correlation coefficient of .92, and their graphs line up almost exactly despite minor differences. The peak of of GNI growth rate was actually four quarters ago at 2.66%. It is now at 2.07%. Over time GNI and GDP will converge and track closely to one another. Which means for four quarters they haven't been tracking together. The coming quarters could very well be the start of that convergence and is something to think about.  \n&nbsp;  \nPurchasing Managers Index(PMI) is actually used as a leading indicator for getting an idea on how GDP will be. The ISM(one of the top dogs that does this) PMI for September was already released. If you look at the summary for the PMI for September it will literally tell you that the overall economy and the manufacturing sector are growing, but growth is slowing. The biggest thing is that New Orders are down 3.3 percentage points overall, but still in the growth area. Decreasing new orders with rising inventories doesn't sound like a recipe for success to me. The other top dog that runs these PMI surveys is Markit and they actually assign weightings to the categories to get a better picture. Makes sense because New Orders are way more important than something like whether employment is up, down, or the same. If you look at this link which shows yesterdays released PMI from Markit https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/2b33e7aa54804c71a1677063ee811f10 you will see an image of how well the survey tracks overall GDP. If GDP QoQ percent change tracked that accordingly, GDP growth would be much closer to 2% than 3.  \n&nbsp;  \nSo there you go there's the DD. Try not to get ass raped on friday. Given everything laid out here I would at the very least  bag hold all your money for a while. Like I said the question is whether or not this shit was priced in after housing data came out and the huge sell off happened. Or try to buy puts near close today if there is a bounce in spy(or puts on whatever you are holding to hedge). If the report comes out on friday and investor sentiment turns to a narrative of slowing growth we're all fucked. Good luck and god speed lads.  \n&nbsp;  \nedit: I don't know if this is wsb in action, but I just checked option volume today on spy and it's already at nearly 3 million options traded with 63% of those being put options. More alarmingly HGY which is a junk bond etf has over 500k options traded today with 90% of those being puts. Junk bond prices aren't really impacted by rate changes as much as regular bonds, but they are greatly impacted by overall economic health. Food for thought, might pick some HGY puts up.

After about 30 seconds of due diligence I decided that I thought NVDA was going to turn around and come out positive for the day so I bought 200 shares. It almost immediately started going up and I was so happy with my play. Then it reversed and went back down, so that I was down a couple hundred bucks. I had to get back to work and leave my office so I decided I didn’t want to be worrying about how much it might go down today so I decided to sell out after only being down a couple hundred dollars. \n\nLater in the day I decided to check the price and saw it ended up going way back up, but that I also still had some shares. I was very confused because I thought I had sold them all and I checked and I still had 180 shares. Turns out that in my haste I only sold 20 shares earlier instead of 200 and I ended up making about a thousand dollars today. \n\nThis made me realize that I’m an idiot and I should never ever day trade.
