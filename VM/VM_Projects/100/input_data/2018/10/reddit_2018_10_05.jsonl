It happened because of one miscalculation that the German car companies I think are making today.\n\nOnce upon a time, through the mid-2000s, Nokia had a **very** close working relationship with Texas Instruments (TI).   Working with TI, Nokia could offer a comprehensive hardware phone solution plus software optimized for that stack.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/2005/07/14/texas-instruments-qualcomm-nokia-cz_nh_0714unwiredport_inl.html#1ec5669a29c9\n\nAnd then Nokia decided that \"chips are chips\", so why not play off chip suppliers against each other.  They decided to have TI compete against Broadcom and Qualcomm:\n\nhttp://www.linleygroup.com/newsletters/newsletter_detail.php?num=715\n\n> At MWC, handset-leader Nokia announced two new suppliers for its 3G baseband processors: Broadcom and Qualcomm. Qualcomm, which has agreed to support the Symbian OS on its processors, will supply Nokia's popular smartphones ...\n\n> These announcements, coupled with Nokia's earlier choice of ST (now ST-Ericsson) as a 3G supplier, leave little room for Texas Instruments, which currently provides the vast majority of Nokia's cellular chips. The handset maker is rapidly converting from ASICs to ASSPs as a way to reduce its R&D expenses, so TI's termination of its baseband ASSP investment appears to leave it no role in Nokia's long-term plans. \n\nTI reacted similar to a former girlfriend reacting with extreme prejudice to a suggestion to open a relationship  -- TI terminated its relationship with Nokia, and even supporting its chips, as soon as it could.\n\nAnd then Nokia found out the hard way that it just wasn't true that \"chips are chips\".   There was a slight problem trying to use Qualcomm's chips:  As recent as late 2008, the two companies had been in a life-or-death patent licensing dispute which Nokia settled by paying Qualcomm **billions** of dollars:\n\nhttp://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/17/business/fi-qualcomm17\n\nBut the money wasn't the real issue, it was a life-or-death struggle to see which company could continue to provide, and receive licensing and/or hardware fees for, the IP for the rest of the industry and for each subsequent generation of cellphone technology.  What Nokia failed to realize was that Qualcomm always understood that as long as Nokia was in the phone business, it was an existential threat to Qualcomm's existence.  It's hard to understand how Nokia missed this, because at that time there were **innumerable** analysts who predicted it was **Qualcomm** who was the dinosaur on the verge of extinction with the move to next generation cellphone technologies.\n\nNokia destroying its relationship with TI left Nokia at the mercy of its deadliest rival, Qualcomm.  The end result was that Nokia had to totally surrender to Qualcomm through Qualcomm's intermediary Microsoft.  A former Microsoft executive was appointed to be Nokia head to supervise the transfer of Nokia's former phone business to Microsoft and its eventual destruction.   Nokia was reduced to essentially its network business.\n\nThe Germans right now are doing what Nokia did with TI.

{"title": "USO DD from you friend GeoDudeBroMan", "selftext": "Alright you degenerate fucks first time I'm doing a main post like this, but their is so many of you that follow me now that I think it's time my oil trades get a separate post.\n\nI know I said I wouldn't be trading until November, but some news came out today that makes the argument for a $100 barrel of oil look like Christopher Reeves, aka no legs to stand on.\n\nFirst and foremost let's talk about this week. EIA report came out on Wednesday showing the largest Crude Build in 19 months (8 million barrels) that is absolutely massive. Diving into the report, the reason for the huge build wasn't caused due too refinery maintenance season, rather due to a decrease in exports (about 800,000 bpd). That is really important to consider especially when you consider the Bulls argument stating that we are in a \"tight\" oil market. Both China and India (the 1st and 2nd largest crude importers) have stopped ordering shipments from the US.\n\nIndia right now is having a currency crisis where the rupee continues to fall against the strengthening US dollar. This is important to consider when looking at emerging markets due to the fact it cost them more money to buy oil which is sold exclusively in US dollars. You add the fact that oil prices continue to climb it starts to have a recessionary effect on India's economy. Why is that you ask? Because in order for India to purchase more oil they need to borrow even more money from foreign banks , India just recently borrowed another 10 billion dollars for oil purchases. Since the rupee is ultimately falling against other currencies it would make it even more expensive to pay back that debt, and if India keeps borrowing money due to rising oil prices and can't pay back it's debt, that's bad news for foreign banks and can kick start a global recession. AKA demand destruction. But wait there is more!\n\nIndia came out [today](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.economictimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/india-to-continue-iranian-oil-imports-post-us-sanctions/amp_articleshow/66088584.cms) saying they will continue to buy Iranian oil after Sanctions go into effect. They basically were in a lose lose situation where it was either borrow more money and push the Indian economy into the shitter or take their chances with Trump and purchase discounted Iranian fuel. So from that we already know Iranian sanctions will not go to 0\n\nSo what else is going on? Well OPEC has managed to replace not just all the oil lost from Iranian exports but them some as well. They managed to increase output by 1.4 million barrels bpd back in September, twice the amount they said they would back in June. This rally started on the premise that OPEC wouldn't increase output/couldn't , but like always OPEC proved analyst wrong yet again.\n\nBut wait there is more! Genscape claiming another Crude build at the okalahoma cushings oil hub. Most likely a result of refinery maintenance season and continued low exports from the US. \n\nSo with that being said, I will be buying 15.5 puts next week as I think we are due for a bit more of a correction.\n\nWill update as always, good luck!\n\nUpdate 10/06/2018: Almost forgot! October 10, 2018, EIA will release their monthly short-term energy outlook. Depending on what they say, could add some volatility. If they confirm that the market isnt as tight as I've mentioned it could lead to an even deeper correction.\n\nUpdate 10/07/2018: A schedule for this week's events\n\n\n\n- Wednesday, October 10\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute is to publish its weekly update on U.S. oil supplies.\nAs I've also mentioned before, EIA will relsease its monthly short term outlook report.\n\n- Thursday, October 11\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties will publish its monthly assessment of oil markets.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on oil stockpiles.\n\n- Friday, October 12\n\nThe International Energy Agency will release its monthly report on global oil supply and demand.\n\nLater in the day, Baker Hughes will release weekly data on the U.S. oil rig count. \n\n-----------------------------------------------\nEdit 10/8/2018: Just a heads up! Hurricane Michael is heading right up the gulf of Mexico and has already resulted in a couple of gulf rigs evacuating/shutting in. This could potentially lead to more volatility, but the rigs shutting down this week will not have an effect on the crude oil report as they are always a week behind.\n\nUpdate: 10/10/2018: sorry I haven't been more vocal today, I am currently getting ass fucked by Hurricane Michael. Overall the short term oil outlook report says there is still some risk involved with regards to Iran exports, but that global demand will go down by 0.5% due to economic issues in emerging markets.

As we get close to Nov 4, we are seeing that a lot of the headlines that have been dominating the headlines are slowly being disproven. The most important that OPEC could/did increase output to offset Iranian fuel. The rally started when OPEC said they wouldn't be increasing production at their meeting in Algeria. The crude build we saw this week essentially offsets a good chunk of the draws we were seeing in previous weeks. Genscape is the best of the best and the fact that they are saying their is another crude build next week implies the market isn't as strapped for oil as people thought.
