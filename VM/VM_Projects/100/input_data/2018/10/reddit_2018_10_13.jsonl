Not much of a social life? That's okay, you've come to the right place.\n\nWhat a wild week. A lot of us have gotten really hurt recently after everything took a huge dump. Hope everyone is doing okay. Please hang in there and be well. You are not alone. Feel free to reach out to vent your frustrations, and remember that money isn't everything in life. Healing is a process and it will take time to recover. Reflect and learn from your experiences. \n\nNeed ideas on plays? A lot of heavy hitters in technology, like AAPL, AMZN, AMD, GOOGL, MSFT, FB, V, and TSLA, will report towards the end of the month or shortly after.\n\nNext week we will see BAC, NFLX, IBM, and PYPL to name a few.
