{"title": "Summary Of $TSLA's situation", "selftext": "Summary of Tesla's situation:\n- Tesla currently has 2.67 billion in cash.\n\n- About 1.1 billion of this is in loans that need to be returned early next year\n\n- Around 40% of their cash in hand is from refundable deposits, from people who thought they would get a $35k car\n\n- Tesla cannot make $35k M3s at a profit(this is widely accepted, and even Tesla hinted at it), they'll lose money even making $42k cars. They need to make $50k cars to earn a decent profit\n\n- When asked in the earning call last week about reservations and how many people chose to cancel/take up their car once offered, Musk stunningly called the question \"boring\" and \"boneheaded\" and went on take questions from a youtuber for 20 mins. This was considered unprecedented and bizarre and stock dove.\n\n- Tesla is losing about 800-900 million a quarter, so they will run out of money without a cash infusion. Literally everyone knows that Tesla will need to raise capital this year.\n\n- Musk though, has insisted that Tesla will not need to raise cash because they will be \"profitable by Q3 or Q4\". Reminder that they lost 780 million in Q1, and even small profits won't be enough to prevent running out of cash. In order to make profits they need to sell 10,000 cars a week. They were supposed to produce 5000 cars a week in 2017. They have just now been able to produce 2500/week.\n\n- Even bulls say that Musk is bluffing and he will eventually raise cash this year. Moody's downgrade of Tesla to essentially junk stocks makes it harder to raise cash at good interest rates. Moreover, there is speculation and some evidence that the reason Tesla haven't already done so, is that they are under SEC investigation which would prevent them from raising cash without disclosing a lot of details harmful to them.\n\n- Tesla has access to standard credit lines for about 500 million, but they recently had to pledge their Fremont factory to just maintain these credit lines.\n\n- A lot of Tesla's financial executives have left the company - a red flag to many including Jim Chanos, who famously shorted Enron due to similar indicators. The head of autopilot left and the head of engineering left 'for vacation' last week.\n\n- Tesla's autopilot is complete false advertising. Their original autopilot was developed by MobilEye. MobilEye hated tesla's exaggeration of the system's capabilities and withdrew their supply after a person died using autopilot. Tesla responded that mobileye was jealous of Tesla's superior \"Enhanced Autopilot\" which has hardware capable of full self driving. It is universally accepted that enhanced autopilot is worse than mobileye's system right now, and in general both are basically lane-keeping system with AEB. Waymo and GM/Cruise are far ahead with their FSD capabilities than Tesla(again, widely accepted)\n\n- Part of Tesla's debt comes from bailing out Solar City, a completely unprofitable company loaded with debt that was run by Musk's cousins.\n\n- Starting from 2019 and 2020, all the major automakers are bringing out electric models. This will further damage Tesla's competitiveness, since they have the wost QA and build quality due to their haphazard and panicked development process\n\nDespite all this, the market cap of tesla is larger than Ford, Fiat and nearly equal to GM. Their inflated market cap(which even Musk admits is inflated) is fuelling their funding which inflates the market cap even more as they lose more money trying to make bigger promises. A classic example of a huge bubble.\n\nWhat does Tesla have to it's advantage? Tremendous marketing and brand value. They're probably inching towards or even surpassing Apple\n\nWhat does Tesla have against it? The realities of running a business and actually making the products.\n\nCredits - otalp @ Hacker News\n\nLink to the thread -- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17126786#17127902", "id": "8lbtiy", "created_utc": 1527010129.0, "score": 183, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 276, "comments": [{"body": "Long $TSLA", "score": 205, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "I did not read the post.

They were supposed to produce 5000 cars a week in 2017. They have just now been able to produce 2500/week.\n\nSee my previous point. Also there was a leaked email that they made 3500/week last week so there's that. \n\nSome quick math shows that at their estimated 20% margin for the quarter and at 5000 cars per week that will mean they produce 13*5000 cars or 65000 cars. At an average selling price of 55k (let's use 50k to be conservative) that's 65,000*$50,000 = $3,250,000,000 in revenue. At a margin of 20% that's $650,000,000 in cash flow from the model 3's.

Tesla also has several hundred times more data which is increasing every moment due to Tesla collecting data while in shadow mode on every Tesla. Those competitors have systems that work in specific cities and in specific climates and situations, but they will take a while to be rolled out to all of their cars in every market.

There are a huge number of cofounding variables between Tesla drivers and non-Tesla drivers. The cars themselves are likely safer, they're probably driven on higher-quality, less rural roads ([where most fatalities occur](http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/traffic-safety-on-rural-roads.aspx)), in newer cars (which are safer than older cars), and their drivers are probably less likely to be drunk.

There are lots of variable costs not included in how Tesla reports gross margins, like service centers and superchargers. 20% gross margins on a $55k car imply a COGS of $44k per car.\n\nHere's some napkin math:\n\nUBS's teardown and report on the Model 3 guestimated GM was losing $7,400 per car sold. Since the base price was $37,500, this implies a break-even cost of $44,900. The Bolt has a 60 kWh battery, vs. 75 kWh for the long-range Model 3. UBS believed Tesla was getting a 20% discount per kWh on its packs relative to GM, meaning the M3's 75kWh pack might cost as much as the 60 kWh pack in the Bolt.\n\nThe bolt's break-even cost is similar to your COGS assumption for the M3. However the Bolt shares an econobox platform and many parts with other cars, while the Model 3 does not. The M3 has autonomy hardware the Bolt is lacking. GM is also much better at making cars than Tesla is. Maybe Tesla's company-owned service and sales centers are more efficient than dealer networks, but if so this hasn't manifested yet.\n\nErgo a COGS of $44k seems low to me.\n\n> Show me a statistic that proves that Tesla's are less safe then, not just a one-off story of some autistic highschoolers who turned on autopilot and died in Florida\n\nI can't, because statistics is fucking hard, especially when trying to determine causality.

I obviously don't have the exact costs of the model 3 production (and don't have time to create a spreadsheet with all the variable costs) but let's start with the battery price: IIRC Tesla had achieved a price of about $140 per KwH on their batteries, and improving every day with economies of scale. At 75 KwH that's $10,500. Again, IIRC the battery is the biggest cost of the car so here's where you might disagree with me. I doubt the rest of the car costs $33,500. The autonomy portion is just 8 cameras and a few sensors, I'm not an expert on this stuff but I don't think it'll cost more than 2-3k at the absolute max. The software involved is obviously a fixed cost so that doesn't factor into gross margin.\n\nSpeaking of gross margin, the service centers and superchargers are not included in the gross margin of the model 3, so I think the 20% and eventually 25% margin is very reachable this year. \n\n2. As for the statistics portion, maybe I misspoke. I shouldn't have said that Tesla's are definitively 4 times safer than a normal car but if we look at the total miles driven divided by the deaths, it's hard to say that those statistics don't at least imply some sort of correlation, such as that a Tesla is at least twice as safe as a normal car, just maybe not four times. \n\nAutopilot has been engaged for, I believe, somewhere close to a billion miles of driving and caused only a handful of accidents. Moreover, it is improving every day so even if is not significantly safer at the moment, it will be soon.\n\n3.
