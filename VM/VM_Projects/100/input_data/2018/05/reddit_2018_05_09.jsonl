I am not claiming I'm at all the best single-name stock picker, but I think the current market environment is such that beta will boost all long bets; a rising tide raises all ships. I think one could easily do just as well buying calls on the QQQ, but I used my judgement on which single-names might accelerate faster than others.\n\nMy top-down view was based off 1. the pullback of CTAs from equity markets since February, resulting in long-depressed volumes, and 2. strong but non-reactionary earnings, resulting in valuation compression going forward. If you truly believed that we're on the cusp of a correction, valuation compression could possibly be the \"new normal\", however, my perspective was that once the market was more at ease with the earnings releases, volume would come back, CTAs / risk-parity funds might re-enter the space further bolstering momentum.\n\nIn terms of exit, my strategy is to hold until valuation reaches pre-compression levels.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "And what calls are you buying moving forward?
