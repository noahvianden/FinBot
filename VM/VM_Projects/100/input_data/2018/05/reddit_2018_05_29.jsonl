Expert answers are much appreciated.\n\nHere is my take:\n\nIn this example. $5010 is the net debit in the beginning \\($50x100shares \\+ $10 commish\\) and let's say buying weekly calls cost $35 \\($25 commish \\+ $10 premiums\\), so that brings the total cost to $5045. Now when you exercise the 45.00 calls, your cost basis should stay the same. But the main point is that if should the stock price make 1&#37; gain the next day, so from $50/share to $50.50, since now you own shares at 45.00/share, you would in fact be gaining $45.50/share, a 1.11&#37; relative gains which is more than 1&#37; gain had you just had your stock at since $50. Compounding returns is key here. If stock declined 1&#37; from $50 to $49.5, that is a 1.01&#37; move, but if you own stock at $45 and declines to $44.50, it is a 1.12&#37; move. I guess from this thought experiment, this strategy is ok if one wants to accentuate their bullish bet on gains, but it is short biased in the sense that it accentuates losses more relatively. In this sense it woulbe a short favoured arbitrage since shorting the stock at $45 \\(after exercising\\), one is now hedged on the upside from existing 100 shares at $45, while borrowing another 100 shares for a total of 200 shares and making more gains if stock goes down.\n\n\\*Downward move in stock price creates bigger relative loss than gains \\(1.12&#37; vs 1.11&#37;\\) because the downside would be capped at $0/share.\n\nIs this all viable?

Whoever you are using you should switch), or $0.10 premium.  At a minimum, lacking extrinsic value (which there will generally still be some of until thurs/fri), that’s a $5 premium, or a $500 contract.  More likely there’s some extrinsic even in weekly and it’s, say, $5.5 or $6.  Let’s go with 6.  So, let’s redo it\n\n* Buy 100 shares of XYZ at $50 ($5000)\n* Buy 1 $45 call weekly expiration at $6 ($600)\n\nSo your net debit is 5600.\n\nThen you want to exercise the call you bought.

I generally use ToS and TW. I'm wondering if it's worth it to use a direct access broker and paying for things like level 2 data feeds. \n\nCan you talk about the more nuanced things about how to select a broker?

If you want to roll a short call spread, say 100 short 120 long, to a new spread of say 90 short 95 long, but it's now 2dte and there are no bids on the old 120 long. Question is am I better off doing a 3 legged roll and leaving the 120 long out of it, since market makers computers don't even have a bid for it since so far otm with 2dte? Or will their computers just assign 0 or -1 cent value to it, and still make offer in the complex order book?\n\nOr better off with the 3 legged trade without that way otm no bid leg, if some or all market makers don't like worthless legs, and just separaetly setting a 1 cent gtc sell on that one?
