My reasoning being that I think it would be impossible for a company to commit such blatant and egregious fraud without a) someone notifying regulators, b) regulators or someone outside internal audit/third party auditors notifying regulators, c) someone noticing irregularities and bringing it up publicly then an investigation. Sure, you can have collusion between upper management and the auditors, but with partner rotations, that will not last more than 5 years. Additionally, with SOX, all executive management must sign the statements noting that they will be held liable for the information contained within them - no more slap on the wrists for the CEO or other executives who happened to not know it was going on. Basically the point I am trying to make is that prior to the fraud getting to the level that was Enron, or better yet, the level necessary to bring down a Big 4 firm, it would have been detected through potentially countless different avenues. \n Now, I'm not saying SOX is wonderful in all its glory, but the regulations are tight, and I personally believe, are adequate to prevent fraud occurring on the scale that Enron did.
