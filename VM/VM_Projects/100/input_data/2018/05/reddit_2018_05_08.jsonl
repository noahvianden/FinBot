{"title": "Actually make money with MU", "selftext": "Listen up retards, you all put too much emphasis on actual earnings reports. Micron has been the most predictable stock on the market the past two years, you just don't understand how to play it because all you fucks are too busy drawing lines and pretending that you work for the NSA.\n\nMicron should be reporting around June 28. That's 51 days from now. Why would you buy shit this early you ask? Because that's when the stock moves you fucking retards. They keep beating guidance and their fundamentals are crazy if the memory market stops being as cyclical as it has been in the past, but I don't want to make those bets because unlike most of you fucks I'm here to make money not gamble it. I want to make money when the market is boring.\n\nLet's look at the last seven run-ups into earnings. If you had timed things perfectly this is what you would have done:\n\n- Bought Feb 5, 2018 and made 49% over the next 45 days.\n\n- Bought Nov 4, 2017 and made 10% over the next 45 days.\n\n- Bought Aug 10, 2017 and made 24% over the next 47 days.\n\n- Bought May 17, 2017 and made 17% over the next 43 days.\n\n- Bought Feb 24, 2017 and made 14% over the next 27 days.\n\n- Bought Nov 3, 2016 and made 24% over the next 48 days.\n\n- Bought Aug 24, 2017 and made 15% over the next 40 days.\n\nEven you dumb fucks should be able to see the pattern here. The month and a half going into earnings the market always comes around because the P/E is just too low for a company as solid as MU.\n\nWe're 51 days out, just buy your calls now and let that shit run. If we match the worst of the last seven quarters MU will be sitting at $51 going into earnings. If we match the best it will be at $72. If we match the average it will be at $59.\n\nGrab some July 20s, from $50-$60 and thank me later.
