I feel that the easiest way to check AMZN(and GOOG) would be to regulate AWS and Google search as public utilities similar to telecommunication and energy industries. \n\nThese technology megacorporations are a new kind of monopoly. Standard Oil and Bell were immense beasts but Google and Amazon(and others) resemble a massive octopus with hands in all parts of life. The largest problem in my eyes is not the market share anymore but the data mining. Corporations are constantly harvesting data analyzing your habits, interests, and needs in order to best cater to you. Are they useful? Absolutely, but in the wrong hands they can be a weapon as well, and many people aren’t even completely aware of the extent to which these corporations know you. Amazon can collect data through its marketplace, AWS, Alexa powered devices, kindle products etc. Google has search, phones, home products...I could ramble forever. Regardless, the fact that I can start googling about the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee, and suddenly I am smashed with ads on Facebook and recommended groups on Reddit about hiking and trails is both troubling and amusing to me. \n\nThis is an awesome thing, but like any great invention I think we should be having a conversation about how we can protect users from abuse. I think data mining today is by and large benign but history shows things can get bad fast if we are not cognizant. We’re not an Orwellian state but it’s a lot easier to get to somewhere similar with what we have now.\n\nSorry for that tangent, maybe should have saved it for r/Privacy, but it does lead to my final point.

The others: Calico, Chronicle, Dandelion, GV, CapitalG, X, Google Fiber, Nest Labs, Jigsaw, Sidewalk Labs, Verily and Waymo. I don't think any of these are profitable, and a lot of them sure as hell are expensive.\n* It's not that they want to block all ads; the EU is totally fine with marketing. What they are considering is extremely enhanced privacy considerations. Companies buy ads through Google because Google can use browser data to target you with relevant ads. I'm a millennial male MBA engineer, so having ads for AARP or tampons or baby toys are irrelevant to me, and the people buying  those ads don't want to waste their money on showing me those ads. Without being able to use browser data, they don't know what to show me. That makes Google advertising much less attractive. Some light reading [here](https://iapp.org/news/a/its-not-just-about-cookies-anymore/).\n* Their search algorithms are the best. I agree 100% there. But search by itself isn't monetized. The monetization comes from using the cookies and other browser data to show targeted ads to you. Without access to that data, they don't make money.
