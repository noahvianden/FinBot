Now he sits there in my heart, this Ouija of mine, Always there to make me smile, Make me feel just fine. He had autism, that boy did, autism in his heart. To take that short, To end his pain, To tear us all apart. But in the end, he died in retardation. Lacking, nevermore, He died an Ouija, MrTrader1 did, And we’ll love him forevermore.
