I pay $15 a month because I'm a math major and sometimes just don't feel like figuring stupid homework assignments out... if I type the exact wording of a problem into Chegg there is about a 70% chance that Chegg has the answer with steps for me. (For the upper level math courses it's more like 40-60% depending on the actual course, but for lower level stuff like Calc I-III, intro to Stats, intro to physics, linear algebra, etc. that percentage shoots up to 90% same goes for basic chem, bio, etc. I'm sure)\n\nI will give my guess to the growth narrative as well: Now as college becomes more expensive students will get wise to the rip-off that is $40K social science degrees ( that is unless you have connections, are a truly gifted networker, or from a top-20 university.) So more students with less aptitude for STEM are going to be taking STEM courses and relying on Chegg. Considering the relatively low cost of 15 bucks a month compared to the price of a degree it is worth it. Chegg is also typically the first result in Google search, even more than they were just last year imo. When you don't pay for Chegg but keep seeing that they have the answer but you just can't see it cuz your too cheap you get frustrated and eventually just bust out your card and sign-up at 2am... not that I know from experience or anything. When you realize Chegg saves you 2-4 hours a week you're not going to cancel it. \n\nRisk: I'd estimate that about 50% of Chegg's answer-bank is available else where for free and easy to find. Even higher than that if you feel like digging around the internet to try and find a correct answer. Also Chegg's quality control could be a little better and relies on people who aren't totally sure how to do the problem voting on how good the answer is... needs improvement lol. I'm not sure how the answer providers are incentivized, but I'm sure it is less costly than most subscription based service expenses, so I guess that is good. Maybe worth noting that college kids are generally cheap and I've heard they uhm just might share accounts between a few people. They do have a competitor or two (Course Hero, and I know there's 1 or 2 others) but I'm sure Chegg has the largest market share.\n\nI've seen on their web page that some of Chegg's revenue comes from text book services, and that shit ain't growing imo anytime soon. I do think they mostly rent so maybe they can maintain for a few years without losing any of that revenue, and the profit margins are probably pretty sweet if they're getting repeat revenue on used books. Most students prefer an actual book as opposed to digital. Shit maybe they're textbook revenue just might grow idk, I've never checked their actual quarterlies or revenue breakdown btw.\n\nAt a time where subscription based services often trade at a premium, and with a highly sought after demo I think Chegg is a solid bet. An acquisition is probs best case scenario but I'm not exactly sure who would target them off the top of my head. I bet their marketing costs are pretty big, but I just think that Chegg might be here to stay.

To be honest, I don't really know the math behind it well enough to give you an easy explanation, so this is just me pointing you in the right direction. Basically, the idea is that you're inevitably going to lose sometimes as long as the probability of winning is not 100%, which it never is in the market. Kelly Crit. helps you figure out what your maximum allocation to each investment should be that gives you the best statistical chance of not losing your capital.\n\nAnyway, I assumed you had $10,000 to invest to see what kind of numbers I got. Here's what I put into the calculator:\n\n    Bankroll: $10,000\n    Odds: 2 to 1\n    Probability: 50\n    Multiples of: $149.40\n    Minimum: $149.40\n\nSo if I assume that you have a 50% chance of \"winning\" on your investment in SHOP, and then I further assume that *if you win*, you will make back 2x your initial investment, your maximum allocation to SHOP should be $2,390.40, or 16 shares. Obviously, you can't know what chances of success are or what the payoff will be in the even that you \"win\", but it's not so much about giving you the magic number of shares to buy. The idea is to help you understand that while investing a higher amount may look like it will give you higher returns on a single bet, if you extrapolate that strategy out over your investing career, you are highly likely to lose your invested capital. \n\nYou also have to consider your time horizon. The odds of SHOP returning 2x your investment in the next 30 days are much lower than the same thing occurring in the next 5 years, for example. Unfortunately there's just no magic way to do this. I wish it were as easy as \"solve for x\" but you will have to make assumptions no matter how you approach it. In the end, it's better to make overly conservative assumptions and give up some possible gains than to make overly aggressive assumptions and risk losing your initial capital. Remember, a 50% drawdown has to be followed by a 100% gain just to break even. On the other hand, a 50% gain can sustain a 66% loss and still leave you in tact.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I very much appreciate your long and detailed response.
