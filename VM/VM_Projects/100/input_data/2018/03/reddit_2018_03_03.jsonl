This is because the Tesla has focused on charging infrastructure, and making everything in house, while the Bolt is an LG creation inside a GM shell with very few charging stations. Tesla has also focused on becoming a battery manufacturer and when other car companies come out with models that can compete numerically with Tesla they won't be able to compete with battery production having to look at outside firms for sourcing. It'll likely take ~8 years before a large firm will catch up to Tesla in EV sales, which is significant as %of ev. vehicles sold is going to increase massively.
