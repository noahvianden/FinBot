I founded Estimize at the age of 24 after spending 5 years in the hedge fund world as a quantitative analyst and then PM. My academic background is in war theory and behavioral economics. \n\nI mentor several other fin-tech companies and hope to be able to share what I've learned over the past decade plus with you. \n\nI have a lot of opinions on the state of the startup tech world, especially within finance, as well as politics (I'm a neo-liberal), surfing, and hockey (huge Rangers fan). \n\nAsk me anything!\n\nproof: [https://i.imgur.com/GbeeH8p.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/GbeeH8p.jpg)", "id": "91hmsb", "created_utc": 1532440851.0, "score": 254, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 215, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "I started with $10M and did 30% and 32% returns with a 2.5 Sharpe the two years I ran the fund.

I wanted to challenge of forcing myself to learn something completely new, how to build a fin-tech company. the lifestyle certainly isn't as great, but it's incredibly rewarding to build something that hundreds of thousands of people use and find valuable. \n\nThat said, I guarantee at some point I'll go back to running money, I truly love the game.

You can train yourself through journaling and keeping track of your emotions relative to your P&L along with the market. \n\nRunning a startup is all about the mess. Your schedule is highly variable, your life is a mess, you are meeting new people all the time, you are forced to learn new things quickly, and constantly. It's uncomfortable, it makes having a normal family life or relationship difficult. You may be traveling at the drop of a hat, you may be up very late responding to clients or partners or your team. It forces you to be uncomfortable and to take a lot of risks with limited information. You also need to sell, constantly. And selling isn't just literally selling for money, it's selling people on working with you, it's selling people on funding you, it's selling people on partnering with you.

If the upside risk to a company is that much higher, the willingness of investors to buy at higher valuations should be there as well. \n\nThe same thing goes for the downside. Like never before companies are being disrupted really quickly, and can go from solid fundamentals to terrible lightning quick. If you are in the line of sight of Amazon or another disruptor large or small, you probably deserve a lower multiple because your downside risk is that much greater. \n\nThis is only going to get more exacerbated as time goes on.

(If there is truly alpha, wouldn't coming from the money management side have allowed you to capture it directly? Isn't that the most efficient thing to do with sources of alpha that actually work? Now, I fully agree that selling models that kind of work generates a much more certain stream of earnings.)\n\n\nAssuming there is alpha, have you thought about at what point your tool has too many customers for the data to no longer be worth anything because it is already priced in?\n\n\nDoes your tool really provide more estimates than Bloomberg, which aggregates the predictions for earnings & for economic fundamentals? Or is it the biggest platform that tries to create an estimate that beats the median prediction? If it is the latter, how do you help people identify the whisper numbers, or is that something that you leave to money managers so they can imagine they are adding their own version of alpha?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Estimize, nor any of its employees are permitted to trade individual equities.

", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That's a good policy. But the main question is not usually about data & analytics companies trading against the clients, it's that if the data & analytics are enough by themselves to generate alpha then the incentives wouldn't be to share that information in the first place. \n\nTools that are more about portfolio construction, risk mitigation, or aiding in a research process make sense to sell, but the conflict inherent in selling alpha generating information is there will be adverse selection in that most true-alpha generating information will be kept private.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So this is obviously a huge questions that comes up for all data companies of course. And I think the questions isn't actually being asked in the right way (not to malign your question, I just don't think it's the right question). \n\nAll data sets will get arbed, period. Some have higher capacity than others, and will take longer. Sell side analyst estimates have been around 30+ years and there's still alpha. \n\nThe adverse selection issue you point to is not actually a problem. It's pretty difficult to effectively arb a data set. It takes a lot of different skill sets that data companies do not have. Running money is not easy, and the structure of the cap table of data companies is not designed to make money from trading. Also, the multiple at sale on revenue from trading is much lower than subscription data sales. \n\nBut more than that, it can actually be more profitable to sell the data (even if it generates a lot of alpha) than to trade it yourself. At Estimize we pride ourselves in selling something that (if used correctly) actually helps firms do this. But there are a lot of products out there that are sold which people buy because they think they need it, not because it directly generates alpha. I put credit card receipt data in this bucket. It can generate alpha, but for most firms it won't and doesn't. That doesn't mean there's an adverse selection issue going on, it's just that finance is an inefficient industry filled with people who mostly don't succeed. That's just a fact. \n\nAlso, data doesn't have to be sold to generate alpha on a stand alone basis. Most of data that's sold is used by analysts to inform their overall opinion about something, such as their own future differentiated view.

You have to get a bunch of people who are going to under-perform the market anyway feel like they need to incorporate the data into their process and that it will improve returns. And maybe it does - there are lots of simple factors that can improve performance by helping fund managers avoid losers. Getting people to avoid highly shorted stocks, or stocks with signs of accounting manipulation all have significant evidence that they work. But those funds will be losers anyway if they avoid the mediocre set of stocks without having bought into at least a couple of the few stocks that drive most of index returns.\n\nAnd then from a business perspective the competitor that owns the most market-share, Bloomberg, is not mainly a data distributor but is really finance's instant messaging system/social network. So maybe you partner with them and get revshare but it's hard to scale up much higher compared to profits that you might have been able to generate more directly if the data actually made alpha generation simple at a large scale. And here we are assuming that the best strategies based purely around the data support a large enough fund. \n\nAnd if the data's utility is based around increasing performance in a few areas that can be incorporated into a process but won't actually drive returns of a fund then I understand why the decision to be an arms dealer makes much more sense than going into the market yourself.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think you have pieces of this correct and others a bit off. \n\nJust remember that no data set creates a model to produce alpha that is deployed in a vacuum.
