Similarly, sanity check that you are viewing the delta per contract and not per 100 shares. I've seen it shown both ways. \n\nDelta is how the movement of the option tracks the movement of the stock. So if the stock goes up and you're long a call, expect a positive result for the delta term. Opposite for a put or if you sold instead of bought. (Double opposite if you sold a put.)\n\nTheta is decay of an option's premium per day. Negative if you own, positive if you sold.\n\nSo a call starts at .35  \nThe stock gains 3.07. Your option gets about 29.73% of that, or .91.  \nAnd if one day passed, it would decay by about 2 cents.  \nSo my estimate for the option's value is .35 + .91 - .02 = $1.24\n\nNow do bear in mind this is just an estimate. It's the asymptote to a curve. Picture a line that touches a circle. For small distances the movement along the line will be similar to the curve. But the bigger the move, the more the circle bends away.  It's the same way with this pricing estimate. The bigger the price change the less accurate that delta is because of another variable called \"gamma\". And if the move is sharp and surprising, that increases volatility which is another variable \"vega\".\n\nWhich becomes obvious if you consider the stock moving down instead of up. In that case the estimate would be 0.35 - 0.91 - 0.02 which is negative, and owning a call can't be worth less than zero.

Plenty of websites have tried but there's a few things stopping them: 1) FB just buys potentially disrupting technology or technology that sustains or improves what they already do. [Here's a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook). 2) FB sells adspace to literally anyone which is what they got a slap on the wrist for (the fake news issue) at the US congress and the EU meeting. But no one fucking cares so they'll pay lip service to \"reviewing their methods and algorithms\" while making money hand over fist doing the same thing they've been doing for years. 3) FB is integrated into damn near every mobile platform and app there is on both iOS and Android. They are, frankly, THE social media platform and can just buy any competition that pops up or is even the slightest bit threatening.\n\nAmazon is in a similar position as the world's largest online retailer. Sure, Walmart, Target, and others developed online services later, after the fact, but didn't capitalize on it when Amazon was booming in the early 2000s. Now Amazon is, like FB, THE online retailer. They are a household name that everyone goes to buy random shit. Why go to a brick and mortar store or be limited by their inventory (both online or at the store) when I can sit at home in the my underwear, just buy whatever I want, and have it delivered to me? The other big retailers had their chance and missed it. And now Amazon is branching out into other spaces like their virtual services, grocery delivery service (purchasing Whole Foods mostly for the distribution network), and so on.\n\nNetflix I think is the most unique of the ones you mentioned. No one likes commercials, people like to binge shows, and people don't like to be told when they have to watch the show they wanna see. Turns out millions of people will gladly pay 15 bucks a month to not watch ads and be able to binge shows. And their content is extremely varied; far more than cable or network television. They, too, are branching out into other spaces like video game services. And they also throw their money at getting more and more (surprisingly good) content for their platform. EDIT: Couple all that with rising costs of cable, the fact that everyone has complained for decades about \"having hundreds of channels and nothing to watch,\" the ubiquity of the internet, and no one NEEDS cable. So everyone just cuts the cord and goes to Netflix. For whatever retarded reason, no TV companies, probably due to the prevailing corporate culture not caring about innovation, thought to invest in online services. Only now are we starting to see things like ABC online and so forth.\n\nSo what does that all mean in the context of Tesla vs Ford, GM, etc.\n\nThe big players are in the position big retailers were in in relation to amazon; they SHOULD be able to see the writing on the wall. If Walmart had been quicker to the punch, Amazon might not exist today as we know it. But they dropped the ball. I don't think that the car makers are going to make the same mistake. They already have plans to build on the same technology Tesla uses, they're already profitable, can throw a bunch of money at innovating those technologies, and have the manufacturing and distribution networks in place to deliver those products.\n\nHowever, it's not a given they will be successful. Those same advantages could be a disadvantage in that these established companies have shareholders and board directors to satisfy. And if the dominant corporate culture doesn't value that kind of innovation, then they, like Walmart, will drop the ball and have to worry about a huge competitor taking away a chunk of their market share. \n\nIt would be smart business to invest a bunch into R&D and undercut Tesla.

And, personally, I don't think he cares about the profitability... I think (and maybe I'm falling for a crafted persona) he's a true believer in innovating to build a brighter future regardless of if his companies are financially successful in the short or long run.\n\nIt's easy for me (us) to sit at home on Reddit and ruminate on how \"easy\" and \"obvious\" it would be for a company like Ford or Hyundai to take all of this technology and completely shift or augment their vehicles to utilize it but it's not that simple. I get that. But it still seems incredibly clear that there is a market and a desire for this tech... and Tesla IS NOT providing it. How long are those wait lists? It's 7-12 months before people are going to get a Model 3? A Model S costs nearly $100K? The Roadster is going to be over $200K? That's not a price point most people are able to pay (despite how much they want the car). This is the time for Ford, GM, Hyundai, etc to all collectively hurry the fuck up and bring something similar to market before Tesla can ramp up it's production, meet demand, and lower costs through efficiency streamlining and back-end innovation.\n\nThe main reason I didn't buy a Model S is not the price, it's the fact that I would have to plan trips around where recharging stations are.
