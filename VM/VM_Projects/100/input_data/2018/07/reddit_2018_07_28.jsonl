{"title": "Thoughts on Tesla", "selftext": "Do you guys think this is a good time to invest?\nHere's my thoughts on the matter.\nTesla shares have taken a hit this month but I feel this is more to do with the bad PR Elon has got from Twitter and I would think it should recover most of these losses quickly. I'm  looking to invest longish term (1-2 years) and I feel they are going to take a big share of the market in Europe in the next few years as most European car manufacturers have not invested heavily in electric cars. Also the fact that most governments are looking to incentivise going electric in the future it will make running costs cheaper relative to diesel/petrol. The model 3 car itself is priced so it is within the price range of most middle earning households and it outperforms ICE cars in terms of torque, 0-60mph and it has a ton of features most cars at that price don't have. Also the demand at the moment far outstrips supply which is  encouraging even though they have had alot of bad PR this year with missed deadlines and empty promises about production output.\nThat all being said I am still looking to invest in a loss making company, one that has been loss making since it's first year. I've been discussing this with a few friends and they told me to be cautious as the reason the stock is valued as highly as it is even with the fact they are losing money is because all my points listed above have already been priced in, and even if tesla starts to take a large share of the market from bmw/audi/Mazda etc the stock might not go up the way I hope it will. \nI'm pretty new to this investment game so sorry if I've made some glaring oversight on something important. \nCheers for the advise!\n", "id": "92kx7u", "created_utc": 1532770096.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 193, "comments": [{"body": "Hit due to bad PR against Elon?

Frankly, there are probably a few significant carmakers who have weak or no EV roadmaps, and I could see them licensing Tesla tech or buying the company in the event of impending bankruptcy to get into the game.\n\nIf they split the difference, getting to profitability is probably simpler now than it was a few years ago-- a lot of the one-off startup costs have already been taken care of.\n", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "PLUG", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Haha, wait....

This could end up being a huge problem because luxury cars are sensitive to price elasticity and consumer debt is already at record highs. The market for $50k-$78k is significantly smaller then the one for $35k cars.\n\nIt has an extremely loyal fanbase that reminds me of Apple. Unfortunately, they operate in a low margin business and are quickly losing their first mover advantage. They are WAY behind in autonomous driving and the best case scenario is Panasonic manages to create a truly revolutionary battery chemistry that other automakers can't match, allowing them to squeak out a few more basis points of gross margin. If not, they are doomed to bankruptcy or a takeover at a much lower stock price considering their P/S ratio is 4+ while TM, who many consider the best automaker in the world trdes at 0.75 P/S.

Lets be honest thats what it is & its margins reflect that. The supposed 30% gross margin is very misleading because Tesla has to run its own dealerships, install & maintain Superchargers and conduct a whole slew of other costs that other car companies push onto their dealership network.
