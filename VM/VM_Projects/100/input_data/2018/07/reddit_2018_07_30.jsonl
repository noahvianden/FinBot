I believe the odds of such a crash are better than 60% in 2018.\n\nWhy? \n\nThe stock market is overvalued, pumped up by easy money from low Federal interest rates. It's been easier to borrow money and invest in short-term gains than plan for the long-term. This is especially true with U.S. corporations, who have borrowed at low rates to buyback stock instead of make capital investments for long-term growth or in employees.  What's more, there's trade-war going on, and it's going to hit corporate profits. Combine that with low quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons once the stock buybacks stop, and the truth about the growth in corporate profits is going to come out -- i.e. they are artificially inflated and unsustainable without capital investment (of which there has been none).\n\nFinally, and this is the real kicker, many in the upper 1% have borrowed against their portfolios so that they could buy more stock and boost their short-term gains that much further. There is a margin call coming here (and for U.S. corporations) as interest rates rise... it's just a matter of time before we hit that tipping point. \n\nIf not this year, next. Institutional investors are already pulling back from the market ... only retail investors are really left driving things. It's why FAANG stocks have been the only ones leading the market higher this year. \n\nFinally, we may be in a 2007 situation here ... where the market rallies through the end of the year, driven by positive sentiment due to cyclical holiday buying and rebounding retail stocks. \n\nBut I don't think this is a repeat of 2007. I think the November elections will likely be the main catalyst for a crash this year. Wall Street hates change.

He would never make a huge bet, but he just told me not to buy a house before the bubble burst.  He also wasn’t another Michael Burry, he didn’t know remotely how bad it would get either.\n\nSo now he’s telling me that it’s harder to predict, namely because of QE, but he doesn’t think we’ve cracked the Economy Konami Code that makes recessions a thing of the past (I’ve seen several non sarcastic comments here that really think we’ll never see a recession again) and I agree with him.  The last time we talked he said we probably have another 12 months of relatively smooth sailing and then by 18 months we’ll firmly be in a recession.  As for how bad he’s preaching: a couple months ago he seemed to think it would be nothing compared to 2008 with a quick recovery, and this time he’s a bit more pessimistic but still not Great Recession 2.0 or anything.\n\nI agree with everything he said.  I’m in the auto industry and starting in late 2012 we had record sales every quarter for each quarter until mid-2016 and then we still did **but** we started offering larger and larger incentives.  Then in late 2017 even that wasn’t enough.  Basically a market only needs so many cars, so we were offering our cars at a discount, which is essentially taking a sale we could make next month and doing it today.  Cars aren’t the backbone of the American economy but buying cars to me seems like a good barometer of how things are doing.\n\nSo combine the classical signs you’ve mentioned, slowing of sales growth (not yet declines but it’s getting there), and Feds potentially worried about inflation and possibly tightening money more in the near future, I think we’re *far* closer to the end of this boom cycle than we are the start.
