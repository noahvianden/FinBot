You are trading with another autistic fucktwit (or a computer designed by autistic fucktwits).  You are not trading with \"the man\" or some central figure.\n\nFor anything you want to do, there has to be someone who wants to do the opposite (or you make a math error and some computer profits off your stupidity).\n\nCalls and puts aren't magic, there's someone on the other side.  They are a giant square/rectangle of moving vehicles for Stock.\n\nYou can:\n\n* Sell Calls:  This means you have stock (there is uncovered calls but don't do this you will get assfucked), and you're betting the gain$ will be less than X.  You sell calls for the price X+Y saying \"hey, I think i'm only going to make X in gains, so I'm locking them in, so give ME your stupid autistic money if you think it's going to get X+Y\".  Generally you sell them for Y mius a little bit, unless the other guy is fucking stupid.  Keep in mind this does not protect you if the stock tanks like the motherfucking Titanic.\n\n* Buy Calls:  You want in on a stock, but you think buying it to get gain$ the old fashioned way outright is boring.  So instead you are paying money for the \"rights\" to buy stock at a future price Y.  You generally profit only if the stock beats Y + the price of buying the calls.  You are eating the leftover tendie$ of the above poor sap.\n\n* Buy Puts:  You have stock, and you think it is going to tank like motherfucking ENE.  But some voice in the back of your head says \"but what if there's tendies?\".  So instead you buy puts at price Y.  This lets you get off the motherfucking Titanic if it goes below Y + the option price.  Why plus the option price?  Sunk cost fallacy you fucktwit.  You already lost money buying the puts so get off the motherfucking ship.\n\n* Sell Puts:  You enjoy a good assfucking so you sell puts.  You are saying \"I don't think the stock will go below X so I will sell you the right to assfuck me if it goes below X in exchange for money\".  If it goes below X then you must buy it at X and you now have stock worth less than what you bought it for (hopefully this difference is not more than the money the assfucker gave you).\n\nAs an added bonus, all these vehicles are tradeable items in and of themselves.  You can buy and sell these positions.  Really, there are not 4 items.  There is only \"Sell at price Y\" or \"Buy at price Y\".  \"Buy/sell puts/calls are terms for why you are intending on doing the previous two things (buy at Y or sell at Y), depending if Y is above or below the current price of the stock.\n\nOP \"Bought Puts\" without owning any stock and when it went down he sold the rights to someone who did own the stock.  This is uncovered.  If it didn't go down OP would have been motherfucking hosed, since he paid money for them and if the stock goes up people generally don't want the rights to sell stock at a lower price.  And OP would get none of the gains of actually owning the stock.  Some other schmuck who sold the puts said I'll take $20 basically betting the stock won't go below $395 on a $415 option.  The seller sets the price.\n\nGenerally these are always priced at ( current price of stock - option excise price ) +/- some margin based on risk (+ if you are buying, - if you are selling).\n\nHopefully I didn't fuck this up.  There are different terms for these, such as long and short, or writing contracts, etc.  I chose the most basic terms.\n\nBuying these vehicles (puts/calls) is less risky but you are paying to do it.
