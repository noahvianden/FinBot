There is some assumption of frictionless markets and exclusion of commissions involved. If you don't have enough capital to exercise the option, which in this case would be $35,000 + exercise fees, then you're going to have to sell that call spread before it expires, which is going to cost you. Market makers love gouging you on prices for deep ITM and OTM options, because there's an enormous lack of liquid volume. So even though your call spread may be worth $2.50 at expiration, you may end up finding that you can only exit the trade for $2.00, because no one else is willing to buy/sell their options at the intrinsic value.\n\nMy advice would be to paper trade them, and see for yourself.

Thus, you need the stock to be above $352.13 for you to make money on your $350 call. A stock price higher than $352.13 is profit, but because you sold a call, you max out profit at $352.50. Thus, the most you can really make is $0.37 per share ($37 per contract). For you to buy and sell the call, it costs $2.13 per share AND I believe that robinhood wont let you sell a call without actually having the stock so you'll need to invest in 100 shares. \n\nThe profit margin seems too minimal for me to invest money into in my opinion.

The deeper the ITM you go, the less the extrinsic value.

Extrinsic value increases as you get closer to being ATM - typically with a correlation to the probability of being ITM at expiration.\n\nThe delta is often used as a probability for being ITM at expiration.  A .99 delta has a 99% guarantee of being ITM at expiration.  The (NFLX) $230 strike is the first .99 delta.  This is deep ITM, and there's no extrinsic value - so your strategy doesn't work here.\n\nThe $350/$352.50 spread has a 84% chance of profit.  84 times out of 100, it makes you $37 ($3108).

Since NFLX is having their earnings report on Monday, the option prices are higher because a price jump is anticipated.  After the earnings report is announced, the interest in the options drops significantly because the unknown becomes known.  (Think of options as insurance for shareholders.)  When you sell a put spread, you close it by buying it back.  When you sell the put spread before the earnings report, people are paying a premium - so you can sell it for $37.  After the earnings is announced, nobody is interested in buying options so the price of options drops - which means you can buy (close) your put spread back for a lot less than what you sold it for.
