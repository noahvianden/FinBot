{"title": "Why $PYPL can bring you tendies TODAY", "selftext": "Today I will convince you to put your entire liquid net worth in $PYPL. All I ask is 3 minutes of your time, and by the time your done reading, I promise your four figure Robinhood account will already be margin call- swimming in tendies.\n\nIn two days it will be the 25th of July. Why is that date important, you may ask? PayPal. Earnings. \"Okay okay u/Sparkswont, PayPal reports their EPS on Wednesday, but why do I give a shit?\"\n\nVenmo. In 2013, PayPal whipped their dick out and made one of the best purchases in the history of the company. For the cheap price of $800 million, PayPal acquired Venmo. Since then, Venmo has exponentially increased the amount of cash they process on a quarterly basis. Since I know most of you faggots can barely read, I've put together a visual for you:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9jDlR0L.png\n\nAs we all know, money isn't paper anymore, it's all 1s and 0s in a database. Only old man Buffet uses tangible money these days, the real money is in the arbitrary \"balances\" in all these fucking mobile cash apps. Trust me, the last time any of my friends paid me in cash was the stone age. It's all through Venmo.\n\n\"Okay sparkyboy, you're starting to make sense. But so what if Venmo is doing billions in transactions? They don't even monetize it.\"\n\nWrong. Venmo takes 3% in fees for every credit card transaction. PayPal is raking in this free cash all because kids these days don't care that 3% of their fucking money is disappearing under their nose.\n\nNow, all that is well and good, but let's look at some historical charts. PayPal is likely to report positive EPS, but we all know that doesn't mean shit (see $NFLX). Let's take a look at how $PYPL has reacted to earnings beats in the past.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDate|EPS Forecast|Actual EPS|Stock Movement\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n04/25/2018|0.41|0.45|+4.05%\n01/31/2018|0.38|0.4|-5.88%\n10/19/2017|0.32|0.34|+9.09%\n07/26/2017|0.33|0.36|+5.17%\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOf the last 4 ERs, $PYPL has rallied on 3 of them. Fuck me, that's some good odds. Clearly there was a bit of a sell off in January, but it's probably just because of how extra monotone Daniel Schulman's (CEO) voice was sounding that day on the earnings call (trust me, I just listened to it and nearly fell asleep). Maybe people passed out and their head accidentally landed on the sell button, who knows.\n\nAnyways, there's a lot more DD I could do on this, but by now you're already buying $ROPE because of your $MU FDs, so all you need to know is **I am your hail mary.**\n\nLet's make some god damn tenders.", "id": "9187g8", "created_utc": 1532361094.0, "score": 193, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "u convinced me, yolo PYPL", "score": 82, "replies": [{"body": "You convinced me to short by saying yolo.
