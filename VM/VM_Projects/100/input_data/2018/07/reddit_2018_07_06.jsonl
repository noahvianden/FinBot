I will give you guys a nuclear DD since I am bored at work.\n\nI say Microsoft over apple (ANY DAY). Is apple bad? No, not by a long shot... its a great company but between the two (at least with the current services and near future projects) I pick Microsoft. Once Apple is WAY more than just iphones, than maybe I will start to balance the scale in likability.\n\nI also like that aside from molesting scandal that took place at microsoft...it was not plagued with financially related scandals(in terms of scale atleast) that would have you bag holding the stock. Apple has already had them many times in the past few years. Which makes it less exciting for a long hold since you have better dip opportunities. Also, people attributed the spectre/meltdown scandal on microsoft when that was on the chipmakers really. In a way, Microsoft was so efficient that they were able to address it before the hardware makers even could.\n\nBut lets dig in. Microsoft caters to children, everyday customer/business professional, all the way up to business enterprises themselves. From video games, to personal computers (affordable and more recently premium), cloud/on premise/internet/hardware services (that compete with all the major techs, better in some ways worse in others). I will list everything I like.\n\n# Personal Computers.\n\nIt's no question that for the longest time to even now, the vast majority of computers are windows. While historically this has been only considered from the software/OS stand point (Windows 7,8,10, etc) but now this has expanded in new ways that I think people should really consider in their DD.\n\n* **Surface Products:** Laptops, 2-in-1s, Tablets, desktop monitors. Overpriced catering to the windows version of premium computer buyers (similar to the mac product line). It is utterly ridiculous what they charge but still offer more than Apple in terms of performance relative to cost. I didn't like the surface that much when they first launched but the Surface laptops that recently came out and the Surface Studio makes me think that, this is just a beginning to a long journey of successful premium consumer goods.\n* **Windows 10:**  Whats so special about an OS you say? ADs! I personally hate this, I work in IT and its super annoying having to deal with this crap when setting up computers and trying to remove all this junk. BUT.... from an investor stand point think about what this means. Everybody thought a few years ago, microsoft is sooo sweet for giving windows 10 for \"Free\" but in reality what they did was, they converted a pay once, own it forever in to... \"you pay us endlessly in small increments that over the years will net us more money.\". Its even worse for those who bought the license because they now paid the same price they would have had for windows 7, only now they are paying endlessly in ads. Look at your start menu or begin typing in Cortana search bar. Both contain paid online suggestions.\n\n# Cloud Business Products/Services.\n\nWhen you think cloud, you probably think amazon (As you should since they utterly dominate this booming technology that is still in its infancy... I am not kidding, the vast majority of businesses still operate with on premise  hardware). So why think about Microsoft in this if they are at second place & miles behind as well. Other than the fact that Microsoft's cloud is growing as a faster rate (in terms of percentage) each quarter and gaining more footing and widening its piece on the cloud chart... it turns out Amazon doing cloud and Microsoft doing cloud are similar in some ways and uniquely different in others, where they are not even competing.\n\n* **Office 365:** This is a very important one that should be thoroughly looked at in your DD as its the tip of the spear for cloud entry for the vast majority of businesses today. And Amazon does not offer a similar product. Microsoft leads in this sub sector of cloud that only really competes with google with its G suite services...but they are as apart as in market share as Amazon is to Microsoft in the larger cloud business scale.... So why is office 365 important you may ask?\n   * First I want to let you know that this is a email service more than just an office suite for businesses that happen to offer office suite and many other products along with it. You could pay less for just exchange (email) or pay more for applications. This is critical because the vast majority of businesses (not using cloud services) around the world use microsoft exchange as their email service on a physical server (Dell, Hp, etc). These physical servers have a retirement period (when the warranty expires, you do NOT want to have a warrantless server unless your a complete idiot and want to play with fire). Now... the last time, the vast majority of companies bought servers to host exchange was about 3-5 years ago (When a major change to windows server OS came out with Windows Server 2012, some took longer to upgrade). So now most of hose servers are all retiring... Retiring before meant paying 10k+ for a server and going through the whole motion again... but retiring now has a new option... move to the cloud and just pay a monthly fee. And this subscrition model from Office 365 is not only cheaper up front but if you do a cost analysis and compare to buying servers... its still cheaper. So why is this important? Office 365 offers a service that says ditch your old servers and get us instead. We will protect your data with million dollars worth of equipment and guarantee uptime you could never imagine setting up on your own.... get rid of the requirement of having to VPN/connect to the office to get your email. Oh and its very simple to use that all of your IT staff that are already used to our servers can engage with it... without feeling alienated/lost. Best of all, its so easy to manage that you can downscale your IT department with less staff.\n   * Now that's just the email part. What about the office suite and other services? Does your company have slack, dropbox and possibility an inventory management tool? Each of which could cost $5-20 PER user/device. Well office 365 covers you on this. Meaning you will save even more money, get 1TB of cloud data storage, have a slacks equivalent called teams that has skype built in (in fact its going to replace Skype for business soon). And this is what they just offer now along with sharepoint, office online and downloadable versions with 100s of apps that be integrated in to them... And in a few years they will offer you even more services.\n   * Office 365 is such a steal and its how my company (IT company that works with many clients) get companies to come to the cloud for the first time. They are all amazed by what it can achieve. If you had bad experience with it, chances are your IT is shit and did a poor implementation (which is true for anything).\n* **Azure:**  This is where Amazon's AWS just wins, no question. These two services compete and yeah there is no hope...so you think. So AWS wins because it came out first (years ahead) and dominated the field when everybody still had their hands up their ass to even do anything. Microsoft shifted its focus and got a cloud engineer as their CEO who is the reason I am even bullish on Microsoft. 2008's Microsoft was utter trash. So remember when I said office 365 is the gateway we and many others are using to open companies that are only on premise to the cloud? Guess what the next logical step is? Going Azure. Sounds crazy until you think about it. On Premise administrators have a choice between using what they are used to (Microsoft servers) or use a completely alien service from Amazon. Both will achieve the same thing (hosting VM, storing data, running applications) but these guys already have office 365 and are doing the next big jump which is hosting VMs on the cloud. Turns out office 365 is built on Azure and they have been using Azure without knowing already (see Azure Active Directory for more info). This is a key point that I feel should not be looked over. Satya was a genius with office 365 being what it is, he knows he couldn't compete with AWS so he slide in Azure without competition (because remember Office 365 services are not offered by Amazon) in companies before they even know it.\n\nEdit: hit a character limit, lol... I will continue on with a reply", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "# Other Services\n\nI don't think many of these will be deserving of being labeled under other for long... truly, but I will mention them here since I am getting lazy. lol.\n\n* **Microsoft Server OS & services:** I am talking about the stuff that was inside your servers at your offices for a long time now.  Not sure how to discuss them from an IT perceptive without just giving a lecture on what they are. You may google windows server and read up on these. They have been here for decades now and are ever evolving tomeet company needs. However on a side note, as an non IT investor, you may not know this but... one thing to realize about services like Amazon's AWS which host computers is that the virtualized computers that run INSIDE AWS's EC2s will still be other application/services. Things like windows, linux, oracle etc. So Microsoft still plays a role within AWS itself.\n* **Linkedin:** These guys overpaid for something that investors weren't happy about and turned it profitable. Now everybody is happy with where it is/headed. It used to just be a social media app for businesses. But now its a legit competitor of [indeed.com](https://indeed.com/) as you can apply for jobs directly inside Linkedin. And more recently they have included educational services. I truly feel they are making this the one stop shop for businesses, from educating the individuals, to connect the people, hiring the people and building a community with business people. They own their own facebook which has no competition... really. I highly doubt we will see businesses protesting against linkedin the way they do with facebook and deactivate their profile.\n* **Attitude towards Linux:** I love this about the new CEO, rather than being Linux's competitor.. they are starting to welcome the Linux community. In fact they offer Microsoft certifications for Linux integration in their database services, offer linux command lines in microsoft's powershell as an option and much more. And the recent purchase of GitHub only solidifies this push to marry Linux and Microsoft more and more. Microsoft is corporatizing linux while also opening it self up to open source. This is big considering how everything has been\n* **GitHub:** Think about what they just bought... a depository/community for the world's largest open source code! This has everything in it. From website, programs, services code, to small scale student and what they wrote, you name it... even the code for bitcoin all these folks make their coins out of. And its a community forum too. They plan to integrate this as an easy to access service in to their products: Azure and Visual Studio. Github has lost quite a few linux users who hate microsoft with a passion. But the younger generation will not care and the scale of GitHub is too large for it to be abandoned over ego. I believe this may turn out in to a linkedin situation. Rather than tackling the corporate they are now tackling coders. Pure specualtion on this one, too early to tell but interesting none the less.\n* **Xbox:** I never would have added this until I realized they are going to the cloud. Imagine gaming handled in the same form as Netflix. Such a crazy idea. You dont need hardware ($400-$700) to play games, Just sign in on your TV and select the game, pair your controller to your TV and Boom... You are playing. And guess who owns their own cloud hosting service? Sony will have to pay (to a company that will generate profit from hosting sony's content) to match the same thing that Microsoft will not have to pay a premium for... just the raw cost for running the service. Either Sony, Nintendo, etc will go with Microsoft's Azure (which I doubt since they compete) or go with AWS. This gives Microsoft a clear advantage in the next video game transition that is coming. And not to mention Microsoft is opening its self up to make their own games more and more (like Sony does). They bought 4 studios and already own minecraft.\n\nBing sucks.", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "Great Bing analysis. 8/8\n\n^(Bing is good for pr0n)", "score": 29, "replies": []}, {"body": "I agreed with everything.

Like I wrote that you glanced over in that post you \"read\", they are leading in some things (enterprise email & office) and not in others. The same is true for all businesses. Whats unique about that?  Surface sales of course are not better than macs but they are a hell of a lot better than last year. Microsoft phones dont really even exist anymore, have you read anything about this company in the past 4 years? And I even said bing sucks right at the end!
