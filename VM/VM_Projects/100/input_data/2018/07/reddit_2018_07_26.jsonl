It went on to recover most of that loss the next day. And that’s a company that had a 200+ P/E ratio,  propped up solely on growth. They missed harder, cut guidance, and only saw half of Facebook’s losses. \n\nI remember saying on this forum that Facebook is the best value in FAANG.

You have a company that basically was telling everyone that they had plenty of levers to pull to continue growth. Now you tell everyone that because of changes you are making, regulation (GDPR) and users growth flattening that may not be the case. \n\n2.  You tell everyone operating margins are going to decline. This is not usually what happens to a growing business. Facebook may have diseconomies of scale. Network grows to be a global behemoth = massive global influence. Influence = regulatory scrutiny = ever increasing overhead for moderation, security and controls, while at the same time to user base has reached maximum capacity (everyone that has fucking internet has facebook.. we are getting there).\n\n3.  The combination of declining revs and squeezed margins = lower EPS across the entire future cash flow timeline (this is a major part of the reason it crashed, people updated their models - much lower EPS growth, FCF would have gone down and I would have applied a higher WACC now that regulation has shown to have a real impact).\n\nSo then the question becomes - how many levers exist to pull revenue out of the existing user base so that it grows quicker than the increased overhead (remember, headcount was up 47% YoY).

I can't be the only one that thought the core FB product was a diluge of garbage ads and content - any incremental improvement should be positive. Valuation is reasonable as well.
