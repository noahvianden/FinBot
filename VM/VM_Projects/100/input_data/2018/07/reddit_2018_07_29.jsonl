You have 100% of your money invested in stocks, 0% in cash. If the market tanks 20%, you \"lose\" 20% of your investment. Not only that, you have no money to deploy to buy some of these stocks which are suddenly on sale.\n\nNow let's rewind, same portfolio total (10,000) but you have 80% of your money in stocks (volatile) and 20% in cash.\n\nThere is a major market crash and the stocks drop 20%. Now you have 8,400 in your portfolio, and your percents are now 76% stocks and 24% cash. However the cash **value** was unaffected. Now you can deploy your 20% cash to the stocks that cut their value. When the market recovers to it's earlier value (in a year or 3), they will recover with those additional shares and you'll have made money.\n\nI personally use this strategy however I keep the \"20% cash\" invested in SPY, wait for Donald Trump to say some stupid shit about Amazon or levy a tariff, then I move the shares from SPY to the individual companies that I invest in. When they recover, I sell them and move back into SPY to keep the 80-20 balance. Basically I expect my underlying stocks to move downward more than the SPY index, so I use the overall movement of SPY (-.4%) to buy a company that is down 4%. When it recovers that 4%, I sell it and buy SPY again. SPY may have swung 1% in that time, but my individual stock swung 4% and I net a profit for myself.\n\nIf you are more conservative or believe a bad market day is coming, I'd say do 60-40 or even 40-60, depending on how you want to insulate yourself from the market.\n\nEdit: also of note, you can reap those sweet sweet SPY dividends if you're crafty. I recently matched the window right and got 200 shares worth of dividends)\n\nEdit 2: As an aside, this is actually how target date retirement funds work. As the retirement date gets closer they change the distribution to be weighted towards more cash and less stocks ie risk.
