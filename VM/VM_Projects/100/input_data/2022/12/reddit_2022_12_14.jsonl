{"title": "Tesla Investors Voice Concern Over Elon Musk‚Äôs Focus on Twitter", "selftext": "The chorus of Tesla Inc. individual investors expressing misgivings that Chief Executive Elon Musk‚Äòs involvement with Twitter Inc. may be to the detriment of the electric-vehicle maker is getting louder, with the car company‚Äôs stock on track for its worst full-year performance.  \n\n‚ÄúThere is no TSLA CEO today,‚Äù Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund LLC, which owns roughly $50 million worth of Tesla, tweeted Monday. \n\nMr. Black voiced frustration after another sharp selloff in Tesla‚Äôs stock Monday. Shares in the world‚Äôs largest car company by market value fell more than 6% in Monday trading after a tumultuous weekend for Mr. Musk on Twitter, including the billionaire taking aim at the company‚Äôs former head of trust and safety; calling for the prosecution of top U.S. government medical adviser Anthony Fauci; and criticizing people who offer their pronouns without being asked.\n\nMr. Black said, ‚ÄúThe market voted today that the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama. Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla‚Äôs brand equity.‚Äù\n\nRoss Gerber, a longtime backer of Tesla, on Monday tweeted a question directed at Tesla‚Äôs board of directors. ‚ÄúWho is running tesla day to day during this critical time for the company,‚Äù Mr. Gerber said. \n\nHe separately tweeted, ‚ÄúThere is nothing wrong at tesla at all. Other than the CEO working at another company, certainly tesla deserves a focused ceo. It would be helpful to know what Elon‚Äôs plans are.‚Äù\n\nMr. Musk, at a trial about his Tesla compensation package last month, said he had been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter, which he acquired for $44 billion. ‚ÄúI expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,‚Äù he testified. \n\nTesla shares are down 54.31% this year through Tuesday‚Äôs close, putting it on pace for their worst year on record. The only other year where the shares fell was in 2016, when Tesla‚Äôs stock ended down 10.97%. The Nasdaq, which advanced Tuesday, has fallen around 28% this year.\n\nTesla shares closed down 4.09% Tuesday, the day Mr. Musk ceded the unofficial title to European mogul Bernard Arnault for the world‚Äôs wealthiest individual, according to Bloomberg, which publishes a ranking of the richest people.\n\nMr. Musk‚Äôs takeover of Twitter has raised anxiety among Tesla backers for months. Several urged the Tesla CEO to abandon the deal and focus on the car maker, when shares were already down around 30%. The stock has declined further in ensuing months amid growing recession concerns and cost pressure from high inflation. Tesla also has scaled back vehicle delivery plans. Tesla‚Äôs stock has fallen about 28% since the Twitter deal closed in late October through Tuesday, when it ended trading at its lowest level in more than two years.\n\nThe Tesla boss on Tuesday tweeted: ‚ÄúTesla will be great long-term, but doesn‚Äôt control macroeconomic tides.‚Äù He later added ‚ÄúI will make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term,‚Äù but didn‚Äôt offer details.\n\nTesla didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk last week said he continues to work on Tesla as well as SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. ‚ÄúI continue to oversee both Tesla & SpaceX, but the teams there are so good that often little is needed from me,‚Äù he tweeted Saturday.\n\nBill Nelson, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration‚Äôs administrator, said Sunday that he had asked SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell if Mr. Musk‚Äôs purchase of the social-media platform would divert from the rocket company‚Äôs mission. Mr. Nelson said he was given assurance that wouldn‚Äôt be the case.\n\nLeo KoGuan, a self-proclaimed Tesla investor, last week tweeted: ‚ÄúTesla board is missing in action‚Äù and called on the company to initiate a share buyback. Mr. Black also has been urging the company to pursue a $10 billion share repurchase. \n\nMr. Musk in October said Tesla could pursue a $5 billion to $10 billion share buyback and said some meaningful buyback was likely. The company had discussed such a share repurchase at the board level, but at the time hadn‚Äôt signed off on it. Mr. Musk has sold more than $19 billion in Tesla stock this year, including almost $4 billion in November to help finance Twitter. \n\nTesla‚Äôs brand image has taken a hit in recent months, according to market surveys. Self-identifying Democrats in particular have soured on the car maker since Mr. Musk bought Twitter, according to data from research firm Morning Consult. \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-investors-voice-concern-over-elon-musks-focus-on-twitter-11670948786?mod=hp_lead_pos7", "id": "zlf435", "created_utc": 1670985601.0, "score": 1648, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 487, "comments": [{"body": "Loose cannon CEO does loose cannon shit.

You can't possibly \"price in\" a recession before it happens and then price in the recovery (bull run) before it even starts. That's because a recession has various magnitudes.

How can you \"price in\" a recession without knowing the severity, and how can you know severity without even entering into one yet.\n\nWhat the market has done when Sp500 touched 3500 was price in a high weighted probability of a mild recession (around 65% chance). If you assume SP500 will decline to around 3200 for a mild recession, pump to around 4200 for no recession (flat earnings growth YoY), give recession 65% probability and no recession 35% probability, you'll get around 3400-3600 level. The 65% and 35% are consistent with economists forecast as of right now. Of course the recession isn't guaranteed, so everything is weighted right now. However, at 4000 level, SP500 has almost completely priced out a recession probability and almost fully priced in a soft landing, especially after the last 2 CPI prints. If it turns out to be true next year, then sure 3500 was the low (consistent with typical bear markets without recession having draw down of around 25-28%. That decline is where the market wrongly prices in probability of a recession). If we end up going into a mild recession, we'll make new lows at around 3200. If we end up going into a deep recession (which again we won't know until we at least enter one), SP500 can easily go below 3000. Discovering the recession severity takes time as we progress through the recession.\n\nOf course market typically looks forward about 6 months, so by the time we've confirmed we did enter a deep recession, market's already looking towards the recovery.

{"title": "Fed raises interest rates half a point to highest level in 15 years", "selftext": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raises its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 15 years, indicating that the fight against inflation is not over yet despite some promising signs lately.\n\nKeeping with expectations, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted to boost the overnight borrowing rate half a percentage point, taking it to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5%. The increase broke a string of four straight three-quarter point hikes, the most aggressive policy moves since the early 1980s. \n\nAlong with the increase came an indication that officials expect to keep rates higher through next year, with no reductions until 2024. The expected ‚Äúterminal rate,‚Äù or point where officials expect to end the rate hikes, was put at 5.1%, according to the FOMC‚Äôs ‚Äúdot plot‚Äù of individual members‚Äô expectations. \n\nThe new level marks the highest the fed funds rate has been since December 2007, just ahead of the global financial crisis and as the Fed was loosening policy aggressively to combat what would turn into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. \n\nThis time around, the Fed is raising rates into what is expected to be a moribund economy in 2023. \n\nMembers penciled in increases for the funds rate until it hits a median level of 5.1% next year, equivalent to a target range of 5%-5.25. At that point, officials are likely to pause to allow the impact of the monetary policy tightening make its way through the economy. \n\nThe consensus then pointed to a full percentage point worth of rate cuts in 2024, taking the funds rate to 4.1% by the end of that year. That is followed by another percentage point of cuts in 2025 to a rate of 3.1%, before the benchmark settles into a longer-run neutral level of 2.5%. \n\nHowever, there was a fairly wide dispersion in the outlook for future years, indicating that members are uncertain about what is ahead for an economy dealing with the worst inflation it has seen since the early 1980s. \n\nThe newest dot plot featured multiple members seeing rates heading considerably higher than the median point for 2023 and 2024. For 2023, seven of the 19 committee members ‚Äì voters and nonvoters included ‚Äì saw rates rising above 5.25%. Similarly, there were seven members who saw rates higher than the median 4.1% in 2024.\n\nThe FOMC policy statement, approved unanimously, was virtually unchanged from November‚Äôs meeting. Some observers had expected the Fed to alter language that it sees ‚Äúongoing increases‚Äù ahead to something less committal, but that phrase remained in the statement.\n\nFed officials believe raising rates helps take money out the economy, reducing demand and ultimately pulling prices lower after inflation spiked to its highest level in more than 40 years.\n\nThe FOMC lowered its growth targets for 2023, putting expected GDP gains at just 0.5%, barely above what would be considered a recession. The GDP outlook for this year also was put at 0.5%. In the September projections, the committee expected 0.2% growth this year and 1.2% next.\n\nThe committee also raised its median anticipation of its favored core inflation measure to 4.8%, up 0.3 percentage points from the September outlook. Members slightly lowered their unemployment rate outlook for this year and bumped it a bit higher for the ensuing years.\n\nThe rate hike follows consecutive reports showing progress in the inflation fight.\n\nThe Labor Department reported Tuesday that the consumer price index rose just 0.1% in November, a smaller increase than expected as the 12-month rate dropped to 7.1%. Excluding food and energy, the core CPI rate was at 6%. Both measures were the lowest since December 2021. A level the Fed puts more weight on, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, fell to a 5% annual rate in October.\n\nHowever, all of those readings remain well above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target. Officials have stressed the need to see consistent declines in inflation and have warned against relying too much on trends over just a few months.\n\nCentral bankers still feel they have leeway to raise rates, as hiring remains strong and consumers, who drive about two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, are continuing to spend.\n\nNonfarm payrolls grew by a faster than expected 263,000 in November, while the Atlanta Fed is tracking GDP growth of 3.2% for the fourth quarter. Retail sales grew 1.3% in October and were up 8.3% on an annual basis, indicating that consumers so far are weathering the inflation storm.\n\nInflation came about from a convergence of at least three factors: Outsized demand for goods during the pandemic that created severe supply chain issues, Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine that coincided with a spike in energy prices, and trillions in monetary and fiscal stimulus that created a glut of dollars looking for a place to go.\n\nAfter spending much of 2021 dismissing the price increases as ‚Äútransitory,‚Äù the Fed started raising interest rates in March of this year, first tentatively and then more aggressively, with the previous four increases in 0.75 percentage point increments. Prior to this year, the Fed had not raised rates more than a quarter point at a time in 22 years.\n\nThe Fed also has been engaged in ‚Äúquantitative tightening,‚Äù a process in which it is allowing proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off its balance sheet each month rather than reinvesting them.\n\nA capped total of $95 billion is being allowed to run off each month, resulting in a $332 billion decline in the balance sheet since early June. The balance sheet now stands at $8.63 trillion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/fed-rate-decision-december-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/fed-rate-decision-december-2022.html)", "id": "zlzaim", "created_utc": 1671044583.0, "score": 691, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 173, "comments": [{"body": "Jerome Powell has the coolest job in the world.\n\nOnce a month he comes out and says \"fuck your stocks and fuck your jobs,\" and everyone freaks out.

May one kind grave unite each hapless name, And graft my love immortal on thy fame! Then, ages hence, when all my woes are o'er, When this rebellious heart shall beat no more; If ever chance two wand'ring lovers brings To Paraclete's white walls and silver springs, O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads, And drink the falling tears each other sheds; Then sadly say, with mutual pity mov'd, \"Oh may we never love as these have lov'd!\" From the full choir when loud Hosannas rise, And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice, Amid that scene if some relenting eye Glance on the stone where our cold relics lie, Devotion's self shall steal a thought from Heav'n, One human tear shall drop and be forgiv'n. And sure, if fate some future bard shall join In sad similitude of griefs to mine, Condemn'd whole years in absence to deplore, And image charms he must behold no more; Such if there be, who loves so long, so well; Let him our sad, our tender story tell; The well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost; He best can paint 'em, who shall feel 'em most.To dream once more I close my willing eyes; Ye soft illusions, dear deceits, arise!
