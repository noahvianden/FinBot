Everyone, even people in villages now have access to smart phones thanks to Chinese companies. TikTok is banned in India so everyone is on Instagram or Fb. People in India exclusively use WhatsApp to communicate. They just video call each other all the time. Data is insanely cheap in India. Basically everyone gets unlimited 1-2 GB per day with whatever phone plan they get. WhatsApp business in India is expanding, you can book tickets and such using WhatsApp. Indian youth is using instagram reels like the rest of the world uses TikTok. Google pay and other digital payments are also on the rise, which means Fb/insta ads are gonna get converted to people buying things online.

As a FAANG person, I can confirm Meta has lost its luster with the most important customer, advertisers in the US and EMEA. Meta’s dual marketplace powered by end users and advertisers hit major snags from globally regulatory and tech changes. Regulatory changes limit Meta’s ability to track consumers which impact performance marketing – Meta’s primary revenue source. Tech changes powered by Apple AppTrackingTransparency do the same at the device level. \n\nIn addition the youth demos are adopting other social or communication platforms like Discord, Twitch, Reddit, TikTok etc. People have a limit of waking hours where to spend their time and Meta’s products, while maintaining MAUs, are losing screen share. \n\nThese trends point to an uphill battle for Meta. Also, no social network has proven unbeatable if you look back. Meta can pivot, innovate, and win back advertisers, but they have major headwinds.\n\nEdit: For folks unfamiliar with Meta’s advertiser proposition, they claim that advertising on Meta platforms can increase awareness or sales of products and services. However, the latest privacy changes directly prohibit much of the omnipresent tracking Meta used to bolster its advertising performance. Apple made significant changes over the last 3 years to improve privacy on its devices as it relates to apps. Google will follow suit in the next two years further limiting Meta’s advertising capabilities. \n\nMeta investors believe that Meta will find solutions to their advertising challenges and exceed the revenue targets compared to the previous 3-5 years **or** innovate faster than Google or Amazon on the ads front. There is a small possibility that Meta’s meta verse investment pays off and users adopt Meta hardware and not Apple’s hardware. You can dwell on that one based on consumer sentiment today.

{"title": "Tesla will be the Myspace of the EV market. Tesla Semi will not change that, just like Myspace music did not save Myspace.", "selftext": "TL:DR - Tesla is only #1 in EV because they were first. Their market share will only decrease from here, Tesla Semi will not change that, in 5 years they will not even be a top 5 EV manufacturer.\n\nTesla created the EV market, no one can deny that. Companies become market makers by creating and cornering a market before there is real competition, then staying ahead of the newcomers.\n\nNew companies try to create new markets all the time. Few are successful. Even fewer create truly NEW markets, most are just iterations past old norms. EV vehicles are not a new market, they are an iteration on the norms of the consumer vehicle market. This means Tesla not only has to defend against newcomers to the consumer electric vehicle space, but they have to compete against very successful consumer vehicle manufacturers altering their established brands in EV's.\n\nThe F-150 is best selling truck, for decades, period. In the USA trucks have an exceptionally loyal customer base, and oversized market share. What Loyal Ford or Chevy owner would choose the cyber truck over the Lightning or Silverado EV? Its rhetorical moron, everyone knows there is not enough to be statistically relevant.\n\nTesla is only #1 in the EV space because they created that market and have not yet had to face real world competition. During that time they have failed to establish a market cornering brand. Right now Ford, Chevrolet, and Hyundai/Kia are all competing to be #2 in the EV market had have openly stated their intention to be #1 in the EV space in the next 5 years or so.\n\nBefore trying to mumble something about \"Tesla's innovation\" around Elon's dick, stop and think about this example. When Toyota entered the truck market they created a new \"small truck\" market. The overwhelming success of the Toyota truck that was eventually named the Tacoma launched them to success in the truck market. Nissan and other imports jumped on the small truck market, but the Nissan offering never hit it big in that space, Why? Because Ford launched the Ranger and Chevrolet the S10 and quickly claimed the #2 and #3 spots. Toyota is still a dominant player in \"small trucks\", but only barely and never managed to corner that market, and they were already a reputable and trusted car brand when they created that marked. Toyota is only dominant in the \"small\" truck space, their larger truck offerings cant come close to the F-150 or Silverado. Tesla was not a reputable or trusted manufacturer when they created this market, and I would argue still are not reputable or trustworthy. Look at Elon, he wasted $44 billion buying a social media company, just so he can ruin his reputation faster than he was by just being a social media user, how does that inspire trust in the brand?!?\n\nTesla Semi is not their savior, it is proof they are the Myspace of the social media world. Tesla created a market where no one thought one would exist (or so oil propaganda had everyone convinced), but now that the value behind the market has been established, how can Tesla out compete Ford or Toyota? All of Tesla's profitable models are in the \"luxury\" space where the margins are higher. Tesla is struggling to produce their still very expensive economy\" model 3, which can not compete against true \"economy\" EV's like the Leaf. Eventually Mercedes EV's will be preferred in the luxury EV space and the model 3 will never be able to compete with a Civic EV or Corolla EV. I am planning to buy an EV in 2024 and if there is a Civic EV, the Model 3 would have to have equal quality, and a LOWER price to even be considered, and would still also have to compete with Leaf etc. Why? Because Nissan entered the EV market years after Tesla, yet their very first EV, offered 2014, still sets a standard for quality/reliability in the EV space that Tesla can not equal even in 2021.\n\nI am not a trader or quant and this is not meant to be investment advice.

Russia)\n\nThe PLA has absolutely NO naval battle experience as opposed to Taiwanese forces who train with US admirals, generals, and officers **for decades** (green berets in particular are close instructors with Taiwanese forces). \n\nSpeaking of which on China’s navy, they are children coming into the world with a newly established fleet of boats. (Which seemingly their whole fleet is **nothing compared to just one US super carrier**) You have to train your officers in naval battle procedure to properly ensure working functional sea and amphibious warfare. The PLA *have to cultivate* naval Admirals or Generals to which again, they lack experience. Which is another reason why they haven’t attempted to attack Taiwan for over 50 years.\n\nTry to use unbiased deduction here, logically speaking it’s just a hard sell that the Chinese will be able to attack let alone win in this situation. If they try it, they’ll lose a lot of people and frankly war costs money. The Chinese are a bit cash-strapped at the moment.

The Saudis have all the leverage meanwhile China does not. \n\nIt’s more of a gesture of passive aggressiveness against the US.

Same general concept as tax withholdings on your W2.\n\nBasic example: You have 50 shares at $10/share  ($500 value) and you owe 20% taxes on these shares at vesting. Instead of paying $100, you can instead choose to withhold 10 shares and they give you the 40 remaining shares in a brokerage account. At this point, you can choose to sell them or hold them. \n\nIf there is a delta on the taxes withheld at vesting and the actual amount owed upon selling, I’d imagine that you would have to settle that come tax time. So if you sold the 40 shares at $20/share, your total gain would be $900 (10 @ $10, 40 @ $20).
