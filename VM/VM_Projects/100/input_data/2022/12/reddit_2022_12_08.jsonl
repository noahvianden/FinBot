Just look at delivery numbers and profits. \n\nLast time the truck segment yes, and a huge upset for sure. But let’s be fair here, no one has actually used their lead as an advantage. Less than 15k lightnings made, less than 20k Rivian, GM might as well not be making the hummer I think it’s less than 5k total still..? It’s not like anyone has actually done anything yet or ran away with it. That’s not saying tesla will come out of the gate like they normally do, the cybertruck is a completely different beast and was designed to be mass produced as fast and cheap as possible. Because of this, it’s manufacturing process and tooling is completely new and is likely to have lots of kinks. So we’ll see where these truck numbers are at by the time CT starts up, but I believe they’ll all still be well below 50k annual rate. \n\nAlso worth noting the truck market is only large in North America, it’s basically non existent in China and Europe.\n\nAlso, just because it’s a “flagship” doesn’t mean anything. If you look at tesla sales almost non of it is from S and X it’s all 3 and Y. And eventually will be CT and “cheap model 3” next. \n\nYour argument for people buying others over tesla is perfectly fine and accurate, but your reasoning as to what will happen is not. The market is huge and can carry multiple companies to 10s of millions in deliveries. Tesla does not need to be making all the vehicles as long as they keep growth and margins at a reasonable place. Growth is teslas crutch, as soon as tesla stops growing it’s gone.\n\nIn my model I see tesla slowing growth down in vehicle deliveries over the next few years, margins will follow (car business). But I still believe margins will be above the average 8% due to their obvious production advantages. While this happens their energy business will be hitting a turning point, it’s already happening now. Last Q they reported 60% growth, they are no longer cell constraint so this growth will continue and they opened a new megapack factory that 10x current capacity. 4680 cells are getting closer to final stage, everything is lining up for energy.
