Significant resistance levels built up at strikes $125 and $130 (image 3)\n4. 100K and 120K stocks pegged to hedges at strikes $125 and $130 respectively. As expiration gets closer and these strikes become less profitable, the contracts are closed and the hedges are released which further deflates the price of the underlying. (image 4)\n5.

Earnings will probably be flat, not just because there is a slowdown, but because inflation will keep nominal earnings somewhat high, if only because the US has actually been a beneficiary of higher energy prices as it is an exporter. That means earnings of 220 next year is likely. 2022 earnings are also around 220.\n\nWhat about valuations? It's all about the risk free rate, with interest rates at 5%, that means a 15 P/E, but there are some caveats. How long will it stay at 5%? Will the 10 yr be as high? What is the makeup of the S&P? The answer to those 3 questions will have a huge effect on where valuations will be. If the case is that 5% but temporary (as inflation falls back quickly), the 10 yr doesn't go higher or stay above 4% (risk-free will actually still be low), and base valuation of the S&P has shifted higher because of mega-cap tech, then a P/E of 17 to 18 is fair. When you do the math, that's 220*17=3740, just about where we are now.\n\nHowever, as we get through 2023, investors won't really be thinking about 2022's inflation, or even the recession (if and when it happens). They will be looking at the Fed lowering interest rates in the face of higher unemployment (if and when it happens) and a recovery into 2024. The end of 2023 won't be earnings and valuations based on past 12 months of 2023, but what investors see 2024 will be like. If interest rates go down to 4%, the 10 yr around 3.5%, and earnings growth of 10% into 2024 , then S&P fair value would be 245*18=4410. Every day that goes by in 2023, whether a recession is happening or not, valuations will increasingly reflect what investors think will happen if the Fed lowers rates and there is actual growth in 2024, end of 2023 will increasingly reflect expectations for end of 2024.\n\nIt will depend a lot on inflation and where it goes, but a range around 3740-4410 and plus minus 5% depending on sentiment is my prediction for 2023, I think that's the most likely scenario, but it could be worse (if inflation reaccelerates and 5% terminal isn't high enough), or it could be better (war is resolved as Russia is exhausted and Chinese demand props up earnings and lowers dollar). \n\nIt's also useful to note that even as the market stays in a range, individual stocks can move much more and completely differently. An example is something like XBI, an entire index of no earnings biotech, completely crushed, but even as the S&P made new lows in October, XBI went nowhere near its lows. XBI's value is almost entirely dependent on interest rates and as you see the market pricing in peak rates, XBI has bottomed. This will happen to many stocks where they bottom way before the market does, so there are great opportunities out there even if you are bearish on the market.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Sir… This is a Wendy’s", "score": 14, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "2022 losers will be 2023 winners", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "$TSLA?

Going into 2022 I still believed strongly in the transitory inflation narrative and thought most of the rate concerns would have played out by the second quarter.\n\nMy view changed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and then continued to change after seeing consistently high inflation prints throughout the year. But at the risk of being wrong again I think that 2023 will likely see an end to the rate and inflation fears, but I think we'll see some panic before that happens.\n\nI still believe that inflation will ultimately be proven transitory, but I massively underestimated how strong corporate and consumer balance sheets were going into 2022, which seem to have provided a large buffer for higher rates. But in contrast to late 2021, we're now seeing record low personal savings rates and completely unaffordable mortgages globally, and this in my view will almost guarantee a sharp decline in house prices in 2023. I'm not predicting a GFC style panic, but there will be clear signs of distress across the economy as house prices fall given the size of the real estate market and its importance to consumer sentiment.\n\nI think on the corporate side we're also going to see some blow-ups of over-leveraged companies in 2023. First that will be companies like PTON and CVNA, but slowly that's going to expand to a general concern for any leveraged company vulnerable to the consumer slowdown that's beginning to play out. Eventually one or two big players will look like they could be the verge of blowing up and this coupled with inflation clearly dropping rapidly will probably force a reluctant but minor pivot from the Fed in late Q2.\n\nI think during this time the NASDAQ will fall slightly below pre-Covid levels fuelled primarily by concerns that AAPL \"is dead\" as consumers pull back on high cost items like MacBooks and iPhones. This narrative will be pushed by CNBC commenters who are literally brain dead, along with more idiotic claims that companies like AMZN, GOOG, TSLA and META are also \"dead\", \"dying\" or \"over-owned\".\n\nBy Q3 we'll clearly be in a recession and the Fed will be sounding much more dovish despite rates still being fairly high. I think despite the Fed starting to cut rates the market will struggle to rebound from fear of inflation returning and an opinion that the Fed isn't cutting aggressively enough to support the economy as the recession is deepening.\n\nBy Q4 Jim Cramer will be claiming that the economic situation is as bad as the GFC and that investors should be selling everything. From this point on he will only recommend the stocks of CEOs that go on Mad Money. This bearish sentiment will then be followed by a surprise Santa Clause rally at the end of the year which will be incorrectly be labelled a bear-market rally. As YoY inflation nears 2% the Fed will surprise everyone by cutting rates to zero in Jan / Feb of 2024 fuelling a decent recovery in tech, but still short of ATHs. Other areas of the market will stop declining, but see less of a rally.\n\nTo summarise, I tend to think interest rates will trend back down to post-GFC levels over the next couple of years and that the recession in 2023 will be look far more ugly by mid-2023 than people are currently expecting. But my guess is that we probably won't see a GFC style event, because I think central bankers will eventually be forced to pivot quite dramatically as inflation continues to fall.

And if you the defense industry, Microsoft has a very tight relationship there, but that hold is starting to break. \n\nI’m rooting for MST and Googl because they’re growth factors for each respective company, and frankly GCP is fantastic for smaller businesses, but I Hope MST pushes to be more competitive and agile with how they develop for Azure because right now they are very far behind in terms of actual features compared to AWS", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "AWS is gaining enterprise marketshare as well.

Sales of VR headsets in the U.S. this year declined 2% from a year earlier to $1.1 billion as of early December, according to data shared with CNBC by research firm NPD Group. Facebook’s advertising business generates that much revenue about every three days. With the ad business mired in a slump, Zuckerberg has been looking to VR devices and related technology to pull Meta into the future. But data from analyst firm CCS Insight reveals that worldwide shipments of VR headsets as well as augmented reality devices dropped more than 12% year over year to 9.6 million in 2022.\n\nTaken together, the estimates of VR headset sales and shipments create a problematic picture for Meta, whose stock price has lost about two-thirds of its value this year. Zuckerberg has said he’s playing the long game with the metaverse, expecting it take up to a decade to go mainstream and projecting it will eventually host hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce. The Quest 2 has been around for a few years and, like any consumer electronics device, has lost some appeal as it’s aged. And while Meta released a new VR headset in fall, the Quest Pro, that device is geared toward businesses and costs $1,100 more than the Quest 2, pushing it even further out of reach for many VR enthusiasts.\n\nMeta decided over the summer to raise the price of the Quest 2 by $100, citing inflationary pressures. Leo Gebbie, an analyst at CCS Insight, said in an email that Meta’s price increase was a surprise “given that the company has been willing to sell the headset at such a low margin to try and drive uptake of VR and gain a high market share.”", "id": "zxl7up", "created_utc": 1672262081.0, "score": 440, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 258, "comments": [{"body": "Not super surprising sales are down.

This is agnostic of Elmo entirely.  It's just believed that the price of the stock is WAY too high. Most of this comes from it's battery technology and some from it's EV.  It was going to get a significant pull back at some point, we just didn't know when/how much (pretty common)\n\nElmo himself is an entity for sure. His persona and characture have really carried the stock a LONG time. This has really carried the stock a long time. Issue is, his exaggerated behavior may have gone outside the margins. His exposure to Twitter has left him vulnerable. Other entities are making gains in ev markets. As a whole there's not a lot propping up the stock ATM. It's missing on deliverables as well. \n\nThe pre-covid timeframe really has it at a relative mid-60s/70s stock price. I'm not sure it's as low as 60s long term. But we could very well see 70s. Unless there's a drastic positive catalyst I don't think we see 150s at all. Based on our current information we just don't have any reason to believe there's a significant positive catalyst. \n\nNow, the internal org structure of TSLA could affect price to a degree but I think it'd be short term at best. TSLA does its best when Elmo is boastful and brash about the product. TSLA does its worse when someone is unable to take Elmo's hand off the tweet button. This mimics a lot of what we actually saw with regards to the last POTUS.  How many times did people just want the man to stop tweeting? \n\nHere's another major issue.. whether he's truly left or right leaning doesn't matter. He's espousing right leaning discourse. This is fine for his fan base, they probably don't objectively care **too** much. However, anyone left/mid does. Meanwhile right leaning individuals love it. All this culminates in... Who buys EVs as a demographic more? Right leaning conservatives or left leaning liberals? It's probably not the diesel driving 4wd flags on their trucks crowd. So the more he opens his mouth the more negative attention he drives towards his TSLA brand. \n\nAll that is micro look to TSLA but also be aware the price pushed up in the pandemic timeframe. We're post-pandemic and potentially pre-recessive.  Markets take that impact in very large bearish swings, aka stock prices drop considerably. This is just more reason to avoid thinking it's going back to 150s. \n\nNext, do we think it WILL (re: will not can) fall further? We just don't know... There's a bottom but wtf is it? There's no structure or catalysts to really give an indication. \n\nTldr; there's no significant reason to believe it'll increase. There's no true lasting support and no positive catalyst. There's no reason reason to believe it's destined to decrease.

It is fundamentally impossible for that to be good for profit. Especially when your cars rely on proprietary infrastructure that you built up around your primary customer base. He's not only torched the stock value, but he's also made the built out infrastructure less valuable because it's now inconvenient for the new audience he's attracting, on top of being less likely to be used in the future by the people he's increasingly alienating. \n\nWhat he's effectively done is trade profit for meme-making. Which isn't a sound business model on a fundamental level. None of this has been helped by his Twitter antics in which, among other things, he threatened to name and shame companies who stopped doing business with Twitter. If I was a big investor, I'd question whether or not I'd be next on the list should I decide to drop any of Musk's other companies. Especially seeing as how Musk is mainly reported on as being a darling of the alt-right, which, whether you like it or not, has a reputation of extremism and violence.\n\nAnd the longer this goes on, the more damage he's going to do.

{"title": "The Return of Blackberry (BB) - $15.92+/share (2024)", "selftext": "I believe there is a lot of potential in Blackberry (BB).  I'm not a WSBer, but all the investing subs have blocked my posts because BB was caught up in the meme stocks, so WSB is the only place left.  This post focuses on a new product called **Blackberry Ivy**, launched in partnership with Amazon AWS.\n\nIf you haven’t been following BB, they no longer make phones and have transitioned to software. Their two main plays are cybersecurity and IoT, with a specific focus on QNX, a real-time operating system currently installed in 215M+ vehicles on the road.  While cybersecurity has been disappointing, QNX has been steady and shows promise.  QNX is used by 24 of the top 25 electric vehicle manufacturers (only missing Tesla) and medical/industrial equipment.  You will see articles saying QNX is being ditched for Android Automotive, but this is just for infotainment.  QNX is still in these cars for safety-critical systems and runs below Android Automotive.  To use a crude analogy, Android Automotive is like Chrome and QNX is Windows.  However, this post is on a new product, called **Blackberry Ivy**, which has no known competitor and is first-to-market.\n\n**What is Blackberry Ivy?**\n\nIvy is an auto software product that processes and standardizes sensor data both in the car and in the cloud. It allows for applications do be built more efficiently in cars and, in my opinion, will transform the auto apps market just like Apple app store or Android/Google Play did to phone apps.\n\nTo give just one example of what Ivy could do, imagine being a third-party app developer who wants to build an app for the auto market that recognizes when a vehicle occupant has fallen asleep, so the vehicle environment can be adjusted for a more enjoyable ride (e.g. The app would turn off air conditioning near that person, turn off volume from closest speaker, etc.). The way to determine if an occupant has fallen asleep is by using data from an inward-facing camera.  However, the auto manufacturer would never grant access to raw camera data to a third-party app developer. This is where Ivy comes in. Ivy standardizes the outputs, so you do not need the raw data. The data from the camera is sent to Ivy, where it is processed to standard outputs  (e.g. Driver = awake, Front-Passenger = awake, Rear-Right-Passenger =  asleep, etc.). The app uses these standardized outputs to create some action in the vehicle without ever seeing the actual video feed.\n\nAn app created with Ivy can then be used with any auto manufacturer using Ivy software, creating a  much larger app market.  A developer no longer has to make separate apps for Ford and BMW vehicles systems, he can just build his app with Ivy and that will work on any car using Ivy.  (Think how cell phones used to each create their own apps, until Android allowed them to share a common marketplace).  This is especially important for niche apps that already struggle to find a market.\n\nThe previous example is just a single example. There are numerous use-cases that can be described for vehicle payment systems, insurance, car maintenance, etc. with many of these already in the works. There is also tremendous potential for a consumer-focused or novelty app marketplace.  For example, Spotify could make a feature in their app that identifies the occupants and their music preferences, so the vehicle only plays songs that the most number of occupants would enjoy. That way someone who loves country music will not have to suffer through a rap playlist (e.g. In-ward facing camera sends video data to Ivy, Ivy outputs: Occupant ID: 30432493, Occupant ID: 34824492 are sent to the Spotify app, which uses an algorithm to cross-reference these IDs with playlists and finds songs both occupants would enjoy.  Spotify never has to see the raw camera data, yet it gives them a great feature for their app.  The car manufacturer benefits because they can create a better driving experience without having to spend a lot of money developing niche apps). This, of course, assumes some level of permission has been given by the occupants to be identified.\n\n**What is Blackberry Ivy worth in revenue?**\n\nBB's SAM estimate of $800M for Ivy in 2024 suggests Ivy could be worth up to $36.36/car/year (based on \\~20M QNX vehicles and \\~2M Tesla vehicles being produced in 2024).  I encourage you to do your own calculation.  Let's say Ivy is worth $10/car/year (with BB getting a 50% cut for $5/car/year).  Multiply $5/car/year by how many cars you think may adopt Ivy and be on the road for any given year (remember, BB QNX is currently installed into \\~20M new cars each year, with the EV market set to grow).\n\nIf all 215M+ cars that currently run on QNX had Ivy, that would produce $1B in revenue each year.  I  believe Ivy will eventually bring in $1B/year for BB, the question is will it take 5 year or 10 years to get there.  Keep in mind, BB’s total revenue for FY 2022 (essentially calendar year 2021) was $718M, so this  would be a significant jump in revenue.\n\nBB's SAM disclosure for Ivy can be found here @ 24:17 (Note: FY 2025 for BB is essentially calendar year 2024): [https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700](https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700)\n\n**What would this do to the stock price?**\n\nBB would now be valued more like a high growth stock. BB currently has a P/S ratio of 3.1. High growth stocks like Crowdstrike (11.6), Cloudflare (16.4), Datadog (15.0), and ZScaler (12.7) all have much higher P/S ratios. If BB were to be valued similar to these companies (e.g. P/S ratio of 15) that would put the stock price at $15.92/share just for 2024. **This target stock price does not take into account any future revenue from Ivy, only BB being valued more like a growth stock based on current revenue.**\n\n**Will Blackberry Ivy actually be adopted by auto manufacturers?**\n\nThere have been a number of recent indicators suggesting Ivy will be adopted by auto manufacturers.   Ivy is a 50/50 partnership with Amazon, but it is only in the last couple of months that Amazon AWS engineers have become more vocal about Ivy.  Sure, Amazon is involved in many ventures, but this seems different.  Ivy was featured a number of times at Amazon's re:Invent 2022 conference just a few weeks ago.  Amazon's general manager of automotive name-dropped Blackberry Ivy during a  presentation and that presentation had two other speakers: a senior vice president from Stellantis, who spoke about how Stellantis (which owns  Dodge/Fiat/Chrysler/Jeep/Opel/Peugeot/Ram/Vauxhall) is transitioning to a software-defined vehicle, and Amazon's general manager of automotive   technology, who discussed BB's QNX operating system and how Amazon was bringing it to the cloud.  Here is the presentation (Ivy name-drop after 13:00): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI)\n\nThe inclusion of Stellantis in a presentation discussing BB Ivy and BB QNX is notable.  When the first live demo of Ivy was presented at Bosch ConnectedWorld 2022 in November, the vehicle used in the demo was a Peugeot, a brand owned by Stellantis (Bosch, a leading supplier for automotive, is also partnering with Ivy).  At the earnings call last week, BB announced they will be demoing Ivy at CES 2023 in a Jeep Cherokee, another brand owned by Stellantis.\n\n[Ivy live demo at Bosch ConnectedWorld in November](https://preview.redd.it/ldum9emvwn8a1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=519417edfdb6e37f082ad1f47fafde651d810e44)\n\nBB announced they hope to have the first design win for Ivy by CES on Jan 5-8 and I expect Stellantis will be the first manufacturer to sign-on to Ivy (If it's not announced at CES, the next bet would be the earnings call in March).  Stellantis' CEO will also deliver a keynote at CES.\n\nRe:Invent also featured another presentation on Blackberry Ivy being run by representatives from Amazon and Bosch.  That presentation was shared by two BMW engineers discussing machine learning.  One of Ivy's selling points is to better allow for machine learning models to be applied to   the data generated by the car sensors.  BMW also recently signed deals with Amazon AWS and already uses BB QNX.  Here is the presentation:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E)\n\nIt's an interesting coincidence that Stellantis and BMW are in presentations that discuss/mention BB Ivy, as well as doing public demos in Stellantis vehicles.\n\nThe AWS/Bosch presentation on Ivy had a very interesting slide showing companies that are already partnering with Ivy and showing some potential use-cases for Ivy:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f0o8xzuzwn8a1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c94d6b3741ce24375f0bc3c6a4ed5790035bb9a\n\nNotice TomTom is mentioned for location-based services.  TomTom recently announced a collaboration with Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft to create a new open map data system known as Overture Maps Foundation to counter Google Maps' dominance.  Does TomTom plan to send their own version of a Google Street View car around the world?  No.  It appears that TomTom plans to leverage the data already being collected by software-defined vehicles on the road.  How can TomTom use data from different auto manufacturers, each with their own systems?  Ivy standardizes it.  TomTom can then use the improved maps to service consumers.  Auto manufacturers bring in additional revenue selling the data collected from the vehicles and consumers get greatly improved mapping services.  Everyone wins.  And it is Ivy that facilitates this.  (Credit to [u/snoutandtruffle](https://www.reddit.com/u/snoutandtruffle/) for bringing TomTom to my attention.  I recommend reading every one of his posts about Ivy as he is the best at spotting new info, IMHO).\n\nBlackberry Ivy is also agnostic, meaning manufacturers don't have to use Amazon AWS cloud or BB QNX in order to use Ivy.  This gives them complete control over the data.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nI'm not here to pump and dump a stock.  I'm also not claiming BB will become a $1T company.  But, I believe BB will be successful and will become many times more valuable than it is now.  Time will tell.  Keep an eye on BB.  Set reminders for Jan 9 and Mar 31 and see if any auto manufacturers have signed-on to Ivy.  If they have (especially if Stellantis is named), come back to this post with a new set of eyes.\n\nI am long BB with a price average below $10 CAD.  I have held for 4 or 5 years (pre-meme).

I’m just showcasing that you bull thesis relies on Chen being able to deliver the strategy , something he’s failed to do this far - what’s happened is almost natural progression since Heins (previous ceo) was open to licensing QNX and was already licensing it in cars.  Again can Chen deliver is what you’re relying on.  Amazon can afford not to deliver.  They are there to scale AWS, so probably not as heavily invested.\n\nThey have yet to turn a profit, although they claim they can do so by 2024.\n\nChen has stated he will use cash to pay down 1.75 debentures - which I have no idea why he would waste money paying back a low interest loan in these environments instead of potentially trying to grow the company more.   It’s like this is BB complete form - Chen has no more arrows in his quiver after destroying all other revenue lines and his contract up in November 2023.

You are correct.  But, I also believe I have given some valid reasoning as to why I believe Ivy will be a success (e.g. BB's SAM estimate, manufacturers don't just name-drop potential products, real demos in actual cars, very low BB valuation, etc.).\n\nI account for Amazon getting a cut in my example (I brought up $10/car/year and said BB would only get $5 of that).\n\nYou have a good point about other companies should be wanting to buy BB, if this tech is truly good.  But, I believe there would be a few obstacles stopping a company buying up BB.  First, companies are usually hesitant to buy up a company unless there is established revenue or a finished product.  Which, as you rightly pointed out, Ivy is speculative until deals are actually signed (hopefully, announced soon!) and Ivy was just released.  Amazon would be the natural candidate to buy BB, but since they're already getting 50% of the profits and have been widening their partnership with BB (e.g. Putting QNX in the cloud), they may be content with their position for the meantime.  Any move by Amazon would be closely scrutinized by the Canadian government for approval, as well as shareholders like Prem Watsa.  Other tech giants (Google/Apple/Meta) would likely be fought off by Amazon and manufacturers/OEMs are already weary of having tech giants completely take over the vehicle software space.  If a single manufacturer bought BB (e.g. Ford), it would make it less attractive to other manufacturers.  These are just my thoughts.\n\nI do believe in Chen's leadership, but I am also frustrated with some of the delays (e.g. patent sale, etc.) and some of those are valid criticisms.  I believe in him mainly because of his work at Sybase and his style (he's not a flashy, pump-up-the-stock and then disappear 3 years later kind of CEO).  He is well-compensated, but I also believe he views resurrecting BB as a way to cement his legacy.  I also recognize that some of the delays are due to software-defined vehicles being on the forefront of innovation and BB has also had to wait for the industry to \"catch-up,\" as well as some macro-disruptions outside their control (e.g. Supply chain issues with chips, etc.).\n\nOverall, I don't disagree with some of your criticisms.
