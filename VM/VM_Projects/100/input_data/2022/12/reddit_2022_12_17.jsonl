{"title": "Why do people want a Recession so bad?", "selftext": "I don't think most people understand what a Recession can do to you and your family. Let's go back to 2008. The amount of lay offs the amount of people out of college with degrees not being able to get a job at a KFC! The lines for interviews being insane. All you could do is think about how you were going to put food on the table for your family.\n\nI really do think that a recession is going to fill in jobs that have been left vacant and will force people back into offices. (Although I am all for working from home). People might have a rude awakening. \n\nA lot of folks are wanting a recession to make money, and I understand that historically recessions have for the most part were great times to build wealth. But let me tell you when you have to pick between feeding your family and keeping the lights on then stocks will be the least of your worries.\n\nLooking back I sold what I had and like many wish I could have kept my bags but I couldn't I had to cash out to support my family. Which I would do again.\n\nI don't think this new generation will be able to handle a recession. The luxury of leaving one job and going to another won't be there and if you dont perform to a standard you will be replaced. (Which sucks)\n\nI post this only because of the amount of folks I see waiting for a recession to hit so they can \"make money\" be careful what you wish for. \n\nAnywhoo most boomers have a paid off house and cash reserved to take advantage of this potential crash so they will benefit the most from this. (And blame others for the recession and \"free handouts\" (Their words not mine) \n\nWe were bailed out in 2020 do you think you'll get a bailout with this kind of inflation?

It goes without saying, that you should do your own research and just use them as a starting point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**INTEL ($INTC)**](https://markets.sh/symbols/NASDAQ%3AINTC)\n\nI could write a whole post on why Intel is setup to be a really good investment over the next 5 years. The super short version is, that with recent developments in AI, Games and compute in general, we are at the point again where our chips are way too slow. For something like ChatGPT buildings full of chips, with millions of processors. So the appetite for bigger and faster chips will almost infinite in the next decade.\n\nRight now there is just a handful of companies on the leading edge and Intel is by far the least loved of them all. My bet is, that their turnaround is well on the way and they will play a major role in the next decade of compute. Not only because the chips start to (already) be good (Raptor Lake, Sapphire Rapids, Arc) and competitive again, but also because their software stack (oneAPI) is beyond impressive and will probably be a driving factor in purchase decisions for compute hardware.\n\nBest guess price: **$250 by 2025**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ($TSM)**](https://markets.sh/symbols/NYSE:TSM)\n\nThe thesis is basically the same as with Intel but while intel is more of a turnaround story, TSM has a history of relentless execution forever basically. For lots of companies that design chips, there has to be one who makes them. TSMC are masters at creating chips.\n\nSee for yourself if you recognize any of the following products and guess who Fabbed the chips for it.\n\n* The groundbreaking Apple M1?\n* The new Apple M2 Chips?\n* Playstation 5 ?\n* Tesla Model S Plaid MCU?\n* Intel Arc GPU\n* Amd Zen 1,2,3,4\n* Playstation 5?\n\nRight. All of them. The only reason the stock is down so much (along with the market), is that TSMC factories are concentrated in (as the name suggests) Taiwan, which is a piece of land that China would really like to integrate (invade) after 70 years of de facto independence\n\nBest guess price: **$200 by 2024**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Biontech (BNTX)**](https://markets.sh/symbols/NASDAQ:BNTX)\n\nLike Moderna (they are almost the same stock). Biontech is ripe for a nice rally in 23. As it seems, the Covid revenue was not just a flash in the pan but will drip in for years to come. Both companies made MRNA tech look easy when in fact it seems really hard to do right and both got insane acceleration from the Covid windfall that they can now use to supercharge their Cancer research.\n\nMind you, both companies are not your typical Biotech fata-morgana dump. They just proved beyond resonable doubt that they can Research, Develop, Scale and Market a completely new technology at insane speed. Again, they made it look easy. Moderna had their first success now with skin cancer vaccines (50%) remission rate and I expect the same to happen with Biontech as well. At a P/E of just 4 it is also the most insane bargain on this list.\n\nBest guess price: **$500 by 2025**", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">INTEL ($INTC)\n \n>Best guess price: $250 by 2025\n \n\nJust to clarify, you think Intel will be worth ~*one trillion dollars* by 2025?

{"title": "John Carmack leaving META. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort ‚Ä¶ our organization is operating at half the effectiveness ‚Ä¶‚Äù", "selftext": "Virtual Reality Pioneer Is Leaving Meta\n\nJohn Carmack, who was chief technology officer of Oculus, which Meta bought, is departing the company.\n\nJohn Carmack, a pioneer of virtual reality technology, is leaving Meta after more than eight years at the company, according to an internal post reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nIn the post, which was written by Mr. Carmack, 52, the technologist criticized his employer. He said Meta, which is in the midst of transitioning from a social networking company to one focused on the immersive world of the metaverse, was operating at ‚Äúhalf the effectiveness‚Äù and has ‚Äúa ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt has been a struggle for me,‚Äù Mr. Carmack wrote in the post, which was published on an internal forum this week. ‚ÄúI have a voice at the highest levels here, so it feels like I should be able to move things, but I‚Äôm evidently not persuasive enough.‚Äù\n\nAs the former chief technology officer of Oculus, the virtual reality company that Facebook bought for $2 billion in 2014, Mr. Carmack was one of the most influential voices leading the development of V.R. headsets. He stayed with Facebook after Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, decided to shift the company last year to focus on the metaverse and renamed Facebook as Meta.\n\nYet even though Meta was moving swiftly into an area that Mr. Carmack specialized in, he was sometimes a dissenting voice about how the effort was going. He became known for internal posts that criticized the decision-making and direction set forth by Mr. Zuckerberg and Andrew Bosworth, Meta‚Äôs chief technology officer. Mr. Carmack had been working part-time for the company in recent years.\n\nWhat Is the Metaverse, and Why Does It Matter?\n\n\nThe origins. The word ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù describes a fully realized digital world that exists beyond the one in which we live. It was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel ‚ÄúSnow Crash,‚Äù and the concept was further explored by Ernest Cline in his novel ‚ÄúReady Player One.‚Äù\n\nThe future. Many people in tech believe the metaverse will herald an era in which our virtual lives will play as important a role as our physical realities. Some experts warn that it could still turn out to be a fad or even dangerous.\n\nMr. Carmack and Meta did not respond to requests for comment. Insider earlier reported on Mr. Carmack‚Äôs departure.\n\nMeta‚Äôs earnings have been hit hard by its spending on the metaverse and its slowing growth in social networking and digital advertising. In July, the Silicon Valley company posted its first sales decline as a public company. Last month, Meta said it was laying off about 11,000 employees, or about 13 percent of its work force, in what amounted to the company‚Äôs most significant job cuts.\n\nIn a podcast interview in August, Mr. Carmack said Meta‚Äôs $10 billion loss at the time in the division housing its augmented reality and virtual reality initiatives made him ‚Äúsick to my stomach.‚Äù He added that the company‚Äôs metaverse efforts have been hampered by bureaucracy and dogged by concerns about diversity and privacy.\n\nIn other posts seen by The Times from this year, Mr. Carmack criticized features on the company‚Äôs Quest virtual reality headsets. In his farewell post, he commended the Quest 2 headset as ‚Äúalmost exactly what I wanted to see from the beginning‚Äù in terms of its cost and mobile hardware, though he was still critical of its software.\n\n‚ÄúWe built something pretty close to The Right Thing,‚Äù he said.\n\nMr. Carmack‚Äôs post, which said he was ending his decade in V.R., concluded by saying he had ‚Äúwearied of the fight‚Äù and would focus on his own start-up. (He announced in August that his artificial intelligence firm, Keen Technologies, had raised $20 million.)\n\n‚ÄúV.R. can bring value to most of the people in the world, and no company is better positioned to do it than Meta,‚Äù he wrote.\n\nBefore Meta, Mr. Carmack pioneered various techniques in computer graphics that became crucial to games that he developed, including Quake. He joined Oculus in 2013 as chief technology officer and stepped down from that role in 2019, moving into a part-time role.\n\nMr. Carmack this week also testified in a court hearing over the Federal Trade Commission‚Äôs attempt to block Meta‚Äôs purchase of Within, the virtual reality start-up behind a fitness game called Supernatural. The agency has argued that the tech giant will snuff out competition in the nascent metaverse if it is allowed to complete the deal.
