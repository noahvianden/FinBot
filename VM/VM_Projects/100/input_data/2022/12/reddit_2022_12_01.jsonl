For example, Volvo's Class 8 EV truck the VNR, it its top form has a 565 kWh battery and a claimed 275 mi range. So it's about 2 kWh/mi or thereabouts. Tesla are claiming 500 mi? 2 kWh/mi?  So I think they're not really ahead in terms of efficiency or anything, but would seem to have a lead on packaging. For their claim they need about twice the battery and I guess a clean-sheet design would allow them to package that in better than the old guard.\n\nThe real meat is whether they've made something that, in 500,000 miles, still works great.

They've got design freedom. \n\nGranted, in the EU the shape of the trucks is pretty much fixed due to regulations on weight and size. So you're stuck with that barn door design here really. They need to make the tractor unit as small as possible to maximize trailer length. The whole thing can't be longer than 18.7m usually.\n\nAlso I really wonder what Tesla are using for a transmission or if they're even using one. I would have thought they might be. Surely even an electric power train is going to need help from having things like crawler gears and very low early gears to get moving. But it will be interesting to see.

So you get about 52% of the input energy turned into useful energy. It’s around 95% for a Li Ion battery. \n\nIn the basic operation of a hydrogen fuel cell there is a membrane. That membrane is extremely pressure sensitive and heat sensitive and needs to be constantly humidified. You might start to see some issues already. The fuel cell essentially acts as a battery but has the heat rejection of a combustion engine. \n\nAnother issue is if you look at heat rejection (waste heat) vs power output, the heat rejection goes up at a very high rate (some sort of polynomial functional) vs power output. Compare that to a combustion engine which is very linear. This is less of an issue on very flat roads, but hills become issues. \n\nThen you just simply have issues with basic heat transfer. Having the extremely cool temperature required for a fuel cell will limit your radiator efficiency for heat rejection. As a result, if you look at any hydrogen fuel cell truck you will notice they are filled with radiators.\n\nThey also struggle for cold environment.

However, it costs you money upfront.\n\nIf the value of the stock stays above the strike price until the expiration date, then the put expires worthless.\n\nIn the case of buying a put when you don't actually own the stock, that's called a \"naked\" put.  If the stock price drops below the strike price, the holder of the naked put can't sell any stock at the strike price, because he doesn't own it.  However, the put option is transferrable, so he can sell it to someone else, which will allow that person to sell their shares at the strike price.  (He could try to buy the stock and then sell it, but that's needlessly complicated.)\n\nBuying naked puts is like buying car insurance on someone else's car.

This includes breaks, loading / unloading / jerking off / driving / etc... but only 11 hours of driving total per day. These hours are all tracked electronically now so if you fuck up as a driver you have to pull over on the side of the road when your time is out.\n\n This means, if you want to maximize your workday, you need to / can take a 3 hour break in the middle of the day, BUT after 8 hours of driving you are required to stop. The minimum times is 30 mins but the laws are setup where one should take a break of up to 3 hours to nap or whatever.

More efficiently though, a driver can break it into two 5.5 hour stints (with lots of wiggle room). At 75mph this would be a \\~412 mile range. So if a driver wanted to push it to the absolute limit, they could about 5.5 hours straight, stop at a tesla super charger station (which there are thousands of, all along major interstates), take their required break, and hop back into a fully charged truck and hit the road.\n\nThis example is of someone pushing it to the absolute limit - which is a sign of shitty dispatching, if a load demands 800 miles per day without a second driver the load provider fucked up.

Losing a lot less energy slowing down and speeding up means that air resistance become a more important factor that dominates efficiency at high speed for BEV.
