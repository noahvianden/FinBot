In Europe trucks can go up to 68MPH (110KPH) but usually 55-60MPH (90-100KPH) is the limit.\n\n2. UNLIKE THE ELECTRIC TRUCK a normal semi does not have to care for damage to their tank. They can fill up every 2h if they want. Or on evey break - it deals no damage. Bateries, on the other hand have to be charged properly, otherwise they lose their storage capabilities. That makes it painfull to use, even with hyper-ultra-super charging mode. Thats quite a painfull part.\n\n3. Just IMAGINE youre stuck in California during a blackout or only allowed to charge it for 2h. THE GRID IS THE PROBLEM - it's old, inneficient (some calculations suggest that in developed countries even 40% - different from place to place - of the grid is too outdated, inefficient and for eco-friendly reasons should be replaced) and CANNOT HANDLE MILIONS OF VEHICLES CHARGING. These trucks would have to only fill up during the surplus hours.\n\n4. When you're driving with a (coworker sleeping at the back) you can push the limit to almost twice what you said. The EV cannot handle it, a diesel/gasoline can. Even if that is a solution only for a single drivers it's a gap there.\n\n5. Due to the level of technology diesel and gasoline engines are bothe energetically more efficient and easier to develop than EV. When you calculate everything a classic truck is just betrer and more eco.\n\n6. Screw 500miles range - I want to know the LIFETIME of that truck AND the batery. Seriously, with such heavy load and constant work I need to know how much these bateries can handle and can they be SAFELY disposed of.\n\n7. There are EV vans driving around cities and EVERY HILL was a killer for them. They did not make up for it as much as you'd think going back down and it ended up having the throw their load onto a convencional truck to finish deliveries.\n\n8. Fires.\nWe both know what happens when a convencional truck hits something. Rarely it happens that it bursts into flames. BUT... For EVs the probablility of that happening is few times higher. Especially, when the bateries are now X times bigger. I want to know that my local FD can handle that sh..t. I've had electric fires, I've extinguished them and know how to cause them on purpouse. I need to know they can handle that f...r burning in front of my house.\n\n9. Gasoline and Diesel CAN BE PRODUCED FROM PLASTIC curently being sent from the U.S. to Asia and Africa so it can be dealt with (usually burnt). But even using solar power it is possible to turn the non-recyclables into healthy fuel. WHICH - unlike that plastic - is recyclable by nature in it's CO2 form. That process also produces other CH based producs which can be reused, for example in paints, some LPG and so on.\n\n10. We keep talking about CO2 from cars (which together is less than top 15 container ships - together). But nobody cares about producing localy or not exchanging stuff every 2-4 years. My car turned 25 this year. It's in better shape than most 10 years old cars. And since it's been on the road for so long it actually makes for more eco car than almost any EV on the road.\n\n11. Like it or not - hybrid and H2 are the ways, not EV. Push GM to finally develop a proper hybrid instead of working with VW (such an eco company...) On going full electric. You never go full reta...

{"title": "I believe inflation has peaked - and here is the data", "selftext": "**TLDR**: I believe inflation has peaked and will come down fairly quickly. I've put together all the data - the points that agree and disagree with that hypothesis so you can make up your own mind.\n\nIf we've already seen the worst of inflation, the Fed will relax and a hard recession can be avoided. Stocks and bonds will perform well, particularly what has most been affected by the high inflation environment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Oil\n\nOil production is steadily returning to pre-COVID levels. Prices have declined with the China lockdown, global slowdown (particularly in Europe), and release of the strategic petroleum reserves. There was fear with the Ukraine war, but the oil does seem to be slipping out to India/China which frees up global supply.\n\nGiven China looks to be only gradually opening back up, Saudi Araba has committed to production increases, Chevron's deal with Venezuela and current prices making fracking more attractive - I think we should get away with this one.\n\nElectric cars are already reducing the oil demand by 1.5 million barrels per day. Increasing fuel efficiency and a stagnant China long-term point to downward pressure on oil prices.\n\n[Oil price](https://preview.redd.it/3om4ovdizj3a1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e3b80baa51fc029344c95e403b9a200ae98408)\n\n[Oil Production in millions of barrels per day](https://preview.redd.it/xhqkipcgzj3a1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=c29223552459fde2954f3edfb276eff4f373c0ea)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Materials, Food, Shipping\n\nFood costs, material costs and container costs have all come down. Inflation-adjusted they're close to historic trends. While they were particularly affected by supply chain shortages and the Ukraine war; other less impacted commodities like copper and milk have remained steady. They don't point to runaway inflation, with demand outstripping supply.\n\nStagnant China with lower GDP growth and popped real estate bubble should free supply of materials like iron ore and copper. India will probably be the next major demand driver.\n\n[Wheat price](https://preview.redd.it/s6ag6dnt0k3a1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=606e7767b6c14bad2a81933039957822ae107c24)\n\n[Iron ore price](https://preview.redd.it/x4s3rsgw0k3a1.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf3a629d3afbc9615494073d1b6d6e0ea906a487)\n\n[Lumber price](https://preview.redd.it/bgvkamrx0k3a1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=f46f1313b549881d18371cd4b73117408a2633ef)\n\n[Global container rate](https://preview.redd.it/lkvkl3o51k3a1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=7869ba715317a0f4f0f581e6b028fe84a4c58a2d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Wages & Earnings\n\nUltimately for more inflation, you need more demand than supply. People need to earn more to spend it (absent debt which I'll talk about next).\n\nWages and earnings growth are only a few percentage points above historic trends and do seem to be falling. This means excluding supply chains and debt, inflation should be sitting a few percentage points above trend (4-5%) vs. the 8% it currently is.\n\n[US wage & salary YOY growth](https://preview.redd.it/iuf06h4qyj3a1.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=44c8a0d3f06725e42aa5b6db66b87635d9af1e37)\n\n[US hourly earnings YOY growth](https://preview.redd.it/c3qzsqtryj3a1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=8011efb7b118453a5009afe42cb50e9c368f794d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Household Debt\n\nDebt is where team inflation has a point. It's accelerating. Consumption demand can come from debt instead of earnings, which leads to bubble pops like in 2008.\n\nWhile you'd assume higher rates would lead to lower debt, as long as borrowing costs sit below inflation you're actually getting paid to borrow. If I borrow at 6% when inflations at 9% then my debt gets 3% lower each year in my ability to pay it off.\n\nI think lower input costs and wage deacceleration will happen fast enough to bring inflation down to where borrowing costs are above inflation. That should nix this bubble.\n\n[Total US household debt](https://preview.redd.it/k1qmmy3nxj3a1.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=18be40fdbee1cb828dfb09db79f1a50bfb93070d)\n\n[Total US outstanding credit card balance](https://preview.redd.it/okxldh7qxj3a1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f0d282ce4174e61101f9b825c2745f48f68b910)\n\n[US personal saving rate](https://preview.redd.it/pmi7g0prxj3a1.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9f00c5b9f687130b748d7efd769bf88acc8a536)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Fed Balance Sheet\n\nThe fed has run down the balance sheet by $300b, still small compared to the trillions they printed but they're making progress.\n\n[Fed balance sheet](https://preview.redd.it/jr97mk84vj3a1.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=424d8050381268f061f36ff1c32feed70d789747)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reverse Repos\n\nReverse repos are where the government takes banks' excess cash off their hands for a day. It only happens when there's so much excess cash sloshing around the system that banks can't find anyone worthy of lending to.\n\nThis shot up to over $2 trillion, which is crazy. But does gradually seem to be easing as of recently. We'll see if this trend continues as the fed pulls more cash out of the system.\n\n[Overnight reverse repos](https://preview.redd.it/1u7ktoxbvj3a1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=10e69d7ac800550c539a206dde50d9aea112eb66)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# LIBOR/SOFR Rate\n\nLIBOR is the interbank rate for how much banks will lend to each other. It's essentially the safest loan a bank can give, particularly the overnight rate. So if you see it spiking it's an upcoming sign of turmoil. For example, it started spiking years before the 2008 crash, indicating a liquidity crunch.\n\nIt has been increasing, but in real terms with inflation at 8% it's flat. The Fed is paying a record reverse repo rate of 2.7% due to inflation which puts a floor on this. Not overly concerned but keep an eye out, it should come down with inflation. If not, probably be a recession.\n\n[US LIBOR 3 month rate](https://preview.redd.it/4zo0ba94wj3a1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a874291115d0bc42e2d9804a4c0516b7b7173c2)\n\n[US secured overnight financing rate \\(replaced LIBOR\\)](https://preview.redd.it/yk31etpgwj3a1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b0112fc62da26c10e8f6e240365539a7f4f879d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there you have it, let me know what your thoughts are on inflation and anything I've missed.", "id": "zayz95", "created_utc": 1670017963.0, "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 203, "comments": [{"body": "Interesting read but in the section about food and material goods you say it’s lower (don’t think that is correct)- and then say “but adjusted for inflation.”  I don’t quite see how you can say that when talking about inflation itself.

They’ll relocate, downsize, move in with roommates or parent, etc. The rental market is very competitive, consumers have options. Cash flow is also great for most rental firms since they refinanced during Covid and have 30 year loans. On top of that, it’s much easier to build rentals now when wfh is common since they can be anywhere. It doesn’t necessarily have to be near metros anymore. The big inflation issues remaining are oil because of opec+, natural gas prices, and diesel. The fed, the majority of the economists, and the market expects yoy housing inflation to decelerate.

Second, despite rent \"decelerating\", you fail to understand the impact of rent, specifically housing in CPI.  To understand it, you must accept that there were people that rented for terms of 12, 18 & 24 months.  Those people - when their place is coming up for renewal are all paying a higher rate.  In 20 major metropolitan areas that renewal rate was on average 9.1% higher than it was 12 months ago, 12.5% higher than it was 18 months ago, and 15.1% higher than it was 24 months ago (which was the first 6 months of COVID).  In New York city, 12 month lease renewals were up 13.4% on averages, and 24 months leases are by far the highest increases, nearing 22% because so many people left the city during COVID.  FWIW, it is important to understand that between June and December 2020, premium rental properties in NYC decreased 12-16% for most 24 month terms.  During the last 3 months, rental rates are down just 2.3%.  So, if your rent was $1500 in 2020, and the average 24 month lease increased by 22%, it would be $1,830 by mid 2022.  If rents decreased by 2.3% in the last 3 months, that place would still rent for $1790.\nhttps://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/nyc-rents-are-going-down-after-huge-increases\n\nI think you are confusing deceleration (a slowing of speed of increase) with deflationary (reduction of supply of money leading to reduction of economic benefit).  \n\nI have not heard of any places where people are renewing leases at lower rates than they had 12,18 or 24 months ago.  To your point that it is supply and demand, I'd agree it is, but I'd disagree that even a simple majority of people move if their rents go up, and even if they did, CPI does not care if that person paid less rent.by.mobing, it is the effect of all renters, so you would need to compare what person B is paying for rental apartment #1, versus what Person A paid for rental apartment #1 last year.\n\nAgain, I'll agree that rent prices are coming down (said that in my original response), but the fact is rentals are 89.6 occupied (just 0.42% from the highest point), demand is not slowing, and development has not outpaced demand.
