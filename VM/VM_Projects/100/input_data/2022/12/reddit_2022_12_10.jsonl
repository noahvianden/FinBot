Per diem was generous, and the list of hotels we could stay at was generous as well. We all had automatic pensions, and generous company matching 401k plans. One major thing was that our team needed logistical support, so we had adequate staff to support us.\n\nThen came the great recession (actually, some of these started in 2005 and 2006)...business travel went away, pensions went away, paid leave plans changed, the 401k match was lowered, and logistics staff started dwindling, meaning that we were having to pick up the slack of their duties, without the additional pay. \n\nWe all THOUGHT that as soon as we got through the rough economy, things would go back to \"normal\". They never did. The pension never came back, business travel never came back, extra travel recoup days never came back, and support staff was never rehired. One other major factor, however, that I never really noticed until I left the corporate world was this: from about 2009 on, an air of \"I might get fired\" was always present, and never really went away, even when economic conditions improved.

Producer price inflation is up even more than consumer price inflation. Of course corporate profits are at records - inflation means each dollar is worth 20% less than it was 2 years ago. Even if profits were the same as several years ago inflation means the dollar amount of profits would have gone up a lot.\n\nThe problem with the whole \"corporate greed\" argument is that corporations have been profits maximizing since the beginning of time.

Folks at the top (not the top-top, but the bottom-top that vomits out reporters, devs, and Congressmen) fucking hate that people at the bottom are in better shape employment-wise right now. They want everything to suck for everyone because the long-term outcome of the White Collar Recession is going to be that lots of people whose jobs are barely work in the meaningful sense are about to be replaced by robots.\n\nFor example, GPT is utter fucking trash. But its output is less fucking trash than what most reporters and writers produce.
