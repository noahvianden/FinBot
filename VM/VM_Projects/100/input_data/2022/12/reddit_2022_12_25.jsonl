{"title": "Tesla stock collapse - All you need to know - Part 1", "selftext": "Tesla ($TSLA) is down 69% YTD. Although this is a number that Elon musk normally finds funny, I think, in this case, he might make an exception.\n\nIn my opinion, there are 5 reasons that led to the collapse of the share price and the goal of this post is to lay them down as well as the impact of each.\n\n***Part 2 will follow on the valuation in full (including all assumptions made) - This post became too long and in my experience, extremely long posts do poorly.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reason #1: Elon Musk acquired Twitter - leading to him having less time available for Tesla**\n\nAlthough Elon Musk is involved in many companies other than Tesla (SpaceX, The boring company, Neuralink), there is no doubt that Twitter is the one taking most of his time at this very moment. This acquisition wasn't welcomed by the shareholders of Tesla.\n\n**The impact:** In my opinion, the role of Elon Musk in all companies is to find the right people for the right positions and assemble teams that do the job well. Then, it's all about translating his vision into actions. The better the teams are executing, the less Elon Musk is needed on daily basis. Although this event had an impact on the time he spends on Tesla, I'm sure if there's a critical decision, Elon will give priority to Tesla over Twitter. Hence, looking into the future, I cannot imagine that Tesla's performance (from a fundamental point of view) will deteriorate.\n\n**Reason #2: Insiders selling**\n\nOver the last 365 days, there has been a lot of insider selling.\n\n|Name|\\# of shares sold|Average price|Total|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Elon Musk|97,004,591|$246.94|$23,954,081,846|\n|Vaibhav Taneja|58,683|$337.81|$19,823,747|\n|Zach Kirkhorn|52,418|$253.05|$13,264,312|\n|Drew Balgino|147,601|$277.45|$40,951,954|\n|Kathleen Wilson-Thompson|105,000|$289.03|$30,348,062|\n|Robyn M Denholm|299,700|$284.84|$85,366,262|\n|**Total**|**97,667,993**|**$247.20**|**$24,143,836,183**|\n\nOf course, it is obvious that the biggest sale was in order to acquire Twitter and most recently (in December) to secure more funds as Twitter is not profitable.\n\nHowever, there have been many insiders in high-level positions who were selling shares and the average price is almost always above $250 (more than 2x where the share price is today). In my opinion, they were selling as the company was **overvalued.** Could I be wrong? Absolutely.\n\n**The impact:** Economics101 - when there's a significant change in supply/demand, there's a change in the price. When there is over $24b worth of shares dumped on the market, it causes a decline in the share price. Was this a significant reason for the decline? Absolutely! Do I blame the insiders? Not really, it is their choice to sell shares. As for Elon, I don't think that if his ownership is up or down by a few %, it has an impact on the level of involvement.\n\n**Reason #3: FED increase in interest rate**\n\nSo far, this is what Elon Musk has been pointing to the most as an explanation for the share price decline. Although the increase from 0% to 4% treasury rate has an impact on the valuation of companies, it **does not** justify a decrease of 69%. Blaming the rate hikes for a stock price fall is the same as saying the stock was overvalued before, based on artificially cheap money.\n\nElon Musk in a Twitter Space conversation referred to the real interest rate being close to 6%. What does this mean? The nominal interest rate is somewhere around 4%, which means, he believes the inflation is negative 2% - We're in deflation. In the same conversation, he mentioned that the FED is using outdated data to make decisions today. Is he right or wrong, well, it's difficult to prove as there's no such data publicly available.\n\n**The impact:** I do believe that this was responsible for roughly 30% of the decline of the share price, but it was pretty much normalizing back from an artificially inflated level. However, this is already embedded in the share price today. If Elon is right and we are in deflation, the FED will decrease rates which will push the share price up in the future.\n\n**Reason #4: Interest rate impact on Tesla's business**\n\nIf you buy a car or a house and you pay for it in case, well, it doesn't matter whether the interest rate is 0% or 10%, you're not getting any loan. However, the majority of such purchases are made using a loan.\n\nIf we take a look at the total cost paid by the buyer, it is equal to the cost of the car (What Tesla is being paid) + the cost of debt (in the form of interest). Hence, even if Tesla keeps the prices exactly the same, the cost from a buyer's perspective increases when interest rates go up.\n\nSo, what can Tesla do? There are 2 options:\n\n1. Keep prices the same - This will lead to lower volume sold, but profitability (on a unit level) remains the same.\n2. Lower the price - This will lead to higher volume, but lower profitability (on a unit level)\n\nBased on the conversation in Twitter Spaces, it seems as if Tesla it is more likely to go for the second option and focus on selling more cars.\n\n**The impact:** In the short run, it might seem like a bad decision, but I do believe it is the right decision in the long run. They'll be able to expose more customers to their products and increase market share. There's no car company that is better positioned to make a decision such as this one.\n\n**Reason #5: It was overvalued in the first place**\n\nNone of the reasons above and all of them combined, do not justify the 69% price drop. There were many Tesla bears shouting that the stock was overvalued above $200, let alone at $400/share. I've valued Tesla multiple times in the last few years and I got to the same conclusion over and over again. I couldn't justify the high price based on the fundamentals.\n\n**So, why am I buying?**\n\nBased on my assumptions, Tesla is fairly valued at around $600b (roughly $190/share). That's why in November I opened a Tesla position and increased it during December. None of the reasons above have a significant negative forward-looking impact.\n\nThe market tends to have short-term memory. The focus is on the 69% YTD decline, however, it's still up almost 500% in the last 5 years!\n\nThe sentiment has shifted significantly, from everything going right for Tesla, optimism about AI day, Optimus leading to wishful thinking, to more realistic thinking, and now more recently, panic selling.\n\nCould I be wrong? Absolutely! This is just my take.\n\nAs mentioned above, part 2 will follow on the valuation in full (including all assumptions made)", "id": "zv1dxh", "created_utc": 1671986177.0, "score": 231, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 379, "comments": [{"body": "We've had an obscene amount of posts about TSLA lately and they all devolve into harassment and trolling regarding musk.

I mentioned in both of my post above.   I believe China demand has somewhat plateaued. they will sell in record numbers in china in q4; but there are some headwinds:  the subsidy is gone in 2023.  more competition: notably the byd seal: they started selling in september 2022 and in november 2022: it sold 15K. Tesla sells about 10k (edit: model 3 per month.  So there is Model Y: but the byd sea lion is coming (on top of the current competition in the Zeekr 001, BYD Yuan Plus).  I think the sea lion will put a lot of pressure on the Model Y.  Then you add subsidies on EV ends in China in 2023.  So can Tesla still grow in China? Yes, but they will have to either cut prices or come out with a lower price model: both of these will affect margins. \n\nEurope:  This market will continue to grow but there are some cracks. at the end of Q4: Tesla offered some discount on their inventories  (https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-offering-discounts-up-to-e4000-on-model-3-y-purchases-from-existing-inventory-in-europe/).  Subsidies in major markets in Europe is winding down also. UK winded down: https://www.electrive.com/2022/06/14/the-british-government-has-stopped-subsidizing-electric-cars/.  UK market is important to watch because of this.  Germany is also winding down:  by 2024 vehicles above ‚Ç¨45K\nsource: https://www.reuters.com/technology/german-coalition-parties-agree-reduce-e-car-subsidies-handelsblatt-2022-07-26/\nI don't know about France.  ,3 most populous country in the EU are Germany, UK, and France.  Then you have more competition: not just from EV but from traditional hybrids: ie prius, civic hybrid, etc. \n\nUSA:  Tesla was given a carrot here with the IRA (I am still not 100% sure how much if any Tesla buyers will get).  but many won't be able to get this due to income limits.  Saying that I think Tesla will grow by quite a bit here.  However if the following link is accurate: (https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/the-inflation-reduction-act-ev-provisions/), the subsidies for NEW EV is only $7.5 billion: it will run out in 2 to 5 years: depending on how much each vehicle qualifies for and how much qualified EV GM, Ford, VW produce.  \n\nAt the end of the day: Tesla is a premium/luxury cars. the market for these cars is very finite.  Without subsidies, many EV are not cost competitive with hybrids.  \n\nCurrent market cap of $385 billion: this is much more palatable than $1.1 trillion or $644 billion.  But my question is still the same. $385 market cap: at 10% market return: in 7 years: market cap will be $770 billion. And future PE of 25: earnings will have to be about $30.8 billion/year or $7.7 billion/quarter.

The difficulty is that an increase in asset prices, in and of itself, should not warrant further increase. Such increase, according to the efficient-market hypothesis, is warranted only by changes in demand and supply or new information (cf. fundamental analysis). Students of financial economics have largely attributed the appearance of momentum to cognitive biases, which belong in the realm of behavioral economics. The explanation is that investors are irrational,[4][5] in that they underreact to new information by failing to incorporate news in their transaction prices.
