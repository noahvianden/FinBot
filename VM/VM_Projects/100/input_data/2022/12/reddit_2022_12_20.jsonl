What do you think is gonna happen if you put a hard cap on net worth? You‚Äôre literally punishing success. Company running too efficient with too good of a margin? We‚Äôll force you to sell your stock and lose control of the company.\n\nI have and continue to think about the implications. I already mentioned that. I am not a one step thinker. I don't propose this as **the solution**, I understand it has a number of flaws. I would hope any idea would go through years or decades of refinement and thought before anyone started proposing it (in contrast leftist partisans tend to have great loyalty to some naive idea they heard on the most recent Vox video or whatever). I have no loyalty to it, if I heard something better I would abandon the wealth cap idea in a second. In the real world there are not best solutions, only better solutions.\n\nI could have gone into details of the problems that I could already foresee with the idea, but my comment was already long and I don't have all day to philosophize. Talking too much about hypothetical policies is pretty masturbatory, but I'll do it a little now.\n\nI think the flaws you mention are some of the weaker ones. The emergence of cabals that control pools of individual wealth is a bigger concern to me. Disallowing competition among the wealthy may have them cooperate to attempt to game the system. Hopefully it would limit their influence in each cabal itself though.\n\n\"Punishing success\" is a non-issue to me. If you agree with capping net worth, you believe there is a point of dimishing returns in monterarily incentivizing individuals. Even more importantly, the more you give to the guy who already has billions, the less free energy for people to innovate today. A trillionaire makes it harder for more billionaires to exist. The wealth cap should be set high, but finite as a function of currency float, inflation, or something smarter.\n\nThe cap would enable more rich people (and therefore successful / productive people) to exist by reducing inequality among the wealthiest. It would actually spur more innovation not already in the market. It would make it harder for a smaller number of people to control the rules of the game. It could make generational wealth not last basically indefinately as it does now.\n\nThe principle behind the idea is simple. There is a limited number of resources. Lets handsomly reward the most productive, but even so there is a finite limit to individual human productivity. Therefore the reward to that individual productivity must also be limited. This is part of the justification.\n\nThe ecological principle resonates with me more. I'm not against inequality. We need inequality, but it shouldn't be unrestrained. Natural systems have plenty of inequality, but no unrestrained inequality. If one organism or species used up all the resources, everything would die off. Every natural system is limited, biological and non-biological. It makes sense to me to limit wealth instead of letting it be unrestrained.\n\n>Company running too efficient with too good of a margin? We‚Äôll force you to sell your stock and lose control of the company.\n\nTrue to the extent that public market caps are actually based on efficicency and good financials. Obviously we have seen many examples were this hasn't been the case in recent decades.\n\nIt might make you lose control of multiple companies, or let go of some amount of control. I would want the wealth cap to be very accomodating, but finite. Maybe capping wealth would deflate company valuations down to reasonable levels. There would be less incentive to pump asset prices in general, at least for the super wealthy. I think this would all contribute to a healthier financial system with fewer boom and bust cycles.\n\nTo be clear the idea is not for any entity to force people to sell assets. There would be no forced asset sales. When I mentioned the things about hoarding I was referring to assets owned surrepticiously, not those owned \"publicly\" so to speak. In those cases assets would be seized and destroyed, just like we seize assets of law breakers. Everything I have said so far would obviously imply lots of details to be worked out if this idea were seriously considered.\n\nThe idea is you could not add to your wealth beyond a cap. If you didn't have liquid wealth beyond this point, yes, you would be forced to sell assets.

{"title": "Who really caused inflation? Biden? Powell? Trump? Xi? Putin?", "selftext": "It seems on top of the money printing that Powell did, there were a lot of reasons that the inflation is persisting.\n\n1. One of the person that people point fingers to is Powell - 2 years of 0 interest rate, massive buying of bonds. That certainly spiked the money flow.\n\n2. One can also blame Putin because it‚Äôs the Ukraine conflict that gave a huge bump to the gas price, making inflation (food and energy, specifically) way higher and more sticky than the Fed likes. \n\n3. Another compounding reason for inflation was the Shanghai shutdown for the better part of 3 months. So many businesses were hit with the possibility of not getting their parts, leading to massive spikes in components and materials, leading to a lot of inflation in goods.\n\n4. Yet another person to blame would be Trump, and no, it‚Äôs not the stimulus. It‚Äôs the things he has done to the immigration system. He makes immigration very hard for foreign workers and the policy is proven to be particularly difficult for businesses that want to hire people. They have to compete for good workers and keep them with higher salary.\n\n5. And at last, it could be said it was Biden‚Äôs fault - because it happened on his watch. Biden did release a lot of oil reserves (like half of all the reserve), but the administration‚Äôs failure to reach diplomatic solutions before the Ukraine conflict (especially Blinken) is more or less relevant to the inflation predicament we are in.\n\nBut I think it‚Äôs probably a compounding effect of all of their actions that resulted in this situation. It‚Äôs unfortunate that poor people have to pay so much for the basic needs. But it‚Äôs also unfortunate for people whose portfolio got hit a lot - plus high interest rate is inherently bad for the US‚Äôs future because the Us‚Äôs leadership is fundamentally a leadership in technology, and advances in technology requires risk taking, growth and low interest rate.\n\nLessons to be learned:\n1.

We tailor fitted our production capabilities to only be able to produce and ship enough to keep this whole economic engine going with the one caveat that it‚Äôs must keep going and not slow down (excess capacity equals poor fixed cost absorption and underutilized capital). You can imagine what Covid did to that system. Everything stops and then when it lifts demand shoots back up but there is just not enough to production and supply chain capacity to keep up.

{"title": "Legit game changer tonight: BOJ surprises with yield cap adjustment; S&P futures tank, US/Japan yields & Yen surge higher", "selftext": "TOKYO ‚Äì Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda shocked markets by adjusting the central bank‚Äôs yield curve control program and sparking a sharp jump in the yen just months before he is due to step down.\n\nThe BOJ will now allow Japan‚Äôs 10-year bond yields to rise to around 0.5 per cent, up from the previous upper limit of 0.25 per cent on its movement range, according to its policy statement Tuesday. \n\nThe central bank kept its target for the yield unchanged at around zero percent. It also left its short-term interest rate at -0.1 per cent.\n\nAll 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected no policy change, though most of them had said the bank should do more to improve the functioning of the bond market.\n\n**The surprise decision has the potential to jolt global financial markets as the BOJ‚Äôs steadfast commitment to defending its 10-year yield cap has served as an anchor indirectly helping keep borrowing costs low around the world.**\n\nThe yen strengthened to as much as 133.21 against the dollar, compared with 137.16 immediately before the announcement.\n\nA further firming of the yen would help reduce the cost-push inflation weighing on domestic-oriented businesses and households as Kishida picks Kuroda‚Äôs successor in the coming months. \n\nThe governor had repeatedly stuck to a resolutely dovish stance by stressing the need for stimulus until stronger wage growth takes place, ruling out the possibility the BOJ will take action against the yen‚Äôs slump. \n\nIn the runup to the BOJ gathering, speculation had been growing over the likely direction of policy after Kuroda steps down. \n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida is planning on revising a decade-old accord with the BOJ and will consider adding flexibility to the agreement‚Äôs 2 per cent price goal, local media reported over the weekend. The reports came after a key aide to Kishida told Bloomberg earlier this month that there is a possibility of reaching a new accord with the central bank.  \n\nThe yield on 10-year government debt remained unchanged at the BOJ‚Äôs cap of 0.25 per cent after the decision. \n\nThe governor will elaborate on the BOJ‚Äôs views on policy and inflation at a press briefing. \n\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/business/kuroda-shocks-by-tweaking-boj-s-yield-cap-sparking-yen-jump?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social-organic&utm_keyword=dlvr.it", "id": "zqdvtq", "created_utc": 1671509295.0, "score": 568, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "The BOJ previously had interest rates in a window of [-0.25%, 0.25%] for its 10 year bonds. The big news is that the new window is [-0.5% to 0.5%]. In other words, if the 10 year hits 0.5%, the BOJ will intervene to keep it down, instead of doing so when it hit the smaller value of 0.25%.\n\nThis is different from a rate hike as the Fed does it, although in this case it happens to also be contractionary. The Fed typically raises its the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) by moving the entire window which usually has a width of 25 basis points. So if the interest rate is currently set to target [4%, 4.25%], then a 1% rate hike would take it to [5%, 5.25%]. The analagous BOJ policy for the Fed would be to widen the range. For example, if the Fed Funds Rate was [3.25%, 3.75%], what the BOJ is doing with its yield curve is akin to the Fed making the FFR lie between [3%, 4%]. \n\nIn BOJ's case and in the current economy this would be contractionary. However, if for instance, the market really really wanted to hold onto bonds (demand goes up, prices go up, rates go down), then the yield on the market wouldn't want to go to the higher level. It in fact may want to go to the bottom end of the window, forcing the BOJ to sell relatively more bonds to keep the yield from going below the window. In today's case, what might happen is the yield in the market will probably hit the ceiling, forcing the BOJ to buy relatively more bonds to keep yields down.\n\nNote: I'm saying 'relatively' because in practice it's buying bonds the whole time, the question is just if it buys less or buys more relative to the current buying rate, in order to target a particular range for their 10 year bonds.\n\nAnother difference is that the Fed targets the Federal Funds Rate, which is a rate between banks in the so called 'overnight lending market' to make sure all lending transactions clear. The BOJ here is directly intervening to change their bond yields in the secondary market (this is where you and I can buy bonds, as opposed to the primary market, which is the government directly auctioning off bonds. Intervening here is called 'monetization' and typically means the country is entering hyperinflation).

I think what it implies is that even despite all their bond purchasing, they haven't been able to keep the interest rate within their bound in a way that was sustainable and without spillover effects, such as a devalued yen, inflation, or disrupted JGB markets.  From what I'm hearing on the news it seems as though the latter was the biggest concern, the fact that the BOJ owns proportionally so many means the secondary market is having trouble functioning.\n\nI don't exactly claim to understand the mechanism but I think it means that if they let bonds float a little higher there will be more buyer interest rather than just relying solely on the BOJ.  If the BOJ owns all the bonds then the secondary market won't work.  \n\nAs for why they raised (lowered) both ends of the bound, I have no idea.

If they buy more bonds, they will increase the price / lower yield of the bond market.\n\nSo I'm talking about two different things: what the market forces are taking the yield to, and what the BOJ is doing to counteract. I think your comment is describing what the BOJ might do to cause the yield to go up to the end of the window.

Mr. Musk currently has no outstanding borrowings with Goldman Sachs Bank USA.As regulated entities, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC and Goldman Sachs Bank USA make decisions regarding making and managing their loans independent of Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., respectively. Mr. Musk and these banks have long-standing relationships over a decade. We are not a party to these loans, which are full recourse against Mr. Musk and the Trust. These loans, as well as loans of approximately $279.9 million in the aggregate as of February 28, 2017 that Mr. Musk received from other financial institutions which are not involved in this offering, are secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk and the Trust. (pg 23)\n\nIn an offering 3 months after the share pledges I referenced in the proxy statement, Musk was reported to have $509M in outstanding loans from GS, MS, and BOFA -- all participants in the offering.  Non-affiliated loan agreements were not mentioned:\n\n>As of April 30, 2019, the outstanding balance under these loans is approximately $208.9 million. In addition, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, has made various extensions of credit to Mr. Musk and the Trust. Interest on these loans accrues at market rates, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA received customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with these loans. As of April 30, 2019, the outstanding balance under these loans is approximately $213.0 million. Finally, Bank of America, N.A., an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, has made extensions of credit to the Trust and guaranteed by Mr. Musk, which are secured by shares of Tesla. Interest on the loans accrues at market rates, and Bank of America, N.A. received customary fees in connection with these loans. As of April 30, 2019, the outstanding loan balance was approximately $85.5 million.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, do we know the terms of the loans?  No.  But, we know how many shares Musk has pledged, we know snapshots of his personal indebtedness to investment banks that provide services for Tesla, and at least one snapshot of his total indebtedness.

Our mean 2022 original amount was about $48,900. The median was $46,700. However, skew was 1.06. Max original amount is about $150k. Min was under $9k (must‚Äôve been a nice down payment). 1st quartile was $33k. 3rd quartile was $60k. Median original for teslas we lent for was about $47,700. Median income for those borrowing for teslas was below median household income in the US, and in general the same for all new vehicles. Roughly 43% were model Y, 38% model 3. X and S were split evenly over the remainder. \n\nLoan terms for all are a median of 6 years and average around there too with interest rates between 3.75% and 4% roughly (this lags our pricing and is not what we‚Äôre lending at now). \n\nTop 5 makes for us to lend for:\nTesla - 19%\nToyota - ~12%\nChevy - 10%\nFord/Hyundai - both tie at 7.6%\n\nKeep in mind that cheaper cars are borrowed for less often than expensive for obvious reasons, so these may not reflect what‚Äôs actually being sold at the dealer. \n\nFor those median is about $46k, 1st quartile $33k, 3rd almost $60k.\n\nMedian income for those are around US household median. \n\nHighest volume was between September and November (duh, that‚Äôs when new models are released). \n\nMore than 50% of the payment amounts exceed roughly 10% of monthly income. 25% exceed 18%.

For the bottom 25% to look like top 50% would require loan amounts in the $12k-13k range‚Ä¶ I doubt anyone in that income bracket has that kind of down payment saved up to make up that difference in even the cheapest of new cars ($7k-$20k down payments).\n\nBut this isn‚Äôt damning of all lower income buyers.
