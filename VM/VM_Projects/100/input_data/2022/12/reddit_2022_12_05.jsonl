That's cool and that is a consideration, although I give it less credit given how I'm looking at the strategy.\n\nThe strategy I'm referring to, to be clear is not about whether their cars look sexy and the cosmetics. I recognize that importance but at their % of market share of the total market for autos, I think it's less of a factor for now in light of the tailwinds in the auto industry itself, particular the tailwinds on the lower end of autos that has made the pricing of an entry level TSLA far more competitive then I would have ever anticipated.\n\nBut, the factors you named are lower impact to my thought process because, they only make 1.2mmm (Trailing) 2.4mm next year in an auto market that typically sells 90mm cars (less these last few years and potentially more to compensate in the coming 2 years due to the shortage that has happened).\n\nEV is a smaller portion of that, but the Auto Industry believes EV will grow from it's current share (I think around 30%) to become 60% of the total new car sales. As a result, the stuff you named, I'm thinking is less important next 1-2 years but will have greater relevance years out. that period of time is likely enough for them to improve.\n\nInstead, what I'm referring to when I talk about the strategy is:\n\n1. the fact they have fully externalized the loan business so they do not have the same constraints on their capital or the same risks in an economic downturn (this is a huge constraint and risk on the legacy auto manu)\n2. The lack of a pension and the drag that is on most of the legacy auto manufacturers\n3. Their lack of need to transition their existing businesses (so capex is more toward growth then managing down the old biz)\n4. Their ability to procure materials a bit better and their location fairly close to transport more affordable transport (the lines that run to Michigan have to go through some infra remodel in comparison an they are in Michigan vs where the population of the US has moved toward)\n5. Their use of capital to reinvest in other areas of growth (the EV commercial truck market, batteries etc). The last of which not only showed significantly stronger growth last quarter, but also significantly better oper income growth.\n\nI realize with large sellers of the stock in the stock market right now, it will be very volatile, but given the above 5 items on the biz strategy and what I think will have to happen at the other autos regardless of TSLA, TSLA looks really cheap.\n\nSo for comparison, this particular business model allows TSLA to have the same EBITDA as Ford despite selling only about 20% of the cars Ford makes. In other words, Ford has to sell 5x more cars to compare to TSLA\"s 1-car profitability. It's not them cutting corners. It's that massive overhead that is the nature of being legacy.\n\nAnd realize I'm using EBITDA to be generous to Ford. If you think about the below the line items (below oper income) it's likely a bit worse as TSLA isn't paying a bunch of consultants to try to modify the biz toward the future the same way Ford likely must AND ALSO, Ford has the financing biz (Interest expense and D&A being higher).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Points 1-4 are minor things in the great scheme. \n\n5 is just plain wrong, the semi is just a distraction, it can never be a real product.

I don't care about technical  analysis, just give me some tickers to look up for goodness sake.\n\n**Here's what I'm buying monday:**\n\nCHPT $20 Jan2024 - Huge open interest (EDIT: adding in a bro's DD which is linked in comments. Basically big potential for legislation to cause CHPT to pump. They also own 50% of the charging market share I think)\n\nSOFI $10  Jan2024 - Super cheap, planning to load up to get delta heavy on SOFI\n\nLCID $20 Jan2024 and $13 Jan 2024 - buying both these cause it's got lower IV compared to lots of stuff right now (60%)\n\nASTS  $20 Jan2025 - Loading up to hold for the next year at least, Hopefully  this stock moons. They de-risked recently cause their satellite array  did something neat. I don't know who cares I'm buying. I think this  stock moons.\n\n**Some random crap that's interesting but I'm not gonna buy just cause I'm focusing on what I already mentioned:**\n\nAZUL - Brazilian cargo airlines or something, who knows sounds cool maybe they transport treasure idk.\n\nVALE  - I've had fun trading vale ever since the epic battery day flop in  late 2020.... but I caught a rally on it a couple months later. It's  pushing higher. They are the worlds biggest nickle miner and they're in  brazil.\n\nI think the funny money fear is  overblown... so heavily regulated brokers like COIN and SOFI, might have a really good chance to moon in 2023 if sentiment turns around about that space.\n\nSIX - six flags had their CEO buying just recently, low options volume tho.\n\nBROS - I've got a few calls ($40 Jan 2024) . The company is expanding a lot. I like them better than SBUX.\n\nFOR  THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND HOLY CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHAT  RANDOM TICKERS YOU ARE INTO RIGHT NOW?!?!?!
