That relabeling of bad loans to good loans is the slight of hand that inflated the bubble and tricked the market into thinking it had lots of money that it did not have. Loaning money to irresponsible parties is not inherently economically unstable so long as the risk of the loan is priced in.

They might be the refs who will make the official call, but a recession is still ultimately up to the markets and their participants. You can call it whatever you want. The NBER can likewise call it whatever THEY want. But the truth is simply:\n\nEverything is more expensive. People aren't spending the way they were by volume (It's massively down). Every classic store of value is falling and near collapse including: property, bonds, treasuries, stocks, etc. \n\nIt is painfully obvious to anyone running a business that we are 100% in a recession, and [most leading economists and institutions outside the US know its the start of a bad one that's going to likely end in a world wide depression.](https://fortune.com/2022/11/23/how-bad-economy-recession-top-economist-mohamed-el-erian-federal-reserve/)\n\nSo those links you posted? Here's how the NBER determines if it's a recession according to that link:\n\n>The variables the committee typically tracks include real personal income minus government transfers, employment, various forms of real consumer spending, and industrial production. **Notably, there are no fixed rules or thresholds that trigger a determination of decline,** although the committee does note that in recent decades, **they have given more weight to real personal income** less transfers and payroll employment.\n\nRight away they admit (first line in bold):\nThey can lie to you. There are no **fixed rules** they HAVE to follow to say it's a recession. Cool. \n\nBut maybe that's just a technicality right? I mean, look at that next line in bold! They put a heavy weight on real personal income in making this decision! People's spending is really how they determine it, and spending looks fine according to their data! \n\nOh? Alright, well let's see how they determine their own spending data:\n\n>Figure 1 shows the trend in four of the NBER committee’s recession-indicator variables—real income minus transfers, real spending, industrial production, and employment—**relative** to their values in April 2020. \n\nNotice what I bolded there? Anything stand out to you about the **relative** comparison of prices from 2020 to 2022? \n\nYeah. It straight up doesn't take inflation into account. If it did, that would say **adjusted**, not **relative**. They never had to take inflation into account, because it's never been this bad. So now they can ignore it and pretend things aren't on fire.

Trading is largely about risk management and impulse control, in my experience, rather than being directionally right. And macro trading is very, very hard, in particular, for the reasons you outlined above. It definitely doesn't make sense to try to trade your macro view on a short term basis. Or rather, you shouldn't expect the market to go in a straight line from here to the end result *even if your macro view is entirely correct and perfectly predicts the future end state of the market.* \n\nAs a general rule, I just let my macro view (and I come from a macro background) constrain my overall trading, but not direct it. So, for instance, right now I think equities are totally bananas, like way overpriced, up here in fucking cloud cuckoo land. Every other asset class is pricing a recession of varying degrees of severity, but all anyone in equity markets can think about is next wednesday. So it makes no sense to believe that equities will suddenly wake up and reprice. I think it happens, but there is a LOT of noise and movement between there and here. \n\nSo maybe I try to chip in to long dated downside when opportunities present themselves to do so. And I don't currently want to be long any equities, at all. So I sacrifice 100% of the upside I can gain from being long any of the stocks I do like, and that's fine by me. I'm just trading around my core view, adding to shorts when I can, and also buying short term downside when I think there is a near term reason for a stock to underperform. \n\nI wouldn't actually suggest that you stop trading. Just pare it way way way back. Like I don't know what your financial situation is, but have a trading account that is maybe just 10% or max 20% of what you could afford to trade. And then trade that like it's 100% of your capital. Psychology should kick in fairly quickly and it should *feel* meaningful even if it's not central to your financial wellbeing.
