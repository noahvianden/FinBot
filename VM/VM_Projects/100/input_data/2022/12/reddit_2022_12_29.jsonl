Or Nike added a rainbow flag to a shoe and then Musk goes on a rant about how he will no longer support Nike trying to groom athletes. That is not sound for business. The second thing that is happening is that more likely than not, the forces behind everything started to teach him a lesson driving what was happening to the TSLA stock based on all of the things he's uncovering. Everyone can interpret the drops that have been coming out however they want. I'm sure some will feel there is something there, others won't. The powers that want to keep things status quo certainly do not want everything to be unmasked like that and I think very deep down, forces joined to trash the stock.\n\nAside from the Twitter stuff, what I see from TSLA is the following: for the longest time, people were paying the Musk premium. The guy can come up with good stuff from his companies but that kind of went down the drain this year.

Apple/Google have an asset-light business model, and the tailwind of a rising internet. The car sector is very mature and capex is huge. \n\nFurthermore at 23% growth rate, that would mean 79b in FCF after the 10 years. \n\nVW has 24b. So you expect the company to do 3.2x the FCF of VW, who sells 7x more cars than Tesla - and that with no new models in the pipeline and an aging fleet. Furthermore at current prices, Tesla is worth 4.6x VW. So even when they get to that cash flow (which I don't think they will), the company will rerate to a similar PE due to growth stagnating after 10 years. \n\nYour DCF is a pipedream. It is more likely that Tesla's growth will stall in 2023, given that their lineup is aging, competition is already outselling them in EU/China and that the market for 60k+ cars is limited. The price cuts in EU/China/US/Mexico/Canada already point to demand lowering (all the while VW and BYD are increasing prices). Btw the average 3.5k discount that Tesla now offers would decrease their earnings by around 30% given that they make 9.2k per car.

Who’s into free speech.  \n\nVery little about Musk's past indicates that he is a liberal at all, other than his own say-so (which means nothing). Regardless, it doesn't matter what his history is. What matters is what he's doing right now, and what he's doing right now is courting the far-right (who knows why, it's not going to be profitable I can say that much). And make no mistake, the right-wing in the US is fucking insane. This is important because Tesla isn't just a US company, they have an international reputation, and that international reputation has already suffered significantly and will continue to do so at this rate until he's removed and dissociated from the company completely. I live in Canada - Conservatives here are moving further right than they ever have, and even they look at the right-wing in the US and think they look like idiots. And that includes Musk - now at least, if not before.\n\nLikewise, his 'free speech' crusade is anything but. He's adopted the US right-wing 'strategy' of claiming to be pro-free speech/1A, but at the same time using his wealth and now his platform (Twitter) to silence and harass those who don't conform to his personal views. If you believe he's some kind of crusader in this regard, then so be it, I'm not going to change your mind -- but the more important part re: Tesla's stock value is that Musk has shown himself to be an insanely bad CEO at Twitter, he's making moves that open the company up to massive legal repercussions and very likely sanctions from the EU unless he reverses course. None of this inspires confidence at Tesla, and the reason Tesla has gotten this far is that they have an entire management team dedicated to keeping Musk out of the company business -- he's valued for his cult of personality/being the face of the brand, and now that brand is poison specifically because of this dumbass crusade.\n\nAt the end of the day people can make whatever investment decisions they want. You can make whatever inane claims you want. I'm here to counter that and say -- TSLA is going down, not up, and people should be prepared to see that happen. I doubt the stock passes $200 any time soon if ever. There's the possibility that it could see a significant bounce up in the near future, but long-term it's going much further down.
