For example sell 1 Dec 23 195 Call for .79 and buy 1 for Dec 23 205 Call for .28 for a credit of $51. The short 195 call has a delta of 10 so a 10% chance of being in the money. Your risk is $949 which sounds high but it is off set by your stock in your portfolio so you’ll just be flat from 195-205 (gain from the stock pays for the credit spread loss) should NVDA go to 195 or higher in the next two weeks. At above 205 your profit will start to rise again should NVDA close above 205 in two weeks. With this strategy you don’t have to worry about any assignment for whatever your reason is for not wanting to sell the stock. If NVDA closes below 195 by 12/23, you don’t have to do anything and you keep the premium.  If NVDA closes at 220, for example, your underlying would have gained $5k but your credit spread would have lost $949 but your are still positive $4k.  At least you don’t have the possibility of being assigned and having to sell NVDA and pay taxes or whatever your reason is for not wanting to liquidate.  Just repeat selling the 10 deltas every two weeks and you can gain $100 a month.  Just my two cents.  I’m sure there are other options traders with better ideas.\n\nEdit: Actually with a covered call you are capped out at whatever call strike you sold.  For example, if NVDA closes at 250 but you sold the 195 strike you make  $2,500 max plus credit (170-195) but the call buyer makes the difference from 195-250 minus the premium.

[Here is the pretty famous paper that documented it](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2586955). Consumers took out all these installment payments for durable goods in the 1920s, but when the recession hit, they would go out of their way to keep the payments on time rather than defaulting. But this ended up being much worse for the overall economy because aggregate demand collapsed in order to allow for deleveraging.\n\nWhat explains this behavior? Very high costs to defaulting.\n\n> The 1930 drop in consumption resulted from the unique\ncombination of historically high consumer indebtedness and\npunitive default consequences. Down payments were large, and\ncontract terms short, so equity was acquired quickly. If an\ninstallment payment was just 30 days late, the good being\npurchased could be and often was repossessed. The defaulting\nhousehold was not compensated for the ‘‘surplus,’’ the difference\nbetween the net resale value of the good and the remaining\npayments. Repossession reduced household wealth\n\nIf you missed a payment, the contracts at the time basically screwed you over. Typical interest rates were also in the 30-40% range.\n\nJust how dramatic was this trend?\n\n> Many pundits blamed the easy credit of the 1920s for the turn\nof events and issued more than a few ‘‘I told you so’s’’ as they\nwatched what they supposed was the natural collapse of an\neconomy based on profligacy and greed. Soaring default rates and\nthe failure of the sales finance industry were widely anticipated.\n\n> The pundits were wrong. Practically the only financial institu-\ntions to come through the 1930s unscathed were the sales finance\ncompanies. Loss rates were 20 percent on merchandise loans, 33\nto 50 percent on real estate loans, and 75 percent on stocks and\nbonds, but the **loss rate on installment credit was 1 to 2 percent**\n[U. S. Census 1943, p. 799]\n\n50% of the drop in consumption came from lower food expenditures--people literally starved themselves to not default.\n\nThe takeaway: you want to have a society where defaulting is costly enough to discourage excessive borrowing, but not so costly that consumers will do literally anything to avoid defaulting. Otherwise the economy collapses if everyone tightens their belt dramatically all at once. Ultimately, federal laws rectified this situation by making default terms friendlier to consumers, ensuring that they wouldn't lose out on all consumer surplus if they default halfway through payments.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Does Cramer already have Tuesdays CPI data?\n\nI'm wondering if Powell may send it to him early.\n\nI heard Powell watches Mad Money every night ...", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I commend anyone willing to buy this drop in stocks into close.

Declining car prices should show up in gross margins. Their issues are mainly  from operating margins, SGA addition coming from the increased acquisition expenses. Gross margin’s small decline was a function of mix (wholesale vs retail). So yes, the cars biz slowed, but not the way I think you’re talking about it. I think they did sell out to wholesale though to cash out inventory in general. \n\nThey are Working Capital positive though so I’m not sure why you’re saying they can’t cover it. Are you thinking used car sales grind to a halt in Q4 making Q1 impossible? \n\nCurrent debt expense and the revolver are $700 but it seems like they should cover via a combo of rolling of the revolver (normal) and running slightly lower inventory. They could also get more financing. Personally I think they should do the latter given their long term view. \n\nMoreover can you explain why you believe an increase in semis is a drag to used cars? The new car guys are seeing some alleviation, but this is a multi year issue that isn’t full fixed in 1 quarter. \n\nUsed car inventories and all car inventories have been on a multi year decline. Even with the increase in auto production this year, we are going to come in a little bit shy of 2019 production, which needed to be high because vehicle age was at all time highs(approx 11years for both US and Europe). We have actually moved older due to low production during the last two years. This is seen clearly by what the insurers are suffering through right now as well as the last numbers out in auto industry research publications. \n\nWhere exactly are you seeing supply excess? Are you the analyst at Jeffries everyone is writing about?  Either way I’d  love to know what you see in inventories. What I’m seeing is def the rate environment causes a pretty ridiculous headwind that for sure hurts everyone with a financing arm. But otherwise there’s so much shortage you just have people forced to buy into it with a preference to low end new vs used. I’m suspecting more small dealers (the 40k they are trying to roll up) go bust making it better for them to do their biz as we come out of this period. \n\nI could also see both KMX and CVNA offering older cars due to inventory shortage.

I’m looking at the FRED auto data on inventories and CPI to get an overall annual number. CPI showed an increase in used prices on the year, but declining on the last few months.

My post is related to the writer of the article whose statement in the headlines is unsupported.  \nAs the second thread of conversation, I think Reddit believes anyone interested in researching a stock that an analyst hates is bullish. Also, I wish my damned video didn't take so long to edit.   \nI DO NOT actually make a bullish call on CVNA in the video. I simply go through the financials and try to understand if I can see the exact same thing the analyst is seeing. I cannot. And this is because it requires I understanding the $110 mm in SGA increase is not just merger-related 1 time vs permanent. As this was a point of contention on the call, I don't know how to think about it. It also assumes their CFO and Board are unable to figure out any solution to financing. I was unable to make that conclusion as I do see value in the company that is financeable at a price.  \nAlso, I'm actually not thinking this is sorted out in debt. I'm thinking it's likely done in a combo of selling down inventory into the Q4 season and equity issuance. It is also not in the debt holders' interest for the company to fail, so this could also just be worked out among the debt holders.  \nAs for being EBITDA negative, it’s not so crazy for companies in this stage of growth. A lot of companies are EBITDA Negative right now and find ways to finance out of it, usually through equity issuance. This horse is definitely a different color, but it’s not a completely different color, especially for early-stage companies that are roll-ups. What’s actually weird is that they have no private equity member on the board.   \nA better-than-average Wall Street banker ought to be able to figure this out. At this point, I’d be surprised if that banker worked for Jeffries, though. The really big problem for them as relates to obvious financing is their board composition, but that’s not the end all be all. One of those guys is going to have to pull their weight and earn their keep. To me, the most likely person to help out is Neha Parikh, CEO of Waze. It’s a tough call, though. They have a clock and it’s running for sure.  \nAs a side point, though I’m not sure if I understood you correctly. For bondholders to offer more upside, they would not offer more than the discount on the bonds currently that are trading busted (the ISIN you’re showing me is trading that way assuming this is secured debt). These are trading busted b/c of the timing issue. That is normal. They need to roll this debt. As soon as they get funding the issue tempers notably and the spreads will tighten in a flash.   \nThey would just offer more than the highest bond rate. This should have been renegotiated earlier, so it is a bit surprising that this is coming to the wire. That’s why I keep asking questions. If he goes the PE route, they will likely replace the CFO within minutes of getting a board seat.   \nOn the other 3 points:   \n\\-----“The debt interest is variable rate, so rising interest rates will cause payments to increase”   \nThis is not so uncommon in auto financing. They can pass it on to their customers who tend to have a slightly lower credit rating than most (47% are a lower credit rating).   \n\\----- “They have to pay towards principal on vehicles not sold within 150 days.”  \nI’m not concerned given the massive decline in inventory and used car shortage. Here is what I’m seeing to indicate the shortage. Both KMX and CVNA cleared inventory citing both concerns about rate increases AND ALSO a lack of good inventory.   \nFrom [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AUINSA)  \nFrom [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/average-age-of-vehicles-in-the-us-increases-to-122-years.html):   \n\\----- ”At least 12.5% of owed principal must be held as restricted cash.”   \nThat makes sense to me given as I said, this debt is used to finance cars and then securitize it out. I don't deny that rates rising is an issue. We’ll find out what’s up with Used Cars with CPI on Tuesday, which will only include Thanksgiving and KMX on Dec 22nd which will tell us what happened with holiday buying.   \nBut again, the guy has always made it clear, he’s doing a roll-up strategy. All of the roll-ups that don’t have PE board members right now should have CFO’s actively seeking to shore up financing and clearly stating how they will manage a treasure chest to purchase weak companies in the coming year.

There are certainly different ways to interpret it, but the historical reality is that a Fed pivot into a rate cut (from a previous raising or flatline regime) has preceded an average 42% decline in the SP500, for these periods highlighted at least.  One should not conclude from this chart that a Fed pivot into a rate cut is the cause of these declines, but merely that it was coincident with the early part of the declines (perhaps because it was clear at those points in time of pivoting that the economy was already in trouble).  Also, there were other periods of SP500 decline with no yellow highlighting and no analysis around associated Fed raising/cutting regimes, so there are clearly other possible drivers of SP500 increases/decreases besides changes in the Fed Funds rate. My takeaway is that if we see the Fed cut rates next year from either a flatline regime (ie no change in rates at the previous Fed meeting) or a raising regime, then I should get short or buy puts if I don't already have those positions.  Most likely though, if the Fed cuts the rate, we should already have had months of warnings about possible trouble in the economy (hmmm like the warnings we've already been receiving for weeks/months about possible recession next year, warnings like the prolonged and deep inversion of the yield curve (3-month / 10-year inversion at deepest level in >20-years), and warnings like deeping debt levels of the consumer who will at some point soon run out of savings and credit to continue spending so much (consumer spending drives 70% of the economy).

Biggest mistake I’ve ever made was adding into lost causes (ever getting into calls/puts, these lost me the most and is absolutely gambling) and various penny biotech stocks as well as other penny stocks trying to chase the high of hitting it big. I never thought from the peak of this account $120,000 that I would see it this low ever, funny because I debated on getting out of all my shit stocks and dumping into apple which was only 80$ at the time and would now have this account valued at 200k ish. I thought when my father told me to get out of Doge when I was up 40k off a 2k investment he was crazy, that completely blew up in my face ended up selling for a 10k profit and then losing that as well. I’m massively depressed, it’s affecting my job, my relationship and me as a person. If you are like me trading in the stock market is not for you, it’s a beast that you have to be able to put money in and and never expect it back if you gamble, you cannot allow your emotions to beat you which I have done multiple times and never really grasped until now. I’m beyond disappointed in myself and don’t think I’m gonna come back to trading in the near future, still holding some  longs and maybe one day those will make me some back. I hope everyone here whose in the hole or who is in need of advice can read this and avoid the mistakes I have made —- DONT GAMBLE AND ONLY TRADE WHAT YOURE WILLING TO LOSE. Thankfully I still have about 30k to my name ($2380 I can’t access because it’s stuck in voyager so really $27620 saved between cash and other assets) at the age of 31 this is embarrassing and depressing, I really should have bought a house or a new car instead of dumping more in every month just to lose it - I have a decent job 8000/mo area (commission based) so I can get it together and just start stacking cash and putting that where I can’t touch it.
