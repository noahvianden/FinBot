In both situations there is buying of the underlying stock in the event of the exercising it seems like. \n\nIn the case of puts, the buyer exercising the option has to purchase the stock at the spot price in order to sell it to the seller of the option at their strike price. Thus, it seems like there would be pressure driving the stock price up if a lot of people chose to exercise their puts at the same time as they have to buy spot anyways in order to sell at their strike price. \n\nIn the case of calls, the seller has to purchase at spot regardless of price which also could drive the price upwards momentarily. At the same time, the buyer of the call is then inclined to sell at the spot after buying at the strike for a profit, driving the price down. \n\nAlso with puts, the seller of the put may then be inclined to sell the stock at a loss after buying at at the buyers strike. \n\nOn the surface, it seems like price movements from exercising wouldn’t result in a net price movement. Especially since a lot of options are exercised automatically, ie, put seller doesn’t end up with the underlying asset at a loss and have the choice to hold, and the buyer of the call doesn’t have the choice to hold stock at a higher price than what they bought it for at the strike. Like on Robinhood, the deal goes through pretty automatically. But that’s not necessarily true. \n\nSo what I’m wondering is whether lots of people exercising options all at once results in a price movement. It seems like it even could be an opposite price movement ie exercising puts makes spot go up and exercising calls makes price go down. Or is it in the same direction? Or is there no movement? \n\nIs it reasonable to expect price movement after a lot of people won their bet and chose to exercise?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Generally options are hedged with shares and all options share assignment is off exchange.

I know the option is valued at something which changes breakevens. \n\nBut what you’re saying is that when the contract is exercised, there really isn’t any need to square it by actually buying and selling the underlying asset, it’s just essentially cash settled and sort of simulates the process of the purchase and sale of assets at the spot and strike. And if a trader wants to hedge their short call position, they’ll purchase an amount of the stock so that if goes up past the strike, they’ll be able to still reduce their losses with a similar situation for those with long put positions? Do I have this correct? \n\nTo me, this is interesting, because if multiple traders and institutions are working with thousands of contracts, then it seems like the purchase and sale of those assets could affect filling those orders for stocks at the spot price, ie the spot price could just change in the process of exercising the options.

I don't really need a primer on the Mx architecture.\n\nSo let's be clear, it's a good design that has a lot of interesting attributes and maybe in a few generation it will surpass x86 in overall performance, instead of just performance per watt.  However that hasn't happened yet, and it's not clear if it will.  Maybe it will, maybe it won't.\n\nHistorically that doesn't matter much, there were a slew of RISC challengers to x86 about 20 years ago, including the Alpha which clearly exceeded the capabilities of x86 at the time on a variety of levels.  That was not enough, and DEC is no longer a company.\n\nSo things have shifted a bit, with a large amount of stuff now being done on the cloud, so that the processor in your home PC doesn't matter as much.

Sure, it'll shadow the Car industry in market value.

It's the same shit the Fed said about inflation and no recession + soft landing. \"We have a potential path to avoid a recession\" but then look at where we are now. When you ask someone how to do something, anything, you need more than \"I can see a potential path\" which has no details. It's literally corporate bullshit lingo.

I treat all bullshit equally.\n\n> But again you goal post move from the premise \"online book store be worth more than every book store on earth!\" to \"justifying current valuation\". Arguments of your sort were made about Amazon at this point in their growth too, which was the point being made. So speculation suggests you will be about as accurate as Amazon's detractors when it comes to TSLA growth.\n\nMy argument is that Tesla does not have a plan to tackle the \"viable path\" you pointed out. I agree those viable paths are there, I just don't see Tesla actually pursuing them. Please feel free to prove me otherwise. On the other hand, Amazon at their infancy, had a very clear business plan. Their strategy had always been to use their core services and business to obtain a monopoly in other tertiary sectors which eventually all build into one larger ecosystem. (Acquiring whole-foods, Expanding Prime into a streaming service, etc). These were clear in their roadmap and is what \"actionable\" information look like. The 2016 Q3 Earning Call along with their 2016 Shareholder's Annual Report details their AWS roadmap and plans for 2017, which showed the incubation of Amazon Fresh, albeit did not name any names, prior to their acquisition of whole-foods.\n\n>Yes, it's speculative. If TSLA is anything at this stage in it's life, it's speculative. If you're looking for a fixed income stock, you're barking up the wrong tree.\n\nI like how the immediate response to growth stock without a solid business plan which may lead to a justifiable speculation is that \"well go back to fixed income stock then we don't need you here\". I am perfectly fine with other Tech growth stock, like Amazon, which makes like no money because they are focused on growth but they have a solid growth plan so it's a lot firmer than just pure speculation. \n\nTSLA's current plan is very modest and attainable, and based on their current plan, their market valuation is too high. Which is fine, if everyone wants to think TSLA have more ambition than they really do, then people are free to feel that way and invest accordingly. I am just not one of those people.\n\nThe main point of my response was to call out how stupid the original \"Book store\" analogy was. TSLA is not like AMZN (in their philosophy and business plan). Calling TSLA valuation stupid is not the same as calling AMZN valuation stupid back in their infancy.

{"title": "Meta and Alphabet lose dominance over US digital ads market as TikTok, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple take market share.", "selftext": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/meta-and-alphabet-lose-dominance-over-us-digital-ads-market/\n\nMeta and Alphabet have lost their dominance over the digital advertising market they have ruled for years, as the duopoly is hit by fast-growing competition from rivals Amazon, TikTok, Microsoft and Apple. The share of US ad revenues held by Facebook’s parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year, the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014, according to research group Insider Intelligence. This will mark the fifth consecutive annual decline for the duopoly, whose share of the market has fallen from a peak of 54.7 percent in 2017 and is forecast to decline to 43.9 percent by 2024. Worldwide, Meta and Alphabet’s share declined 1 percentage point to 49.5 percent this year.\n\n“Four years ago, you wouldn’t be talking about either [TikTok or Amazon] in advertising,” said Dischler. “So it’s really telling that more and more people are acknowledging that advertising is a great and scalable business model.” Amazon’s foray into the digital ads world has played a big part in hitting Meta and Google’s dominance. After years of toying in the market, it ramped efforts up in 2015 and has since seen ad revenues skyrocket from less than $1 billion to an estimated $38 billion this year. “Before I joined, I didn’t even know what Amazon Ads was,” said an Amazon executive who says they now run “a massive team—and I didn’t know this existed before the recruiter called.” Paul Prior, chief operating officer of Undertone, a digital advertising company, said retail giants led by Amazon woke up to the realization that their extensive data on customers could be the basis for a massive advertising business with higher margins than the sale of goods online. But Amazon then went a step further, expanding its on-site ads business beyond its own shopping site. “Across the wider digital universe, they use that data set to empower brands and the advertisers to buy better, to spend more effectively and drive return on ad-spend,” said Prior.\n\nApple has also emerged as a new threat. Its ad revenues have grown from under $2.2 billion in 2018 to more than $7 billion this year. Although that is just 1.2 percent of the global market, it is already more than Snapchat and Pinterest combined, and some estimates suggest Apple could reach $30 billion of ad revenue by 2026. Zuckerberg has repeatedly hit out at Apple’s “conflict of interest,” criticizing it for charging “monopoly rents” and stifling innovation.  Insider Intelligence has forecast that Google and Meta’s US ad growth in 2023 will be just 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, while at least eight of its rivals are to experience double-digit gains.", "id": "zvzi00", "created_utc": 1672095453.0, "score": 873, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "So there is no more threat of antitrust laws against Alphabet and Meta.

Google will NEVER lose search market share, not in the traditional sense. The way you search today, if still applicable in 100 years, will belong to Google. The caveat, of course, is that people stop searching (googling) and start asking AI questions instead, BUT Google actually has the edge there as well with internal AI (not yet public)   \n\n\nSince search ads are the #1 driver of revenue you might be concerned that TikTok or Amazon or Apple are going to take away search market share, and that's just not going to happen...  \n\n\nUnless. Apple bundles an AI search solution on iOS that rivals or beats Google. Think the buzz that Siri had years ago, but actually helpful. That would MURDER Google's marketshare. \n\n...but, as we've seen (with Maps & Email) just bundling a solution doesn't mean users won't gravitate towards the better Google solution. \n\nWhich brings up one last point. Google owning Android gives them 50% automatic marketshare. So, it's really that last 50% of mobile (iOS) that they have to protect. \n\nAll that needs to be said about Google vs. anyone else is that Google has search, and as long as Google has search they have the absolute highest intent ad clicks on Earth. Why? People are searching for a solution and able to find it. \n\nFacebook doesn't allow this. \n\nApple allows this in an app setting (such as finding apps) but you can't just get an insurance quote or a loan. \n\nTikTok doesn't allow this. \n\nAmazon doesn't allow offsite traffic.\n\nDesktop search is going nowhere, either. Computer users will still use Google.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.) TikTok. Here's the thing. It's a terrible advertising platform for us marketers. Creative (i.e. ad assets) are almost ephemeral in the sense the little twats using TikTok have about 3.5 second attention span. Ads go stale in days, not months. \n\nThis means advertisers will use it, but lose more often than win. It's kind of like 15+ years ago when Google rolled out the Google Display Network (GDN) which Adsense is based on. Everyone thought it was this massive new ad platform that will offset high search ad costs. Nope, it was just trash traffic for the most part. \n\nThat's TikTok. There's money to be made, but you're basically doing drive-by's on bored young adults that want to see someone with no bra jumping rope. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.) Amazon. They are a very real threat to retail ad budgets. That's for sure. That's not going to stop people from advertising on Google or FB (especially for ad retargeting outside of the Amazon platform); but ad dollars and ad dollars, right? If you allocate more to Amazon because you sell on Amazon, it makes sense. \n\nWhich brings up another point. To use it you need to sell on Amazon! That cuts out a lot of Fortune 500 advertisers and doesn't really scoop up much high-CPC marketshare of industries like financial products, which make up the majority of Google's search ad revenue. \n\nUnfortunately, Amazon DOES have AWS (vs. Google Cloud) so if you're looking at this holistically as a business, Amazon has a LOT more going for them across multiple fronts. \n\n...but again, this shouldn't impact native search marketshare and Amazon does not drive traffic offsite, so that's a big no to 3rd party ads. \n\n4.) Then there's Apple. This company represents the #1 threat to Google's ad marketshare. As I stated earlier, simply bundling an AI search solution and selling ads would drastically cut into Google's search ad revenue IF Google didn't have a competing product. \n\nApple has something like 50% marketshare on mobile, so you can't discount what they have the ability to do with their device base (same with Google's Android) \n\nAs an advertiser do I care about Apple right now? Yes and no. \n\nNo because it only matters if you offer an app as a primary product, and a lot of the companies I work with don't (though, 1 does and we almost exclusively use Apple) and for obvious reasons, the Android version of apps aren't allowed to be advertised. \n\nApple's ad system is also pretty terrible. You can't drive traffic to a landing page offsite, everything goes straight to the download page. Great if you want app downloads, but also not that great if you want to tailor your message. \n\nI see a future where Apple certainly controls a lot of overall ad budgets since they have the mobile ecosystem (just like Google does) + higher quality users; but this shouldn't cut into Google's current revenue stream by much. \n\nThese are 2 very different products with VERY different intent as explained previously. Google traffic is super high intent and that's because people are looking for a solution across endless topics. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5.) Lastly, there's Facebook. As an advertiser I've given up on them. All is not well with FB. I would NOT purchase stock in their company unless I believe in their version of the Metaverse, because ads are no longer a consideration. \n\nThat says a lot. I've made millions advertising on Facebook. I would absolutely love nothing more than to continue advertising on FB for the rest of my life. There's no point. Apple killed them when they eliminated the ability to get attribution, and then FB killed themselves with Cambridge and FTC issues to the point they had to basically eliminate all of their great targeting options. \n\nFacebook has 3 massive problems. \n\n1.) It's too expensive. Costs on par with Google. \n\n2.) It has far lower quality and intent. People aren't searching, they're interrupted with an ad. \n\n3.) Attribution is basically gone. Who clicked what and who converted? Fuck if I know!\n\nFacebook in its current iteration stands absolutely no chance at taking Google's marketshare for anything but consumer lawsuits. IF the metaverse becomes of a thing and FB controls that, well, then, they're the biggest thing in the world, right? Can't refute that. \n\nBut, think about it. There's a reason Zuck pivoted so hard. He knows he lost the ad game and it's just a matter of time. Thanks to Apple, they can't fix their attribution problems so he has to create his own fucking world to monetize. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\nIn closing. Will Google lose marketshare? Probably not.

It changed the entire industry. \n\nFed scrutiny became even higher. Once GDPR was put in place and then Cambridge issues (think of it like it exposed a huge hack) both Google and FB had to limit the way they allowed advertisers to \"track\" their website visitors. \n\nHowever, WITH the abilities you had before Cambridge broke was even crazier than just tracking.

I could create some Diabetes-related ads, target an age/sex demographic and add a few interests like \"Fast Food\" or whatever and then see how the ads performed. \n\nOr, I could just use a 3rd party data source that had details on my target (all you need is an email address, really) and now I have a better list! \n\nTake it one step further and you purchase a list of people involved in a health provider hack and you have a ton of personal details, including their medical records (HUGE HIPAA violation, obviously) and guess what? Now my list of targets include ONLY people that fit my criteria! \n\nSee how powerful that was? \n\nNow, imagine that you never used any of the blackhat tactics, most people would never do it (except that RU political shit, right?) but 3rd party data allowed for extremely granular targeting that would basically allow any advertiser to pick and choose to the perfect audience for their product. \n\n...even if that product happened to be weight loss, a disease or their birthday. \n\nStarting to get creepy right? \n\nOnce Cambridge hit FB had to dial down the creep factor, so they got rid of 3rd party data sources were allowed on their platform by default (yes, anyone could use these 3rd party data sources) and it made things a bit harder, but of course, you still could target any type of interest you wanted. \n\n...including pages people liked. \n\nFor years it was still powerful, and creepy. \n\nThen, Apple hit, and took tracking options away (this was a direct shot at FB and Google ad dominance, btw) - now us marketers couldn't see who converted well.

{"title": "Tesla vs. Toyota valuation", "selftext": "I have seen several posts in various other investing subreddits arguing that Tesla should have a valuation like other car makers. Sometimes an argument goes like this: Tesla only sells 10% of Toyota and the stock should trade at 10% of Toyota's value.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/as274qanl88a1.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf6d52d23c7e9643ef54faaea4267e5a5a98b773\n\nThis completely neglects the difference between ICEs (a declining industry) and EVs (a growing industry), but also the differences in profitability, other revenue streams and debt levels of both companies. Instead of cars sold, one could take a look at earnings.\n\nSo, let's take a look at the valuation. First, equity valuation:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icutd33ol88a1.jpg?width=733&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=436099028a5aec495bfa3cfa18d70697f86d0cbe\n\nBased on trailing 12-month non-GAAP earnings, Tesla has a PE of 30 compared to 10 for Toyota\\*. Hence, a 202% higher premium for a higher expected earnings growth. If we take the latest quarter, Tesla has an annualized non-GAAP PE of below 27. Here, Tesla trades at a 85% premium compared to Toyota.\n\nAlright, let's look at the total firm value, including debt: The enterprise value:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cld89cool88a1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63f79170a29708fffb0b9580a8d7e0bb08823150\n\nRight now, Tesla trades almost at the same enterprise value as Toyota.\n\nTesla has around 15 Billion $ in excess cash (21 Billion $ in cash - about 6 Billion $ in debt). Toyota has about 157 Billion $ in net debt. For the enterprise value calculation, the multiple is usually calculated with EBITDA (earnings + interest + tax+ amortization + depreciation). Based on trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, the enterprise value of Tesla is 21 times its EBITDA. For the annualized Q3 22 EBITDA, the multiple is below 19 times. In this case, Tesla trades at a 65% premium to Toyota.\n\nEveryone can make their own assumptions about the growth potential for both companies to evaluate differences in static valuation multiples.

The common thread of these reasons is that Tesla is a growth story while legacy auto is a survival/restructuring story. Tesla is growing into a secular growth segment of the auto market, while legacy auto is trying to survive the transition from a secular decline segment of the auto market (ICE) to EV. This results in the following differences:\n\n1. Many auto companies are shrinking unit sales, while Tesla has been growing them near 50% average over many years. Selling EVs is zero or near zero sum for legacy while it’s positive sum for Tesla.\n\n2. Tesla has the higher operating margins than any other automotive company except Ferrari\n\n3. Tesla has 2.5x higher return on equity than the automotive industry\n\n4. Tesla is not burdened by debt, legacy costs, or dealer networks\n\n5.

But there are undoubted chinks in the armour that have begun to show.\n\nFor starters, it’s clear that TSLA isn’t doing well in China. Any way you slice it, selling a fifth of what BYD sells per week even after price cuts and incentives, is a terrible look for a growth story. \n\nA huge part of the TSLA story was that it was supposed to be the pioneer, leading the EV charge. Now there is a legitimate case to be made that not only is TSLA not the leader, it is far behind. Are we so sure BYD won’t do the same in other markets? \n\nThe IRA incentives are neutral for TSLA, not bullish. When you’ve established market leadership, you want the competition to drown in your wake. The IRA gives the competition a fighting chance. Without it, only TSLA had the margins and efficiency in the US to conquer the EV market. With the IRA, it gives other, less efficient companies a fighting chance. The IRA may well be the difference between GM and Ford sinking vs drowning. The IRA to TSLA vs the competition was like giving a loaf of bread to a rich man vs a beggar. The rich man will enjoy eating it, sure, but for the beggar, it is manna from heaven.\n\nThe TSLA story has also been about massive margins. Now with the looming recession, Elon has come out and said they may decimate their margins in order to move volume. This is not positive for TSLA. It may be necessary, yes, but as TSLA margins erode, people start to wonder why it deserves a higher PE. Thus the serious PE compression going on right now.\n\nThen there is all the other political and Twitter stuff which for me has hit TSLA badly. It’s really not rocket science. No other S&P CEO brings political agendas to the table. They try to stay as apolitical as possible for a reason. Elon doesn’t care very much what people think. For me, that’s not a good sign.\n\nAm I still bullish on TSLA? Yes. But has all of the above changed my investment horizon on the stock? Also yes. I used to think I would hold for 10 years and getting to $700 per stock was a sure thing. Now, I will be exiting at $400 whenever it hits that number.

Tesla Energy is aggressively going to provide charging for *all* EVs in the US in 2023 onwards, as their V4 supercharger stations will be highly profitable from an operations standpoint. Tesla Energy also has a significant tailwind, since the IRA provides charging station credits for new charging stations to be built. Having a CCS1 connector at a charging stall is not required to get the credit. What *is* required is that the charging stall has to charge more than one automaker’s vehicles. \n\nSo Tesla Energy could either add both NACS and CCS1 connectors to each stall, or they will only have NACS connectors at each stall and another OEM will adopt NACS, thereby qualifying V4 supercharger stalls for the charging station credits. The latter is more likely to happen, as Aptera (if they make it to production…) is going to use the NACS port.

{"title": "2022 Income Update (a year later): $850K or 132% trading options", "selftext": "Hi kids, I made a similar post last year, making $140K selling options:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/rve85t/i\\_think\\_im\\_allowed\\_to\\_post\\_this\\_143k\\_options/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/rve85t/i_think_im_allowed_to_post_this_143k_options/)\n\nThis year, a lot has changed, **I've made less money SELLING options, at $108K as of Dec 26**, but the majority of my gains came from buying options (SPY puts when it hits $430 in the summer). So, the $850K is nice, but it wasn't Thetagang and I probably can't recreate it, I can recreate the $100K selling options though.\n\nI try to follow the tastytrade way, 30-45 DTE, closing or rolling at 21 DTE. I adjust this based on my risk and my availability actually. Sometimes I aim for 75% before I close, instead of 50%.\n\nLast year, my most successful strategy was just selling covered called, I hit $67K in 2021, however as the stocks tanked, I dumped a lot of them, converting my trades into spreads, **credit spreads (80% have been call credit spreads) have been my most successful strategy, earning $47K in 2022**. Main stocks were SPY, TSLA and NFLX. I was selling call credit spreads on TSLA before the split, I was making $1K/week until it split, then the IV disappeared, so I found NFLX. I've been selling 7-10 weekly call credit spreads on NFLX (this is more gamma/swing trading, not theta, I know).\n\n**Biggest single day loss: $16K on Tesla Iron Condors**. This was the first and last time I've ever done this, I thought I 'bought to close', but instead, I 'sold to open', instead of 7 Iron Condors, I had 14, it went very very poorly. Since I trade at the office, I don't have my portfolio open all day. I submitted my trade and logged off until 3pm, when I saw my blunder.. that was painful.\n\nThe saying 'it works until it doesn't' has never been more accurate than in 2022, I think I've stumbled on a strategy that works, then SPY increases 5% in a day on random news, so I stop trying to short SPY, I just can't predict what it'll do, except when its at $430.\n\nIn the Summer, when SPY hit $420, I spent $50K on Dec 2022 SPY Puts, then it went to $425, I bought more, then at around $430, I bought more. Kind of gambling, I hate buying Options, I hate the decay, I'd rather earn Theta, but, I 'had a feeling' or maybe just common sense that SPY shouldn't be at $430.\n\nI tried to take pics of my account as status updates, I had a feeling I'd make this post again at year end, but within 10 weeks, I probably made $600K.\n\nOpening account balance, Jan 1 2022:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rimdudc6e98a1.png?width=295&format=png&auto=webp&s=29197ea1b802afa2b0d07b1c2a64b6366b2c0753\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMid July:\n\nI closed my positions, making $200K by mid-July just on my purchased options. I took a pic since it was the first time my Margin account broke $1M. I was pretty happy. Take a look at my open P&L though, I was down like $100K just on my long positions (which is why I dumped them, I felt it was a losing battle, stocks would continue to go down) ..\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcrq4mf7e98a1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=f91516e16ca45343529aaa3015fbc5bbaee0705e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnd of August, what is it, 6 weeks later? I started to panic, I've never had such large gains, SPY kept dropping, I figured I should be a normal person and just take profits. I closed out my SPY puts, took a pic for the memories. Notice my long positions recovered a little, but still had a big $50K unrealized loss.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ckfiv38e98a1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5bd301aea697d43eefa3170b1256c42019fc110\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm still expecting SPY to go down more, I might get back into shorting, I tried to buy puts if SPY hit $420 again, but it hit $410 and dropped back down, that would've been a good opportunity.\n\nFor those wondering, yes this is in my taxable account, I don't trade in my retirement or tax sheltered accounts. I pulled out $$, paid my tax on the gains and bought two rental properties, just to diversify my investments.\n\nAll in all, its been a good year, won't be able to replicate it. But with still $500K sitting in my margin account, I can probably hit another $100K in selling options, its been 10 years trading for me, I do it part time, I'll never stop.

The nearest mid-long terms support is around $110.\n\nMy point is that if you short TSLA at $123 with a stop loss of $200 and a risk of $77 for a gain of $13, the trade is obviously not cost effective.\n\nSome people may disagree with my opinion and will say that $110 is only theoretical support and support can be broken.\n\nOn a longer-term basis, I believe TSLA will fall below $100 next year, but after a short term sharp drop, there is no likelihood of a continued sharp drop here. Traders are rational and if it drops to $110, there will be traders to try to long.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8i6jck9j78a1.png?width=1763&format=png&auto=webp&s=074acc87b6ab002064c681ce9443415e0f993150\n\nThis is my prediction of the future TSLA trend.
