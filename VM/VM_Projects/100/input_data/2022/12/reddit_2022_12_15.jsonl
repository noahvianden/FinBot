Intubation is often associated with a more negative outcome than less invasive measures when it is not completely needed.\n\nCPAP doesn't completely take over but it will provide that extra resistance to expiration and extra buff to inspiration that will reduce work of breathing and recruit lost lung tissue, this can often reverse respiratory distress and can result in the patient being taken off of their ventalitory support.\n\nOne of the lessons from the pandemic is that PTs being on ventilators was associated with a poorer outcome (this is often just corellation not causation, they were on ventilator due to their serious condition) than when put on CPAP, but part of the reason they fared worse is that once you take over the respiratory drive completely, it is harder to coaxe the  body to take over again.

And for good reason.\n\nThe 10 largest investors in the electric-vehicle maker's stock, including ETF giants Vanguard, **BlackRock** ([**BLK**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) and [**Musk himself**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/elon-musk-sp500-lost-this-staggering-amount-on-tesla-stock/), lost nearly $133 billion since Twitter's board accepted Musk's buyout on April 25, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and [**MarketSmith**](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).\n\nIt cost Musk the position as the richest person in the world. But he's not alone feeling the pain.\n\n## Tesla Stock Dropping Like A Rock\n\nTesla's value is down more than 52% since the Twitter buyout was approved on April 25, while the S&P 500 is only off 5.5%. And Tesla stock is off 29% since the deal closed on Oct. 27, much worse than the S&P 500's 6.6% gain in that time. Shares are down again Wednesday, by 3.4% to 155.38.\n\nThat's shredding a jaw-dropping amount of wealth for Tesla investors. The value of Tesla is down $339 billion from the Twitter deal's approval and $206 billion from the close.\n\nInvestors worry that Musk is so infatuated with Twitter, he's not minding Tesla.\n\nInvestors owning shares of Tesla, now down more than 50% this year, are vocally expressing displeasure. \"There is no TSLA CEO today,\" Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, which is down nearly $18 million on its Tesla stock since April, tweeted Monday, as [**first reported by the Wall Street Journal**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-investors-voice-concern-over-elon-musks-focus-on-twitter-11670948786?mod=hp_lead_pos7).\n\n## It's Not Just Costing Elon Musk\n\nMusk is definitely [**suffering the most from the Tesla implosion**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-burned-as-musk-goes-ballistic-on-twitter/). As the largest shareholder with 14.1% of the company, he's personally lost $47.9 billion from the time the Twitter deal closed.\n\nBut losses are spreading to Main Street, too, as the giant ETF and mutual fund companies are the next biggest owners. Vanguard, which is [**forecasting a recession**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-vanguard-predicts-global-recession-next-year-why-to-believe/) next year, is the No. 2 largest holder of Tesla stock.

Prune the bad ideas that Bezos was over investing in (Alexa, Devices, Grocery) and go gang-ho behind Earnings (AWS, Ads, Core Retail). A professional CEO reporting to the board has clear priorities vs a founder looking for one last big thing before he retires.  AMZN has aggressively been pruning costs by shutting down projects (e.g. Care, Glow, Scout) and reducing investments in $ sucking black holes like Alexa and Devices. This type of approach also cuts flack, removes dead wood from teams, improves overall accountability at a giant company like Amazon. Management  has sharper focus on the money making businesses. Expect lower manpower costs, better revenues going forward. \n2. **Retail**: Over the  covid years Amazon has done massive Capex in warehousing, which sets them up for lower cost in the next few years as the business grows and the utilisation of these FCs improves. Additionally having all of this extra warehousing space NOW means Amazon can ramp up on Selection, In-stock and faster delivery to have a much better customer experience than its competitors. Expect higher traffic, revenue and conversion for Retail, with declining costs as the FC utilisation improves. \n3. **Ads**: Higher traffic from the above, and continued growth from newer markets = more opportunity for Ad dollars to be earned. Ads is a beautifully self-propelling flywheel, and a lot of META money will come to AMZN as advertisers see better conversion here (vs META which has been nuked thanks to ATT)\n4. **Long term orientation**: E-commerce is still a fraction of the overall market, and there are very few services which can compete with Amazon on selection, pricing and in-stock. Try the poor experience on Bestbuy or Target and you will know why AMZN is ruling this growing market. AMZN has the best deals, fastest delivery on the widest range of products this holiday shopping season. COVID brought a surge of new consumers online (especially US), and while some have gone back to offline once markets opened up, many have tried and are reusing the Amazon experience. AMZN will continue to take market share, in this growing market. \n5. **Under monetised bets:** Amazon has multiple high CSAT, high traffic services which some would argue are under monetised currently e.g. Prime Video, Music. Additionally the large under-utilised Warehouse network can be used to drive up FBA coverage, and earn more fees on FBA services.

The company, lead by Elon, had to hit numerous goals and stay there. And then once he earned the package, he still couldn't sell for 5 years, which we are still well away from him being able to do.

Good job learning that it's a class action from 2018, from a average joe who does not have the networth to have a major shirt against Tesla  lol. You are getting there slowly. The whole premise is that the compensation plan was not prepared or presented to shareholders in a fair manner which is independent of Musk and his influence. And as time passes the plaintiff just gained more and more evidence to prove it and the board being beholden to musk (e.g The \"independent\"  board allowing musk to use Tesla shareholder employees for his private Twitter business) . You can cite Tesla gains but Tesla is not the only 10X-100X stock. The AMD CEO didn't become the richest person in the world from AMD going from $2 to over $150+. Adjusting for market cap percentage gains there is really ZERO comparison. You can't see this, see the connections in the board, the **actual** compensation plan, etc and NOT clearly see it as a fair deal put together by an independent board in protection of shareholders. [You can't see that while everyone else can be diluted, Musk can't. Unlocks are by Market Cap, he can dilute and raise nearly infinitely, no share price provisions. No net income provisions, no sales requirements, unlocks by adjusted EBIDA, etc. There's really been no legitimate justification and they've used accounting tricks that wasn't too make Tesla look good](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4139394-tesla-elon-musks-compensation-implies-massively-lower-profitability) (like the bears claim) but to help get Musk his compensation. The same tricks that landed cruise line CEOs in hot water years ago. You've replied a lot but haven't explained WHY for comparable CEOs who've achieved similar turn arounds, gains, etc  that Musk was given this much equity. The answer is that he was already rich and him and his friends put this lottery ticket TOGETHER with high rewards that really weren't high odds as predicted as **EARLY AS 2018** with said filing. This is how you get paid $60B for producing 3 million cars total over 20 years lol.  Shareholder vote doesn't matter because literally that's the point of the lawsuit, that it passed due to misrepresentation. Would the vote today be different if shareholders were given the option to reduce the stock's outstanding shares? Probably so with the current begging of Tesla shareholders for a buyback. \n\nPS.

I said that the comparison to others was irrelevant. Doesn't matter how much AMD grew. What matter was that Elon wouldn't earn anything at all UNLESS the company grew more than 10x in less than 10 years. \n\nTwo, the dilution of everyone was known. Elon receives stock while everyone else drops by the percentage that he receives. That is why stock holders had to vote on it. And the majority agreed because the dilution is less than 10% after the stock more than 11x. \n\nThree, unlocks are by market cap, revenue, and adjusted earnings milestones. Each tranche \"vest only if one market capitalization milestone **and** one operational milestone are both achieved. For the first tranche, Tesla‚Äôs current market capitalization has to increase to $100 billion **and** the Company must meet an additional operational milestone. For each subsequent tranche, Tesla must increase its market capitalization in additional $50 billion increments‚Äîup to a total of $650 billion‚Äî**and** achieve another previously unmet operational milestone at each level. The award consists of a 10-year grant of stock options with 12 potential vesting tranches, and **is designed to help ensure that Tesla is executing well on both a top-line and bottom-line basis**. For each tranche that is achieved, Mr. Musk will vest in a number of stock options that corresponds to approximately 1% of Tesla‚Äôs current total outstanding shares.\"\n\nFour, the \"accounting tricks\" that bears have been claiming have gone back decades. And yet even with extremely high scrutiny by the SEC and many others, Tesla has never been found to be in the wrong. \n\nFive, this entire pay package again was approved on by share holders. And not because they wanted to make Elon richer. But because it clearly tied his wealth for decades into the company, making all investors rich as well. Again, he wouldn't receive anything unless the company grew massively.\n\nSix, \"that really weren't high odds as predicted as EARLY AS 2018\". Where do you get that it wasn't high odds? How many companies have EVER surpassed 650B in market cap? And how many companies at that point in time? $650B market cap in 2018 would have put them as the 5th most valuable company in the world, barely behind Amazon and Microsoft. Apple didn't even hit $1T until later that year.\n\n\"but haven't explained WHY for comparable CEOs who've achieved similar turn arounds, gains, etc that Musk was given this much equity.\"  \nOne, it wasn't asked. Two, the answer is simple. Other CEOs weren't voted by their board and share holders to receive such a benefit. Just because it never happened before doesn't mean that it's illegal (it isn't) nor that there isn't reason for it. How many other CEOs invested hundreds of millions of their own money into their company and then decided not to receive any money from said company except in the form of SBCs?\n\n\"PS. You can't say the company was \"bankrupt\" and musk was paid to save it and then say previously other companies are wrong for paying CEOs of financially struggling companies. Also of which their compensation % is not that of Musk's.\"  \nI didn't say that they were bankrupt nor was Musk paid to save it. He didn't receive ANY money while they near bankruptcy. That was the whole point. He wouldn't receive any pay at all unless the entire company was in incredible shape and every shareholder at the time made more than 10x even counting dilution. \n\nPS. What shareholders today would do is irrelevant. They were not the ones that voted on this plan. They jumped in AFTER the growth had already started.

Anybody with any basic understanding of science can appreciate that the latter is a much more efficient (superior) solution for spinning wheels. My point is who amongst the car buying population really cares what fuels the car? We shouldn‚Äôt care if its leaded gas, unleaded gas, nickel-metal-hydride batteries, lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells, or a flux-capacitor. Barring any discussion of what is best for the environment, the only reason most should care is convenience. For example, are there enough electric charging stations or hydrogen stations? Assuming no disadvantage to any energy solution (this is not an environmental discussion), my main point still stands: Who really should care? \n\nBecause of this, I feel that the car buying public needs to wake up and not focus on the EV letters. From Mercedes, you can buy one of many cars: cars fueled by unleaded gas, some diesel options in Europe, and some battery powered options. The more the world starts to downplay the difference between the energy sources, Tesla will appear less ‚Äúsexy, shiny, and new.‚Äù It will have to compete on price, style, image, brand, quality, etc. Because of this, I do not see them maintaining the market cap pole position.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Economy is why people care.

{"title": "Apes go broke squeezing their poles: an explainer", "selftext": "The Metamaterials / Torchlight / Next Bridge / Pole Perfect saga is the dumbest retail frenzy since the apes took over the treehouse. But within this objectively funny tale of idiots losing all their money is a confusing history of reverse mergers, spin-offs, and unlisted public companies.\n\nIf you're not aware, the premise was that the Evil Hedge Funds, with the assistance of the Evil Market Makers, had established a very large and very naked (like ur mom lol) short position in Metamaterials Torchlight Preferred Shares (MMTLP). MMTLP shares were set to get a large dividend, which would trigger a short squeeze and bring about a global financial reckoning and blah blah blah you know the drill. As you can probably guess, everybody that went balls deep in MMTLP is now broke.\n\nThis is a fuckin' novel so if you read like a child maybe just wait for the audiobook.\n\n## Technical stuff\nBefore we can look at the complicated timeline that led to MMTLP apes gargling testes for rent money, we need to understand the differences between a private company, an unlisted public company, and a listed public company.\n\nA **private company** is a company that isn't registered with the SEC. Its financial reports are not public. Shares (if the company chooses to use shares to represent ownership) are usually restricted and tracked internally. The company can't offer shares for sale to the public and shares aren't listed on stock exchanges or dealt OTC.\n\nAn **unlisted public company** is a company that is registered with the SEC and releases public financial reports. Because of this registration and its compliance with SEC regulations, it can offer shares for sale to the public. However, it isn't listed on any stock exchanges nor is it dealt OTC because (a) it hasn't made a public offering so there's no liquid shares floating around and (b) the company (or their transfer agent, if they have one) isn't integrated with any clearing houses so share ownership changes are person-to-person.\n\nA **listed public company** is a company that is registered with the SEC and releases public financial reports, can and *does* offer shares for sale to the public, has a transfer agent that is integrated with clearing houses, and is either listed on a stock exchange or is dealt OTC. It has a sizeable volume of liquid shares and there are probably market makers willing to quote a bid/ask to potential sellers and buyers at any time.\n\nA private company \"goes public\" by registering with the SEC, becoming an unlisted public company. Registering with the SEC doesn't magically get a company's shares listed on any stock exchange or dealt by any OTC dealer. To become a *listed* public company the company must work with a stock exchange or OTC dealer to (a) set up the appropriate facilities for share transaction recording and clearing and (b) meet the stock exchange / OTC listing requirements for volume and price.\n\n## Shorting\n\nShorting a stock just means borrowing shares from a shareholder and selling them to somebody else. Generally the lender will want regular interest payments from the short seller / borrower, since while their shares are loaned out they don't have the rights that go with those shares (like voting on corporate actions). The lender will probably also want the short seller / borrower to pay the lender the value of any dividends that the company might issue while their shares are lent out. (Lenders are usually ok with giving up voting rights in exchange for interest payments, but *not* ok with missing out on dividends.) The lender probably *also* wants the right to demand their shares back at any time.\n\nPrivate companies essentially cannot be shorted because there is no facility or procedures by which shares can be lent, nor is there any mechanism by which lent shares can be offered for sale. Shares in private companies are usually pretty restricted. There's also no way you can \"accidentally\" end up short shares of a private company. For example, when a public company goes private through a buy-out, lenders recall their lent-out shares (so they can be sold to the private buyer) which forces the short seller to rebuy the borrowed/sold shares.\n\nOn the other hand, standardized contracts and systems exist to facilitate and track lending and short selling of shares of listed public companies. When you short a listed public company you don't have to work out the details of the loan with the person you're borrowing from; it's all standardized and automated. It's also possible to \"accidentally\" become short shares of a listed public company. For example, you might be assigned on a call option.\n\nBut what about unlisted public companies? There's no practical way to short them, because they aren't integrated with any of those standard contracts or systems that exist to facilitate shorting. But theoretically if you were able to borrow shares from a shareholder you could sell them to the public at a lemonade stand. I don't know what happens if you are \"accidentally\" short shares of an unlisted public company. This can happen if (*foreshadowing*) you are short a listed public company and it spins off a subsidiary as an unlisted public company.\n\n## The history ~~of pole dancing~~\n\nThe year is 2007. The first iPhone and the last Harry Potter book are released. On October 30, Tammy Skalko (Florida native and total MILF) incorporates Pole Perfect Studios, Inc. The company is based in Longwood, Florida, incorporated in Nevada, and intends to develop pole dancing fitness studios. In May 2008 Pole Perfect registers with the SEC and becomes an unlisted public company. The company has about 3.75M shares. Most are held by Tammy Skalko and two associates (James Beshara and Harry Stone) but they also directly sell about 500k shares to 40 shareholders. The company starts with about $15k in cash and no other assets.\n\nBy September 2008 Pole Perfect is listed on OTCBB with ticker PPFT, which enables OTC dealers to make a market. However, since this is a small company with no assets or revenue, there isn't actually any trading volume.\n\nNothing happens in 2009 and most of 2010. In October 2010 Pole Perfect has less than a thousand bucks in cash, no assets, and no revenue. There has been neglible trading OTC and as a result, OTCBB has delisted PPFT. The majority of the companies shares are held by Skalko, Beshara, and Stone. It would seem that, like many small businesses, Pole Perfect isn't going to work out.\n\nMeanwhile, in June 1010, Thomas Lapinksi founds Torchlight, a private oil and gas exploration company with a partial interest in a single potential oil field in Texas, the Marcelina Creek Field Development. Torchlight is incorporated in Nevada. Torchlight shares are held entirely by Lapinski, who lives in Texas. Torchlight also has a business consultant in Missouri named John Brda.\n\nThen, in November 2010 a bizarre switch-a-roo happens. Pole Perfect \"acquires\" Torchlight! The deal is this:\n- Pole Perfect issues new shares which are paid to Torchlight.\n- Pole Perfect assumes Torchlight's assets and business plans.\n- Skalko, Beshara, and Stone are paid $270k (combined) to give up all their shares of Pole Perfect and step out of the company entirely.\n- Lapinksi and Brda take over leadership of Pole Perfect.\n- Pole Perfect abandons all existing pole dance studio business plans to pursue Torchlight's business plans.\n- The company is renamed Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.\n\nEssentially Lapinksi and Brda pay $270k to hollow out Pole Perfect and use it as a vessel to take Torchlight public. I have no idea why they would do it this way, since it cost Pole Perfect much less than $270k to go public in the first place. But hey, I'm not a businessman.\n\nShortly thereafter, Torchlight turns around and gives Tammy Skalko $12k in cash and $50k in stock for consulting services, for some reason.\n\nBy February 2011 Torchlight (nee Pole Perfect) is listed again via OTCBB and changes ticker symbol to TRCH. Over the next couple years, Torchlight conducts typical oil and gas exploration business, including leasing some land in Kansas and Oklahoma and drilling exploratory wells. Then, in December 2013 Torchlight becomes listed on NASDAQ. TRCH has arrived! They have about $16.7M in assets (after burning $10M in 2013) and a market cap between $48M and $123M depending on the day.\n\n## Oh Canada!\n\nWhile Tammy Skalko, Thomas Lapinksi, and John Brda are doing accounting magic in the lower 48, something wonderful is happening in Canada.\n\nMetamaterial Technologies Inc., a material science company focused on nanotechnology, is founded in London, England in 2010 but expands and moves to Nova Scotia, Canada, in 2011. I don't know anything about Canadian corporations but presumably they had to fuck a moose or blow a mountie or something. At some point they become tradable on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), one of Canada's three ~~maple syrup~~ stock exchanges, under the ticker MMAX.\n\nWhen COVID hits, the poutine-eating leadership of Meta decides they would really like to get more exposure to the sweet sweet American dollar by becoming listed on NASDAQ. But that's a time consuming and expensive pain in the ass for a Canadian company. It's much easier to acquire a small US company that's *already* listed on NASDAQ, hollow it out, and rename it. (Sound familiar?)\n\nSo in September 2020, Metamaterial Inc. (at some point they dropped \"Technologies\" from their name) and Torchlight enter into a Letter of Intent bny which Torchlight will \"acquire\" the significantly larger Metamaterial. The deal is:\n- Torchlight issues a ton of new shares which are paid to Metamaterial. Metamaterial becomes a 75% owner in the combined business, and legacy Torchlight shareholders are diluted 4-to-one.\n- Metamaterial assembles a new board to lead the combined company. Torchlight gets to keep one member.\n- Metamaterial will sell off all Torchlight assets and abandon all plans to perform oil and gas exploration, and instead pursue Metamaterial's business plans.\n- The hollowed out and replaced company will be renamed Meta Materials Inc., change its ticker from TRCH to MMAT, and issue new preferred shares to legacy Torchlight shareholders (Series A Preferred Shares).\n- Proceeds of the Torchlight sell-off will be distributed as a dividend to holders of Series A Preferred Shares, and then those preferred shares will be canceled and cease to exist.\n\nFor Torchlight to hollow out Pole Perfect all they had to do was pay off Skalko, since Pole Perfect had minimal assets and liabilities. Metamaterial had to do a little more work to do the same thing with Torchlight, since Torchlight is actively traded, has more shareholders, and has considerable assets and liabilities.\n\nThe \"acquisition\" goes through and in June 2021 Torchlight is no more. Meta Materials Inc (MMAT) now trades and issues Series A Preferred Shares to legacy Torchlight holders. This includes John Brda, a major shareholder in TRCH. Meta Materials plans to liquidate Torchlight assets and reward preferred shareholders by year-end 2021.\n\n## Things fall apart\nMeta Materials makes no effort to restrict the new Series A Preferred Shares, and there's a lot of them out there, so dealers start dealing them OTC under the ticker MMTLP (Meta Materials Torchlight Preferred). Short sellers start shorting MMTLP, predicting that the liquidation of Torchlight assets will result in a smaller dividend than is priced into MMTLP. The short volume grows significantly.\n\nWherever there's high short interest there's idiots who missed the Gamestop squeeze and are desparate to lose their life savings. An \"ape\" community springs up in late 2021, based around the thesis that the Torchlight asset sale dividend to be issued to MMTLP holders will cause a short squeeze because (a) shorts will be financially hurt by paying the dividend to their lenders that they'll be liquidated by their brokers and (b) shorts will be forced to close their positions through the cancellation of the shares and there will be a rush for the door as cancellation gets closer.\n\nThere's one ape in particular who drinks the Kool Aid, and that's John Brda. Yep, John Brda, the oil and gas consultant who orchestrated the Pole Perfect Studios Inc. reverse merger, is now on Twitter pretending to be a financial guru to idiots who put their life savings into the to-be-liquidated remains of the Torchlight assets he once helped manage.\n\nUnfortunately for the apes, Meta Materials finds that they're having a hard time selling off Torchlight assets. After all, Torchlight wasn't making any money from those oil field developments, so there's probably not a line of speculators waiting to snap them up. In June 2022 Meta Materials reveals that \"We may be unable to pay dividends to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock\" and says that they may in fact spin off Torchlight assets into a new unlisted public company called Next Bridge Hydrocarbons, Inc.\n\nYou might think this would be the nail in the coffin for MMTLP apes - who wants untradable shares in an unlisted public company with worthless assets and no active business? - but you'd be vastly overestimating the brainpower of the average simian.\n\nThey double down! Now they're certain that this 1-for-1 ownership swap will cause the short squeeze, because *everybody knows* you can't be short an unlisted public company so shorts will be forced to close. They also decide that Evil Hedge Funds and Evil Market Makers have colluded to *naked* short MMTLP and that there is a high volume of counterfeit MMTLP shares that will be revealed when ownership of Next Bridge is distributed and shorts are forced to buy their way out of a mess. And John Brda is right there with them, tweeting links to subreddits and looking for secret messages in his skidmarks.\n\nThey're not *completely* wrong though. As the spin-off date of record of December 12 2022 approaches, short interest declines and the MMTLP price jumps around and sees trading halts. The apes are right that nobody wants to be short when MMTLP is canceled and turn into untradable Next Bridge shares. What they don't realize is that nobody wants to be *long* either! It's a liquidation party, everybody wants to move their money into stuff that trades.\n\n## Endgame part 100\n\nDecember rolls around and apes fall into one of two camps. Some apes actually *plan* to hold their MMTLP shares through December 12 and become owners of Next Bridge. They think that maybe the short squeeze won't actually happen until *after* the spin-off occurs. It's just common sense, after all, that they way to get rich is to hold untradable shares of a failed oil and gas development company. But most think the squeeze is coming just prior to December 12th. As each day passes and the squeeze doesn't squoze, they get more and more jittery, alternating between panick selling at a loss and pricing Lambos (while still looking at a loss). They zoom in and out of ye olde VW chart while the MMTLP price continues to drop as everybody with a functioning frontal lobe closes their positions.\n\nAnd then, finally, after all this waiting, on Friday December 9th, **it happens**.\n\nNo, no the squeeze, lol, that was never going to happen.\n\nNo, it's better than that. FINRA halts all trading of MMTLP indefinitely.\n\nIn what is clearly a move to out-troll the SEC's meme stock commercial, FINRA forces all MMTLP shareholders (and all MMTLP shorts) to take the L and be swapped out for Next Bridge shares.\n\nIn their own minds, apes were just seconds away from a financial orgasm when FINRA dropped a fucking *anvil* on their collective nuts.\n\nThe apes weren't happy.\n- \"But I was just about to sell, right as soon as it squeezed!\" Doesn't matter, enjoy your Next Bridge shares.\n- \"This is illegal! I'm going to sue FINRA!\" lol\n- \"You can't be short a private company!\" Next Bridge is an unlisted public company, not private.\n- \"What is this all about? How is this possible?\" Better luck with your *next* stripper pole reverse merger, John!\n\n## Fallout\n\nThe fallout from this isn't yet clear. Brokers received very little information and instructions about how to process the spin-off, and currently apes are looking at zeroes in their accounts. But eventually they'll end up with shares held by Next Bridge's transfer agent. Whatever money they put into MMTLP is gone; they *may* get some sort of payout if Next Bridge eventually liquidates its holdings. It's theoretically possible that Next Bridge will one day become tradable, but since the actual operators of Torchlight are not affiliated with Next Bridge there's no reason to think Next Bridge is going to try and operate the unprofitable oil and gas fields. Probably they'll just sit on the assets until ithey can be sold. And that isn't easy, because remember like a hundred pages ago I said that that Torchlight has a *partial* interest in some of their properties? A partial interest in an unprofitable oil field is not exactly turning heads. It's very possible that these loss-making enterprises were were simply evicted from Meta Materials' books so they can quietly go bankrupt on their own.\n\nThere was no measure to force shorts to close, so there are short positions open on MMTLP that will presumably become short positions on Next Bridge. I mentioned earlier that I don't know how short positions on unlisted public companies are handled. I would imagine that the lending shareholders probably want the full rights to their (worthless) shares back, so I wouldn't be surprised if the company issues new shares to directly sell to short sellers, so the few that remain can close their positions and all shareholders have their full rights restored. That would dilute the shares, but there weren't many short sellers that stuck around until December 9th, so maybe it doesn't matter much. So far there's been no information on how this will be handled.\n\nJohn Brda continues to tweet. MMTLP apes are slowly, reluctantly dragging the goalposts to a fictional universe where they were *all* in the camp of wanting Next Bridge shares to pass on to their children. Redditors continue to be on the lookout for the next big terrible bet.\n\nSo next time you make a bad stock play, your options expire worthless, or you catch your wife with the lawn guy, don't feel bad. You might be an idiot, but at least you've never lost your life savings in untradable shares of a worthless shell company being discharged from a materials science company who became NASDAQ-listed by reverse merging with an oil and gas company who had previously become OTC-listed by reverse merging with a pole dancing studio company. You're not *those* people.\n\n**Edit:** Please correct anything here that's wrong.
