The challenge for investors is that the three companies don’t report cloud infrastructure metrics in a way that makes them easily comparable. However, an internal estimate assembled by Google employees, based on a leaked Microsoft document and some extrapolation of other market statistics, suggests Google believes it’s closer to second place than analysts think.\n\nGoogle’s document estimates that Microsoft generated under $29 billion in Azure consumption revenue in the latest fiscal year, which ended June 30, reflecting the value of cloud infrastructure services used by clients. That’s several billion dollars less than what Wall Street analysts had forecast. Bank of America was the most bullish, predicting Azure would pull in $37.5 billion in fiscal 2022. Cowen predicted revenue of $33.9 billion and UBS said $32.3 billion. The document from Google has Azure ending the 2022 fiscal year with an operating loss of almost $3 billion, down from a loss of more than $5 billion the prior year. It claims that Azure’s sales and marketing costs approached $10 billion, accounting for 34% of consumption revenue. Microsoft said sales and marketing costs for the whole company equaled 11% of revenue over the same period.\n\nOne analyst dismissed Google’s bottom-line tally. “There’s no way it’s that big of a loss,” said Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock. His research shows Azure boasting an operating margin above 30%, compared with Google’s estimate of a -10% margin.

It's why shows like the simpsons were written the way they were, because a working man could support a whole family and have a nice house in the suburbs without needing to \"hustle\" or \"pull themselves up by their bootstraps\"\n\nThere is only 1 party in this country actively working to undermine social programs, de regulate industry, increase privatization and cut taxes for the most wealthy. There is only 1 party heavily invested in convincing the public that trickle down works when the data shows it doesn't.

TLDR the countries with the happiest citizens and healthy economies practice a form of social capitalism where there are safety nets on the low end but still rewards on the high end. But one party....lol... labels any good or service received from the government here as (big scary buzzword) \"Socialism\". The reality is it's not a hand out, it's a basic service that was paid for but they hate regulation and cost controlled industries. \n\nI really don't know how people are able to ignore all the obvious stuff they do in completely plain view. That party wants to gut social security which is fully paid for by us and take it away from us, they cut taxes on the richest and privatize industries from healthcare to utilities. We literally have the most expensive healthcare in the world and are the only country out of the top 33 without single payer healthcare. For fucks sake look what happened to the texas power grid last year and the costs legally passed off to residents.\n\nLet me just be real with you.

The same man who came up with the brilliant Davao death squad.\n\nMy Version of the American dream is being able to own your own business and working from the ground up in order to ensure a better life for your future generations. My relatives actually had various businesses throughout the years and were able to thrive during 2018. Those businesses which included a Pinay convenience store, restaurant supply company, and logistics company all fell through over these past couple of years. Why do you think 2018 was successful?  Some may say it was due to the pandemic labor shortage. However, did you know that the new corporate taxation policy isn't just limited to large corporations? Believe it or not, 2 of those fell under the corporate tax umbrella. Kind of weird considering there were maybe less than 100 employees among all them combined.\n\nThat being said, not only were they taxed at the same 35% corporate rate, but they also had to pay back taxes since this new policy essentially caused this retroactive tax dating back to the the Obama era. My family isn't rich. They couldn't cover that like the big corporations could. I would only imagine that this isn't a 1 off case. \n\nTbh I worked my ass off through college as an immigrant. Ended up studying politics and economics to actually educate myself and get into trading which I still do in my spare time but I got my back end coding certs post grad and now work as a data scientist.\n\nAside from my personal experience, I don't see corporate tax breaks like you do. I mean the umbrella policy itself is fucked. But do you really think that taxing corporations more will come out of the rich executives pockets? That gets dealt in 1 or 2 ways. Either the downsize and add more responsibilities to the remaining workforce, or that cost gets past down to the consumer. Trickle down economics which is also what spurs more innovation and job creation. It's a model which benefited businesses like those of my relatives. The inverse allows those big corporations thrive. Since the barriers to entry have tightened, these big corporations are allowed to exhibit more predatory behavior.\n\nDon't get me started on social programs. My family and I pay into the benefits of people who were born here and for those who didn't go through the citizenship process. All of these are why our American dream that we came here for is dead. We came here to be proud of our country. It's funny that all of a sudden everyone hates America. I'm very well traveled and can tell you that other countries haven't solved these problems. My group of immigrant friends that I have made here and throughout college still believe we are the best country in the world. I could care less what you think about capitalism. That's an argument that won't ever get through to anyone.\n\nFree healthcare isn't free. I don't want to use all of the mess going on in Canada because you probably don't think it's bad up there. And Obamacare was.....not good. That was so memorably impactful that I wrote a thesis on it. Did you know that there is actually a limit on how many people can become medical doctors in America? Thats why they are paid so much more than doctors in other countries. I believe Italy has the best healthcare system in the world and doctors are paid much less as it is more of an honor. Republican policies have very little to do with it. I personally don't agree with your support of social programs, regulation, or corporate taxation points as I felt that on the ground level. Maybe democratic policies benefitted your personal life positively, but it existed as a big thorn in my side. And aside from China, what other countries have a stronger economy than the U.S.?

The issue here is that you're assuming that no regulation could, would, or should be made to prevent exactly this.  Corporations that exist purely to generate as much profit as possible at the expense of people are evil and need to be regulated.  If the people in charge of these corporations can't get it through their heads that what they are doing is morally wrong, they need to be controlled in a way where it's now *legally* wrong, and real consequences need to be applied to their actions.  That's literally part of what government is supposed to do, protect the people from those in society that would hurt them.\n\nSo few people consider this concept and simply view the world through the lens of, \"Will this work when applied by itself today with no other support to make it work?\"  Well obviously not.
