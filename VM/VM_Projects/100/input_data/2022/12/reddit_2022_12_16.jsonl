They're also mean-reverting so they're not just going to trend in any single direction for decades on end - some years they'll be a headwind, some years they'll be a tailwind.\n\nBut from a near-term perspective ideally you'd want to be buying stocks after they've been discounted for higher interest rates because that usually means rates will be a tailwind to future valuations as they're likely to make back down. Lower rates are good only in hindsight because the worst time to invest is probably when stocks have rallied 50% on the Fed cutting rates to zero. At that point interest rate moves can really only be a headwind as they move back up and stocks need to rerate.\n\nImo as a long-term investor the only important consideration of higher interest rates is the impact on business models. For example if you're a business and you can borrow $1 million at 2% to invest in a project that will yield a 3% return on that investment it makes sense to borrow and grow your business. But if your return on invested capital is low then borrowing at higher rates directly impacts your ability to grow.\n\nThis impacts tech more than other sectors because it's common in tech to borrow money to invest in projects which will yield a return way out in the future. Higher rates fundamentally makes the growth model used by a lot of tech companies today much more challenging which could result in lower returns long-term if you're overallocated to those types of companies.\n\nHowever, if you're a steady dividend paying company that isn't borrowing money to invest in growth then higher interest rates really doesn't have much impact on your ability to operate.\n\nI think what's interesting about the market right now is that if interest rates do remain high speculative tech is likely to face long-term headwinds and it's likely many in the space won't survive. However, if rates end up falling back down (as some expect) it's likely capital will come out of the steady dividend stocks and back into growth over the next several years. This is basically the story the post-GFC economy - so the question savvy investors need to ask is whether this is truly regime change?\n\nIf you're unsure about where interest rates are heading you probably just want to remain diversified or invest in profitable growth companies as a middle ground. If you do this I personally don't think you should care about rates much at all because some years they'll be headwinds and others they'll be tailwinds, what's important is that your investments long-term will be able to continue to grow with the economy.\n\nThe stocks which have out performed this year solely because they're better plays in a higher rate environment could end up being very bad investments over the next several years if these moves in rates are unsustainable. Personally I don't think that risk is highlighted enough here and I worry those who have over allocated to \"safe\" dividend stocks this year could see fairly mediocre returns going forward if rates move back down. But people can do what they like, it's just I suspect a lot of them would be better off buying bonds if they're buying dividend stocks simply because they have a low risk-appetite.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Solid points...

We are not focused anymore. \n\nElon has done a lot for Tesla. There is no Tesla without Elon Musk. Whoever says otherwise has not followed Tesla like we have. \n\nI remember Elon joking that he hopes he know when he is senile as people who are senile don't realize it.  I also remember Elon joking that when simulation and reality don't agree; Reality wins. I don't know if it is an information bubble, Dunning - Kruger effect or all the 16 hour days catching up but Elon is not the same. He is not focused. I have tried to hold out hope that someone from Elon's friends will sit with him and talk him down but unfortunately it seems he has become very insular and is going deeper and deeper into his rabbit hole. \n\nTesla's future is in jeopardy in my opinion not because they are not making great products but because the thing that made them unique and the most valuable car company in the world is being lost. The laser focus and overarching vision is in danger. I have never been invested in any brand ever other than Tesla. I have been invested in their vision.

It's completely ridiculous that car sharing is still an infant industry, with few serious players.\n\nI can't wait for the day where you can pay a monthly subscription and get access to a car network, without fuss. The car comes to you, takes you where you need to go, waits for you if a return trip is needed within a short term, or goes somehere else if not. So many people use their car, that can host 5 people + cargo, to commute by themselves. I understand that public transport is not always ideal for people, since not everyone can live on a well deserved public transport line, and that's where I see the role of robotaxis. It's basically \"individual public transportation.\"\n\nTesla is the only company positionned to seize that market with both hands. The other players have the cars OR the software and robotaxi needs both. Tesla can leverage its vertical integration and design a car that is married to the software and the value proposition. Model 3 and Y are already a step in that direction. They are feeding the self driving AI and the design language is in line with the robotaxi notion.\n\nI also think the cybertruck is a step in that direction. The style is definitely jarring but from a manufacturing perspective, the design is a lot simpler to make than traditional trucks. If they can make a small cybercar in the same vein, manufacturing it in very simple steps through gigapress machines and simple folding and entirely skipping the paint studio, those cars will be extremely cost effective.\n\nNone of this is interesting for someone who NEEDS a truck because they live in the woods and use it daily as a work vehicle.

Brand safety matters.\n\nHere's the part that will probably get me downvoted into oblivion‚Ä¶  Regardless of Asperger's or being on the spectrum or whatever the heck he has going on, Musk clearly has a severe case of Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  And the prognosis for people with NPD is extremely bleak.  As they get older, narcissists only get worse.  More demanding, more abusive, more self-centered, more impulsive, more and more impervious to the needs and wants of anyone but themselves.  Narcissists can be brilliant, and extremely charming when they want to be, but ultimately they descend into some form of tyrant.\n\nAnd there's something else, something even more alarming, going on with Musk now.  Just look at how erratic and unstable his behavior has been over the past year especially.  Making impulsive decisions, then changing his mind, then suddenly changing his mind back again.  It has become a pattern, and is only getting worse.  Personally, I think there must be some kind of drug addiction at work here.  It's the most logical explanation for his erratic behavior and frequent mood swings.\n\nIt's a shame because I think there are a lot of brilliant people working at Tesla, it is a great company, and a lot of good people who believe in the company have put their money into it.  But unless the Board of Directors can force Musk out, I don't see this ending well.  Considering his vast wealth, Musk is beyond the point where anybody can argue with him or make him do anything he doesn't already want to do.\n\nThere may be some temporary respites, but he's only going to get worse from here.\n\nETA: [https://twitter.com/GabeHoff/status/1603820718084481025](https://twitter.com/GabeHoff/status/1603820718084481025)\n\n(The entire thread is a good read.)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I meant emotionally invested.

I imagine most people do not get Elon's tweets directly from twitter but rather read about it in the news afterwards.  This is an important difference because it allows the media to set the context around a tweet first, either through omission or bringing other irrelevant information, thereby changing how the tweets are interpreted.\n\nI don't know all the context for every tweet because nobody has time to look into all that, but here is an example of one I did look into from the recent twitter saga.  \n\nMedia narrative - Elon Musk fires employees for correcting him.  The implication being 1) Elon doesn't know what he is doing because someone who supposedly has more expertise said he was wrong. 2) He can't handle criticism\n\nSo here is the actual story.  Elon Musk doesn't run the profiling himself.  He asks the engineers to do that for him and they are the ones that gave him the 1000+ number.  \n\nhttps://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1592176202873085952\n\nSo this guy then says Elon, who actually had multiple people test it, is wrong.  Well, Elon is very open to being corrected.  He previously sent an email where he stated.\n\nEmail me back to explain why what I said was incorrect. Sometimes, I‚Äôm just plain wrong!\n\nAnd we see exactly that same sentiment in the thread.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/EricFrohnhoefer/status/1592010924017258498\n\nSo we can see that Elon asked two questions here so lets analyze the replies.  \n\nWhat is the number [of RPC calls]? His answer... \"Zero\".  So 1000 to 100 is one thing, but 1000 to 0 means they are talking about completely different things.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/truth_tesla/status/1592171168693424128\n\nSo RPC is remote procedure call.  Basically code that is executed remotely such as over a network.  Understanding this will be important later. \n\nNow either he is incompetent and doesn't know the common definition, or he did know and was being a jerk so he could say he one up'ed Elon.\n\nAs for the second question: What have you done to fix the slowness? His answer.. \"we have done a bunch\".  That's literally the whole answer.. which is completely unacceptable when asked by one's boss.  However, he does proceed to answer a third unasked question of what can we do to speed it up.  So lets analyze those.\n\n1) Bloated with features that get little usage - So he is saying there are too many features, that are executing code that is unneeded, some of which are executed over the network perhaps? aka RPCs...\n\n2) Tech debt - extremely generic problem meaning taking the easy solution now at the expense of making it harder later.  Its not directly related to speed of the app, but rather speed of development.\n\n3) Waiting for network responses. - As in, code executed over the network is taking too long? perhaps because too many RPCs?\n\nSo yea, he was wrong without providing evidence and was clearly not as much of an expert as he thinks he is.
