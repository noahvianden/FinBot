Pretend that exercise and assignment work exactly like share-settled contracts, only instead of the shares themselves you deliver/receive the cash value of the shares.\n\nSo for your +3800/-3850c spread vs 3900 SET, exercise of the 3800c means you pay 3800/share x 100 in cash in order to receive 3900/share x 100 in cash.

If you owe the net difference, you only pay the net difference. If you receive the net difference, you only get the net difference.

It's true you might not know if your short contract is assigned or not, but you are never going to get or receive more than the net, and when the decision between assignment vs. not is close, it means the net is small.

The share price of an ETF is usually normalized to $100 (or $50 or $20, whatever the marketing department thinks is a good price) upon inception, regardless of the underlying index value, so an initial mapping of index price to that share price is done, and then where the ETF share price goes from there is all according to the index tracking method mentioned above.

I think macro is driving the picture right now, and will be for the foreseeable future.\n\nCHPT doesn’t install the stations themselves. They sell the hardware, software, and warranty to station owners who then foot the bill, or use subsidies to install them. The owner can decide to charge a fee or not, and if they do then CHPT gets a 10% cut, but the real money is from the hardware sale and the ongoing software and warranty payments. \n\nCHPT can’t handle building all of those obviously, but they will certainly get a large share of them. There are a number of large competitors in the market and CHPT is known as one of the best but also one of the most expensive. I still feel that $4B is a fair value for this business as it sits currently.

The cost of sending a standard 40-foot container from China to the U.S. West Coast is $1,935 — down more than 90 percent from its September 2021 peak of $20,586, according to the online freight marketplace Freightos.\nThe moderation in inflation is just beginning to appear in government statistics. In October, the Federal Reserve’s preferred price gauge, the personal consumption expenditures index, posted its smallest monthly increase since September of last year, and is up 6 percent over the past 12 months. The better-known consumer price index is rising at an annual rate of 7.7 percent, down from 9.1 percent in June.\n“The worst of the inflation is behind us,” said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist for TS Lombard in New York. “The question is where does inflation settle?”", "id": "zchnbe", "created_utc": 1670179165.0, "score": 376, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 356, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1413|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sxeqdj/game_theory_metafacebook/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/syv0mn/russian_conflict_stocks_ev_tesla_solar/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t55wc7/boil_uso_much_more_room_left/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s8ilg4/corz_ipo_today_core_scientific_youre_welcome/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t4ju4p/ev_tesla_community_talk_tuesday/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xazi6s/caap_slowest_upward_trend_ive_seen_but_making/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x40xrp/caap_deep_value_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t3hc0k/tsla_multi_trillion_dollar_company/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t8saqb/xop_oil_gas_etf/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=zchnbe)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=zchnbe)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: We're already seeing moderating inflation rates, and this is expected to continue in the coming months.

Its kind of a \"cheat\" to return value to shareholders in a \"free\" or reduced cost way. You could pay a dividend, but people have to pay taxes on those usually, and its counted as regular income vs. long term capital gains when you sell a stock. \n\nSo apple is sitting on $50B or whatever it is these days, and the best way they think they can return value to their shareholders is to increase the value of their shares via a buyback, as opposed to spending on R&D, buying a new tech, or issuing a dividend, etc...", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "They can then take those shares they bought at $1 for $50 total, and wait for their share price to climb to say $4.

Usually, these exchanges are offered by market makers, although you can have brokers offer them. However, since it’s offered by MMs, there’s a lot of liquidity available and that won’t matter. The MMs can then offer a price for bulk orders, which does factor in the size which isn’t the best price for a normal trade, but for the size of these trades it is.\n\nImportantly, since said trade is unknown to the public, it doesn’t have an immediate impact until the trades are publicly disclosed (which needs to happen at some point, but occurs after a delay). If they did this, it would cause a large price change, say a $10 asset going up to $12 causing an average price of $11ps, where the dark pool will offer it at $10.50. It also prevents liquidity issues. For example, you want to purchase $10b worth of shares in a firm worth $15b, you may find that once this trade is known, over $5b won’t be available for sale. Hence, going back to the original point, the price isn’t affected immediately, and thus has no impact on the person (or usually institution) making that trade.
