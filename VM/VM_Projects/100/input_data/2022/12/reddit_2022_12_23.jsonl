This year I'm not going home for Christmas but I've really been enjoying listening to those old Christmas carols, like \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\".

Of course there was the Cold War, but the USA had made it out of the Depression, and they had won the war. I think there was a spirit of optimism and even good will and cooperation in the western world.  Civil rights were a problem, but the ball started rolling for that in that era, too.  I dunno.  I hear that optimism reflected in that music.  And I was just thinking, that must be the Warren Buffet era.  And I just checked.  He bought his first stock at age 11, which would be in 1941.  It was indeed his era.\n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't invest, please, I'm 100% invested and I don't short!  This isn't investment advice, just a reflection on the state of things which I think has some relevance if you've decided to humor me thus far.  But I think the Warren era is over.  I don't feel that optimism in the USA anymore.  I don't even feel it here in Spain (even if for whatever reason life feels more down-to-Earth here).  I dunno.  It's a new era.  I guess the first cracks in the USA showed with Vietnam, which was about 50 years ago.  And around then Nixon closed the gold window.  Yes, we had the \"Great Moderation\" after that, but could you really call it a moderation when everything came crashing down in 2008?

Just note this doesn’t have anything to do about the financial metrics you are asking for but why i see this stock falling in the near future. And again i see it growing but it has to come to reality. \n1. Elon and the twitter deal\n he has sold millions of tsla shares worth i believe 32 billion, and still is owing money with high interest rates. \n2. He is destroying his brand with how he does not seem to care at all about the investors who have worked hard to earn and invest there money that are getting demolished in this market. \n3. His main base was democrats in california buying his EVs, now he is supporting free speech on twitter which we know the republicans are happy about and they would never buy a tsla let alone be able to afford one. (I do not care about politics to me it’s a huge circus)\n4. He hired a global ceo in china who has no idea how united states economy actually works\n5. Brags about great margins, which can be a good or bad thing for what i’m about to say, he is cutting his production in china and prices of his cars in half, lowered 5 times in the last year. \n6. Struggling with texas, and germany factories to produce and find people to work, while they are freezing hiring, and also planning more layoffs q1 2023\n7. It is a car manufacturer, in one of the most competitive times for automobiles, other companies are making them for cheaper and way better quality, have you every sat in a tesla and checked out how all the materials come together? \nI know i have and i would never buy one, if i could even afford one. \n8. going back to 3, he is turning away his main customers and heavily getting involved with politics \n9. every time he tweets the stock tanks, right when he said he would stop being twitters ceo the stock jumped 3% in aftermarket\n10. he experienced most of his growth during a time when stocks were getting pumped like crazy and it was a trend to buy an EV which was only tesla at the time. Now other companies like ford, bmw, merc, and hyundai are getting into the mix with longer lasting, and better quality cars\n11. i understand they do solar energy as well but enph is a much better company with their iq8 microinverters which means they only have to replace a portion of a panel instead of a whole one if something goes wrong, they are currently developing the iq9 as well. just look at how enph has grown in the last couple years, which will come down as well while the market bottoms more. \nyou can look at all the financials of a company but i like to think you should invest in what you see in real life, and what i see is a bunch of unhappy people with how elon is managing this whole situation, tslas overflowing dealership lots, and more and more people buying other evs over tsla because who can really afford to get into debt for a car at the moment, especially such an overpriced car. \nLet alone elon facing margin lawsuits and tsla getting investigated for more occurrences with its self driving capabilities. \nPersonal experience as well - a lady using auto drive almost smashed right into me because it didn’t sense my car. That scares me to want to buy one in the future and invest in it before these problems get sorted out which can hurt the company more in the future. \nOnce everything gets figured out and demand starts picking up, they have all the production in the world and a headstart on the EV market.

In addition, the company's balance sheet is healthy, with assets totaling $74.4 million and relatively low liabilities of $33.3 million. These are all positive indicators that suggest TSLA is financially stable.\n2. Positive earnings growth: TSLA has demonstrated strong earnings growth in recent years, with a three-year average earnings growth rate of 85.4%. This suggests that the company is generating increasing profits and could potentially continue to do so in the future.\n3. Attractive valuation: TSLA's valuation metrics are currently attractive, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 35.6 and a price-to-sales ratio of 4.2. These ratios are lower than the industry average, which suggests that the stock may be undervalued.\nBearish Reasons:\n1. High debt levels: TSLA has relatively high levels of debt, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.5.

Since China is currently something like almost 40% their sales.  \n\nI would look at Europe and look at their current sales level.  I would also start looking at their market share trends.  I would then look at what they were trying to do in Europe over the next 2 years, and again, I would start worrying about margins. And the lofty, lofty growth they are trying to achieve.  Do I think they can grow sales significantly?  I do, but I think prices are going to bite them.\n\nOn to the US.  I would be more bullish about their prospects here.  IRA is going to help. But it’s basically just a wash with the interest rate increases over the past 12 months.  And when your cheapest car is almost 50k, and the model you sell the most of is over 65k, there’s going to be a lot of your customers that aren’t even eligible for the tax credit.

For every 10% price reduction the market for those vehicles double (basically who can afford those) so in a sense, you answered your own question.

I’ve heard a lot of noise but no actual data leads me to think that there will be a slowdown there, especially as they bring in cheaper versions of their cars. \n\n2. Europe still has significant backlog. Again, unsure that demand isn’t there. Norway is a good example of a market leader and they just broke the record for the most of one vehicle ever sold in a year (model y) which was held by the VW beetle for decades. \n\n3. US is looking good with the IRA, the inventory has vanished (personally was thinking I’d take advantage and upgrade my 3 to a Y but there were 0 within 200 miles of me). Cybertruck is going to be huge, I am not sure people are comprehending it yet, and deliveries will start this year on that. I would expect China to release a compact (only for Asia) end of 23, Europe to have its own in 24 and US to show more models this upcoming year. \n\nLastly, on the end of quarter discount, outside of the obvious ($7500 tax credit starts Jan 1) they probably will be moving to hardware 4 on all cars soon, which includes Hd radar. That will Osborne the ones they’re making today pretty quickly. Better to sell them now.

There’s currently zero wait for any Chinese made car in China, and China has incentives ending on dec 31.\n\nEurope’s backlog has shrunk dramatically throughout the quarter, and there are reportedly quite a number of countries with inventory available to be sold.  So we shall see how things look in a week.  Backlog can’t be too large if Tesla is choosing to ship german made cars to Taiwan.   \n\nTax credit is on sales date, not production date.

If you look at the latest filing [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000153949723000652/n3535\\_x1-pre14a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000153949723000652/n3535_x1-pre14a.htm) there is a lot of talk about the stock and why we shareholders should cover another bout of dilution, to finance directors' base salaries of at least $450,000 without even the added bonuses. To be honest, if I was going to be taken for a ride as a shareholder, I would at least have expected for the ride to be in a truck.\n\nSo now they're asking to raise the number of authorized shares from 800 million to 1.6 billion. Are they trying to mimic the FED? There's no way shareholders should agree to this madness without substantial sales secured - and I mean **secured**, not some vague LOIs from dubious companies that claim to take 100s of trucks \\*if\\* they get the subsidies from the right government.\n\nThe filing I refer to above talks a lot about selling shares, it hardly presents any evidence of solid truck sales.\n\nThe stock is being sold at above 60% short every day for the last days, and has been at above 50% sold short for weeks on a daily basis. The only reason this will head in the right direction (up) is if management is able to prove that customers are willing to take trucks today, not next year, not based on government subsidies alone.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't recall exactly the date of the interview but it was before I bought into NKLA where Michael Lohescheller stated in an interview that NKLAs target cash position is somewhere around $ 700m iirc.\n\nThe dilution does not surprise me. What I didn't expect is that the stock price fell far below $2 and now below $1 which is perhaps the reason why dilution happens to have this extend. Back then I thought a dilution of 30% is likely and add some FUD.. the SP is surely going to fall.\n\nI'm not a fan of paying executives such salaries either as long as the company can't sustain itself but on the other hand I couldn't tell you what I'd have done differently or what they should've done for that matter.\n\nThere's a lot of debate about Romeo and whether or not it was a waste of money but I think most of it boils down to demand being low right now.\n\nBEVs come with their issues like FCEVs. In both cases it's primarily the re-fueling issue although for BEVs it could be a range issue as well.\n\nHere's the thing.. nowadays you have to be early. And maybe NKLA is not just a bit too early with their FCEVs, but they're also handed the current economic environment and they are forced to dilute much more than they expected themselves I assume. I doubt dilution is in their own interest. \n\nAll in all, it's been a risky investment from the start. I still believe that there's a chance for demand to rise and there's nothing wrong if it's driven by incentives at the begging. Not unusual for new technologies.

But now they've really run out of excuses.\n\nI'm curious to see how this goes over the next couple of months. I don't think that management deserves any of the compensation they want right now, so there's a NO vote. They should go back to earning $1 a year with no other compensation until they show actual results. On the other hand, with the share price at 0.82 right now and likely to go even lower, the risk here is getting pretty low.

{"title": "Why you should be terrified everyday inflation is only “waning”", "selftext": "In 1964 a gallon of gas cost about a quarter.  So how did we get to today’s price?  Through inflation.  The fed targets 2% inflation per year to spur people to invest their money and not keep it in the mattress.  Essentially, if you save that money in a safe it’s losing a compounded 2% annually.  Several times since 1971, inflation has run away including in the 70’s and each time we had to raise interest rates above the rate of inflation to swiftly stop it.  We’re not raising fast enough in this case and that’s a huge problem for the rest of our lives. \n\nWhy is it important to swiftly stop inflation?  Because they never fully deflate,  prices don’t go back to pre-inflationary prices.  That is how gas becomes 3-5$ instead of 0.25c over 58 years.  Which means that if this inflation only wanes down 0.1% for months on end then your prices, for the rest of the of your life, are rising higher and higher and these prices will be the new normal.  They will stop their measures at 2% inflation and where we land is the now normal for pricing.  \n\nFor every 1% in inflation we gain that is 1% you have lost for the rest of your life. Because they don’t reverse it.  They only get to 2% and stop.  We have now gained somewhere close to 10% in 2 years.  That means for the rest of your life now 10% of your earnings, that you don’t make up in raises, is gone and it will be compounded by an extra 2% annually and other high inflationary periods.  \n\nYou should be screaming for them to raise faster as they did in the late 70’s because you now have to make 10% per year in the market to even stay above the new prices you will pay.    That is impossible for most.  Don’t believe me?  Look up consumer prices from the late 60’s, 70’s and 80’s.  We don’t ever roll them back to where they were.  \n\nSure you will get some back in the form of raises, but you won’t get it all back and this is called erosion of your purchase power.  Ever hear how people in the 1950’s and 60’s could buy a house and 2 cars and pay them off in 4-7 years?  Their houses cost 10k and cars 2k and they had salaries of 10k or more per year.  The same house and cars you pay 100k+ and 50k+ for.  The wage increases never match inflation and slowly the poor and middle class are bled to death.\n\nHopefully this spurs some of you to understand monetary policy in this country better, it’s the single biggest destroyer of our livelihoods.", "id": "ztlkt9", "created_utc": 1671813126.0, "score": 1041, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 577, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|805|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ugz3jr/face_rip_rally_is_on_and_not_done/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ztlkt9/why_you_should_be_terrified_everyday_inflation_is/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n\nHey /u/Revolutionary_Elk345, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: Inflation is important to stop because it never goes away and prices just keep going up.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Fuck off", "score": 27, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ban this motherfucker", "score": -24, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "why don't they do a stock split on the hundred dollar bill so we can have cheap houses again", "score": 419, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)", "score": 18, "replies": []}, {"body": "They need to stock split the house. 4 families per house instead of 1.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Actually it was common practice in soviet countries, but mostly in flats not houses.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Totally agree.

Both of the spikes were caused by external factors in supply side disruptions he couldn't control, but the internal readings of inflation reacted appropriately to his actions of raising the rates at a sharper rate than the Fed has done in 2022. This includes deflation on prices in the mid-1970s, which few people took advantage of at the time because unions were already starting to feel the impact of increased productivity in emerging Japan and revitalized Western European sectors.\n\nSeparately,\n\nYour premise that prices never deflate is inaccurate. Deflation was a major contributor to the death spiral of world economies in the Great Depression. Its the reason why central banks avoid it as much as possible from a macro perspective. However, they embrace it in localized economic sectors, which is what we see in the second half of 2022 with the rapid decline in gasoline and related energy prices.\n\nAdditionally, due to technology advances and productivity multipliers, an apples-to-apples comparison of say a car in 1940 versus a car in 2010 is extremely misleading. The level of capability, quality of life improvements, etc. are necessary factors to look at in several sectors when judging inflation's impact. While base commodities are often used to simplify the inflation math, you can't avoid looking at the productive power of a gallon of gas in 1960 versus the same gallon of gas in 2020 terms.

The costs of salaries and wages are a fraction of the prices to make stuff. There's value added at each step in the supply chain. The amount of money to spend, all things equal, is smaller than the price of all output by necessity in a vacuum. So without any sort of consumer/corporate debt, the output won't clear and the obvious thing to do is to reduce how many people you employ. You don't need to make that much output if you're not selling it. And demand may reduce from there and reduce employment. But in the real world, there's all this margin buying for appreciating assets, refinancing, consumer credit and corporate debt to meet payrolls and invest. So the output can clear with lots of debt. But then you have this problem if no one gets paid more, then eventually a month comes around where people can't go into more debt because they were unable to pay off their old debts. They have to pay off the debt with their income rather than purchase more stuff or to invest in more output creation or capital. So the same thing happens especially if you factor in interest rates. That situation can go on for a while if it's like corporate debt purchasing appreciating assets, but the cycle is nonetheless inevitable and those will probably end up depreciating in the long run in a system with no inflation. So ultimately, it must be so that salaries/wages increase together in different parts of the economy alongside price increases and profits for economic stability (in a super closed system, but it's not a given that exporting will be entirely possible). Salaries and wages go up, they eat away at markups, so prices have to increase if there is to be profit. If there isn't profit, they'll fire people and demand will decrease. If salaries/wages don't go up in some fashion over time, output won't clear and an efficient system will not hire as many people if output doesn't clear consistently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA 2% inflation target is more than just trying to compel people to not keep money under their mattress because things are getting more expensive in the future.

Its likely we will see fewer vehicles being used and a greater share of driver-less 'carpooling' utilized in major cities; Its expected to increase roughly 7 fold by 2030.\n\nGiven what Toyota has alluded to this past week regarding EVs, we could see new alternatives to electric showing up. And Toyota is 10.5% of global sales so that says someting. \n\nThe supply chain for EV battery materials necessary to meet these targets has to drastically increase as well and Musk already intends on innovating in this area as well.

For instance, most flagship cars look the same. Their are slight differences, but even still, Tesla has its own aesthetic that some like and some don't. Tesla also has good performance when compared to other pure EVs, and as mentioned above, the battery performance is unparalleled (unless compared to Asian EVs, which are very nice). So yes, the concept of first to market brand loyalty does stand firm. For instance, people often only buy Ford because their family is full of Ford buyers. Some only buy Toyota for the same reason. The parallels are still there, obviously cars are different from phones, but the power of branding is the same in both of these markets. We could run in circles about this, but I don't think either of us are moving the other with regards to this point - that is okay\n\nJobs said tons of dumb things, did dumb things, and was notoriously mean to others in his life. There are lots of parallels to be made between Musk and Jobs, both positive and negative. At the end of the day, they are both best known for bringing great thinkers together to make strong brands. To be fair, Jobs was more socially responsible, but it's also important to remember that Elon is on the autistic spectrum. I find it ironic how quickly people make fun of Elon's social failings, when the guy has talked about this, and when so many of those that pick on him are supposedly conscious about not being ableists. Imagine if people were consistent with their empathy... At the end of the day, Musk is more socially reprehensible, but the good he has done for the world is far greater than what Jobs did. I'm happy to see someone with as much money as Musk has care about creating a more renewable form of transportation. Sure, EVs mainly run on coal electricity right now, but Tesla has also done work to push for interconnected solar power grids. This was all done intentionally, and sure it isn't cheap, but Elon is trying to save the world some carbon emissions. Tesla forced the car industry to move forward with EV investments, and now people belittle Tesla for this monumental effort that they pursued (notably without profit for many years)\n\nAnd you're wrong about mobile eye. On the surface it may look like it's the same result, because self driving is still iterating, but these are vastly different technologies. Watch the Tesla A.I. Day if you don't believe me.

Tesla's market share of all cars is increasing, despite their share of EVs decreasing. Lets say that EVs make up 1% of cars one year and tesla has a 90% market share of EVs, that gives them a market share of 0.9% in all cars. Lets say at another point in time EVs make up 5% of cars and tesla only has a 50% market share of EVs, in this case Tesla would have a 2.5% market share in all cars. So here you can see that despite their EV market share decreasing from 90% to 50% they would still increase their market share of the overall market from 0.9% to 2.5%.

How many will be sold in the overall market?\n\nThe data that you did provide is quite simple and not very helpful.\n\nThe reason I bring up 2021 is because they had very good sales growth that year while overall new vehicles sales were not so robust. So yeah, they did gain in overall marketshare, and I’m wondering if that’s the data that you read in the past, and continue to present it as current facts or future projections?\n\nEven if you could provide some reasonably unbiased figures from someone without a vested interest, that also took into account that new vehicle interest is averaging 6.6%, and macro markets are facing headwinds so a lot less people are financing pricey EVs with their HELOC, (etc!) you’re still only looking a tiny fraction of growth in the overall market which is certainly nowhere near proportional to the overall market capitalization. \n\nThe whole reason Tesla is Tesla was because of its control of the EV market, which appears to be diminishing, with no help from the CEO and his current side hustle.
