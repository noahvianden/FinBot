Please elaborate as much as you can!!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "An options price has two componentes, intrinsic value and extrinsic value.  Intrinsic value happens when the contract is in the money which makes sense when you think about it.  For example if the strike of a call is $50 and the underlying is currently priced at $60, then the right to buy shares at $50 has value.  Extrinsic value is more about time and volatility.  So when a contract is out of the money, it only has extrinsic value since there is no intrinsic value in a contract to buy shares at $50 when the underlying is priced at $40.\n\nNow let’s bring this back to delta.  Yes, delta is an estimate of the expected change in contract value based on the underlying moving 1 point.  There is more value in an in the money contract than an out of the money contract so it’s reasonable to think that contracts at different strikes would have different price changes.\n\nNow let‘s talk time.  Extrinsic value tends to drop over time as the contract approaches expiration.  So it’s reasonable to think that the price changes based on price movement would also be different here.\n\nAnother analogy that might help.  Floor traders have long used the delta of a contract to estimate the probability that a contract will expire at least $.01 in the money at expiration.  It’s not an exact probability but it’s close enough.  So in that light, seeing different deltas at different strikes and different times makes sense as well.  Ever notice that a contract at or very near the money is about $.50?  That would tell a trader that contract has about a 50% chance of being in the money which makes sense when it’s right at the money since it could just as easily go either way.  Once it starts to move away from the money those probabilities would change based on the amount and direction of the move.\n\nAnyway, hopefully something in this gives you an idea of why deltas are different.

If there is a big down move, the other purpose of the puts are to prevent margin call (by expanding in value as the overall portfolio drops) - is there a standard or best practice to avoid margin calls?\n\nAll of the above are viable techniques. It all comes down to how much money you want to pay for insurance. By analogy, if you have a $500k house, it would be silly to spend more than $500k on insurance for it, so you pay some amount less according to your risk of loss. So you have to figure out your probability-weighted risk of loss and then hedge accordingly. For example (very simplified), if you think there is a 10% chance of total loss of the house, you should pay no more than $50k/year for insurance that covers the entire value of the house.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the cost of the hedge directly reduces your forward rate of return.

While the chaos at Twitter isn’t Tesla’s concern, Ms. Warren raised the possibility that many of Mr. Musk’s actions may be shortchanging Tesla.*\n\nMs. Warren asked whether Mr. Musk’s diverting of resources from Tesla — including software engineers and senior executives — is harming the carmaker. In her letter, the senator also questioned whether Mr. Musk’s assertion that their being seconded to Twitter was purely voluntary, citing an anonymous employee who told CNBC, “most would also feel it was impossible to turn down a direct request from Mr. Musk without later facing poor performance reviews or other consequences.”\n\nMs. Warren also suggested the possibility of Mr. Musk **intentionally shortchanging either Twitter or Tesla to benefit the other**, including Twitter potentially overcharging Tesla for ads or tweaking the social network’s algorithms to benefit the carmaker.

{"title": "Toyota Chief Says ‘Silent Majority’ Has Doubts About Pursuing Only EVs", "selftext": "BURIRAM, Thailand—Toyota Motor Corp. TM -0.87%decrease; red down pointing triangle President Akio Toyoda said he is among the auto industry’s silent majority in questioning whether electric vehicles should be pursued exclusively, comments that reflect a growing uneasiness about how quickly car companies can transition.\n\nAuto makers are making big bets on fully electric vehicles, investments that have been bolstered by robust demand for the limited numbers of models that are now available.\n\nStill, challenges are mounting—particularly in securing parts and raw materials for batteries—and concerns have emerged in some pockets of the car business about the speed to which buyers will make the shift, especially as EV prices have soared this year.\n\n“People involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority,” Mr. Toyoda said to reporters during a visit to Thailand. “That silent majority is wondering whether EVs are really OK to have as a single option. But they think it’s the trend so they can’t speak out loudly.”\n\nWhile major rivals, including General Motors Co. and Honda Motor Co., have set dates for when their lineups will be all-EV, Toyota has stuck to a strategy of investing in a diverse lineup of vehicles that includes hydrogen-powered cars and hybrids, which combine batteries with gas engines.\n\nThe world’s biggest auto maker has said it sees hybrids, a technology it invented with the debut of the Toyota Prius in the 1990s, as an important option when EVs remain expensive and charging infrastructure is still being built out in many parts of the world. It is also developing zero-emission vehicles powered by hydrogen.\n\n“Because the right answer is still unclear, we shouldn’t limit ourselves to just one option,” Mr. Toyoda said. Over the past few years, Mr. Toyoda said, he has tried to convey this point to industry stakeholders, including government officials—an effort he described as tiring at times.\n\nGlobal car companies have made a sharp pivot to electric vehicles within the last few years, driven in part by the success of EV-only maker Tesla Inc.\n\nTraditional auto makers such as Toyota, Ford and GM are also facing new competition from startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group Inc., which make EVs exclusively and have captivated Wall Street in recent years.\n\nAt the same time, the legacy auto makers have a much broader base of customers, including many living in rural areas and developing economies with unreliable electricity supplies.\n\nAnd their gas-engine businesses are still driving the bulk of profits needed to fund the costly shift to electric vehicles, which not only requires the development of new models but also construction of new facilities and battery plants.\n\nThe infrastructure to charge electric vehicles is meanwhile still lacking in the U.S. and many other parts of the world, making owning an EV still a challenge for many types of consumers.\n\nAccording to J.D. Power, the market share for EVs in the U.S. has risen sharply in the last couple of years. As of October, it was around 6.5% of the total new-car market, the firm said.\n\nBut that is largely because EV sales are growing faster in places such as California, where there are more options and a greater willingness among buyers to make the shift, J.D. Power analysts say. Sticker prices for electric vehicles have also jumped this year because of the rising cost of battery materials, limiting the pool of buyers who can afford one.\n\nAuto executives say the uptake on EVs could be uneven for some time, and that gas-powered models, along with hybrids and plug-in hybrids, will endure for many years to come.\n\n“The coastal areas, the East and West Coast, that’s electrifying much quicker than the interior of the country,” said Jim Rowan, chief executive of Sweden’s Volvo Car AB. Mr. Rowan said plug-in hybrids serve the purpose of providing buyers with an option if they aren’t ready to go full electric and are important to warming them up to the technology.\n\nRyan Gremore, an Illinois-based dealer, who owns several brand franchises, said he gets a lot of customers inquiring about EVs, in part because of limited supplies.\n\nThat might give the impression of robust demand, but it is unclear how it will materialize when inventory levels at dealerships normalize, he added. “Is there interest in electric vehicles? Yes. Is it more than 10% to 15% of our customer base? No way,” Mr. Gremore said.\n\nMr. Toyoda’s long-held skepticism about a fully electric future has been shared by others in the Japanese car industry, as well.\n\nMazda Motor Corp. executives once cautioned that whether EVs were cleaner depends largely on where the electricity is produced. They also worried that EV batteries were too big and expensive to replace gas-powered models and better suited to the types of smaller vehicles that Americans didn’t want.\n\nNissan Motor Co., which launched the all-electric Leaf over a decade ago, had until recently taken a more cautious stance on EVs with executives saying they were waiting to see how the demand would materialize.\n\nNissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said the company moved too aggressively with the Leaf early on, but lately demand for EVs has been growing faster than many had initially expected. Nissan said last year it would spend roughly $14.7 billion to roll out new battery-powered models. Now, Mr. Uchida said it may need to spend more.\n\nThe wild card, he said, is regulations and government subsidies globally that could speed adoption even more. “Would that be enough? The answer is it may not be,” Mr. Uchida said.\n\nMr. Toyoda has argued that fully electric models aren’t the only way to reduce carbon emissions, saying hybrid vehicles sold in large volumes can also deliver a short-term impact. “It’s about what can be done now,” he said.\n\nMr. Toyoda’s cautionary tone toward EVs has caused some concern from investors and consumers that the auto maker could be falling behind in the EV race.\n\nToyota has been slower than rivals to roll out fully electric models in major markets such as the U.S., with its bZ4X electric SUV being recalled earlier this year because of a potential safety problem.\n\nMr. Toyoda said the auto maker was taking all types of vehicles seriously, including EVs. In late 2021, it revealed plans to spend up to $35 billion on its EV lineup through 2030. Since then, Toyota has disclosed sizable investments in EV manufacturing capacity in the U.S.\n\nThe Toyota chief also said alternatives to EVs, such as hydrogen-powered vehicles, were beginning to get a warmer reception from government officials, members of the media and others involved in the auto industry.\n\n“Two years ago, I was the only person making these kinds of statements,” Mr. Toyoda said.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota-president-says-silent-majority-has-doubts-about-pursuing-only-evs-11671372223?mod=hp_lead_pos5", "id": "zpgxoj", "created_utc": 1671421269.0, "score": 1629, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 752, "comments": [{"body": "I think Toyotas reliance on hybrids, albeit very good ones, puts them in a weird spot where if they went electric they might not see the same range as they are now, which might be a deterrent to some.", "score": 210, "replies": [{"body": "I think they are looking towards next gen battery tech too maybe for pure EVs.

There are plenty of tests done in the battery tech world that show at best you might get several thousand chargers for a tame 21700, or just several hundred for a high drain 21700.

Where is this lauded efficiency?\n\n[EVs convert over 77% of the electrical energy from the grid to power at the wheels.

Meaning that many parts for EVs and ICEs literally come off the same assembly lines and can be fit interchangeably between the them (for similar models). For example, BMW uses what they call the [CLAR Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_CLAR_platform) for nearly their entire lineup of vehicles which include ICEs, Hybrids, and EVs.\n\n>Where is the lithium used in new vehicles? What about the cobalt? How do you dispose of it? How are they disposing of it?\n\nIn the batteries which can be recycled. Yes, there is less used in purely ICE vehicle applications than hybrids/EVs. Depending on where you live, there are different legal requirements on how to handle battery disposal and in a growing number of places it's illegal to simply dump them in a landfill. I don't have the space/time to look up legal requirements for you. Google your local requirements if you want to find out more.

The reason you don't have it at your house is shipping/maintenance not engine efficiency. Which is why...natural gas IS used to heat homes, it's easy to pipe to houses and utilize. You can't pump high pressure flammable liquid in residential for safety concerns. It's not thermodynamic efficiency that prevents us from using personal generators it's cost of moving the resources and difficulties for safety.\n\nThere's a reason why power plants use whatever fuel to create steam directly for use in steam turbines and not burning it in piston based ICE's to generate power. [Turbines used by utilities can reach over 90%](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-07/documents/catalog_of_chp_technologies_section_4._technology_characterization_-_steam_turbines.pdf) efficiency. Even a diesel engine with a second stage heat capture system cannot touch that.

That old diesel engine you keep referring to? Absolutely horrible for the environment because it lacks emissions equipment. There are a lot of types of accidents that render a car unrepairable. Or maybe you run into corrosion issues. Or maybe the repair cost far exceeds the car's value and having a newer, more reliable car is desirable. Or maybe new regulatory standards have changed that make it difficult for you to register the car. Or maybe you're concerned about how unsafe old cars are compared to newer cars. Or maybe you now have a family and your existing vehicle isn't big enough. Or maybe you changed professions and your old car can't meet your current requirements.

{"title": "Why December CPI numbers are likely going to show deflation and why annualized inflation will rapidly approach 0 in 2023.", "selftext": "As we all know, inflation is the buzzword of the moment. However, November's CPI was only +.1%, which would be 1.2% inflation annually. The numbers have come down dramatically since June of 2022, which showed a month over month gain of 1.3%. In other terms, as of November 2022 data, the annualized rate has dropped to what the monthly rate was only five months prior - a 92% decrease. \n\nWhat will December CPI show? We have inklings. \n\nRetail gas prices, available here -\n\nhttps://ycharts.com/indicators/us_gas_price\n\nshow that we are down about 13-14% from November. \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/market-data/commodities\n\nNatural gas, crude oil, heating oil, and retail gas futures are all also down from November, variably so, but DOWN. An approximate 10-20% decrease across the board is apparent. \n\nWhat else is dropping? Food commodities are also visible at the WSJ chart, corn and wheat, coffee, all are plunging - the only exceptions are cattle and sugar. \n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf\n\nAs we can see from the CPI inputs, we have data at our fingertips showing that most of the inputs are down A LOT from November. Groceries and eating out are stickier than the raw commodity prices so they will not match the futures exactly, but the trend is down. The car market is also f*cked. The only numbers we cannot get (unless someone can - would be great!) are for shelter and the other factors at the bottom of the chart, but with the recent revisions to the BLS job numbers (no growth!) and the stalled housing market I think rents are also probably stable at this point. \n\nWhat does this mean? \n\nApparently the \"trading economics\" forecast for December CPI is +.2%. I disagree with this. Energy prices have been falling significantly since mid November, as have most commodity prices across the board. The rise in interest rates has already put us into recession IMO even if the numbers do not confirm this yet, and I believe fed policy is misguided as this entire fiasco was due to the supply chain issues generated by COVID and the invasion of Ukraine, NOT from loose monetary policy which was necessary to keep the economy afloat in the face of both crises. \n\nIn sum, I think the data we already have for December - barring something unforeseen at the end of the month - confirms that the next CPI print out will show DEFLATION. In fact, I would not be surprised if it was even -.5%. December 2021 CPI was +.6% (annualized +7.2%), if we are at 0% this month, inflation will have fallen by 100% year over year, and annualized CPI will drop to 6.5%. If we are -.5%, it will be down to 6%, a drop of 15.5% in one month! \n\nThe future is bleaker from there. The next print outs after Dec 21 were Jan 22 (+.6%), Feb 22 (+.8%), and March 22 (1.2%). April saw a relaxation (.3%), May went back up (+1%), and June was the peak (+1.3%). \n\nIf we assume 0% inflation through June 2023 - which I think may be GENEROUS given the energy numbers, the prohibitive interest rates, and the possible resolution of the Ukraine crisis and the continued amelioration of supply chain issues - off an annualized baseline of 6.5%, we would hit 5.9% in January, 5.1% in Feburary, 3.9% in March, 3.6% in April, 2.6% in May, and 1.3% in June. I.E., with values at zero and NOT negative, we are going to see today's annualized number become the actual annualized number as of 6/2023. \n\nIf December of 2022 comes in below 0 - i.e., -.5% as I think is quite possible given the energy plunge - things accelerate faster. Assuming we are at 6% annualized in Dec 2022 and the monthlies are -.3% through June 2023, we would be at 5.1% as of 1/22, 4% as of 2/22, 2.5% as of 3/22, 1.9% as of 4/22, +.6% as of 5/22, and -1% by June of 2022. \n\nBarring another black swan event - which is possible, but could also result in even more deflation! - the trajectory since June of 2022 would put as at annualized inflation of under 2% between March and June of 2023, with a risk of actual annualized DEFLATION also appearing sometime after April 2022 if the December trends continue. \n\nWhat does this mean? I think the Fed pivot will accelerate, I think we have one or, at most, two small hikes before the pause, and I also think that we will see rate CUTS by June of 2023. This likely portends a stock market bottom that has already occurred or will occur in Q1 of 2023, and if we see several consecutive negative CPI print outs, QE is likely back on the table by Q2-Q3 of 2023.", "id": "zpnu39", "created_utc": 1671445056.0, "score": 391, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 306, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wrote in a thread the other day that they should probably have done 25bps last week then pause because in all likeliness they've already overtightened. I also think a lot of people here are underestimating how rapidly things can get ugly once momentum shifts. It's not just the near-flat recent CPI prints, but extreme deceleration in MoM inflation that's is alarming because it suggests it's probably not going to stop here but likely go into deflation. And we know once started deflation is likely feed on itself if left so at some point the Fed will basically have no choice but to pivot should that happen.\n\nBut my theory from the start has always been that inflation was almost entirely a result of stimulus and high savings rates and fundamentally unsustainable. For example, normally when rates rise it balances supply and demand, so while things like mortgage rates might rise in a normal tightening cycle economic demand would be strong enough that people can still afford the higher rates. But no one can afford these rates today - it's not just balancing supply and demand, it's a brick wall. That alone implies they're far too high because unless they bring rates back down we'll basically need to see a housing crash to bring supply and demand back in balance.  The thing that's always separated this tightening cycle from others is that rates haven't moved higher because of some fundamental strength in the economy, and in the long-run it's always economic strength that's required to sustain higher rates. In fact I'd argue we probably have far more deflationary forces in the economy today given demographics and technological advancements.\n\nBut at the end of the day what I think is irrelevant, what's important for making money in the markets today is seconding guessing the moves of our central banker overlords and in my opinion they've signalled quite clearly that they want a recession and for people to lose their jobs and I don't think enough damage will be done by June. I also think Powell is always wrong and fundamentally unable to enact moderate monetary policy - he basically only has two modes, hyper stimulate or overtighten. So my assumption based on historical data is that they'll overtighten and hold rates too high for too long, then they'll drop them back to super accommodative when they blow up the economy.

Here is an update based on the most recent economic reports to help better understand where the economy currently sits and if a recession is still on the horizon.\n\n**Definition of a recession**\n\nA drop in output across all leading economic indicators defines a recession. More specifically, if employment levels drop, consumer spending decreases and industries don't produce as much as they did previously. These areas of economic activity have to be in a long-term decline for there to be an official call, a definitive recession.\n\nEven though the final monthly and quarterly numbers of these activities are used to determine a recession, they're not always representative of the state of the economy. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is the agency that calls a recession whenever it notes that economic indicators are showing continued signs of a slowdown.\n\nIn the past, the NBER would call a recession after two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP). What makes things different this time is that other economic indicators still showed strength during the same contraction period. This forced the NBER to reassess.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/12/13/recession-fears-are-we-unofficially-in-a-recession-now/?sh=756e13f832ef\n\nEdit: The response has been crazy...I thought that we are NOT in a recession according to everyone on Reddit?", "id": "zpz85s", "created_utc": 1671474124.0, "score": 332, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 318, "comments": [{"body": "all this handwringing over technical definition vs rule of thumb but just keep in mind it is okay to debate.

In this paper, we analyze the pandemic-era rise in retirements using a model that accounts for pre-pandemic trends in retirement, the cyclicality of retirement, and other factors. We show that: more than half of the increase in the retired share are \"excess retirements\" that would likely not have occurred in the absence of the pandemic; excess retirements have been concentrated among cohorts age 65 and older at the start of the pandemic; excess retirements have been largest among the college-educated and whites; and excess retirements reflect in part that worker transitions from the labor force to retirement remain elevated.

Brand perception is tangible and important, especially for purchases heavily wrapped in questions of personal identity and status like a new car.   Brand perception has been measurably harmed.  \n\nProducts do speak for themselves, you're right.  They announce \"this is who I am, this is the culture I align with\", and brands carefully manage what their products say and mean.  You think the swarms of massive, pristine pickup trucks dominating right wing suburbia are just rationally chosen products picked for their utilitarian functionality?  Don't be absurd.  They're cultural markers, powerful ones.   A strong product does speak for itself, but brand perception is literally part of product strength.\n\nFurther, the culture wars are all consuming.  The shifts in brand perception are not equally distributed, and point to an increasingly partisan view of the company on the part of consumers.  That is bad.  Very bad.  If Tesla is seen as being firmly on the right wing side of the culture wars that will be catastrophic for demand in the US and EU.  \n\nI think the years of online shitflinging over Tesla has led to a certain amount of built in willingness to ignore any question of \"sentiment\" because there's always been so much \"controversy\" of the sort that takes up a lot of words on reddit or twitter but doesn't mean a goddamn thing in the real world.   These were categorically different to the perception shift we're seeing now - they were largely about Tesla as a company and investment opportunity, not Tesla as a car brand.\n\nMost of the \"perception\" issues and \"controversy\" in the past have been confined to TSLA as stock or Musk personally.  This is the first time we've seen that spill over to Tesla as an automotive brand in a statistically measurable way.       Note that the relevant metrics existed throughout all of Elon's earlier silly dustups, and they barely moved.  *This time is different*. \n\nYou may still argue that it doesn't change the long term case for TSLA, but I don't think it's accurate to argue that this debacle hasn't harmed the company \"fundamentals\" in any way.  The concerning shifts in sentiment here are not about short term stock sentiment and the recent share price dive, they're about the big picture perception of Tesla  products among potential consumers.
