It’s science.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Putting in my bid for smart guy at the bottom:\n\nIn my experience there's two kinds of stupid on Reddit (and in the world).\n\nFirstly there's the blatantly idiotic like people saying \"$BBBY going to the moon baby!\" or \"TSLA way undervalued!\" and stuff like that. Or in a broader sense things like \"Covid no worse than a bad cold, government ain't gonna control us!\" There's a lot of this going around lately and I dunno if it's because people are poorly educated and frustrated or what, or if the internet has just given a voice to people who have no idea what they're talking about. But the thing is I'm not worried about these people. It's obvious when you see it.\n\nBut on the other hand there's the more dangerous phenomenon of a sort of academic or self-righteous idiot. These are the people saying \"VTI and chill\" and will point you to all sorts of data about how active investors never beat the market etc. These are the people who believe Jay Powell when he says \"inflation is transitory\" and cite all sorts of data despite it being obvious that the Fed is just looking for any excuse not to tighten. They're also the people who would have believed Bernanke when he said \"subprime is contained\" in '07, because I dunno, Bernanke knows what he's talking about, right?\n\nThe latter seems to be rooted in a strange sort of optimism and faith in our world and its institutions. Now look, I'm not saying we're headed for the apocalypse or that humanity hasn't achieved all sorts of wonderful things over the centuries. Not everything is gloom and doom. At the same time, however, there are real vulnerabilities. Our institutions did nothing to stop the Global Financial Crisis (actually they actively encouraged it), they have done nothing to reign in inequality, and they have done absolutely nothing about the tremendous debt overhang. There are real vulnerabilities in our system.I'm not going to say that the former idiotic type are enlightened, because they're not. But I do think they're reacting to a genuine sense of unfairness and frustration that they are feeling. Those of us with well-to-do families and well-paying jobs are doing OK. Guess what? That's not the majority of the world. The majority of the world is fucked, and it seems to be getting worse, or at least more and more unfair. So I understand why these \"idiotic\" types lash out and say stupid things and also believe fairytales that make them think they can get rich quick. This phenomenon didn't come out of nowhere.\n\nIt's not all gloom and doom, but the notion that things are gonna be smooth sailing the next 50 years like they have the last 50 is utterly misplaced IMO. VTI and chill worked well when the US was a unipolar dynamic giant. Now we're heading into a bipolar world (US and China) and we're starting to see real cracks in the system. We're starting to see QE and low rates, two things that have undeniably juiced the markets, go away. We're heading into an inflationary world thanks to a reversal of globalization, an aging population, and climate challenges. Democracy is under threat.  None of this bodes well for global productivity or the markets.\n\nIf you just want to VTI and chill, that's absolutely fine with me. If you can afford to put in a large sum every month, I imagine in 30-50 years when you retire you'll make out pretty good. But guess what? You might not make it out as good as someone who did the same in 1970. And guess what? Not everybody is getting paid enough to the point where they save so much that even if it's a shitty return well they still retire as multi-millionaires.\n\nI'm just saying, there is more than one way to play this thing, and the self-righteous \"VTI and chill\" herd mentality is, indeed, quite stupid. It's more nuanced than that, and I'm convinced that Reddit is getting it wrong here just like it gets it wrong on everything else.

Or in a broader sense things like \"Covid no worse than a bad cold, government ain't gonna control us!\"  There's a lot of this going around lately and I dunno if it's because people are poorly educated and frustrated or what, or if the internet has just given a voice to people who have no idea what they're talking about.  But the thing is I'm not worried about these people.  It's obvious when you see it.\n\nBut on the other hand there's the more dangerous phenomenon of a sort of academic or self-righteous idiot.  These are the people saying \"VTI and chill\" and will point you to all sorts of data about how active investors never beat the market etc.  These are the people who believe Jay Powell when he says \"inflation is transitory\" and cite all sorts of data despite it being obvious that the Fed is just looking for any excuse not to tighten.  They're also the people who would have believed Bernanke when he said \"subprime is contained\" in '07, because I dunno, Bernanke knows what he's talking about, right?\n\nThe latter seems to be rooted in a strange sort of optimism and faith in our world and its institutions.  Now look, I'm not saying we're headed for the apocalypse or that humanity hasn't achieved all sorts of wonderful things over the centuries.  Not everything is gloom and doom.  At the same time, however, there are real vulnerabilities.  Our institutions did nothing to stop the Global Financial Crisis (actually they actively encouraged it), they have done nothing to reign in inequality, and they have done absolutely nothing about the tremendous debt overhang.  There are real vulnerabilities in our system.\n\nI'm not going to say that the former idiotic type are enlightened, because they're not.  But I do think they're reacting to a genuine sense of unfairness and frustration that they are feeling.  Those of us with well-to-do families and well-paying jobs are doing OK.  Guess what?  That's not the majority of the world.  The majority of the world is fucked, and it seems to be getting worse, or at least more and more unfair.  So I understand why these \"idiotic\" types lash out and say stupid things and also believe fairytales that make them think they can get rich quick. This phenomenon didn't come out of nowhere.\n\nIt's not all gloom and doom, but the notion that things are gonna be smooth sailing the next 50 years like they have the last 50 is utterly misplaced IMO.  VTI and chill worked well when the US was a unipolar dynamic giant.  Now we're heading into a bipolar world (US and China) and we're starting to see real cracks in the system.  We're starting to see QE and low rates , two things that have undeniably juiced the markets, go away.  We're heading into an inflationary world thanks to a reversal of globalization, an aging population, and climate challenges.  Democracy is under threat.  None of this bodes well for global productivity or the markets. \n\nIf you just want to VTI and chill, that's absolutely fine with me.  If you can afford to put in a large sum every month, I imagine in 30-50 years when you retire you'll make out pretty good.  But guess what?  You might not make it out as good as someone who did the same in 1970.  And guess what?  Not everybody is getting paid enough to the point where they save so much that even if it's a shitty return well they still retire as multi-millionaires.\n\nI'm just saying, there is more than one way to play this thing, and the self-righteous \"VTI and chill\" herd mentality is, indeed, quite stupid.  It's more nuanced than that, and I'm convinced that Reddit is getting it wrong here just like it gets it wrong on everything else.

The rationale is more that range is not so important. It's great for marketing but most people use a car mostly for a daily commute which is not hundreds of miles and also typically you can charge at either end of the trip. Range by itself is simply not a deciding factor on the European market", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Porsche itself disagrees with you “The Taycan is the pure expression of a Porsche electric sports car. “. As far as range goes I disagree immensely with that assertion. Sure people use it for commuting but they also use it for trips. Tesla’s strength is it’s SC network. Everyone else is left using 3rd party charging which is entirely haphazard. Any time I use a non-Tesla charger it works maybe 25%-30% of the time.  Industry studies show the networks are up more than that 75%+ ( https://www.newsweek.com/electric-vehicle-charger-study-flawed-says-electrify-america-1714818?amp=1  ) but just going off my anecdotal experiences. That’s an issue especially if you live in a European context that may not have a garage or garage parking and are wholly dependent on outside charging for energy. Range suddenly matters a lot. Additionally, the cold dramatically changes range in real world driving and outside of a few southern countries the EU is cold. Norway in the summer is more like CA in the winter.\n\nRange anxiety is a real thing. You aren’t supposed to keep an EV at 100%. More like 80% MAX. So a 280 range turns to less than 235 immediately. If you’re driving somewhere for 50-60 miles each way suddenly you have less than 100 miles of range. It may be irrational but it’s also bad for the battery to drop lower than 20% (55 miles) based on the 80/20 rule. The real range you get on an 280 range car is 180 to stay within the band. Can you extend this sure of course but any time you charge to 100% you worry if you’re screwing the battery up or once you get lower you start worry about what you can turn off or what speed you should be at so you don’t kill range. \n\nIt’s way more complicated of a question. Tesla’s build quality is vastly inferior to Porsche. It’s not even close. But Tesla’s battery tech layer is better. Their UI is better. And the SC network removes a lot of anxiety. A Tesla also can carry a ton of stuff. A Porsche cannot. The Porsche is a vastly more satisfying car to drive from a driver experience but the utility of it sucks. In a world full of large SUVs and trucks  I prefer the seat position of a model X over a Taycan. On an open road without obstructions I prefer the Taycan. If I’m going to the grocery store I prefer Tesla. It’s not even close. They are just different cars and different mission profiles. \n\nUltimately other SUVs like Mercedes can upend the utility argument at some point but Tesla’s differentiator is it’s SC network. If they didn’t have that and we were just evaluating build quality and other things even their competitive advantage in battery tech etc becomes less compelling. But we aren’t in that world yet and Tesla’s investment in the SC represented a 10+ year asset diversion. \n\nOne other point I’d make is how the cars are produced. Tesla is unique in their ability to stand up factories quickly. All the legacy makers are doing the same thing but it’s taking them 3-5 years just to build the factories and retool. If Tesla needs a new factory they have been able to build them in 1-2. This matters when responding to consumer demand. \n\nThat being said Musk was incredibly stupid for buying Twitter.

Who knows, but one can say that their self-driving is not something that will set them apart.\n\n2) The Tesla system is an OS all on its own. Carplay? Autoplay? Not a chance meaning either I get Spotify or I have to use old bluetooth audio, which truly sucks. I rely on Google Maps for all of the information and there is none of that.

Before the video rolls, with the Rolling Stones’ “Paint It Black” as background music, a message reads, “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not driving anything. The car is driving itself.”  \nTesla workers later revealed that the video was fabricated, done in multiple takes, with the driving system’s failures removed, including a crash into a fence. The video remains on Tesla’s website.  \nThe lawsuit highlights the multiple revisions of Musk’s statements over the years that full autonomy would be achieved in three months, or six months, or the end of the year (in any given year) or the next year.  \nIn its motion to dismiss, Tesla lawyers note that Musk often has said regulatory approval will be necessary before actual autonomy can be deployed. But neither Musk nor the lawyers say which regulators they’re talking about.  \n“Tesla would need no federal approval to deploy an automated driving system in its current vehicles,” said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor who specializes in autonomous vehicles at the University of South Carolina. “Tesla would need state approval in California and a small number of other states, but it has not sought that approval. Tesla would need approval in Europe, but it has not sought that approval.”  \nRegulatory agencies have been investigating Tesla’s automated technology for years. Several fatalities have been linked to Autopilot software. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has several investigations open, including a probe into why Teslas seem to disproportionately crash into emergency vehicles parked on the roadside.

The competition isn't there.\n\nThe closest thing in the pricepoint of the model 3 is a car that you can never even find (Hyundai Ioniq 6 or whatever it is because there's like 3 different models of it). There's 4 model 3s at my local carmax with under 5k miles on them while the Hyundai EV hasn't even been spotted in my area yet.\n\nIn addition, there's 4 super charging stations in my area as well, something no other EV has which actually makes road trips bearable and possible. Tesla can build you a route between your start and stop locations and *correctly* estimate when you'll need to stop to refuel and know if you can even re-fuel or if all the spots are taken.\n\nIf your Tesla breaks down or has any issues, they will come to you. You don't have to have it towed to your nearest fulfillment center (In my case is 2.5 hours in either direction, but in the case of other people in my state can be over 4 hours). \n\nThe appeal/hype is around the limitations of EV, which Tesla has largely solved long before anyone else has. Most EV manufacturers have none of these things either. If they have the pricepoint, they don't have the range. If they have the range, they don't have the charging networks or take super long to charge (1 hr+). If they break down, you're basically stuck unless it's a major car brand. \n\n\nFor example, any Ford (F-150/Mustang) EV owners report broken/damaged or otherwise poor upkeep at charging stations, in addition to not even knowing if they can charge anywhere but home because the stations are not tracked. To add to that, most people can't even charge the F-150 at home because most trucks don't fit in your average 2 car garage unless you built it for extra length and height.\n\nIt's difficult to digest but the face of EV is still Tesla and these are the reasons why. To anyone who knows anything about EV, the competition is still pretty cold. It might not be freezing, but it's jacket weather.

It comes from knowing whether or not you have to wait in a line which can take up to half an hour for a *single* person infront of you to charge. When the map of the US only has one super charger every 50-75 miles in metro areas and sometimes over 150 miles in rural areas, having to drive 200 miles vs 300 miles and filling up is a big deal. Especially with longer trips. \n\nFor example, my family takes 1, 300 mile trip once a month (round trip). If we were in a low-range EV, we'd have to stop and fill up, which estimates around 30-45 minutes, even for ranges of ~100mi. A trip which would normally take us just over 2 hours 1 way is now taking 2.5 hours and round trip takes us 5 hours. In addition, once every year or 2, we take a trip to see my grandparents, which is a 900 mile journey. This would add over 3 hours on the trip (bringing the total to over 11 hours) with a slow charging EV with a standard 250 mile range or the wrong charging current on a properly ranged EV. \n\nA traditional engine of nearly any range has a 5 minute (at most) fillup time. You could see how this can get obnoxious when you have a single trip you need to make for personal reasons (such as a distant family member's death, a wedding, etc) where you will significantly increase your original travel time compared to a standard vehicle. \n\n----\n\nWe don't have the value you seem to in Aus.

There are definitely places where an EV does not make sense, but a Tesla isn't the solution for those people. \n\nIn the scheme of things, adding a half hour onto a 3hr trip is roughly the amount of recommended break time anyway. This isn't like a ICE where you stand there and fill up. Instead you plug in, and then go get a coffee, use the toilets, stretch your legs for 15-30 mins and then you head off again. And these are issues faced by all EVs fairly equally. In my state there are no Tesla branded fast chargers outside of the inner city which may affect my view point on them. All of the regional charging stations are 3rd party, will charge any modern electric car fairly equally, and support ultra-fast chargers. \n\nTeslas don't charge up any faster and don't have any more range. I appreciate what you are saying about the added charging time for long distance trips- those distances you quoted are certainly not anything I would consider too long of a drive.

So the political left is not \"liberal\". They are simply \"left\". I could settle for \"progressive\", but that term is not perfect, either.\n\nSecond, \"fascism\" comes from the Latin word for a bundle of sticks, and has been used to describe a bundle of muscle fibers in modern anatomy. Fascism is about favoring the group over the individual, and forcing a certain way of view on all so that there is a sense of cohesion. Japan would arguably be very fascist. When leftists use the term \"fascist\" they are simply trying to say something cute and derogatory, but they are missing the point of the meaning. In reference to my first point in the previous paragraph, the political left is probably as much or more fascist as the political right in that they don't really want individualism or freedom of thought or speech.\n\nI have never been a fan of Musk. Nor am I partisan. But I haven't seen him do anything the left hasn't done 100-times over.\n\nMy case remains that the left don't like his politics.

Emotionally appealing ideas like free healthcare for all and perhaps even student loan forgiveness sound nice, but don't make economic or moral sense. The money has to come from somewhere, and it is simply not fair when someone is forced to pay for someone else's life choices, especially when the payer took great sacrifice to avoid those poor circumstances in the first place.\n\nIt has been well researched that indirect payment systems inflate costs because people are not as careful when it's someone else's money. This is precisely why these systems want 3rd-party payer systems: they profit more!\n\nEver wonder why veterinary medicine and orthodontics are so darn cheap compared to allopathic medicine, despite the similarly advanced education and technology? Because up until now, they don't take 3rd-party payer systems! Statistically, cancer treatment doesn't even work. Why should I be forced (by threat of jail time or worse) to pay for someone else's bad decisions to go forward with chemo? Obamacare is a forced buy-in of for-profit \"insurance\" companies. Ever wonder why healthcare stocks have done so well since Obama took office? I've worked in healthcare management and finance for years. The whole thing is a mess.\n\nAs for schooling, government school loans simply increase demand of unhelpful schooling, which raises the prices that much higher and creates a perpetual cycle of need. University education got insanely expensive when the government school loan program began. Before then, someone could work their way through college (my parents did). After the loan program got started, people pay off debt sometimes for decades with their higher-paying job that required a degree to even obtain! Loans act as a sort of subsidy to universities which inflate their wealth and power, the same as subsidies for health insurance companies. I've been a college instructor and medical researcher, recipient of grant funds from both governmental scientific agencies and local endowed pools. In both cases, the money is mostly wasted. This waste is allowed because the pools are bottomless. It's a disaster.\n\nDid you see how expensive housing got when the Fed lowered rates and bought a boatload of 10-year bonds and mortgage-backed securities? The Fed, in essence, subsidized home purchases. Why can't young persons afford housing? Because of leftist policies! (And before someone says the Fed is nonpartisan, it's important to note the very idea of a centralized banking system which attempts to control the economy with top-down methods is overtly left in ideology.)\n\nThe worst part is that these policies aren't even a choice. They are forced on all by a leftist regime that does it for power. They know they can use emotionally coercive tactics to convince the masses to vote their way, and then blame the bad results on someone else. When any of these policies are forced on others who disagree with them, leftists call it \"equality\". True liberals (read: libertarians) would not be wrong in calling it fascism and authoritarianism.\n\nIf we truly want equal access to healthcare, education, housing, and so forth, we'd do-away with the 3rd-party payer systems and the biased qualifications of debt and admissions.

Last month's CPI val was 298.012, so you need a MoM increase of less than 0.0766% which is practically 0. \n\nHowever, statistically when PPI MoM increased compared to the previous PPI MoM, the CPI MoM also increases relative to the previous CPI MoM in 73% percent of times.
