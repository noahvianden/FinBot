For political reasons the Windsors and their modern predecessors have based their public relations mantra around avoiding the limelight when it comes to their wealth.\n\nBut her Majesty is the legal owner and sovereign head of Canada, Australia and the UK. Given the staggering amount of land alone that technically belongs to the crown, the wealth is mind-boggling. This NewsStatesMan America article best sums it up, “If the Queen converted her landholdings into cash, she would easily be the richest individual on earth. Also, The Crown Jewels by themselves are worth billions.”\n\n**2. Vladimir Putin**\\- Mother Russia’s Bounty\n\n**Putin is estimated to be worth $1.6 Trillion dollars**. But I’m taking this from a Russian banker himself. Here look at this quote from exiled Russian banker Sergei Pugachev, “Everything that belongs to the territory of the Russian Federation is owned by Putin. Any attempt to calculate \\[Putin’s net worth\\] won’t succeed. He’s the richest person in the world.”\n\n**3. Mohammad bin Salman (Saudi Crown Prince)** – $1 Trillion Dollar Man\n\nThe de-facto boss of one of the world’s wealthiest nations, the Crown Prince’s power has been on the rise for the last few years. **Consensus estimates give him an approximate $1.4 Trillion fortune**. Wait. What? With vast oil wealth and an increasingly firm grip on the throne, MBS has the power to summon any amount of money, whenever he wants to. Since Aramco went goes public, we now have a more formal way of valuing him. For now, Aramco is valued at $ 7.08 trillion, leaving the House Saudi as one of the wealthiest families in the history of the world.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Haha!

That was enough to close the deal, but it wasn't the final proposal.\n\n> By October, the updated financing had dropped the $6B loan to Elon, and replaced it with more equity from other investors.\n\n> Second, an explanation of why Twitter has to repay that leveraged debt:\n\n> As part of the acquisition, Elon founded several holding companies. One of those companies, called \"Bidco\" in the contracts, is officially named X Holdings, II, Inc.\n\n> Bidco took out $13B in loans, and then merged with Twitter. When they merged, both of those companies winked out of existence and were replaced by a new company, also called Twitter, which holds the combined assets and debts of the two merged companies.\n\n> So, the new Twitter has to pay back the loans that Bidco took out, because legally they're now the same entity.\n\n> If you don't mind reading a wall of legalese, Bidco's role is described in this debt commitment letter that was filed with the SEC: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922048128/tm2213229d1_ex99-c.htm", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "[this SEC letter of commitment was also published the same day](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922048128/tm2213229d1_ex99-d.htm)\n\nSo you’re saying this SEC letter of commitment never happened?

So a switch would be beneficial for both sides\n\nAnd it looks to be that this is for only 3B which is unsecured debt, not the entire 13B\n\n[A Bloomberg article from Dec 7](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-08/musk-bankers-mull-tesla-margin-loans-to-cut-risky-twitter-debt?utm_medium=social&utm_content=business&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&leadSource=uverify%20wall) talks about it, copied below: \n\n> Elon Musk’s bankers are considering replacing some of the high-interest debt he layered on Twitter Inc. with new margin loans backed by Tesla Inc. stock that he’d be personally responsible for re-paying, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n> The margin loans are one of several options the Morgan Stanley-led bank group and Musk’s advisers have discussed to soften the burden of the $13 billion of debt that Musk used to purchase the social media company in October, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are confidential.\n\n> While many details, including how terms of the swap from one debt to the other would work and how advanced the talks are, remain unclear, the mere fact that the two sides are discussing such an option underscores just how badly this deal has gone for all involved in the six weeks since it was finalized.\n\n> The banks have been unable to find buyers for the Twitter debt and are facing the prospect of realizing steep losses. Musk, meanwhile, is under increasing pressure to turn around the finances of a company that was already struggling when he and his partners bought it. Musk put up billions of his own dollars, selling Tesla shares to make the purchase, and pledging more stock to help prop up Twitter now would be risky. It could give Twitter the breathing room it needs to turn operations around, or it could mean Musk is just throwing good money after bad.\n\n> The financing discussions have so far focused on how to replace $3 billion of unsecured debt on which Twitter pays an interest rate of 11.75%, the maximum banks had guaranteed Musk when they agreed to finance the acquisition in April, the people said. The company is estimated to face annual interest costs of about $1.2 billion based on the current debt structure, more than a measure of Twitter’s earnings for the whole of 2021. It’s unclear what the rate would be on the margin loan.\n\n> Representatives for Musk didn’t respond to requests seeking comment, nor did Twitter and Tesla, which no longer have communications departments.\n\n> Morgan Stanley and the other Twitter lenders — Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Societe Generale SA — did not provide comment.\n\n> Tesla shares whipsawed on Thursday, dropping as much as 2.9% at one point before closing down 0.3% at $173.44.\n\n> Options\n\n> While the $13 billion of debt Musk took to finance the deal sits at the Twitter corporate level, any margin loans against Tesla shares would be taken by the billionaire in a personal capacity. The swap, however, could still make sense considering that Musk has a significant amount of his own money tied up in Twitter equity and given the margin loans would likely carry a much lower interest rate than Twitter’s unsecured debt, the people said.\n\n> Tesla’s last proxy statement disclosed that at the end of March, Musk had about half of his Tesla shares already pledged to secure an existing margin loan. After accounting for subsequent share sales, his remaining unpledged shares could secure a margin loan of more than $5 billion at a 20% loan-to-value ratio, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\n> But since the March update, Tesla’s shares are down more than 50%, meaning Musk would likely needed to have pledged more shares to satisfy margin calls unless he repaid some of his existing loan.\n\n> Musk could exercise some of his options to obtain more Tesla stock to pledge as collateral for the loan. Those options are currently worth more than $40 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\n> The original Twitter financing package included $12.5 billion in margin loan commitments backed by Tesla stock. That was ultimately replaced by additional equity commitments, including investments from several partners.\n\n> Musk, who has said he wants to turn Twitter into a forum for free speech, is also facing a backlash from advertisers and Democrats in Washington over concerns that harmful content may increase on the platform.\n\n> The banks are not expected to attempt to offload any of the Twitter debt — which also includes $6.5 billion of term loans and $3 billion of secured bonds — to institutional investors until the new year, when the company could offer a clearer picture of how Musk’s changes have affected its operations, the people said.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t quite understand this finance talk.

That means stopping for say a half hour or even hour) is no big deal.

Tesla was always aiming to wind up with 20% market share so dropping market share among EVs is not a concern until it looks like it could hit that point. As the EV maket as a whole expands, Tesla's market share is bound to drop, but that doesn't have to limit their growth or their sales until EV adoption is closer to 50% than 5%.\n\nTesla is not just a car company, but it's reasonable to value them as just a car company at least for the next 12 months. They have a lot of cool projects in the works, but until any of those contribute meaningfully to revenue, it's prudent to consider them as basically a car company. That said, their high margins and rapid growth still warrent a multiple above that of other car makers. As an example, here is a hypothetical which is unrealistic for some obvious reasons, but it's illustrative:\n\n>Imagine there were no major macro concerns and Tesla's demand continued to outstrip supply for the next two years. Imagine they also kept growing at the rate they have this year. This year, their unit volume is on track to grow 50%, but their TTM profit grew from $3.5B in Q3 2021 to $11B in Q3 2022, which is 214% growth. The bottom line grows much faster than the top line becuase certain costs don't scale with revenue. Even assuming that ratio plateaus a little but their top-line growth continues, you could easily see:  \n>  \n>2023: 2.25m cars sold, $22B in profit  \n>  \n>2024: 3.38m cars sold, $44B in profit  \n>  \n>A P/E today that values them as \"just a car company\" would maybe say they're worth $50B to $100B, but in 2024 those same multiples would put them at $200B to $400B. A valuation growth that fast implies that the \"today\" valuation is too low.\n\nAnyway, sorry if that's a bit remedial to you, but I think it's a useful example of why, even valuing them as \"just a car company\" you can easily justify something in the ballpark o $100/share if you believe their growth targets.\n\nThe main problem right now is that the global economy is so uncertain that any projected growth rate looks like a guess. And yeah, their bots and their software and their batteries and their solar systems all look several years from being major profit generators.\n\nSo, I'll be looking for a bottom and buying with an eye toward 2030.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}

Fairly straightforward.\n\nAs is the case, in a bubble or not, there will always be certain equities grossly overvalued or undervalued. This is where the uniqueness of TSLA comes into play.\n\nDaddy elon is a malignant narcissist. IF you don't know what that is, do a quick google search. Good to know what it is,how people display it etc. Narcissists are very empty people inside, and do a lot of harm to those around them. Anyways, papa elon, being a narcissist, did what most narcissists do well. He manipulated people. He lied, over and over and over. About FSD, about cyber, abount damn near any timeline. But when the free money was flowing, his image was one of a supremely brillians genius that just has the magic touch. So when he'd proclaim things, the world would just eat it up as if it was fact. It was anything but, it was mostly lies.\n\nSO fast forward to today, competition in the space is heating up, and tesla has not done much to build a moat. Some data came out recently that shows Tesla spending the least in R&D or any major big cap 'tech' company. SO essentially, the world is now seeing TSLA as a car company. Not a tech company, not software, not anything but a car company. Elon's recent shit show at Twitter further pulled the mask off, and now most sane people, even those that were under his spell of bullshit, are thinking back to all the crazy things Elon proclaimed, and saying to themselves, 'holy shit, that guy is full of shit!'\n\nSo again, look at what any major car company in the world is valued at, and look at tsla. Now the fanbois are quick to go to the usual talking point Enron has burnt into his minions' brains. It's not just a car company. Margins, growth.\n\nWhile there is truth to margins and growth, it is in fact just a car company. The tech and software and whatever else tesla works on is specifically for their cars. And in that space, they have made no advances greater than anyone else. FSD is bullshit that rubes paid 15k for and odds are another company will crack the self driving mystery long before TSLA does. Reference to the piss poor investment they're making in R&D.\n\nNow to growth and margins. WIth heavy competition, growth can't be sustained. This can be argued as we're only in the early stages of the EV movement, but cars have brand loyalty, more than a lot of other consumer products. People that like Honda stick with honda. People that like and can afford Mercedez will stick with mercedez, etc. SO no chance of growing 50% or whatever. That growth rate, even without competition, implies a highly exponential curve. meaning by year 4-5 of that 50% growth, your numbers are in the 10s-100s of milliomns. That growth rate was absurd to begin with, and again something Elon repeated to manipulate people.\n\nMargins. Well they have great margins, partially due to the fact that they build shitty cars. Fact. But with competition, and especially competition from established players with a history of quality and brand loyalty, that margin can't hold. Especially when your product is too expensive for the working class, and others will build cheaper cars for that crowd. So your market is upper middle class to rich people. Rich people will buy their porche and MB EVs, and upper middle class now have a wide range of choices. So that margin can't hold up.\n\nIF all that makes sense, this company will in the very near future be valued as a car company. Meaning a PE of less than 10. WHich would bring this stock down to $40-60 range. And speaking of growth, Elon has all but destroyed the brand so good luck even maintaining 20% growth. Sure people in China might not really get exposed to his twitter antics and hard right politics, but America is obviously turned off to him, at least the demographics that would buy a tesla. And he's widely the most hated man across Europe other than Putin at the moment, so good luck with that. And guess what, a 50K car is not gonna get any play in emerging markets or 3rd world countries. Even a place like India with its billion plus people will not be buying 50K teslas. \n\nTL;DR: TSLA, after the next few earnings calls show the growth collapse, which will lead to margins being shaved down to reasonable levels, will settle into a car company valuation. Unless FSD magically starts working in the near future(it has zero chance of doing so) this party is over. Let's me say it one last time: It's not a tech company, a software company, it's not saving the world, and Elon is a piece of shit who has shown his true colors. Anyone with half a brain, regardless of how much you've already lost, needs to dump this ASAP. Odds of it ever getting back to 150 are very low. This will settle into a 100bb market company, if that, and will either reside there or be bought by one of the big dogs.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -5, "replies": [{"body": "What are you trying to say bro.

{"title": "Why we aren't near the bottom", "selftext": "Alright so I’ve constantly seen all over reddit/twitter people calling this a short recession. Citing the most recent CPI data and being confused about the Fed's hawkish attitude. So let me explain why we're either going to have a long recessionary period or at least a continuation of rate hikes. \n\nLet's look at the most recent CPI data:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jb1mqw1lgf8a1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c3cf89f8a71feadae20d511ff874837fd70d5a8\n\nNow you’re probably thinking “inflation is slowing down which means the feds strategy is working and therefore we’ll have a short recession”.\n\nWhile the rate of inflation is slowing down, inflation is still occurring at an alarming rate, which explains why the Fed raised rates pretty aggressively. For context, here’s how fast the fed raised rates in the past year:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4j6lrrygf8a1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=88bba550599a1de20ddfedb90557b9a3262adbb0\n\nHere’s how fast the Fed increased rates before the 2008 financial crisis:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wstpoyxzgf8a1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=e00b5f2eeee55e738106ebd99da1737df5c3c851\n\nNow the reasoning behind the aggressive rate hikes is the inflation rate, the Fed obviously doesn’t want to become another Zimbabwe. Now my theory is that we are essentially headed towards another 1970s Great Inflation period. For those of you who don't know, the US essentially forced full employment with easy money policies which caused inflation to ramp up at a similar rate to what we’re seeing today and eventually put the US in a period of stagflation. The big problem in the 1970’s was that the federal reserve was fabricating growth through monetary policy which is not sustainable due to it coming at the expense of straining the natural capabilities and resources of the economy. Sound familiar?\n\nSo now let’s address another big issue affecting the Fed’s hawkish attitudes: Job growth and unemployment. Here's the unemployment rate during the last year:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ed6e8v42hf8a1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=db482df7062ff188b5d8d4cb3515268f17430249\n\nHere’s job numbers in the last 2 years:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ddokm23hf8a1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeab38ad69187c3bae090edb9fb7b495c624e2b4\n\nNow here’s the problem. We have a very strong job market, which obviously means that employers are competing with each other for talent/employees which can lead to increases in wages. This is why the federal reserve is still very hawkish despite decreasing inflation growth rates. If we do not see a decrease in job growth and an increase in unemployment numbers we will see increases in wages to attract potential employees which would lead to wage-push inflation.\n\nHowever there is also another issue. Inflation growth has been outpacing wage growth for the last year which is causing a decrease in real average hourly earnings:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9zrlwa04hf8a1.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cff2cb586103451bd7a844f051d3a4ed3cd9553\n\nNow the inflation rate we have been seeing is not an effect of wage inflation because inflation is sticky in the short run. If you want to know why that is, read this: \n\n[Sticky Wage Theory - Overview, Factors, Unemployment (corporatefinanceinstitute.com)](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/sticky-wage-theory/)\n\nThe problem is also that if employment numbers stay at what they’re at right now, one of two things will happen:\n\nScenario 1: We see wage-push inflation/wage-price spiral as workers demand more wages due to the decrease in their purchasing power. Which could lead businesses to increase prices to preserve margins, so more inflation, which would cause more rate hikes from the Fed. \n\nScenario 2:We see mass layoffs as businesses try to preserve margins by lowering the number of employees they have to pay. \n\nScenario 3: If employment numbers do go down though, then that would be indicative of businesses seeing a slowdown in consumer spending as they realize that they overhired during the bull market because the sales growth was fabricated largely through policy. We would essentially see the same outcome as scenario 2, just a bit sooner and potentially less devastating. This is the best scenario for the economy long-term but could potentially lead to a crash.\n\nRegardless of what occurs, the effect on the market is the same. So here is what you actually care about, the effect on the stock market:\n\nFor context, let me explain what has occurred so far. In the last bull market, it seemed as if every company had their stock price blow up. Why is that? Because 1) we had very low interest rate which obviously impacts the discount rate and also allows business to stimulate growth through basically interest-free debt-funded capital expenditures and because 2) top line was growing due to higher consumer spending as a result of fiscal policy (both through the republican tax bill during the Trump era and the COVID stimulus package) and monetary policy(low interest rates and unlimited quantitative easing). So, future expectations were very high and so stock prices ramped up. Therefore a lot of businesses were overvalued and that's why we’ve seen a decrease in stock prices in the last month as interest rates have decreased and consumer spending has decreased.\n\nHowever, a ton of these businesses are still overvalued. The reason being that inflation has affected the top line as some businesses have seen revenue increases through pricing power and have not yet seen that much of a decrease in consumer spending(because the rate hikes were very aggressive and therefore have not had their full effect on the economy yet). We have also seen the easing of supply chain issues for some companies which has improved their overall margin and bottom line.  Therefore we have even seen companies raise guidance for their top line and their net income/EPS numbers which has led to stock price recoveries/increases(or at least has provided some resistance on the downside for some stocks).Can show some examples in another post if necessary.\n\nHere’s the outcome of the three scenarios(which basically are the same thing):\n\nScenario 1: We see more inflation as a result of wage increases which leads to a more hawkish Fed which can push us into a recession through more aggressive rate hikes, similar to the Paul Volcker-led Federal Reserve in the late 70s-80s. We also see margin compression due to the increase in costs both through COGS and SGA(from wage increases). This would decrease company EPS numbers and their multiples which would place some companies in an overvalued position. \n\nScenario 2: Mass layoffs end up affecting consumer spending which will decrease top line growth rates(and therefore future expectations) which would lead to a reevaluation of a majority of stock prices and would cause sell-offs due to a change in future expected cash flow and therefore a change in valuation. Even if some businesses are able to preserve margins it would still cause multiple expansion which would put some companies in an overvalued position.\n\nScenario 3: Basically scenario 1 but much sooner.\n\nOther things to consider:\n\n1)Current debt balance is pretty high, which makes sense since a lot of debt was taken out during the last few years when we had low interest rates: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8h8lhfc5hf8a1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=1151fda5b59fcabc1407435ae60bb8c955746ba4\n\nThis could potentially put us in a deleveraging situation which could lead to a paradox of deleveraging: \n\n*“To reduce debts people sell off assets to gain liquidity. Selling assets causes a fall in the price of shares and house prices. Falling house prices cause a negative wealth effect and a fall in consumer confidence. This leads to lower consumer spending, lower economic growth and more losses for banks.*\n\n*To reduce debt, people cut back on spending to save costs. This leads to lower aggregate demand in the economy. An individual choice to save more might make perfect sense, but if everyone in the economy increases saving by 20% (and reduces spending by 20%), then it will cause a significant fall in aggregate demand in the economy and can cause a recession.”*\n\n2) Much of economic theory is based on self-fulfilling prophecies. For example, if people anticipate a rise in inflation, they will increase their spending now as their dollar has more value and in turn the increase in spending is what causes the inflation. Similarly enough, an issue right now is that many individuals expect there to be a short recession therefore they are not taking the precautions to withstand a recession(such as decreasing spending) which is one of the reasons why we haven’t seen much of a slowdown on the top-line of companies and why we still have an overvalued market.\n\nTLDR: Inflation is the main thing driving growth for companies and we have yet to see an increase in wages(or layoffs) and we’re seeing supply chain issues ease up. Therefore, EPS numbers for a lot of companies are inflated which would change once we see an increase in wages or layoffs, which would place those companies in an overvalued position so there should be sell-offs of those equities. The Fed understands that wage inflation is a big possibility if we do not see a decrease in employment/job growth which explains their hawkish sentiment.", "id": "zwe3l9", "created_utc": 1672142484.0, "score": 454, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 213, "comments": [{"body": "That was a long scroll to the comments, I think I need to rest my thumb", "score": 247, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Look at Mr fancy thumbs.\n\nDebt collectors took mine.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Everyone knows this isn’t the bottom we’re just waiting for the cards to collapse\n\n*Nobody knows when* ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)", "score": 192, "replies": [{"body": "My problem is when using nominal data from 15 years ago, like nominal debt.

{"title": "Let's talk chip stocks - what's still oversold and overbought in this macroeconomic shitshow.", "selftext": "TLDR: NVDA, AMD, overbought, TSM, INTC oversold with limited downside +5% dividends on INTC and 2.39% dividends on TSM\n\n**Tech macrosector analysis:**\n\n\nCrypto GPU mining is essentially dead, killing the \"gaming\" market for both NVDA and AMD, with INTC largely unaffected. \"gaming\" revenue accounts for roughly 40% of NVDA's and AMD's revenue. Although if we factor in forward looking trends, there is significant investment in INTC for manufacturing within USA, while NVDA/AMD still rely on TSMC for chip production, this can significantly boost the revenue and outlook of INTC if supply chain issues continue with the global trends looking negative with international relations with China being largely negative. Although TSM has invested in manufacturing plants within the US, it's questionable if it can support the current volume demand or future volume demand for the west. \n\nOne advantage NVDA has is its GPU market share dominating the AI space, with its GPUs being the predominant brand used for AI research and DIY at home use. As AI tech picks up steam, we may see NVDA's forward looking revenue improve within the next year or two. AMD lacks both manufacturing investment advantage as well as a growth outlook for AI sector, therefore I am most bearish on AMD from a technological innovation standpoint.\n\n\n**Fundamentals**:\n\nEPS:\n\n\n\n\n\nStock| EPS | 3-YR Qtrly EPS drawdown| 3-YR Stock Drawdown | current P/E ratio\n---|---|----|----|----\nNVDA | $0.27 | 77% | 57% | 60x\nAMD | $0.04 |  97% | 59% | 38x\nINTC | $0.25 | 87% | 62% | 8x\nTSM | $1.78 | -283% (growth)| 45% | 13x\n\n\nAlthough initially the price drawdown for INTC may seem fair given the quarterly EPS decline, I believe the significant drawdowns on INTC is due to investment into manufacturing plants and processes within the USA, which I believe will pay off in the coming years compared with NVDA and AMD. TSM drawdown seems unjustified given the continued increase in EPS through the economic downturn, although we may see a drawdown at some point if macroeconomics worsens, TSM remains a strong bet as semiconductors will always be in continued demand for the foreseeable future. NVDA and AMD are extremely overvalued from a P/E ratio standpoint, as a ton of growth and hype was priced in given their exposure to cryptomining and technical outlook vs their competitors, but I believe AMD is falling behind in both processor and graphics vs Intel and NVDA. I believe both AMD and NVDA has significant downward price momentum to reduce their P/E ratio to be more in line with the macroeconomic outlook and improve their realistic evaluations.\n\nHow I would play the market:\n\n**Long side:**\n\nIf you want to take a long position or positions with minimal downside through the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, I would invest heavily into INTC and TSM as these both continue to perform in terms of dividends and have P/E ratios that are very reasonable. Plus they also provide significant dividend returns even while stock price dips. I would take a lesser position in TSM if any, due to uncertainty with China, but if you want exposure to any upside from NVDA and AMD, it may be better just to take a position in TSM rather than either NVDA or AMD, as any demand growth from them will be passed through to TSM.\n\n**Short side:**\n\nI believe NVDA and AMD both have significant drawdowns in share price to go. Given the P/E ratios of both companies, I have taken short position in NVDA multiple times since Q4, but I also do not believe that the 97% EPS drawdown is priced in for AMD either.\n\n**Current positions:**\nOut of the above mentioned, I hold:\n\nLong: 600 shares INTC\n\nShort: 10x 130P 17 FEB 23 NVDA\n\nNone of this is investment advice, not guaranteed to be accurate, DYOR, I hold no liability, I wrote this for entertainment purposes only. etc. etc.", "id": "zwoinz", "created_utc": 1672171168.0, "score": 206, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|231|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lslau3/i_believe_intc_intel_will_be_the_greatest_value/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zwoinz/lets_talk_chip_stocks_whats_still_oversold_and/) \n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: NVDA, AMD, overbought, TSM, INTC oversold with limited downside +5% dividends on INTC and 2.39% dividends on TSM", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "My favorite chip manufacturer is LAY'S which is a subsidiary of PEPSICO (PEP) :)", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "Pringles is one of my favorite but they’re owned by Kellogg so I worry they may be over extended with cereal", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Utz is a better buy and lays is overpriced.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "upvote for DD, we really don't have these any more", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "INTC is a government subsidised pos tho\n\nGo learn something you ritardos\n\nhttps://siliconangle.com/2022/12/19/intel-delays-construction-18b-german-chip-fab-angles-government-funding\n\nEdit.
