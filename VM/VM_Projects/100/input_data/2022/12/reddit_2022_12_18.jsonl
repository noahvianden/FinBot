{"title": "AirBNB (ABNB) Stock Review 12/18/22", "selftext": " \n\nAs always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.\n\n· **Company Description**\n\no ELI5 the company’s business model\n\n§ ABNB connects over 1 billion customers with its network of over 4 million hosts. Hosts develop a unique space all around the world for customers to stay. They are homes, cabins, castles, yurts, boats, villas and more. AirBNB also offers many hosting services.\n\n· **Company Soundness**\n\no How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?\n\n§ AirBNB earns service fees. These are effectively commissions for connecting a customer with a host. AirBNB books are somewhat cyclical and seasonal. There bookings are correlated with the economy. AirBNB also receives the cash upfront when a property is booked and recognizes that revenue when the customer has checked in to their property.\n\no Do they operate with significant leverage?\n\n§ Very little. They operate with $.43 of debt for every dollar of equity on their balance sheet. Additionally, their interest coverage is a massive 77x. Usually AAA rated names need to be over 20x (among other factors).\n\n§ They ended the 3rd quarter with $7.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and have access to an additional $1.0 billion line of credit.\n\no Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?\n\n§ Given their conservative balance sheet I would say they are well suited given the cyclical nature of their industry. They have about 6 quarters worth of expenses of liquidity for a business that is cash flow positive currently.\n\n§ Additionally, since cash is collected before the stay, they are able to operate with a negative cash conversion cycle meaning they get the benefit of cash for some time prior to paying expenses. While this would slow in a downturn, this does suggest a strong financial position.\n\n· **Can it be Replicated?**\n\no Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?\n\n§ Some. Connecting hosts and customers is not a difficult business to replicate on the surface. For example after AirBNB paved the way, new competitors joined the rank like VRBO, HomeAway and even Expedia is starting to book Airbnbs. Having said that, given AirBNB’s size, they are still the clear leader for this space.\n\no Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?\n\n§ Yes, this post covid travel boom has been a godsend to their business and FCF margins have grown to an all-time high of 40%. The previous highwater mark was 14% in 2018. Additional scale has been showcases as revenue per employee has moved up to $1.31 million and returns on assets have steadily climbed to 11%.\n\no What is the competitive advantage?\n\n§ The competitive advantage is that hosts want to list where customers search, and customers want to search where hosts list. This creates a network effect. Additionally, this network effect is bolstered by host support agencies want to list on AirBNB to showcase their services due to the plethora of hosts. Finally with their scale and margins, I feel they will be able to out invest competitors in new solutions to cement their advantage while still having strong financials.\n\n§ They also have brand strength given AirBNB is not only the company name, but it is what people call this kind of vacation.\n\no Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?\n\n§ As this industry has and continues to mature, I feel you would be hard pressed to start from scratch given the dynamic of the network effect I mentioned above.\n\n§ Having said that, we will likely see consolidation of hosts over time giving then more bargaining power. For example, should a host buyout/merge with 1000 other Airbnb properties they might be able to host a site strong enough to list the sites themselves and bypass AirBNB all together. This is a much more capital-intensive model and would likely take significant time. Were basically talking about going full circle here and ending up with a hotel chain of different locations ironically.\n\no Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?\n\n§ The Brand. Its difficult to get to the point of Kleenex, Google it and AirBNB it. Being the first mover in this industry likely will give them a long runway.\n\no Are there competitive threats on the horizon?\n\n§ Yes, smaller hosting sites and as I mentioned host consolidation and therefore increasing their bargaining power.\n\n· **Growth**\n\no Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?\n\n§ I would say yes. AirBNB’s fastest segment is long term rentals as fully digital employees opt to hop around month to month. While there will likely be some pull in for work from home, I don’t think the trend will be eliminated.\n\n§ They are at that sweet spot too where they are likely small enough to growth through a recession but are large enough to be profitable.\n\no Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?\n\n§ Yes, while AirBNB is fairly mature in the US, they are fairly small abroad giving them a long run way for many years.\n\n· **Watch List Decision**\n\no Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?\n\n§ I believe I do.\n\no Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?\n\n§ Yes, I think their conservative balance sheet and network effect will keep them well insulated from competition over the coming years.\n\n· **Valuation**\n\no Value the company\n\n§ Revenue for 12/31/22 is forecasted at \\~$8.3 billion\n\n§ Revenue for 12/31/25 is forecasted at \\~$12.645 billion\n\n§ Revenue for 12/31/28 is forecasted at \\~$17.644 billion\n\n§ This implies a 3-year revenue CAGR from 22 to 25 of 15% per year\n\n§ This also implies a 3-year revenue CAGR from 25 to 28 of 12% per year\n\n§ YTD Shares have an annualized growth rate of 2.84% per year\n\n§ Since going public shares have increased by 4.39% per year\n\n§ Going forward, given the wider margins and higher revenue per employee I would expect less total dilution per year. Given this is hard to project, I am going to assume 0 to 2.5% per year\n\n§ As of 10/14/22 they have 642,377,183 shares outstanding. By 12/31/25 they would be expected to have 642.37 million to 693.908 million shares.\n\n§ In terms of FCF margins this is also difficult to predict given the small data set and covid period both during and after. We are likely at peak margins which are trending as high as 40%. It appears the lows have been around 20%. I am going to assume margin ranges between 25% to 35% for a midpoint of 30% to reflect higher overall margins from scale, but acknowledge we are likely at a peak.\n\n§ In terms of FCF yield, in 2025 projects today say 3 years from then the company is expected to grow at 12% per year. Given the variability in their revenues from the economy, I feel that a FCF yield of 4% to 8% is probably appropriate. This is in-line with Expedia’s FCF yield prior to 2020\n\n§ Estimated FCF per share in 2025 4.55 (12.645 rev \\* 25% margin / 693 shares) to 6.89 (12.645 Rev \\* 35% margin / 642.37 shares)\n\n§ With a FCF yield of 8% on the low FCF per share and a 4% yield on the high FCF per share we get a 3-year valuation between $56.88 to $172.25 for a midpoint of $114.56\n\n§ With a current price of $89.57 this implies a 3 year CAGR of -13.50% to 23.28% per year with a midpoint of 8.19% per year.\n\no Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?\n\n§ Its probably a little elevated. A price of $80 would imply a 12% return on the midpoint. Given the cyclicality of the company, that is probably a fair price given the current expectations.\n\n§ With a minimal public track record, this is a very difficult company to value hence the wide range in outcomes.\n\nSources:\n\nShareholder Letter Q3 2022: [https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc\\_financials/2022/q3/Airbnb\\_Q3-2022-Shareholder-Letter\\_Final.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/Airbnb_Q3-2022-Shareholder-Letter_Final.pdf)\n\n10-Q Q3 2022: [https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc\\_financials/2022/q3/45c8d785-ef1f-43fd-a676-fb15f8a1e5e7.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/45c8d785-ef1f-43fd-a676-fb15f8a1e5e7.pdf)\n\n10k 2021: [https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q4/2a413af0-3429-4317-9d3c-a71f2d6d2683.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/2a413af0-3429-4317-9d3c-a71f2d6d2683.pdf)\n\nOther Data: [https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:ABNB](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:ABNB) [https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:EXPE](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:EXPE)\n\nCurrently Long", "id": "zp0xf6", "created_utc": 1671376875.0, "score": 263, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "My concerns are: \n\nlegislation that could ruin their business model (already in place in some cities);\n\nhosts ruining the service (which we already see a lot).", "score": 326, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah the latter, along with inflated pricing and fees  are the issue.

On the Oregon coast. A very tiny oceanfront duplex where the owner lived on the other side. The tiniest kitchen I’ve ever seen with very little cabinet space so we were basically sharing plates, cups, and bowls as a family. Lots of rules. We had to do a lot of cleaning before we left to avoid a fee. We’ve decided against airbnbs on the coast because of this place. The comparable hotel rooms are similar cost but bigger in size, better beach access, and shared amenities like hot tubs. If you need anything it doesn’t feel as weird to bug the front desk. \n\n2. “Dome house” in the woods. We did a little staycation out of the city only a 30 minute drive away. This one was a very positive Airbnb experience for me because of its uniqueness. The house was huge, with very tall ceilings, and 100% ours for the weekend with no host on site. It had a huge hot tub and we saw deer walk up to the house in the mornings. The wifi crapped out, and we were limited in the amount of trash we could throw away for some reason, but we made the best of it. \n\n3. I went to California for a quick funeral a few weeks ago and stayed at an Airbnb for the night. I had never done the thing where you get a room in a house with the hosts. Hard pass on ever doing this again. The hosts were in their early 20s and in the sink of the shared bathroom was a bunch of their nail trimmings. The house was otherwise fairly clean(they probably use a house cleaning service) but it felt like being in college again with roommates because I generally didn’t feel comfortable taking up the living room or other shared spaces. There was also no tv in my room so I kinda just kept to myself holed up in my room looking at my phone. Weird..\n\nSo if you can find a very unique Airbnb, with a whole place to yourself, I’d do it, but otherwise I’ll tend to prefer a hotel.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "You also don’t have to worry about getting spyed on or robbed in a hotel.

I don't care because my company pays but all of the stock pictures never match, there is always chipped/cracked counter tops, dust, mold in the exhaust fans, stained carpets, moldy bathrooms, silicone tearing off, chipped mirrors. Last one I stayed at the AC wasn't working properly, it was only releasing hot air and not cold.

{"title": "I don’t think JP is bluffing", "selftext": "The bond market is clearly dismissing what the Fed is saying about raising terminal Fed fund rate to 5.25% and holding all year. The 2y yield dropped after the FOMC when it should be rising. Yields across all durations should be much higher than they are now if fed fund rates are truly higher for longer. \n\nI don’t even blame the market in thinking the Fed is bluffing. After all the Fed has historically always cut rates during a recession, including for Volcker’s tenure. And we have so many forward looking indicators pointing to a recession. So the bond market is simply reading the room and following historical precedence.\n\nThe reason why I think the Fed isn’t bluffing is because JP is choosing to ignore data that contradicts him. For example, he used to make a big deal out of job vacancies being too much in comparison to those searching for a job. We now know that Fed knows that those vacancies are bullshit. The Fed is also aware that shelter prices are dropping down and in fact lagging. The Fed is well aware that the real world clearly paints a much different picture to what their data suggests. The Fed will continue to cherry-pick their lagging data in support for their goal.\n\nA bigger tell from the recent FOMC is that there is no dissidence among the Fed. They are all hawkish. Unlike back in 2019 when JP raised rates, he has full support from the President. Either 1 of those 2 will start reversing if we have a pivot anytime soon.\n\nThe bigger picture here is that the Fed really don’t want to lose more credibility and want to be 100% sure that inflation is dead. I also think the market is underestimating how fast inflation drops. It drops fast at first but then progress slows down rapidly. Also the bullwhip effect makes inflation come in cycles.\n\nThe market is too premature in front running a pivot, and this sets up a counterintuitive trade to actually short bonds.

Picture these retired baby boomers depending on their $500k houses to help fund their retirement suddenly being worth half of that.

Because there's a perception that these current \"high\" interest rates (really still relatively low historically speaking) are more painful than the 8+% inflation we recently saw.  \n\nAlso, I think JPow sees the writing on the wall.  He sees that there is a strong possibility that a credit event forces him to lower rates before inflation falls to \"target\" levels.  So he's going to try to hedge and increase that target to give himself justification to pivot sooner.

What am I missing?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Old debt becomes an issue because not everything is a 30 year fixed mortgage. Not every bond is a 30 year treasury. This debt rolls over periodically. Some interest rates just float.\n\n\nAlso, old debt can be affected by asset prices. So for example, all the people who refinanced their houses in the past 2-3 years. They pulled cash out and refinanced at say 2.5%. Lets also assume a ling term fixed rate. Sweet. But then housing prices fall because new buyers can't pay the same principal with these higher rates. So now all the people who refinanced are underwater on the house. Not everyone walks away just because of that but if they ever have trouble paying the mortgage, it becomes an appealing option because there's literally nothing to lose. So now those long term MBS's are going to underperform. \n\n\nAnd to be clear, it would take multiple years at the current rate to really start showing up in the long term fixed rate debt market. But it causes other problems that could quickly bleed over. So consumer credit is susceptible since that's typically a variable rate. Auto loans are relatively shorter term so within just 1-2 years a significant portion of that market is at higher rates.  The US government averages about $5T of rollover debt a year so that's at the new higher rates. Municipalities roll over debt.\n\n\nYou also have the banks buying some of this long term debt with shorter term and variable rate loans. Imagine sitting on 30Y Treasuries at 3% leveraged on a short term loan that now costs 5%. And it creates liquidity issues and mark to market problems.

{"title": "Where did inflation come from and where it goes", "selftext": "This is largely from [this](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RI_CausesofandResponsestoTodaysInflation_Report_202212.pdf) 90 page paper (and I did a bit of research to validate the points in the paper). The conclusion is quite enlightening to me.\n\n**Where does inflation come from** (from the paper):\n\n1. inflation comes from a mix of supply chain shortage, commodity price surge, corporate profit markups, and shift in sectorial demand (yeah, i know, old news)\n2. inflation does not come from the excessive stimulus during the pandemic nor the labor shortage we are experiencing\n\ni'll start with the more contentious point 2. One popular theory for the cause of this wave of inflation is the >5 trillion dollar US government spent all together (CARES + CAA + ARP etc.). The money went to government spending related to COVID measures like vaccine, and also individuals and business as stimulus checks. To put things into perspective, that is more than 5/23 = 22% of US 2021 GDP. When you create this much excess money and pump it into the economy, it is not surprising inflation will ensue.\n\nAccording to the paper, this is wrong. Aggregate demand (lump sum of personal consumption, government spending, investment and exports, these all create demand in the economy) is actually below pre-pandemic trend. Note the number is inflation adjusted, but if inflation is a result of too much demand, we should see demand rises before the inflation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3s6bvur3hm6a1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed5c48b69aa10bebdb6ed162fd43d67d437580e3\n\nThen where did the 5 trillion go? It turns out **the excessive stimulus merely compensated for the demand collapse from COVID, but it did not overcompensate**. Compare this to 2008, without the stimulus checks, the personal consumption never caught up to the original trend.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6w4ykvdtim6a1.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ca3da6ec748df9a242739da0107e7c2dc13d4a2\n\nIt is not hard to understand why, a lot of ppl lost their source of income during the pandemic, so the stimulus check is offset by their loss of income. In addition, say you are not allowed to go to restaurants  for a month. The next month, after COVID restriction is lifted, it's not like you will go to restaurants everyday, every meal. You don't spend all money you saved last month immediately.\n\nIndeed, American household saving increased drastically during pandemic, however data shows these savings are largely held by wealthy households (it comes more from not able to spend money during lockdowns rather than stimulus checks). These people put higher % of their money into investment than consumption.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jccxizyzlm6a1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=25054e21eb3a594a758315c08ea9e59b40ef2378\n\nThe second potential fuel for inflation is labor shortage and the resulting wage-price spiral (higher price causes worker to demand higher wages and in turn makes production more expensive). This has been talked about a lot lately. However, real wage (adjusted for inflation) actually decreased. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vo2953rmm6a1.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=a643e405c505730a676f50f19e3b04ce0b6ba85c\n\nA stronger evidence is that inflation started growing in early 2021, when unemployment rate was 6%-7%. The labor shortage was much more severe pre-pandemic, when unemployment rate was 3.5%, but we did not have much inflation then. \n\nNow coming back to point 1, inflation comes from four things: supply chain shortage, commodity price surge, corporate profit markups, and shift in sectorial demand. Supply chain shortage is basically (relatively) short-term disruption from lockdowns. The price for containers, freight etc. spiked several times in 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lnyeis4pm6a1.png?width=2046&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b0fe73f1d4e1e5e3b0ed9d130f26c96a36a8323\n\nGas and food (commodity) contributed 2.9% out of 7.7% inflation rate, you must still remember the gas price in June. Ukraine war did not help. But this part is beyond the control of fed and congress.\n\nCorporate profit markups is basically companies raising prices higher than cost because they now can blame it on inflation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3j1c81jqm6a1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=5473edbefad0f6391b8e73f1e4b3df3dd6724e52\n\nLastly sectorial shift in demand means people shift their spending from one thing to another due to COVID, **without increasing the aggregate demand**. Housing is the prominent example here, after COVID, people abandoned cities in favor of suburbs. If this happens slowly in normal speed, suburb rent will grow and city rent will come down and there is no change in aggregate demand. But because of COVID this happened so fast and some human psychological effect made the market responds slower to price drops than price hikes (e.g. landlord and tenants do not realize the 3k/month apartment in the city may only have a 1k market price now). This explains the inflation in rent that accounts for \\~30% overall inflation. [Signals](https://www.zumper.com/blog/rental-price-data/) showed that this part of inflation is coming down as sectorial demand shift back.\n\n**Where is inflation heading** (my guess)\n\nThis paper really paint an interesting picture of what happened: so Fed wasn't wrong when they thought inflation would be \"transitory\" back in January. The supply chain problem has been alleviated for the large part (only 11 months later!) and excessive spending / wage-price spiral are just not here. However the expectation for high inflation was already embedded in people's mind, and greedy corporate CEOs decided it was a good time to rake some extra money for a rainy day. That compelled the fed to take decisive actions, which made the raining day come true.\n\nAt this point in time, it seems all the catalyst for inflation are gone. Commodity price has come down, supply chain is going back to normal, rent is coming down but it is not reflected in CPI timely, corporate profit will evaporate in the looming recession. After the last 50 base point hike, US bond yield didn't move much. The bond market doesn't believe in the fed's terminal rate. I personally think we will cut rate some time in 2023.", "id": "zow3bx", "created_utc": 1671361147.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|5|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: the Fed and the congress are doing a great job, but inflation is not their fault, nor is the stimulus.
