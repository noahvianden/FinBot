Unlike many countries all US government debt is denominated in its own currency (compare to say, Russia since it‚Äôs in the news, which is trying to pay back USD and EUR in Rubles) - meaning in the absolute worst case scenario, the government can print its way out of debt. This isn‚Äôt ideal and would have massive inflationary pressure on the economy, but it is doable. \n\nI‚Äôll add that our debt isn‚Äôt due all at once and is constantly being sold and paid off (and coupons paid on some longer term treasuries). The cost of paying back debt / coupons (basically interest on debt) is called the cost of servicing debt. So while our total debt is now at about 105% of GDP, because of the incredibly low rates on that debt, the cost of servicing it will only be around 1.5% of GDP in 2022. Something the country can very easily meet.\n\nWhat will be perhaps tougher is in 20-30 years. The treasury sells bonds out to 30 years, so a significant portion of the principle for the debt accumulated from 08 to today will start being due over that period. The government can borrow more to cover, or simply absorb the cost into the budget. In 20 years the economy will grow in real terms (and thus budgets are higher) and through (ideally small) inflation, the value of the dollar will decrease - meaning in nominal terms there are many more dollars to go around and the debt is easier to pay. It is quite likely that our government is borrowing in negative real terms. Free money. \n\nFrankly, I‚Äôd like to see the overall debt get back under 100% of GDP.

{"title": "What is ONE idea or mindset you hold onto with dear life when making investment decisions? Here is mine:", "selftext": "As a disclaimer, I am not trying to ''educate'' anyone or act like I know it all. I am far from an expert, and I will never consider myself as such out of respect for the complexity of stock-picking, but after reading the major works of Howard Marks, Graham, Buffet, Munger, and having observed my own behavior and others around me during good and bad times, my major approach sums up to the following sentence:\n\n\"You're neither right nor wrong because people agree with you or disagree with you. In other words, being contrarian has no special virtue over being a trend follower. You‚Äôre right because your facts and reasoning are right.\"\n\n(Not sure if Buffet or Graham said it, but anyways)\n\nIt might seem like an obvious statement, but in my experience it's far from it...\n\nI think there is a reason why Munger states knowledge in psychology and human nature is of immense importance when it comes to investment decisions, likewise, I also understand now why they are so critical of some business schools and their way of approaching the market; as if it was a robotic machine with predictable outcomes with no interference of human emotions.\n\nI read news a lot and like to I listen to people, and I have noticed that when times are good, people will always rationalize over why a stock will continue increasing. Not too long ago, if we take Meta as an example, you wouldn't hear too many bad things being said about it. A safe blue chip stock, has monopolized all social media, and what not... But now that it has taken a major nose-dive (in stock price, very unproportional to corresponding loss of the company itself) you will hear everywhere, from analysts, people, news outlets that it's ''over'', the future looks ''hazy'', ''TkTok is rising'', ''Metaverse won't work out'' Whatever... I am not into that stuff, they might be right, and they might be wrong. I don't know. But the point is, if people truly had the conviction they had previous to the nose-dive, now would be the perfect time to invest a huge chunk in such a company. But most don't, this just proves it was all a bluff. They never truly believed in it, it was all emotions. Once again, psychology... Human emotions... Just like when times are good, they only saw the strengths of the company and no weaknesses, now that times are bad, they can only see the weakness of the company and no strengths, and they can only come up with reasons why it might go to shit.\n\nSame thing with Tesla right now, I look around me and the majority can only see what's fantastic about the company. They have the best production rate, the best factories, the best batteries, the best engineers, branding power, whatever... I don't even know whether it's true, I'm not into this sector, this is just what I hear all the time around me. How would the opinions of majority of these people change if say Tesla nose-drived like Meta or Alibaba did right now? Say 50-60% because of just one missed quarter? I am willing to bet people will start saying ''the automobile industry is tough'', ''VW's catching up, their engineers are better...''.\n\nNow those are just generalized examples to get my point across, but bottom line is, behavior like this is not surprising to me anymore, and there is a reason only a selected few will achieve desirable outcomes long-term, because as the quote in the beginning states, it's not about being a contrarian for the sake of being contrarian, or just following the flow.

That's not how it works. Tesla usually works through an iterative process, starting with small scale trial production, dialing in the production parameters to get the best results they can for that design, then developing an improved production process, dialing that process in, and repeating. There have been comments that the Giga Texas cell production process shown in the new video is significantly different from the previous process shown in the videos from California, implying that at this snapshot in time, Tesla is dialing in a new production design in Austin, while at the same time they are putting 4680s from California into the Giga Texas vehicles and selling them.\n\nTesla also designs their vehicle manufacturing lines this way, originally with low yield and low volume, then ramping up yield, volume, capability, and quality. The fact that (as Elon said) ~two thirds of the BEVs on the road in the US are Teslas, that Tesla considers it highly likely that Model Y will be the best selling vehicle in the world of any kind (including ICE) by revenue in 2022 and by number of vehicles sold in 2023, and that Teslas get sky-high customer approval ratings, suggest that Tesla knows what they are doing in manufacturing.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "I get the same feeling.

{"title": "Real estate market and the broader economy", "selftext": "I know there will be lots of \"just short the housing market, bro\" responses, but I am more interested in the opinions of the OG WSB autists if you guys are still around. Full disclosure: I'm not involved in this market. \n\nPapa powell lowered fed rates to almost 0 during the beer virus and printed paper, so there were lots of easy money. This money first went into stonks and the market became too hot. Institutional investors had to find an alternative asset class and it seemed like they went into real estate. \n\nAs you have noticed, the housing market went crazy over the last few years. However, I also noticed this insane price hike is mostly for starter homes -- aka the houses for entry-level buyers getting their first home. These starters are single-family houses/apartments/duplexes/condos/townhouses, you get the idea. In contrast, my older wealthy friends' >$1M mansion had seen maybe 300k increase, while the starter houses my younger friends are looking to buy increased by x2 or x3. \n\nInvestors (instead of home buyers) purchased [\\>18% of all real estate sold in Q3 2021 alone](https://www.redfin.com/news/investor-home-purchases-q3-2021/). Firms like BlackRock has bought 66 apartment complexes in my city -- **not** units, entire complexes. I also looked at the prospectus of two REITs (Vanguard VNQ and BlackRock USRT) and \"residential\" is the second-highest holding in these funds. The top holding is something called \"Specialized REIT\" -- I wonder if apartment complexes or residential RE holding companies count as such. In both funds' documents, they identified \"increasing interest rates\" as a significant risk factor. The point is, this is just two REITs. There are lots more of these institutional or even individual investors of various sizes buying up starter homes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all that said, I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on where this is going and how it will end. The following is my speculation and thinking-out-loud, so probably not everything makes sense: \n\nIt seems to me like these institutions are cornering the market by controlling the supply and causing the price to increase, and then slowly selling these starter houses to any sucker who would be willing to pay the ridiculous price ... so are they holding a bunch of empty houses waiting for appreciation or are they also renting them out? How are the occupy rates? \n\nSwitching gears -- what about the packaging and reselling of these mortgages? Anything going on there? I know they [never stopped selling CDOs](https://www.printfriendly.com/p/g/mKya3x) after 08/09. Like the film ending scene of 'the Big Short' pointed out they are now making 'boutique synthetic CDOs'  and call them 'bespoke tranche opportunity' and [there's a lot of activity in product](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N22B5Q2). \n\nAs interest rates start to increase, are institutions gonna fire sale and try to make their rival firms and new home buyers hold the bag? I'm not sure of the exact cause or mechanism but if they needed to cooperate and hold it all together, they wouldn't -- just look at how they handled Bill Hwang's swaps. They all agreed to slowly unwind, but right after the meeting when Credit Susse and UBS went to sleep, Goldman and Morgan immediate offloaded and tanked those stonks and market in general. That's relatively small in comparison to the entire housing market. \n\nAnyway, I would love to hear your opinions, thoughts, and insights on this.
