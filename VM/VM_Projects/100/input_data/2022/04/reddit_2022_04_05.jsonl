{"title": "Broker Dealers & Mutual Funds/ETFs Have A LOT of GME Securities Lending Counterparty Exposure - Let's Explore Some Numbers", "selftext": "**\\*Obligatory,** none of this information is financial advice and is the result of my studies. All investors must do their own due diligence, come to their own conclusions, and make their own financial decisions.\n\n**TL;DR** Broker Dealers (primarily believed to be the big banks) are estimated to have borrowed at least **5.72M shares of GME** from mutual funds and ETFs. The funds are exposed to potentially catastrophic securities lending counterparty loses. The brokers are also exposed to risks in multiple areas. They are; relending the shares, they own shares in the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.\n\nIt's a long post and I believe it is 100% worth the read.\n\n# Background Information\n\nI'm rewording a previous post and adding another fund onto it... Going to try and make it easier to understand.\n\n**Broker dealers are exposed to potentially high $ securities lending counterparty risks from GME and we can see it.** Mutual funds and ETFs (funds) have lent GME shares to broker dealers who in turn lent it out to be shorted. The lending of this security makes the fund and the broker dealer a \"counterparty\", hence \"securities lending counterparty\".\n\n[AIG](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/what-went-wrong-at-aig) suffered roughly $21B in losses from this same business practice in 2008. They would borrow securities from a broker dealer (Citadel & others) and lend them to hedge funds, who would short sell the stock. AIG's counterparties (the brokers) were bailed out [$43.7B](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/aig-bailout-disclosed-counterparties/original.pdf) in 2008.\n\nThinking of that example, funds are currently lending GME shares to broker dealers who are ***relending*** the security to a hedge fund to be short sold.\n\nThe [mutual funds,](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/) and [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks) currently loaning GME, and the *investors* of those funds, have a similar exposure to securities lending counterparty risks as the broker dealers did who were involved in AIG's scheme.\n\nThe broker dealers currently borrowing and lending GME have a [similar exposure](https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/securities-lending-a-focus-on-two-risk-areas-1495080131) to what AIG's exposure was in 2008, which was famously catastrophic from AIG... I wonder how it will go for the current GME lenders?\n\nWhat's more, the *investors* of the funds are the very brokers who are borrowing shares from the funds. **They own shares of the ETFs** loaning the GME shares. So, they're exposed as lenders of the securities and as investors in the funds.\n\nAnd MOAR, some **funds also hold a lot of the brokers OWN shares** (ex. VTI holds 83M shares of JPM - worth $13B)... So, the broker is now exposed to counterparty risk 3 ways...\n\n1. They are borrowing and relending the security,\n2. They own shares in the fund which exposes them as *investors* in the fund, AND\n3. Many of these funds contain shares of the broker. If the fund needs to liquidate any of these holdings due to their own counterparty loses, the share values will lose money as they're being sold off.\n\nHere are the main stats from the first post I made which showed how much GME was being lent:\n\n* 138 of 213 funds were loaning GME shares\n* 70 funds lent out more than 90% of their GME shares\n* An estimated 5.72M of total 11.98M GME shares were on loan (this is just loaned securities and does not account for rehypothecated shares or other avenues of securities lending), and\n* from the data filing, we were able to see the fund's securities borrowers and how many $ worth of securities they borrowed (this includes all securities, not just GME). We KNOW that someone(s) in the list of borrowers is borrowing GME.\n* The primary borrowers of the one fund reviewed (a Fidelity Mutual Fund which had lent $61M worth of GME) were; Morgan Stanley **($911M)**, Goldman Sachs **($454M)**, Citi **($388M)**, BofA **($380M)**, JPMorgan **($321M)**, State Street **($239M)**, Barclays **($115M)**, BNP Paribas **($105M)**, UBS **($56M),** etc.\n   * Note: You'll need to see \"GME Deep Dive: So Much GME Lending\" in my profile for the original post with this info. I have it pinned.\n\nThat's a lot of $ on loan for just one fund... I'll leave some quotes regarding securities lending counterparty risks at the bottom of this post for additional clarity.\n\n# The Web\n\n**Example 1** of securities lending counterparty risk is the fund which is estimated to have lent out the most GME shares:\n\n**Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI)** filed on 3/1/22 for holdings on 12/31/21.\n\nTotal GME Shares = 1,847,760\n\nTotal GME Shares on Loan ≈ 1,185,700\n\nSee the prior post for supporting information on how this was calculated. This fund has a lot of exposure when short sellers fail to return all of their shares during MOASS after the short sellers have been liquidated.\n\nThe NPORT-P filing also gives us a list of the fund's securities borrowers along with the value of the securities on loan. This is for all securities, not just GME. Here are this fund's borrowers:\n\n[ Nearly $4B worth of securities on loan to these 24 borrowers ](https://preview.redd.it/7lddv0rb8pr81.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a13147fbe642ce67f51476bec0636f4497fbcd4)\n\nTake a close look at those names... These entities are borrowing the funds then lending them out hedge funds, best case scenario. We don't know for sure which entity is borrowing GME specifically, but someone(s) here is.\n\nI wonder who is investing in this fund if they have counterparty risk as well? As of their last filing, these guys:\n\n[ Well, that's basically the same people plus Citadel ](https://preview.redd.it/88b90mog8pr81.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=56a2fe6803e0f02f217938829139f785e82cc17d)\n\nNearly $10B worth of this fund's shares are held by the same entities listed as the securities borrowers of the fund.\n\nSo wait, the same entities who are borrowing securities from the fund, also own shares of the fund? They have counterparty exposure as fund ***investors*** as well as the ***lending agent***. $ bills are starting to add up a bit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o67gkzxc9pr81.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=502bec7e2d34818c3da305caadf38eec9fe83787\n\nThe ***fund*** has exposure as well. When short sellers fail to return shares during MOASS, the fund may need to liquidate holdings to keep its head above water. Here are some of the funds holdings:\n\n[ $40B worth of these securities are held by the fund ](https://preview.redd.it/4q0mn82g9pr81.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=6188e2ff74c05db37c78b0ed51acbb6cb033eae5)\n\nOkay, so when short sellers fail to return shares to the lending agent (the banks), and\n\nthe banks fail to return the shares to the fund, and\n\nthe banks own shares of the ETF, and\n\nthe ETF owns shares of the banks...

Just to name a few.\n\nMany other funds loaning GME shares have similar looking securities borrowers, shareholders, and fund holdings compared to the three funds we've just reviewed. That's a lot of securities lending counterparty risk when you considered the amount of funds loaning GME shares (over 5.72M shares by 138 funds).\n\nRemember, this is just lending from mutual funds and ETFs and does not include other avenues for lending GME shares.\n\n# Computershare\n\nDirect Registration is how I am protecting my shares in the event my broker defaults and is liquidated [(741)](https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/) from short selling OR securities lending counterparty losses. There's lots of DRS posts out there that will break down the reasons why I feel GME's transfer agent, Computershare, is the best place for my shares.\n\nI'm not telling you that your broker will default. I'm also not telling you to DRS your shares. I'm simply saying that **I feel safest knowing most of my shares are on GME's books at Computershare** because when marge calls and the short sellers are liquidated, that exposure is going to be passed elsewhere, including to the funds and other entities involved in the securities lending listed above, and the other avenues we've done our DD on.\n\n*Buckle Up*\n\nTanks fo reedin\n\n**Note:** I have not extensively reviewed all funds and fund holdings, but GME appears to be one of the most loaned securities held by these funds, if not the most loaned, BUT there is a SUBSTANTIAL amount of securities lending currently happening with these funds so I can't be certain where GME falls.\n\n**Note 2:** I'll leave the post with these quotes that I used in my original post regarding counterparty risk:\n\n**The Counterparty Risk**\n\n[Deloitte - Securities Lending](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/addressing-securities-lending-risks-with-blockchain.html)\n\n***A typical securities lending transaction involves multiple entities: borrower, lender, lending agent, prime broker, and clearinghouse.*** *Lenders typically include various investment firms, as noted above, whereas, broker-dealers and hedge funds make up the bulk of the borrower group. Lending agents, on the other hand, are broker-dealers, custodial banks, and some large asset management firms as well.*\n\n***In almost every securities lending transaction, lenders are exposed to multiple risks***, such as counterparty default risk, collateral reinvestment risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. In particular, counterparty default risk and collateral reinvestment risk seem to have captured the most attention from regulators.\n\n[SEC - Securities Lending by U.S. Open-End and Closed-End Investment Companies](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/securities-lending-open-closed-end-investment-companies.htm)\n\n*Lending agents* ***often*** **(not always)** *indemnify* (protect) *funds against the risk that the borrower will fail to return the borrowed securities (to the extent that the value of the collateral is insufficient to replace the unreturned securities).* ***Lending agents, however, typically do not indemnify funds for losses incurred in connection with cash collateral reinvestment.***\n\n[mutualfunds.com - Securities Lending](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/)\n\n***When a fund lends the stocks,*** *these assets are not actually part of the fund, the put-up collateral is.* ***Typically, U.S. Treasuries or cash is used.*** *However, in recent years everything from mortgage backed securities and derivatives to letters of credit and other exotic I.O.U.’s have become commonplace.

The funds are exposed to potentially catastrophic securities lending counterparty loses. The brokers are also exposed to risks in multiple areas. They are; relending the shares, they own shares in the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.\n\n\nThis is correct u/Freadom6. Here is this thing about the truth: It is **always consistent** no matter how ludicrous everything else is. Additionally, it is possible reach the same truth through different methods. Copying and pasting a different comment with edits I made to explain why these bank 'tards must have a stupid amount of exposure. \n\n***\n\nReality is all the prime brokers are short GME because they accepted a Bearish Credit Default swap and hedged this by shorting the underlying (GME +Basket of stocks.) . This means all the prime brokers have been holding a bag of shit since GME went to 90+, and they will go bust when GME moons. This will also throw and ugly wrench into the financial system, and people are going to be pissed.\n\n\nYou can come to this insane conclusion by:\n\n\n1. Understanding what CDS are, that they can payout on an increase or decrease of the underlying. (See post: BEARISH (Negative) EXPOSURE TRS/ETRS: The Full Run-Down & Why The Market Is Most Definitely F**ked) (Auto mods get spicy, so I'm not linking it.) u/zyzzbrah21\n\n\n2. Read the Archegos Credit Suise collapse report. Bill Hwangs concentrated bullet swap positions (that would payout when a basket of assets dropped in price), mirrored among several prime brokers that didn't communicate with each other. Had there been more rigorous swap reporting guidelines, risk management would have rejected being a counterparty to Hwang. (Ideally.)\n\n\n3. Combine points one and two. Its all how they went short GME + basket to hedge a bearish default swap. Prime brokers often are also market makers, so they can even naked short the underlying to hedge a swap. Really should be a no-no but Wall Street does whatever it wants. I just wonder: Who else beside Hwang made these swaps.\n\n***\n\nMore notes about how there is something batshit insane lurking at the heart of our financial system with GME at the Center.\n\n\n\nA) Statistical evidence showing how a bunch of unrelated stocks move in price leans toward basket theory being true. (I.E these bearish CDS on a basket of stocks as the underlying exists and is large enough to influence price movements.)\n\n\nB) u/Get-it-Got's work showing there are waaayyy too many GME shares in existence. Gives credence to the existence of some ludicrous positions in the financial system. There is something fundamentally wrong here. These numbers shouldn't be possible. Re lending might explain part of it, but I'm not sold. \n\n\nC) Reverse Repo exploding. This means something is wrong with plumbing of the financial system. You can see Citadel's balance sheet that they have been participating in reverse Repo operations. I forget how this helps them, but this isn't normal behavior. And securities sold but not yet purchased is a huge liability. \n\n\nD) Broccaaa's work.

That is definitely a mistake but since the company is performing a turn around and if you like what you see then investing for the long term is best.\n\nGodspeed!", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At no point in the legal proceeding did RH acknowledge or confirm the 226% number before the case got dismissed by the judge.  \n\n>the shorts did not mostly close during the run up.

Since you seem to fail at reading comprehension, I'll quote the exact page and highlight the relevant sections for you:\n\npage 25-26:  \n>In seeking to answer this question, staff observed that during some discrete periods, GME had sharp price increases concurrently with **known major short sellers covering their short positions after incurring significant losses**. During these times, **short sellers covering their positions** likely contributed to increases in GME’s price. For example, staff observed that particularly during the earlier rise from January 22 to 27 **the price of GME rose as the short interest decreased**. Staff also observed discrete periods of sharp price increases during which **accounts held by firms known to the staff to be covering short interest in GME were actively buying large volumes of GME shares**, in some cases accounting for very significant portions of the net buying pressure during a period.  \n\nThe price went from $65 to $350 between Jan 22nd and 27th, the period when the SEC says short sellers covered a majority of their shorts.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": ">Aye if after split no squeezey then I won’t believe in the short squeeze thesis anymore but will continue to hold for the turn around.
