You clearly were not prepared for the high risk that came with your possible high reward. Next time don't just look at the possibility of big dollar signs but also be realistic of what you can lose.\n\nYou are down 95% why did you let it get that bad? Options lose value as time goes on. They are an investment product you should rarely hold especially for the time frame that you were buying. If you were not willing to lose that much you could have gotten out a long time ago and you should have had a limit for how far you were willing to go a stuck with it. Did you really have a reason you thought it would go back up or were you just hoping for the best?\n\nIf you had enough money for 60 calls why did you not use a strategy that would have hedged your position?

There was a time in 2018ish where I had a 1:1 with my manager at the time. He came into the room all excited, saying \"INTC is about to hit $60!\". Here we are 4 years later where the stock did basically nothing (except gain you dividends), and now well below $60.\n\nBrian Krzanich was a terrible CEO, and the interim CEO (former CFO) after him, Bob Swan, was probably just as bad. When you have a bean counter leading a tech company, you're in for a bad time. He was merely delaying the inevitable. I found it strange that so many employees were so thankful for his work when he just made it worse. His bonus was heavily tied in the stock maintaining a gain in a certain percentage for a month or so, and he accomplished just that...then right after the stock tanked heavily. In addition, employees are definitely in for a bad time when a CFO (person who deals with money) is now in charge. You know he won't be signing off on many people's promotions/raises.\n\nDuring those times I've been very bearish on INTC. I work at the Santa Clara, CA campus (HQ) which has the highest COL relative to all the other Intel sites. Considering it's the bay area, there's tons of competition from companies right in our backdoor. Despite that, Intel pays relatively low compared to the market, which is no wonder why employees leave easily when they get 2-3x the money shoved in their face. It is very difficult for Intel to bring in new talent when they aren't willing to spend the money, and the same goes for current employees. \n\nThe great thing about Pat so far is that he is potentially taking the right steps to a brighter future for Intel. The most important one imo is he bumped up tons of employees base salary if you were under a certain threshold for your grade level/position, and new hires sound like they're getting massively better packages than before. Current employees are also getting big RSU refreshers. This will help to make employees happier, willing to stay, potentially work harder, and bring in new talent.\n\nIntel will also become a foundry service (think TSMC). Even if the node technology and scalability isn't close to TSMC, companies need options/alternatives. Pat is spending big money to open up multiple new (mega) fabs which won't finish for another few years. \n\nMany employees believe it's the right step in the right direction despite the risk. The market is not a fan of INTC, and we've seen many times that a great product doesn't translate to a great stock. \n\nI've held onto all my RSU grants over the years (which was in the $50-60/share range), and I contribute the maximum amount I'm allowed for ESPP (guaranteed at minimum 15% gain if you sell right away). ESPP hurts a lot more when I see the stock down because I'm putting forth my actual money from my paycheck. Obviously in hindsight things didn't work out, but my gut is always telling me to hoard my shares because if and when INTC does blow up, I don't want to miss out on it. More realistically, even if INTC does do really well, it'll probably be a 20-30% gain over the next few years. The only redeeming part is seeing a large sum of dividends, but unfortunately, I enrolled the plan into DRIP so rebuying more shares with the money I get back is losing even more value.\n\nMy advice is your money is better put elsewhere. Even if Intel becomes successful, I doubt they will do as well as S&P500/NASDAQ over the long run.

{"title": "Elon Musk wont succeed in buying Twitter: short Twitter via may 13 44 puts", "selftext": "Sorry for clickbait title, nothing against Musk but he cannot succeed in buying out Twitter. Twitter will remain a public company, that status quo will continue as it has been. Republicans/conservatives will downvote me into oblivion, cry and whine about free speech blah blah, but feelings =/= facts.\n\nThesis: The takeover attempt of Twitter will fail completely, whether its through a complete buyout, or or a proxy war over the board. Furthermore, there will not be any other entities that are willing to offer an alternative buyout (that twitter will accept). As a result, the Twitter stock price will plummet back down to 30s before Musk began buying shares. Puts are the winning strategy.\n\nArgument 1: Poison Pill (shareholder rights plan) will make it nearly impossible for Musk or a consortium to gain control over the board. The moment Musk or a consortium reaches 15% ownership of the company, all other shareholders will have the right to buy discounted shares of Twitter. The result is that the acquiring group will constantly have their shares diluted, and the entire attempt will become exorbitantly expensive. Indeed, poison pills are very effective at preventing even the attempt of a hostile takeover.\n\nArgument 2: Musk's 54.20 buyout offer is too cheap. Companies of this size generally don't consider any offer lower than their 52 week high. Twitter has hired Goldman Sachs to advise them in this matter; apparently Goldman Sachs believes that the offer is too low to be considered. Additionally, the decision by Twitter to adopt a poison pill almost surely implied that Twitter also believes the offer is too low. They will not accept a bid of 54.20. To entice the board to sell the company, Musk and Co, or some other firm will need to offer a significantly higher premium, a lot closer to the 52 week high of \\~$70.\n\nArgument 3: In theory, Musk probably could afford to buy Twitter at a price the board cannot refuse, but is he willing to do so? Musk doesn't have enough liquid assets to do this immediately, he would have to liquidate the equivalent of his entire stake in SpaceX to come up with \\~45 billion dollars. To put it another way, is Musk willing to give up SpaceX to buy Twitter? My guess, is probably not. The fact that Musk is already talking about getting \\*other\\* people on board with him suggests that he is unable to, or not willing to foot the bill.\n\nConclusion: Twitter will not be bought out by Musk. Therefore, the logical thing to happen is for Twitter to fall back down to the 30s.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nMy position: Holding May 13 $44 strike puts, worth approximately 1000 dollars.

Is that a good thing?  They don't enforce environmental policy that protects people and the planet.  Their energy grid is like 60% coal.  Laborers are getting paid a fraction of what people in Western nations make, have to work longer hours, and have fewer rights.. yet the products they built get marked up in Western nations.  The Chinese government hoards raw materials and manipulates commodities markets (anti-competitive) to the benefit of the companies operating in China so that other nations can't  compete.  They manipulate their currency to give them an advantage in exports.\n\nYou said:\n\n>I admire Musk for his work aimed towards revitalizing America as a Manufacturing leader\n\nIt's just incorrect.\n\nCompanies moving to China in a big way isn't good for Western labor, income equality, or for the global environment.  Certainly not for the US public as jobs are lost and income inequality grows.  It's great for corporations that only care about making a buck and monopolizing industries.\n\nI dislike Elon Musk like I dislike all corporatists; especially given that he's being touted as some sort of savior.  He's done very little for the environment.  2 million electric cars in 12 years in a sea of 1.4 billion ICE vehicles in use across the planet.\n\nHe seems to tout himself and his company as some sort of bastion of US manufacturing, when he's clearly not.  He's anti-union, and does everything in his power to rapidly automate jobs away from US workers.  Remember, Musk's original goal for Fremont was to be almost entirely automated on day one. Failing miserably, he went to China for his second plant where even if he needed to use laborers... they were dirt cheap.\n\nI dislike people saying he's a genius when he's done nothing to suggest he is... and frankly, I'm getting real tired of the endless media coverage of the dude that treats him like a God.\n\nI dislike that the man keeps pushing out bullshit statistics (aka blatant lies) that make apples to oranges comparisons on accident data, battery degradation data, and gross vehicle margins.\n\nI dislike claims that Tesla has developed incredible breakthroughs, when there's very little in terms of breakthroughs they've actually developed.\n\nI don't like liars that go on stage and flaunts their company's \"engineering prowess and superiority\" and then proceeds to lie about product mix, timelines, and prices to customers and investors in a bid to drive up share price... while simultaneously claiming other OEMs can't hang.  It's one thing to miss timelines that are 5-10 years down the road.  This dude claimed in April 2019 that FSD would be feature complete within 8 months, that a million robotaxis would be on the roads by 2020 making their owners $30k per year (and also wiping out all taxi driver and ridesharing jobs in the US), and that \"you would have to be financially insane to buy anything other than a Tesla\".  In 2017, he claimed Tesla Semi deliveries by 2019, and roadster deliveries by 2020.  In late 2019 he claimed cybertruck deliveries by late 2021.\n\nMissing timelines that are 2-3 years away by a few months is one thing.  He's missing timelines that are 1-2 years away by 2-3+ years.  The + because the products still aren't on the market, and we have no clear idea when they will be.\n\nThe man's claims are causing public and private funding to funnel to Tesla, instead of funding the entire industry to create far more competition, R&D, and jobs.\n\nWhy people tout this guy is beyond me.

As much as I enjoy delving in memes all day long on reddit, I don't like it when he uses his money to propel memes to real world stuff that affects millions.\n\nSome examples of things he did that just pissed me off:\n\n1) calling the Thai kid rescuer a pedo because he called the tunnel-rescue invention Tesla came up with \"useless\"... which it really was given the circumstances.\n\n2) Promising things like \"funding secured\" for buying stock at $420, only to then find himself dry handed when the Saudis that he supposedly got the funds from pulled back... thereby resulting in losses for many who bought in following the news.\n\n3) insulting the SEC for doing what they are paid to do. Sure, I suppose there was some bias against him when compared to other swindlers, but that probably has to do with his vocal attitude towards everything.\n\n4) pumping and dumping d-oge and other d'igital currencies by investing in them, then saying he invested in em, and then dumping em, and then saying he dumped them (classic pump and dump schemes over and over)\n\n5) Using his money to bail himself out every time he gets himself in trouble, and shoving it to the SEC every time.\n\n6) Using Twitter to call out and openly insult and defame anyone who has had disagreements with, including his ex wife.\n\n7) Joining the anti-vax crowd when his company started taking a hit due to social distancing requirements, and spitting out pseudo-science bs for all his followers to read.\n\n8) Getting pissed at Twitter for banning such tweets and then going on a hostile takeover so that he can buy them out and change the rules.\n\n9) Insulting the Twitter board when they take protective measures against such infantile actions from a billionaire social imbecile. \n\nI personally believe Musk is having a Howard Hughes moment.
