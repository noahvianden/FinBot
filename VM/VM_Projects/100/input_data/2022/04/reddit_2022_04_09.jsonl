Now saying that is a certainty, but something to consider:\n\n\"Fair Value and Profit Drivers | by Ali Mogharabi Updated Feb 03, 2022\r  \nOur fair value estimate is $400 per share, representing a 2022 enterprise value/adjusted EBITDA multiple of 14 times our adjusted EBITDA projection. We have modeled 16% average annual growth over the next five years. As the firm plans to further invest in research and development and content creation and virtual reality and augmented reality offerings, in addition to data security, we see average operating margin coming in around 37% on average over the next five years, comparable with the previous three years.\r  \n\r  \nMeta’s revenue growth will be driven primarily by online advertising and increasing allocation of online ad dollars toward mobile, video, and social network ads. We expect a 15% increase in 2022 ad revenue followed by 18% growth in 2023, assuming a continuing global economic rebound. We expect a 6% five-year CAGR in Meta’s monthly active users, mainly due to strong growth in Asia. We also assume deceleration in overall advertising ARPU growth to 10% per year over the next five years, from the average annual 21% growth the firm displayed over the past five years.\r  \n\r  \nWe look for higher growth in operating expenses in 2022 as the economic recovery will allow the firm to more aggressively increase its R&D, especially in metaverse. Such growth will lower margins. We have assumed a 33% operating margin for 2022, lower than 40% in 2021. In 2023, we expect operating margin to widen to 35%. A portion of those investments is in content and data monitoring, which requires a higher headcount. In addition, given the pressure the firm faces from users and lawmakers, legal fees could continue to affect margins. We expect the operating margin will expand in 2023-2026 to 39%, as lower growth in operating expenses (driven by more automation of content, data, and user monitoring), coupled with revenue growth, creates operating leverage. Our fair value uncertainty rating for Meta is high, based on uncertainty over future advertising growth rates and additional regulations restricting Meta’s access to and use of data, both of which drive growth in the firm's source of revenue.\"", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": ">Interesting.

I'd also suggest investing in some stocks other than the obvious choices like Apple, Amazon, Disney, etc.  Don't get me wrong, I like all of those stocks, but there are a couple of things about your situation that you'll want to consider.\n\n1. You're 21. I think it's awesome that you already have $30k set aside to invest in the stock market. Being 21 gives you an advantage of being able to take some risk that you wouldn't be able to if you were at an age closer to retirement. You have a long time until you will need to access this money, and over a 20-40 year period if you make the proper selections, you will be sitting on a bundle at the time of retirement.\n\n2. Choose anywhere from 10 to 20 stocks. I give you this recommendation for several reasons. With your original idea of just a handful of stocks, if one or more of those stocks takes a dive it could wipe out a considerable portion of your portfolio. With 10 to 20 stocks, you protect yourself if one or two of the companies have devastating results. You also give yourself a better chance of one of your company's being something like a 100 to 1,000 bagger. Diversify your portfolio amongst industries that you have an interest in or believe in. Some good ideas are artificial intelligence, the cloud, 5G, cyber security, cryptocurrency, renewable energy, oil, military & defense applications, biotechnology, and many others. \n\n3. Ideally you want to find the companies that are going to be the next Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Well these companies are still good investments and are virtually guaranteed a positive return over a long period, they are going to pale in comparison to companies that are at the beginning of their journey who will eventually grow to be Titans of their industry. Companies such as Apple Microsoft Amazon or Tesla are so large that it is difficult for them to double or triple their value. It's not impossible that one of them could increase five fold, but it is much more likely for a younger company to do that.\n\nHere are some ideas: \nAlphabet: GOOG, GOOGL\nApplied Materials: AMAT\nFarfetch: FTCH\nGarmin: GRMN\nNvidia: NVDA\nSalesforce: CRM\nSplunk: SPLK\nTaiwan Semiconductor: TSM\nArista: ANET\nBox: BOX\nEtsy: ETSY\nIrobot: IRBT\nNew Relic: NEWR\nRoku: ROKU\nTencent Holdings: TCEHY\nTwilio: TWLO\nBaidu: BIDU\nCerence: CRNC\nCognex: CGNX\nIntel: INTC \nPalo Alto Networks: PANW\nThe Trade Desk: TTD\nBlock: SQ\nMicron Technology: MU\nIron: ITRI\n\nSome other companies that I like which I don't know the ticker offhand and will need to lookup:\nAxon\nZebra\nZscaler\nCrowd Strike\nAdobe\n \nThere are so many other stocks I like that are not on this list. Hopefully, this gives you some ideas or helps someone put together a portfolio. My best advice is to invest in companies that you believe in. Since you are 21, generally speaking you have a pulse on what is popular and what the up-and-coming technologies are. The list that I just made is more technology based and would be considered high growth stocks. If you are looking for safer investments than your original idea is a solid one. Good luck!

Apple - at a near ATH (less than 7% off), which is similar to S&P500. Heck, they were at ATH just last week. I find the growth in Apple to be in short spurts. It tends to boom up, then trade sideways for a while. I think we’re gonna go sideways for a bit with Apple, especially with general market weakness. While Apple is a great company, its had a hell of a boom recently (tripled in value over last 2 years). Long term, it will go up I’m sure. But I might trade sideways for a while before then.\n\n2. NVDA - Quite a bit off their ATH currently, but also not quite at their bottom I don’t think. I could see them going to 200, maybe a bit less with poor market stability. Their P/E is still incredibly optimistic compared to the rest of the field. In order to maintain their P/E over the next two years, they’d grow 50%. It holds a high PEG value too, (2.92), meaning it is relatively overvalued even accounting for its growth. I think it definitely can go up, but I think it’s actually pretty fairly priced where it’s at. \n\n3. AMD has taken a brutal beating recently. It’s about 60% off it’s ATH. It would need to increase 50% y/y to match its projected growth by 2024. Its PEG ratio is under 1, indicating it’s a buy. AMD is currently sitting at a 6 month low. It hasn’t been valued lower than 100 per share since July 2021. Since this valuation, which is before Semi’s really took off in Q4, AMD has acquired Xilinx, acquired another (albeit smaller) company, announced a 8bil buyback while completing nearly 3 billion of their last announcement. What this tells me, is that AMD is so confident in their company and they think they’re undervalued, so they’re buying up their own stock with free cash to potentially resell later or improve valuation.\n\nOf these 3, the greatest short play is AMD. It has the highest opportunity to increase 50% y/y. Next would be NVIDIA. Ideal growth at 25% y/y. Finally Apple, which I would be impressed with a growth rate of 15% y/y.\n\nI think the riskiest play, at this point, is actually NVIDIA. They’ve been really overvalued for a long time, despite their market dominance. With greater market competition, they may struggle in the years to come.

{"title": "SoFi company analysis and valuation - Big story and many risks ($SOFI)", "selftext": "SoFi has been a very popular retail stock and I underestimated the amount of information that was available for it. It took me quite some time to differentiate what is important and what isn't and this post is a summary of my findings and it includes valuation at the very end.\n\n**What is SoFi?**\n\nSoFi is a Fintech company that aspires to be a one-stop-shop for financial services, that allows members to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money.\n\nNow, the main question is, well, **how is this different than a bank?** The management provides 4 differentiation points:\n\n1. Speed - being faster than the competitors when it comes to approval of loans, opening accounts, buying/selling stock through their platform, payments, etc. - In my opinion, although this industry has been around for hundreds of years, there's no doubt that certain parts of it have to be disrupted. However, my question is, assuming this is an advantage that SoFi has, is it sustainable for the next 5, 10, or 15 years? I don't think so.\n\n2. Selection of products - More products related to borrowing, saving, investing, and protecting money. I personally don't buy this differentiation point. I do believe cost-cutting is possible, but coming up with something new and innovative that's significantly different than the current offerings, I doubt it.\n\n3. Content - Financial education, research, insights - Even if SoFi has a platform that offers more financial education and research, this is something that is easily replicable. I don't see this as a huge long-term advantage.\n\n4. Convenience - Instead of having opening times between 9 and 5 from Monday to Friday, they want to offer the services 24/7. The company has an only online presence so they can cut some costs as they don't have to lease buildings for this purpose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The 3 segments**\n\nThe company has 3 segments and it is worth spending time understanding each one:\n\n1. The lending segment - self-explanatory - accounts for 75% of the total revenue\n2. The technology segment - which is related to Galileo - accounts for 19% of the total revenue\n3. The financial services segment - is related to all the products such as debit/credit cards, budgeting tools, investing, etc. - accounts for 6% of the total revenue\n\nAll 3 sectors have been growing fast, but we need more information to understand the second one.\n\nThe technology segment is related to an acquisition the company made back in 2020 (Galileo) and the purchase price was roughly $1.2b. At the time, that was almost 15% of the company's market cap. What SoFi got from the acquisition was a payment processing platform that uses AI for fraud detection, which is more efficient than the industry average. On top of that, it has an API that allows for app development. The revenue for SoFi will come in the form of platform fees and program management fees. This is one of their big bets and the management refers to this segment as the AWS of Fintech. The same way a business can be started on Amazon within a day, well, that's what they're aiming for, except for companies in the financial industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The growth story, the metrics, and the confusion**\n\nThe company provides two key metrics for its growth in its annual report.\n\n1. The # of users - This has significantly grown from 1m back in 2019, to almost 2m in 2020 to almost 3.5m in 2021. However, it is worth mentioning that every one that is registered on the platform is a member and remains one unless the terms of service are violated. So, if there's an inactive member for 3 years, it doesn't matter, that person will be considered a member. However, what I'm missing here is the revenue per user. Having users is good, but if they're not being monetized, the metric is useless.\n2. The # of products - If the first metric is not that useful, maybe this one serves a better job. If you as a member have a personal loan, well, that's one product. If you have a credit card, that's another one. If you are using their platform to invest, that's another one. The idea of the company to build a good relationship with its members and sell many of its products is great. Well, the number of products reported in 2021 was 5m. That translates to roughly 1.5 products per person. It did increase from 1.21 in 2019, but it isn't that impressive (yet). Although it sounds as if this could be a great metric, well, there's another trap here, not every product has the same value. 1m of these 5m products are related to the lending segment, which as mentioned above, accounts for 75% of the total revenue! The remaining 4m products bring in only 6% of the revenue as they're related to the financial services.\n\nSo, we have metrics that are not that reliable. What's next?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The company's performance and what can we expect?**\n\nIf we look at the company's performance, it is a money-losing company with a negative net margin of -48% for 2021 on its roughly $1b in revenue.\n\nA **mature** company in this industry has:\n\n\\- a net margin that's between 10-15% \n\n\\- high leverage (debt on the balance sheet being over 80% of the total passive)\n\n\\- RoE around 16%\n\nCurrently, the debt is around 50% of the balance sheet, so there's still a lot of room to grow.\n\nThese numbers should serve as a sanity check later on for my valuation as if I forecast anything that's significantly above that, it might be unreasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What's next?**\n\nThe company made one large acquisition (Galileo) in 2020 for $1.2b. At the beginning of 2022, they announced the large acquisition of Technisys for $1.1b, which is a company that will serve as their core banking system. Both of these acquired companies have some presence in LATAM, so SoFi is acquiring new companies that have a presence in other geographical regions as well.\n\nThe analysts forecast about 50% revenue growth in 2022, followed by 41% revenue growth in 2023. Great growth, but slightly declining. At the same time, the net margin is expected to improve, from -48% in 2021, to :\n\n\\-21% in 2022\n\n\\-6% in 2023\n\n\\+5% in 2024\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The risks**\n\nDue to the actions being taken, there are two large risks that I see:\n\n1. **Execution** risk - Their big bet (The technology segment), currently accounts for less than 20% of the revenue and hasn't yet proven as successful.\n2. **Integration** risk - Combining SoFi with Galileo and Technisys might sound great and there's always the amazing word synergy being used, but that's yet to be seen in the financials. There's an integration risk here that needs to be addressed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The valuation**\n\nTaking into account all the information above, I used a DCF model to estimate the company's value.\n\n**Revenue growth** \\- 898% in the next 10 years (following analysts' estimates for the next 2 years, then slowly declining). From $1b in 2020 to $10b in 2030.\n\n**Net margin** \\- From -48% in 2021 to 13.5% in 2030 - Close to industry average\n\n**Discount rate** \\- 12.8% (Based on cost of equity)\n\n**RoE** \\- Based on the assumptions above and the development of equity, the RoE is roughly 15%, which is close to the industry's average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPutting all the numbers together, and adjusting for the equity options and the preferred shares, the value of the company is **$8.8b** (almost $8/share). The current market cap is $6.5b.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that at the moment, I am looking at SoFi as a company that's not significantly different than the current ones in this industry.  I am aware that I could be significantly wrong in my assumptions and if I see a better performance from their technology segment, my storyline would significantly change.\n\nI'd like to get your view on the company and I am sure there are plenty of pieces in this puzzle that I have to learn more about.", "id": "u02410", "created_utc": 1649537792.0, "score": 165, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "Something to note, Wall Street generally focuses on interest income rather than revenue for bank & credit card stocks, so some websites will show interest income as the revenue number.\n\n[Intvestopedia article on how to analyze bank/credit stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/bankfinancials.asp)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Everytime someone makes a post about SOFI the stock drops another 10%", "score": 197, "replies": [{"body": "LMAO, I've seen a similar DD and forcast of SOFI when it's $20+. \n\nThis stock just keeps dropping, despite all the catalysts.", "score": 46, "replies": []}, {"body": "So short and keep posting?", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "There are plenty of SoFi shorts.

Every time a company, any company, needs to integrate something new and rework their code base, it will take longer than it would have taken to do it earlier. Imagine you've built a 2 floor wooden house, then you decide that you want to make it have cement supports instead of the wooden ones. You will have a lot more work ahead of you compared to if you've done cement supports from the very beginning.

The growth isn't expected to slow down seeing as SoFi bought Technisys. \n\nTechnisys operates in 16 different countries and has over 100mil customer accounts. Technisys also supports 60 banks, FinTechs and non financials, these can be offered to use Galileo much more easily, reducing CAC, at the same time the Galileo customers can be offered to use Technisys. \n\nFrom the acquisition PR, Technisys is expected to add cumulative 500-800mil until EOY 2025, Technisys will also save SoFi 75-85mil cumulatively in 2023 to 2025 after the integration with Galileo, and then 60-70mil annually afterwards.\n\nSo overall, Technisys will give SoFi 575-885mil cumulatively until EOY 2025, but this is excluding the benefit of additional markets that Technisys exists in and Galileo doesn't, which Galileo can now be marketed in.\n\nPeople call SoFi a bank and people call SoFi a lending company, when in fact it is more a tech company than either of those.

What do you think the finance bubble was all about? Basically rubber stamping and assuming that you can offset the risk with insurance (derivatives). It failed spectacularly. Its the same with real estate agents. Though there are deals which are easy enough to automate, the second people figure out how to game your system, its game over and abuses will happen (a la 2008 RE bubble). This is why no one has been able to replace a human for risk assessment. There are too many nuances to lending and real estate.\n\nPlus the rules of lending change often. Though in theory you can program this stuff, in general, programming is complex and mistakes happen and when they happen on a wide programmatic scale, they become disastrous. Plus a lot of the programming requires some opinionated leeway. Its not a simple math problem. The risk targets are always moving and its not like you will notice the problem right away. It likely takes years before you spot systemic errors. By then you will have incurred millions to billions in losses. See what happened to Zillow with their automated real estate venture.

{"title": "I analyzed 2,000+ stock splits over the last 3 decades to see if you can make money from stock splits. Here are the results!", "selftext": "Stock splits are all the rage - After Google announced in Feb that there would be a 20:1 stock split in July this year, Amazon has followed suit announcing a similar 20:1 split and sending the market into a frenzy. Amazon’s price was up by 6% the next day and Google’s stock rose more than 9% in after-market trading following the news. Tesla is also planning for a second stock split and most recently, GME has also announced its stock split.\n\nWe do know that stock splits do not affect the underlying business in any way, but it is undeniable that there is price movement around the announcement and execution of a stock split. So in this week’s analysis, let’s deep-dive into the world of stock splits, how and why they are executed, and most important… Is it possible to make money off of a stock split?\n\n**What is a stock split and how is it executed?**\n\nA stock split is a simple decision by the company board to increase (or in some cases decrease) the outstanding shares of the company. For example, let’s say you own 10 shares of company X worth $100 each. So in total, you own $1K worth of shares in the company. If the company announces a 2-for-1 stock split, now you will have 20 shares of the company worth $50 each. But the total value of shares you own in the company does not change. You will still own the same $1k (20 x 50) worth of shares that you started with.\n\nIf you are wondering why companies engage in stock splits, the following are some of the key reasons.\n\n* **Affordability:** Sometimes the stock becomes too expensive for retail investors to buy into. Consider Amazon - One stock is worth close to $3k now. So the minimum amount you would need to start investing in Amazon is $3k which might not be affordable to a vast majority of retail investors \\[1\\] Also there is the psychological impact of buying a share worth $3k and a share worth $30.\n* **Options:** For the options players, there is a huge difference when a stock is cheap. In options, a single contract is worth 100 shares. So for a covered call strategy incorporating Amazon, before stock split, you would need a single stock position worth more than $275K vs only \\~$14K exposure after the said 20:1 stock split.\n* **Liquidity:** Since more shares are outstanding for the company after the split, it will result in greater liquidity and a lesser bid-ask spread. It also allows the company to buy back their shares at a lower cost since their orders would not move up the share price as much, due to higher liquidity.\n\nNow before we jump into the analysis, you should understand how exactly a stock split is executed. On **announcement day**, investors get to know that a stock split is going to happen soon. The stockholders eligible for the stock split are decided on the record date. This is mainly a formality. The actual split would happen on the **ex-split date (or ex-date)**. After this, the stocks would start trading at their new price. For example, in a 20:1 split, the stocks would trade at 1/20th the previous price after the ex-date. From our data, we observed that there was an average delay of 36 days between the announcement day and ex-split date.\n\n**Data**\n\nFor this analysis, I have used the data from [Fidelity’s stock split calendar](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/conferenceCalls.jhtml?tab=splits) that tracks the announcements and execution of stock splits, from as far back as 1980! I have considered splits only from 1993 (due to stock price data availability), and I have considered only companies that currently have a market cap of $1Billion or above. I have also ignored reverse stock splits as the data is too small to be statistically significant.\n\nThis gives us a total of more than 2,000 stock splits to work with. In case you are interested in the raw data, I have shared both the raw data and analysis through links at the end \\[2\\]. \n\n**Returns**\n\nAs soon as a stock split is announced, there is bound to be a lot of buying and selling activity. The question is, how much return could you have seen? There are a few scenarios possible here.\n\n**Short Term Returns**\n\nThe short term plays possible around stock splits are:\n\n1. You already own the stock and see its price go up on announcement day.\n2. You did not own the stock on the announcement day so you buy the stock just before the actual stock split execution.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j7ujpf1y2is81.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=60912ef1adabca10f9f857da0321abf1363f705a\n\nAs expected, the announcement of a stock split sends the stock pumping with a 1.48% 2-day return when compared to only 0.09% return generated by SPY during the same time period. You would still have beaten the market if you had bought the stock one day before the actual split execution day and then held it for two days (albeit by much less - 1/7th of the gains you would have made if you had owned it before the announcement).\n\n**Long Term Returns**\n\nConsidering that a stock split is supposed to indicate growth prospects, what happens when you hold for a longer time? There are two possibilities:\n\n1. You buy the stock just after the announcement of the split\n2. You buy the stock on the split execution date.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/51513s603is81.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ed4a28a5e57254549e79a65ccd952219eea34a\n\nBuying just after the announcement would have paid off handsomely with the returns beating the market easily in the long run. On average you would have had an alpha of 1.5% over the market in just over a month.\n\nBut, on the other hand, if you buy it on the day of the split, the returns are not that great. You would have lost money in the first week on average and would have been underperforming SPY even over the period of one month. You would have had to wait about a year for your portfolio to overtake SPY. This is to be expected because by the time of the actual split, the hype has died down a bit and the rallies in price are a bit more uncertain.\n\n**What about H\\*DLers?**\n\nThis is another interesting case where you would have bought stocks on their announcement date or ex-split date and held on till today, starting from 1993 \\[3\\]. Though most people wouldn’t trade by this strategy, it’s interesting to see how it would have fared. \\[4\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6i7py113is81.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=c74d9f2afdcb64f342300dd6c6bb0169f208a58c\n\nIf you had bought all stocks that underwent a split and held till today, you would have beaten the S&P 500 by close to 200%!\n\n**How certain are our returns?**\n\nNext, we have to look into whether the alpha we are seeing here is due to a few stocks that are skewing the results. Even though I have capped for outliers, I wanted to know what % of stocks undergoing a split beat the market over the different time periods that we just saw.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4506by13is81.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd95395be1c8e00bb00ea578eea899d756fe635\n\nWell, would you look at that! Except in one case, the odds would be in your favor to beat the market if you had followed this strategy. As expected, for short term the highest chance is if you had owned the stock before the announcement (which is not realistic), but even if you had bought it one day after the announcement, you would have had almost a 60% chance of beating the market by the actual execution day.\n\n**The cheap and the expensive**\n\nThe usual rationale behind a stock split is that the stock has become too over-priced, and splitting it makes it cheaper for retail investors to buy into - But the data revealed some contrary insights. Over 90% of the stocks were less than $52 in value at the time of the split, and only 5% were over $230 in value!\n\nSo obviously, the question is - **Was there an advantage to buying cheaper stocks or more expensive stocks at the time of a split**, and how did they compare to the total set and the benchmark?\n\nThe 10 percentile value for the adjusted close at the time of announcement was $3.50 (203 stocks less than this value), and the 90 percentile value was around $43 (203 stocks more than this value). Here are the average returns for these sets.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hzenccz23is81.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=4debdb20bdedbd1c9b06aa887de2acb8c5ee5569\n\nThe lower-priced stocks seem to have a massive advantage in almost all respects, sometimes giving a return of more than twice the complete set of splits in the long term! On the other hand, the higher-priced stocks have a poor record - Though they beat the benchmark in the short term\\[5\\], in the long term, their performance is much lower than the stocks having a lower price.\n\nOne of the reasons that the lower-priced stocks have such a high average is because stellar companies like Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Nike, etc. were trading for less than 5 dollars per share in the 90s - But this doesn’t invalidate the observation. There were stocks trading for more than 100s of dollars around the same time, and they didn’t do as well as the lower-priced stocks. This insight could mean that ***companies with a lower share price that go for a stock split now have a higher possibility of growth than huge stocks*** like Amazon or Google.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe analysis seems to indicate that stock splits are a sure-shot buy. But there are some caveats to keep in mind before trying to replicate this:\n\n1. There are a variety of large, mid, and small-cap stocks that underwent stock splits. Comparing the returns solely to the S&P 500 might not be the most ideal way to calculate Alpha since the S&P 500 comprises of the biggest 500 companies in the U.S. So the alpha we are seeing here might just be compensating for the extra risk we are taking buying into smaller companies.\n2. The stock splits selected here are companies that have a market cap of at least $1Billion.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBuying and holding stocks at the time they are undergoing a split might not be an outrageously successful strategy - But it definitely has an edge, both in the short term and especially in the long term. This gives some credence to the statement that a stock split indicates good prospects of growth.\n\nAnd if you’re wondering whether the right time to buy is during the announcement or the actual split, the data shows that **there is a clear advantage to buying around the time of the announcement**, especially for short-term plays. The probability of success is also 60% and above in many cases, indicating that there is something more to this than mere chance.\n\nAnd finally, stocks with a smaller price seem to do much better than stocks with higher prices when it comes to stock splits. While this could just be the compensation for the risk you are taking investing in smaller companies, it’s definitely worth looking into!\n\n**Data:** All the raw data for the stock splits and returns for additional time periods that I could not showcase in this article [**can be found here.**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/stock-splits-data-6LUbbrOfFLo2cjV25RoXaQ/live)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] Along similar lines, to own a single Class A share of Berkshire Hathaway, you need $489K. There are some theories that certain companies have very high share prices because they don’t want retail investors (who are usually fickle in ownership) to own their stock. This usually leads to lesser volatility for the said stocks. One other point to consider here is that there are more and more brokers who are offering fractional shares these days. So stock splits might not be as relevant as it was before.\n\n\\[2\\] This should make your life much easier as we had to use web scraping to pull all the data.\n\n\\[3\\] Walmart split its stock [11 times](https://stock.walmart.com/investors/stock-information/dividend-history/default.aspx) on a 2-for-1 basis between their IPO in October 1970 and March 1999.

A quarter of the float has now been auto consumed by the investors, instead of multiplying it in a stock split.\n\nNow before you call me a bagholder, Im aware both can be done at the same time.

If anything, he's a major catalyst to accelerate this process so I've taken the time to explain it here. I've categorized each section incase your brain is too smooth to understand one of the sections like the profit margins etc.\n\nAlso, Elon's  Tweets today are ... well just look for yourself..\n\n# I keep getting comments about this\n\nTwitter is already dead, the institutions holding twitter hold it for heavy influence of the consumers. That stock and its financials don't mean much to them other than this. IMHO;nfa\n\nGonna post this again at the top\n\n>Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules,” the company said in an unattributed statement. “**Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders, and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions.**“ As always,” the statement added, \"our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service. Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.”\n\nYes I know it's a lie, connect the dots, it's easy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Quick Recap Since April Fool's Day\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start here since this is undoubtedly where most of the smooth brains heard about this.\n\nElon took a 9.2% stake in twitter as reported  Mon Apr 4. while most of you were sleeping at 3 in the morning the stock gapped up \\~27% via 13-G filing which is required for anyone who purchases more than 5% of a company. This publicly and officially discloses big ownership stakes.\n\nWhen smooth brains heard this they thought 'wow Elon musk is in must be going to the moon' so they bought the top and pushed it up another few percent, some smooth brains got out for tiny profit. Others got dumped on and got left holding the bag or sold for a loss because there was zero conviction or research into this play other than, such stake, much wow.\n\nSome geniuses in this sub predicted it perfectly down to the timeline and price action how it would get dumped. Major congrats to you to being well versed in retard timelines and I hope you are still holding those puts because we've got a lot further to go down imo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Wendy's Laws of Tendies Applies\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould of simply applied:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rzdwr7/guide\\_wendys\\_laws\\_of\\_tendies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rzdwr7/guide_wendys_laws_of_tendies/)\n\n>**1st Law of Wendy's: Mass stupidity.** Assume everyone and you is retarded. The sooner you understand we are all natural born crayon eaters the sooner you are on the path to tendieland. Never trust anyone or yourself, at first. If something seems retarded to you at first, it's probably genius. The inverse is also true, if you or others think it's genius at first glance it's probably retarded. Same thing if you see other people saying that. I don't care who they are. Do more research into it. Figure out how retarded everyone is so you can replace those crayon dinners with chicken feasts.\n\nNow it's time to go one step further and apply\n\n>**2nd Law of Wendy's: Confusion.** The more confusing and convoluted the information is the likelier it is you'll make big tendies. Big words and vocabulary you don't really understand means it's above your paygrade and therefore likely the opposite of retarded. Learn more about it and see if it's worth buying.\n\n# What Can Or Will Elon Do, And What Can't or Won't He Do\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've seen a lot of next level retarded shit about Elon saving Twitter all over the internet.\n\n**Let's lay out the facts**\n\n1. Twitter is 77%+ owned by institutions [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/twtr/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/twtr/institutional-holdings)\n2. Elon is the 'single largest holder' but that doesn't mean much since you need 50.1%+  of a company to 'control it'\n3. You cannot do a hostile take over of Twitter because of who owns it.\n4. Twitter's Board in a statement put this out (yes I know it's a lie, they can control it, point is they are not going to and they aren't there to make money directly off of TWTR)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jwao7j47is81.jpg?width=654&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52eb68361bde139f763d168655f4c0fe89d3766c\n\nMeaning Twitter stock is worthless since the employees run the company and Elon doesn't get to decide shit. Same ownership. Same Management.\n\n5. The **CEO** and the rest of the company doesn't believe in this stuff\n\n>**Parag Agrawal:** Our role is not to  be bound by the First Amendment but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation and our moves are reflective of things that we believe lead to a healthier public conversation. The kinds of things that we do to work about this is to focus less on thinking about free speech, but thinking about how the times have changed. One of the changes today that we see is speech is easy on the internet. Most people can speak but our role w**hich is particularly emphasized is who can be heard.**\n\n6. Elon is also capped at 14.8% ownership being a board member. But it doesn't matter because the 77% of the other institutions are not giving up their stakes. I'll get into that more later\n\nNow that we laid out some facts lets talk about some implications of this\n\n**Elon cannot and will not change twitter in any meaningful way,** the company does not care about the share holders or even making money. They care about their activism. Ownership is onboard with this and is going to subsidize  (like CNN etc.) and **continue running it in the direction that it has been going in.** And even if they didn't, a lot of the population will not ever trust TWTR again, and a lot of the population (esp on Twitter) does not like Elon at all. Just look into that yourself if you don't believe me, I know it's hard to believe\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# So what is the current direction of Twitter?\n\nTwitter is going down the tubes for a number of very important reasons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Lets look at the financials and KPIs\n\nFirst let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter's balance sheet\n\nStarting on page 43 of Twitter's Annual Report from 2020 [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\\_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020\\_Twitter\\_Annual\\_Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf)\n\nWe can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services, 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue\n\n1.37B Cost revenue\n\n873M in 'Research and development'\n\n888M in 'Sales and marketing'\n\n562M in 'general and administrative'\n\nTwitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.\n\nLet's break this down again\n\nTwitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent\n\n37% on cost of revenue: servers, buildings, upkeep etc.\n\n23% on Research and development: software engineers, sociologists, artists, focus groups (market research) (I believe moderators is in here as well)\n\n24% on Sales and marketing: sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.\n\n15% of general and administrative: executives, legal, finance, info tech, hr, consulting, moderators (in both categories probably), customer service etc.\n\n3% on interest and other: interest on debt financing, operations etc.\n\n29% on taxes.\n\nYes these numbers add to 131% of revenue or in other words a 31% net income loss.\n\nWhy is Twitter so expensive to run, why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money?\n\nLets go back in time to Twitter in 2011-2013 - Here's the same report from that time period. [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\\_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf)\n\nPage 57\n\nGoing to compare to Twitters Monthly active users (MAU) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:\\~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)).\n\n2013: \\~225M monthly active users (MAU)\n\nCost of Revenue : 266 M (\\~330M inflation adjusted)\n\nResearch and Development.(R&D): 593M (\\~740M inflation adjusted)Sales and Marketing 316M (\\~400M inflation adjusted)General and Administrative 124M (\\~160M inflation adjusted)\n\n2011: \\~100M MAU\n\nCost of Revenue: 62M (\\~85M inflation adjusted)\n\nR&D: 80M (\\~110M inflation adjusted)\n\nSales and marketing 26M (\\~36M inflation adjusted)\n\nGeneral and administrative 233M (\\~310M inflation adjusted)\n\nOk so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users\n\n2020: \\~330M MAU\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$4.15 per monthly active user\n\nR&D: \\~$2.65 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: $2.7 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: $1.7 per monthly active user\n\n2013: \\~225M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$1.47 per monthly active user\n\nR&D: \\~$3.29 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: \\~$1.78 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: \\~$0.71 per monthly active user\n\n2011: \\~100M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$0.85 per monthly active user\n\nR&D: \\~$1.10 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: \\~$0.36 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: \\~$0.85 per monthly active user\n\nSo what's alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.\n\nLet's recap\n\nCost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **388% increase**\n\nR&D went from $1.10/user in 2011 to $2.65/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **141% increase**\n\nSales and marketing went from $0.36/user in 2011 to $2.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **650% increase**\n\nAnd general and admin from $0.85/user in 2011 to $1.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **100% increase**\n\nAs you can see, twitter suffers from huge inflated costs over the years of running their business.\n\nI suspect this has a lot to do with financing of their servers through amortization payments.\n\nBut also trying to scale their business with the technology that was available 10+ years ago and not being able to change their business model because it was bad PR to fire off thousands people and replace them with future technology, they've essentially been forced to grow with their existing business modeling scaling up which you can see results in worse and eventually negative margins.\n\nTwitter has 5,500 employees (1 employee for every \\~60,000 users)\n\nThis is one of the things they fear more is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare. (by their other competitors I won't mention here just yet)\n\nFacebook has all of these similar issues with growing costs and declining growth etc.\n\nMore sources\n\nTwitters growth is slowing and stagnant [https://www.statista.com/statistics/970920/monetizable-daily-active-twitter-users-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/970920/monetizable-daily-active-twitter-users-worldwide/)\n\nAs is their profitability\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TWTR/twitter/net-income](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TWTR/twitter/net-income)\n\nAnd ARPU/Activity Engagement\n\n14B in Total Assets\n\n6.7B in Total Liabilities\n\nNet income is negative and historical trends are horrible\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/cash-flow?p=TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/cash-flow?p=TWTR)\n\nFCF does not look great either\n\nAlso considering censorship is Twitters product, what userbase is left after that . Besides they never did anything wrong, why admit that now to change it if profit is not a motive\n\nAll down the tubes. Ownership does not care, employees do not care. Twitter is not about making money to them and it never will be imo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why is Elon there then? He's not stupid\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are completely right about Elon. But understand that Elon's net worth is near 300B and this is a troll purchase to him. Advertisement for his products and entertainment. He knows exactly what he is doing. The employees there are already revolting\n\nGet it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ji9pcz44ais81.jpg?width=605&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4178e80678e2d341f15ea439afb97507ff08246\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwitter is taking since last year to roll out a simple edit button\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ep5db8rdais81.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8d15d2926b42a79df9ab6c17809e0416998a56e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwitter r Fuk. 1st and 2nd Law of Wendy's applies here. Elon can't and wont be saving shit even if he wants to (I've got even more DD about that and Twitters competitors but I won't mention it here for now)\n\n**Even if it does change, the userbase and employees will revolt even more than they already are.**\n\nInverse Cramer, Inverse Cathie\n\n# Positions\n\nI've got calls etc and shares all over on competitors\n\nAlso\n\nTWTR May 50p\n\nTWTR May 40p\n\nTWTR Jun 25p\n\nTWTR Sept 20p\n\nBe careful though. The force of retard is strong in retail in this one. I've seen smoothers say TWTR is the next amazon and that Elon is doing a hostile takeover.\n\nAlso Institutional money has a lot vested to prop them up.\n\nGood luck\n\n>**3rd Law of Wendy's: Diamond Hands.** If you're betting around short term small movement you're going to paper hand or miss out. The best things can be volatile or daunting before doing the research. The payout has to be worth the risk otherwise you'll lose out over time even if you win more often. See that stock down 50%? It might the best or the worst opportunity of your life, you don't know that based on the chart alone. See that stock up 500% it might get rug pulled or keep going, you just don't know and need to look into it more before FOMO'ing in or bitching out.  \n>  \n>**4th Law of Wendy's: Allocation size.** Go all in and eventually you'll be homeless. Good plays don't work out and bad ones do work out. Be ready to double, quadruple down, or even quit with some other money. Nothing you see is financial advice including this guide for retards.\n\n# Not financial advice, Manage risk\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ka679lnbis81.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b6e8137de313a3a39e9786ff2fca5627d528e6f\n\nEdit: I can't keep up with all of the comments\n\n>There are only two outcomes the first being infinitely more likely imo  \n>  \n>1.Twitter is worth too much to the current owners as an advertisement for their agendas and products (obviously not twitter's balance sheet itself), they give up nothing and let Elon touch nothing because that billboard space is far more important for them to control. Twitter goes down the poop shoots because of competition  \n>  \n>2.Elon actually manages to bring about meaningful change (they already said hell no, see op) and the userbase revolts and dips (already happening)\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "tztelv", "created_utc": 1649511598.0, "score": 779, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 581, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1214|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tlg2l2/dwac_tmtg_a_way_to_bet_on_the_information_bubble/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tlfqea/dwac_tmtg_a_way_to_bet_on_the_information_bubble/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tlkhoq/dwac_tmtg_a_way_to_bet_on_the_information_bubble/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rfmptv/understanding_dwactmtgs_value_proposition/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t8bpg5/cramer_says_no_dm_the_manufacturing_catalyst_of_a/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tztelv/twitter_is_the_hindenburg_elon_is_the_flame_you/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tztelv)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tztelv)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Same reason why reddit ipo is going to leave alot of bag holders", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "what do these numbers mean?  ive seen this and :4271: a couple places today and idk what the hell they are.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://reddit-econ-prod-assets-permanent.s3.amazonaws.com/asset-manager/t5\\_2th52/W1d7fkfcAU.png", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "ima need a little more help bro all that link gives me is a page with some error codes", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's Michael Burry (Christian Bale) smiling at the beginning of the big short, are you on a potato?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. \"$30 is $30\", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard.

Wouldn’t this suggest that Twitter is actively investing more into ongoing development? A slow development cycle for one front-end feature with broad UX/UI implications doesn’t mean that there isn’t also significant R&D going into other back-end features or capabilities. Generally speaking, it’s fair to assume diminishing returns would cause expenses-per-user to grow as a total userbase grows. It costs money to both retain existing users and acquire new ones. But, more importantly, are we considering if Twitter is successfully extracting greater lifetime value out of its average user? The longer a single user is on the platform, the more ads they will serve and rev they can generate, which allows them to project greater net value from the average acquired user. It may mean losses in the short term, but projections of increased net value will likely continue to drive market valuation.\n\nI also think you’re so close to figuring out that institutional investors and Musk are willing to invest in Twitter as long as the value can continue to extend to other investments/priorities.

He also has never worked with big banks, and he also assumed office at the top of the 2008 financial bubble when everyone else was leaving their positions.

I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10%.  Oil rose 35% in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5% which is going to shock the markets.  \n\nAnother factor, is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession, but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.  \n\nThe amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day, even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.\n\nI hate to be that person, but, over the last year with unemployment decreasing, spending increasing, and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80% without interfering.  At most there will be a 50% bear market similar to 2008.\n\nThe stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell, then it should recover in the following days.\n\n \\* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more \n\n**TLDR**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j38bqv92ajs81.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=39172bb2a032402fe4c78d52443440fff4a1a227\n\nI will respond to every comment!", "id": "tzxfou", "created_utc": 1649523682.0, "score": 103, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|24|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|660|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skwpds/spy_current_week_analysis_next_week_predictions/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcoh2o/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_314/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sqwd9c/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_214/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t23ypl/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_228/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7jifc/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_37/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tp494n/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_328/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tzxfou/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_411/) \n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tzxfou)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tzxfou)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Don’t know a lot about the stock market but I’m pretty sure your prediction for Friday is wrong.
