That comes after two years of near-zero rates aimed at allowing a recovery from the steepest recession in U.S. history.\n\nAlong with that, the Fed has halted its monthly bond-buying program aimed at keeping rates low and money flowing through the economy. The Fed will start shrinking its current bond holdings as soon as next month, slowly at first then ultimately at a pace expected to hit as high as $95 billion a month.\n\nWhile economists still largely expect the U.S. to skirt an outright recession, risks are rising.\n\nGoldman Sachs sees about a 35% chance of negative growth a year from now. In a forecast that is an outlier on Wall Street, Deutsche Bank sees the chance of a “significant recession” hitting the economy in late 2023 and early 2024, the result of a Fed that will have tighten much more to tamp down inflation than forecasters currently anticipate.\n\nThat all comes after a year in which GDP rose at a 5.7% pace, the fastest since 1984. While consumer expenditures, which account for nearly 70% of the U.S. economy, drove growth in the first half of 2021, an inventory rebuild from the depleted pandemic levels accounted for almost all the growth in the final two quarters of the year.\n\nSustaining that growth into 2022 will require an easing in clogged supply chains and some resolution in Ukraine, both of which will face pressures from higher interest rates from not just the Fed but also global central banks that are engaged in a similar struggle against inflation.", "id": "udu25j", "created_utc": 1651149608.0, "score": 1894, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 589, "comments": [{"body": "How is it unexpected", "score": 934, "replies": [{"body": "To the economists...how do the people predicting these gdp numbers have a job still", "score": 436, "replies": [{"body": "And then we get this in the same article:\n\n>While economists still largely expect the U.S. to skirt an outright recession, risks are rising.\n\nLike I'm supposed to trust them to be right when they've been wrong on so many other things.", "score": 179, "replies": [{"body": "Recession is transitiry", "score": 117, "replies": [{"body": "Ok, there IS a recession, but that's actually a good thing.", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "It’s a great asset.

A million times yes. I see this comment every time the discussion comes up. Let’s not even begin to discuss the philosophical points, just the economic ones.\n\n1. Economies boom when birth rates slow - this is a result of a greater ratio of workers to dependents, thus creating an increase in productivity. This is a primary reason for the growth of the US economy, we keep birth rates low and import workers to boost our GDP.\n\n2. If you can’t import workers, there is a rapid and incredibly detrimental shift - during the boom of the previous period the composition of dependents was largely the elderly, not children. When it is children (as in the baby boom) you see a decrease in productivity followed by an increase as these children mature into competent workers. However, as you have primarily elderly, the only thing that happens is your work force shrinks and your number of dependents grow.\n\n3. Once the ratio of elderly dependents to workers becomes large enough entitlement benefits must be cut - Medicare and social security will no longer be affordable. As the supply of nurses shrinks and the number of elderly grows, nursing home prices will skyrocket. The physician shortage will be exacerbated and medical care will become more expensive than ever. People will start dying and dying tragically.\n\nI am not saying that the population of the earth is going to level off, I am saying it is going to decline. We have seen this repeated in dozens of countries over decades. The speed at which this happens is accelerated. First we pulled from China, next was India, now all of Asia is beginning to dry up. Africa and South America will be next. Once their birth rates decline it will be over unless we do something about it.\n\nI think we will start to see this happen in China in the next couple of decades, as they have a problem with immigration (read: racism).

After one quarter of contraction, we could be looking at just one more quarter, or a year.

Much of what we're witnessing is due to a confluence of major events - best though of as exogenous shocks here. \n\nCovid has shaped 2 years of market returns. It is still with us and it has led to massive, inhumane quarantines in China with all the market disruption that implies. \n\nSupply chains broke down during covid, completely. They are being rebuilt from scratch, and they are not being made to mirror what came before - China, for one, is working to insulate it's supply chains. \n\nFor our own part, we're seeking to internalize more critical supply chains through a sort of neo-autarky. We see individual companies hiring - or outright buying - ships, planes, trucks to get their goods. \n\nTesla is opening up a metal refinery and discussing buying lithium mines. \n\nBottlenecks are everywhere, and even with inflation it appears there is enough pent up demand for consumption to continue increasing as more goods make it to market - and there are still shortages for many products (anyone wanting a high-end laptop or a PS5 anytime in the past 2 years is certainly aware of this).\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine, it's increasing violence and its increasingly likely spread into Moldova have upended the global economy. Ukraine is 'Europe's Breadbasket' - one of the largest producers of wheat, other grains and seed oils in the world. Russia is close behind. This is a huge hit to a global population already suffering higher rates of hunger due to covid already. It'll get a lot worse, and famines have widespread implications.\n\nI could go on, but you get the point - while there is some contraction, it is happening amidst several global events that are transforming everything from global trading patterns to the nature of our social interactions with friends and family. \n\n**It's a recession as result of exogenous shocks - and these shocks can be factored into your stock buying.** It's why I bought into ADM and MATX months ago - and have been very happy as a result.

Consumer staples are always great. So is energy.\n\n*War between global provider of natural gas and oil and the ally of those most in need of gas and oil?* MLPs; oil companies in the short-term; renewables in the long-term. Also, miners - renewables require new types of metals that are also required by the burgeoning EV market - which itself will expand because of the war.

So u/GringoExpress, your theory about \"THE\" time to buy is when people are \"no longer salivating as the chance to buy the dip\" is essentially impossible because there will literally always be someone buying even if all stocks go to zero- but if you're saying the time to buy is when only a *few* people are \"salivating\", I'm on board with that...\n\nReality is, there is only one market condition when people are not \"dip-buying\" and \"calling the bottom\" - and that's when things are good and stocks are near the highs. Waiting until people are no longer dip buying means you're definitely with 100% certainty going to miss any recovery because you'll have to wait until stocks are unanimously considered worthless - and if that ever happens, everyone will be entirely in cash so any cash you have will also lose like 99% of its value.\n\nThe fact that the \"incoming bottom\" seems to be so widely discussed and accepted without the real presence of significant fear is a major red flag to me... (or should I say green flag). We may not be at the actual bottom, but the fact that everyone thinks we're headed lower to me means the risk-reward is skewed toward the buy side.

I am sharing mine below.\n\nMy strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks - W1 SMA(200) (blue on the picture) and min/max price from last 200 weeks - W1 MIN(200), W1 MAX(200) (both yellow on the picture). All these indicators are used for is to determine ultra conservatively what is the \"cheap\" price.\nYou can see them in the picture: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/ShzMz5nu/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ShzMz5nu/)\nAdd up new investment money every 6 months - as much as comfortable.\n\nHow to use?\n\n(W1 = 1 Week candlestick timeframe)\n\n1. Split ur total investment money into 4 equal piles.\n\n2. Invest one pile per crossing critical weekly structure (3 descibed below) - weekly structures are meaningful in moves many years across\n\n3. No matter how much you invested, sell 1/2 of the investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line - after this you can again buy from the initial place - W1 SMA200. You can also choose to sell the half when you are at 80% or more profit.\nNotice that you should pick stocks on which you have at least an 80-200% target if the price goes back to the MAX(200).\n\n4. Invest 1 pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line\n\n5. Invest the 1  pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line\n\n6. Invest 2 piles when the price goes under the W1 MIN(200) as far as it is to the MAX(200) from the W1 MIN(200) - orange rectangles used for measurement on the image.\n\n7. Hold 1/2 of the position in profit until you are happy with the profit (up to you, I recommend at least 3 years more after crossing W1 MAX(200) upwards).\n\n\nThis strategy is for investments lasting 3-10 years. Never sell a losing investment!\nIf you stopped liking the stock you invested in fundamentally after you invested, just go with it and try to take profit when the price bounces from one of your buy orders and overall you did profit from the stock.\n\nThis is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:\na) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on mediocre stock (TDOC) and 5-10 years on trusted stock (MSFT, AAPL).\nb) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have the balls to ignore them\nc) with this strategy you will rarely get fully out of cash - this may be hard to stand.\n\nThis should be used on assets that are growing forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).\nI really advise buying something that is traded publicly for at least 5 years.\n\nProfits can be reinvested.\n\nIf you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media.

We're not at the bottom of the GFC, we're not in the March 2020 lows. All we've done so far is correct from insanely and ridiculously overvalued to less overvalued in many cases. At this point, this is more of a correction to the mean with a bit of fear sprinkled over it. A proper recession will hit harder. Much harder. And there will be more constant bleeds.\n\nMy advice to people would be: Don't freak out. Do your work before making a buying decision. Do what you've always done. Unless doing what you've always done led you to the decision to buy TSLA at a thousand bucks or NFLX at 500 bucks because you thought they were undervalued. In that case learn as much  as you can and improve your system. Remind yourself that valuation matters. Remind yourself that a stock isn't necessarily good value just because it has come down 20, 40 or 60%. Remind  yourself that proper long-term investing means consistent and regular re-evaluation of your thesis and the numbers.\n\nAnd that's key. A stock you own/want being oversold because of general fear, hype calming down or others  dragging it with them can be great if  the company itself hasn't changed, if your  thesis still applies. In that case it may be coming close to a range where it's valued attractively.\n\nIt could also be terrible if it's a result of a  company's inability to execute and perform to expectations or of a company having to change their business model in a significant way.

As Russian gas continues to flow in, ***storage facilities are slowly being refilled after the winter,*** when demand for gas is heaviest, and are currently one-third full. In recent weeks the minister for the economy said efforts to secure gas from other countries had resulted in a one-third reduction in the amount of gas that comes from Russia.\n\nEarlier this year, the government began a review process that ***could, if necessary, mandate gas rationing.***\n\nBut if Russia were to stop gas flows to Germany, the economy ministry reported to Parliament recently, ***the situation could become critical quickly.***\n\n“We have to be ready for it,” Mr. Scholz told reporters in Tokyo, where he paid Prime Minister Fumio Kishida a visit to shore up ties between the two countries. Japan, which like Germany is an energy-poor industrial powerhouse, is also struggling to ensure that it has sufficient natural gas supplies.\n\nAt the outset of the war, Germany relied on Russia to meet 55 percent of its natural gas needs. Since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the country has reduced that amount to 35 percent by canceling some contracts and importing more liquefied natural gas, or LNG, from other countries.\n\nBy the end of the year, German officials said they hoped to be drawing less than a third of the country’s gas from Russia.\n\nStill, the Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, warned last week that ***an embargo on Russian gas could cause the country’s economic output to drop by as much as 5 percent this year.*** Mr. Scholz and his finance minister have also warned that an immediate ***cutoff of Russian gas could throw the economy into a recession.***\n\nTens of thousands of jobs in German industries that are powered by gas, including chemicals and steel, could be threatened.\n\nNearly half of all homes in Germany are heated with natural gas. ***If rationing becomes necessary, private homes, along with essential infrastructure such as hospitals, would be prioritized*** in the event of a shortage.\n\nThe government has also focused on refilling natural gas storage facilities that had been left nearly empty as the winter came to an end, some because they had been in the hands of Russian companies. Germany seized control of the storage tanks after the start of April, citing national security reasons.\n\nIt has since been slowly and steadily refilling the facilities, with the aim of ensuring that they are at 90 percent capacity by Dec. 1, in keeping with a new European Union law that was drawn up to ensure sufficient levels of gas supply.\n\nRobert Habeck, the German economy minister, has also been working to find alternative suppliers for the coal and oil that Germany imports from Russia. Neither fossil fuel is as important to the country’s energy supply as gas, with only 25 percent of coal and only 35 percent of oil coming from Russian fields at the start of the year.\n\nGermany is now in a position to join the European Union’s embargo on Russian coal and will soon be in position to do the same with oil, Mr. Habeck said this week, after a trip to Poland that he said was part of the government strategy “to step by step, set the conditions and to meet them” to achieve independence from Russia.\n\n“And now we will do the same thing with gas,” Mr. Habeck said.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your original assertion is that Tesla would not have access to natural gas, that is incorrect.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Tell me you didn't read the article without telling me you didn't read the article.

(Long call, short call, long put, short put). In this case long put", "score": 154, "replies": [{"body": "It’s easier to think about it as a call instead at first. Someone writes a call and someone else buys that call option hoping the stock price will rise (as opposed to buying a put hoping it will fall) The seller (writer) picks a strike price and agrees to sell the stock to the buyer at that price at a future date. It’s always in chunks of 100 shares. So if you buy one option you control 100 shares of the stock. 2 options you control 200. If the stock price rises above the strike and you exercise (as this guy did but most people sell the actual call/put to someone else to make the gains instead of waiting for or purposely exercising) you are able to buy the stock at the strike price and then immediately sell it at the now higher price. You make that difference minus the price you paid the seller for the call. That price you paid is called the premium. Premiums are more expensive if the volatility is high or close to earnings. And you pay more premium for the longer amount of time you have till the option expires.\n\nOk so simple right? Seller of call says I’ll sell to you at this price no matter what. If it goes beyond that you make money so long as it goes higher than the difference you paid for the premium.\n\nA put is the opposite. The seller, instead of agreeing the sell to you at the strike price, is basically promising to buy from you at the strike price. Premium shit is all the same. So what happened here is the guy bought a put option that expired the next day (risky), and he paid a premium of $7,170. He bought 1 so he controlled 100shares. The strike price was 2800. The stock fell below that strike to where he exercised at 2600. So the put writer had to basically “buy” his shares at 2800 even though the price of the stock is now 2600. Since he has 100 shares (1 option) that’s $280,000 - $260,000. Or 20k. Minus what he paid in premium, which you never get back. So he made just under 13k.\n\nThe tricky part really is that when it comes to a call when you exercise you basically are buying the stock at a lower price (if you have the funds to do so) and then can sell it at the higher price to lock in those gains. You could also hold the underlying at that point and hope the stock goes up even more. Or it could plummet and wipe out the gains you made.\n\nThe issue with exercising a put (when you don’t actually own 100 shares of the underlying) is that you basically enter a short position. Meaning you are borrowing shares in the stock at a certain price and then hoping to buy back those shares when the price is cheaper. I’m sure you’ve heard all about those meanie hedge funds shorting stocks around here all the time. The thing is if you don’t close that short position (cover) and the price skyrockets you can get absolutely fucked to hell and theoretically the losses could be limitless. But this guy covered right away and pocketed those gains. Maybe his broker forced him to. I dunno. I don’t even know if he had enough funds to actually own the underlying or the protocol for his broker when it comes to exercising if you don’t have the funds. Maybe he’s got 300k in there to do so. Maybe not.\n\nAnyways, I guess the kinda cool thing here is the guy got his broker to do all this after hours. When normal trading is done. He could have waited until tomorrow…maybe made more. Or made less or nothing. But he basically called and locked in the gains made on after hour price movement.", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "This was not easier", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Read it again and focus, i believe in you retard.
