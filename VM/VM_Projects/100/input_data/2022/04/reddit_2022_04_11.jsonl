Ideally you should be able to afford at least 50 delta.\n\nDelta is proportional to probability of profit at expiration (sometimes called probability of ITM at expiration), so the higher your delta, the better chance you'll make a profit over your holding time (which need not be until expiration).\n\nIn general, the more confidence you have in your price forecast for the underlying, the lower in delta you can go. You are not doing so for delta, since higher delta is usually better all else equal, you are going low on delta in order to lower your initial cost of entry. Lower cost means higher leverage.\n\n**Expiration**\n\nTry to keep your expirations under 60 days. Why August?\n\n-----\n\nAs for the rest, they are not very relevant.

That isn't possible.

You might have to wait one more day if not.\n\n> For the $90, I’m factoring in event A’s max net losses of $10 5/20 vs $25 5/20 (Event B max loss - event A max loss)\n\nStill doesn't make sense.

It's not usually that large. So your example gives you an overly optimistic sense of the risk. Imagine a more realistic situation where the OTM put pays $1 ($1 extrinsic + $0 intrinsic) and the ITM put pays $16 ($1 extrinsic + $15 intrinsic) credit. Since you \"pay back\" all of the intrinsic value during assignment (assuming the stock price is below the opening price, as it was for your $10 open vs. $9 expiration), there would be no advantage for the ITM put vs. the OTM put, but all the additional risks already stated.\n\nIf you should actually find such an OTM vs. ITM put difference in extrinsic value, that's a rare exploitable edge that is probably worth the risk of going for. But like I said, rare.\n\n> Psychologically it does suck, but mathematically you are paying the same as $10/share for something worth $9/share right? (since you got the credit)\n\nIf you are a person where math can overrule psychology, sure. But don't underestimate the power of emotion when it comes to trading.\n\n> Wouldn’t the max gain for B change as the stock price increases?\n\nYes, I believe that is what I said. It cuts both ways. The assigned stock may go up and you make (save) more, or the stock goes down and you lose more.\n\n> Could you explain early assignment in layman terms?\n\nIt means exactly what the name says. If expiration is 5/20 and you get assigned on some day before 5/20, that would be an early assignment.\n\n> while event B has wiggle room from $11 to $25.\n\nSigh, that's not wiggle room. That's pure penalty! That's intrinsic value that you were \"loaned\" and that you have to \"pay back\" on assignment. You don't get to keep all of that intrinsic value unless the stock price rises *above* $25.  Since that is extremely unlikely, you are going to pay at least some part of that intrinsic value back through the unrealized loss on the stock.\n\nI don't think you've grasped the importance of that unrealized loss. If you paid $25 for something that cost $9, and you spend the credit that would have covered it, what happens if the stock never goes above $10 again for years? You will carry that unrealized loss on your books for all that time. Eventually, you may have to realize it. Then what? The money that would have covered it is long gone.\n\nAnd if your plan is to immediately dump the shares as soon as you can, why take assignment in the first place? You can sell to close the put for very close to the same net gain/loss on or near expiration day, and avoid all the hassle of shares and unrealized loss. It will just be realized loss, instead.

The logic is that these orders, as opposed to market orders, do not fill immediately.

But the constant is that at least one MM is active in the market for that contract.\n\n* Everyone in the market makes bids and offers on the contract. But those bids and offers may not be the actual prices traders will trade at. So while yes, there will be limit orders establishing bids and asks, there are also \"invisible\" price targets that traders in the market, including MMs, will fill a trade at. For example, say the bid/ask is 2.00/2.10. There is at least one active bid and one active ask at those prices, those are visible to the entire market. But, you can enter a bid to buy at 2.07 *that instantly fills*, because some trader in the market, usually an MM with a computer, had decided that 2.07 was an acceptable bid for a contract they wanted to sell, but if they could instead get someone to pay 2.10, all the better. So they're limit ask is 2.10, but they're *actual* acceptable trade price was 2.07. The 2.07 price is invisible.\n\n* There is an edge-case where the only bids are invisible bids. The actual listed bid will be $0, but that doesn't mean a seller can't fill an order. If there is an invisible bid for $.01 from an MM, it may be possible to fill for that price.\n\n* Market orders are neither here nor there in how the market functions.

The reason there is an MM in the market always is for when you *don't* have any friends trading that contract. When no one else will trade with you, at least one MM will. Otherwise, there will be pockets of no liquidity across the options market, which will cause chaos. You would be less likely to buy a call with a 1 year expiration if you had some doubt about whether there would be a market for your *profitable* call in a year. Exchanges don't want you to worry about that.\n\nBesides, MMs make good money. It's not like anyone is forcing them to create liquidity, it's a good business for them.\n\n> Are there well-known market makers in the US options market? Who are they?\n\nThere are several, most associated with big banks, but the biggest MM in the US is Citadel Securities, which is *also* a hedge fund.

You decide to buy a call option to benefit from an increase in the stock's price. **You purchase one call option with a strike price of $115** for one month in the future for 37 cents per contact. Your total cash outlay is $37 for the position plus fees and commissions (0.37 x 100 = $37).\n\n> If the stock rises to $116, your option will be worth $1, since you could exercise the option to acquire the stock for $115 per share and immediately resell it for $116 per share. The profit on the option position would be 170.3% since you paid 37 cents and earned $1—that's much higher than the 7.4% increase in the underlying stock price from $108 to $116 at the time of expiry.\n\nMy question is: If you think MSFT is going to $116, why wouldn't you purchase call options with a strike price of, say, $114, or $113, or, heck, $109?  Wouldn't you make a lot more money *and* reduce your risk?\n\nI know I'm missing something big (and probably obvious) here, but my research hasn't given me an answer.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> but I don't understand how the purchase price is decided.\n\nYou meant strike selection.

Wouldn't you make a lot more money and reduce your risk?\n\nIt's all trade-offs when it comes to options trading. If the current price is 108 and the target price is 116, yes, $114 would make more than 115, 109 would make more than 114, etc. Okay, since *everything is trade-offs*, you have to give something up for that extra reward. If you learn nothing else, learn that. Any time you try to make something better for an option trade, one or more things need to get worse.\n\nSo in this case what gets worse is:\n\n* The cost of the call goes up. If the 115 costs .37, the 114 might cost .82, and the 109 might cost 6.69. So now your \"bigger profit\" of 116-109 is actually smaller, because you had to pay more for the call.\n\n* Your risk actually goes up, not down. The more you pay up front, the higher your risk, since you can lose everything that you paid.\n\nIn fact, *any time reward goes up*, risk must go up also. The same is not necessarily true in reverse. Risk can go up without reward also going up, if it is unrewarded risk.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much for that super clear explanation!\n\nThat's actually what I was assuming the reasoning was, but nothing I've read or watched has mentioned it.

I know theta decay is a thing but this is 6 mo to exp.\n\nPlease help me out here. Thank you all.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Okay, a lot to unpack here. The quick answer that it's often better to take a profit early than late, here's why: [Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/risk_reward_and_exits)\n\nFirst, where are you getting those prices from, like $100 and $80? Is that the bid of the bid/ask, or the mark? The mark can jump up and down, even though the bid goes steadily up, so it's best to track the value of your call by the bid. The bid may understate your value a little, but better that than overstating. For example, you could get that pattern of up to $100, down to $80, with a bid/ask of $.75/$1.25 (mark is $1.00), then later a bid of $.78/$.82 (mark is $.80). So even though the mark went down, the bid went up.\n\nAssuming it was the bid and not the mark that went from $1.00 to $.80, the key phrase in your trade history is, \"it dropped.\" For long calls, once option traders start to doubt that the call is going to pay off, demand can dry up. So even though the closing price was higher than the intra-day stock price that got you an intra-day high value on the call, the drop may have \"spooked\" traders into being more cautious. Demand can also dry up towards the end of the day as day traders who don't want to hold overnight unwind their positions and dump positions on the market, depressing price.\n\nIf the underlying had just gone straight up with no detours downwards, your call probably would have finished higher. Though even in that situation it can still tail off and not rise in value as much as it did earlier in the day, if IV started high and declined during the day.\n\nFinally, don't dismiss theta just because you have 6 months to expiration. If you have a lot of extrinsic value, theta is still a risk. For a single day it would be a pretty small per-day loss, but those days add up. Five months of $.005 theta decay a day is still $.75 of cumulative loss. As a percentage of a $1.00 premium that is 100% extrinsic value, that is some serious decay.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}

Economists' latest forecasts also show the chance of a recession in the next 12 months has risen to 27.5% from 20% last month\n\nAccording to former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the United States will fall into a recession next year, and more and more economists are reaching a consensus on this.\n\nOn Friday, Summers pointed out on a TV show that the combination of \"overheating, policy delays, and supply shocks\" poses an extremely difficult set of challenges, so that a U.S. recession is \"clearly more difficult than no recession in the next few years.\" It is possible,\" adding that economists are gradually reaching such a consensus.\n\nData from a survey of economists does show that the probability of a recession they forecast in the next 12 months has risen from 20% last month to 27.5% today.\n\nSummers emphasized that historically, the United States has not been without a recession within two years after inflation above 4% and unemployment below 4%. At present, the market's expectation for the US CPI in March has exceeded 8%, and the corresponding unemployment rate is 3.6%.\n\nSummers believes that if the Fed is to reduce inflation, it needs to properly weaken the labor market. He cited nominal wages (not adjusted for cost of living), which he said were surging at the fastest rate on record, with an annual rate of 5.6 per cent in March. And a recent co-authored paper by Summers shows that once nominal wage growth exceeds a certain rate \"say 4% or 4.5%\" it leads to worse, not better, outcomes in terms of household purchasing power.\n\nAnd right now, in the words of Summers, the U.S.’s current 40-year high inflation means that average real wages last year were “one of the worst performances we’ve ever seen.”\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Summers predicted as early as the middle of last year that U.S. inflation would reach 5% by the end of the year, much higher than the Fed’s statement of 3.4% at the time, and the final data also confirmed Summers’ prediction.", "id": "u0y4yf", "created_utc": 1649646942.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "\"Doomsday\"?!

It could be summed up as: some businesses had supply chain problems and raised prices, and other businesses saw stimulus money in the economy and wanted to get their beaks a bit more wet. But they also figured why give a raise to anyone, there's a CTC now. It also doesn't help that a petrostate is under sanction, which pushes up gas prices, which is a big contributor to how inflation \"feels\" to the average person.\n\nSo every signal told businesses to raise prices without actually doing the other part of making sure the workforce could afford it. (I'm speaking in a very general sense, of course most individual businesses do not set their prices based on what their employees can afford.) Supply chain issues actually masked this a little bit by making certain things more difficult to acquire, such that only the more well off could afford them. This made the demand-supply ratio look really impressive, but the numerator and the denominator were both smaller numbers than anyone cared to admit. (No evidence for this, just trying to make a case here that might be worth thinking about.)\n\nIf that's the case, inflation should cool pretty naturally because demand will just starve out due to inflation, and businesses will wise up and see there's market share to be gained through lowering prices.\n\nI just tend to think low/zero real wage growth is an underreported aspect of this economy and will ultimately constrain inflation.

I’m not too sure if it still results in a bull case here.\n\nThe way I see it is that there is going to be some hurt going on whether the fed raises rates or not. If the fed raises rates more aggressively, there will be some hurt in the short term like a recession, but things will eventually try to go back to normal. If the can is kicked down the road, it will look like a bubble of some pretty extreme proportions. Extreme inflation till nothing is affordable, then pop.

This provision protects internet platforms like Facebook and Google from liability for statements and content its users generate.\n\nThis legal protection—not accorded to newspapers or other fora—created the internet as we know it. Protection from liability for any false or injurious content their users post has permitted the social media giants to allow the incredibly freewheeling discussions and commentary that we have come to expect from the internet. Exemplary is Facebook’s response to the recently circulated doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In a statement to The Washington Post, Facebook said:“We don’t have a policy that stipulates that the information you post on Facebook must be true.” In addition, this legal protection has also helped create the lucrative tech behemoths and further their dominance in attracting advertisers. This dominance has gutted the advertising revenue streams of local, regional, and even national media outlets—outlets that do not enjoy the privileges of Section 230.\n\nBut what is particularly bizarre, ironic, and deeply destructive to public discourse is that, though Congress passed Section 230 to promote a free and open internet, Facebook, Twitter, and Google now use it to advocate for an open internet while at the same time justifying their censorship regimes.\n\nOn one hand, Twitter, Google, and the other internet platforms often advocate for an open and free internet with no restrictive gatekeepers who would block or throttle disfavored content—i.e., the policy generically known as “network neutrality.” However, they advocate for an open and free internet only when faced with broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast that could block their services. In 2017, Zuckerberg wrote that broadband providers should not be allowed to “block you from seeing certain content.” Similarly, Twitter’s lobbyists argued that Verizon and Comcast should not be permitted to “block content they don’t like” and/or relegate “certain content to the backwaters of the Internet in second or third-tier status.”\n\nOn the other hand, Facebook, Twitter, and Google seem to embrace a principle of “an open internet for thee but not for me” when it comes to their own platforms. And much of the country has yet to comprehend the power they seek to wield through discriminatory network practices. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey explained to podcaster Sam Harris that Twitter does not “optimize for neutrality” when moderating speech, despite the company’s professed support for “net neutrality.” He didn’t specify which values Twitter does optimize, but Columbia University’s Richard Hanania found that over 95 percent of high-profile bans have targeted those on the Right.”\n\n1/2. https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/social-media-platforms-or-publishers-rethinking-section-230/", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Gave you an upvote because I largely agree with it, but you should at least attribute the [source](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/social-media-platforms-or-publishers-rethinking-section-230/) that constitutes the bulk of your comment.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "He’s posting right wing political sources while complaining about politics in a stocks subreddit.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Meh.

For instance, telephone companies cannot kick customers off their platform on the basis of political views, nor can airlines. In contrast, the social media firms have the power—and have used the power—to kick off any user for any reason, in contravention of civil rights law. Similarly, cable companies retain legal liability for content the public creates on the public, educational, and government access channels, and newspapers retain legal liability for their paid advertising. But social media platforms face no liability for the libelous, or even criminal, statements their users publish.\n\nHow have we gotten to this legal anomaly where dominant internet platforms not only avoid antitrust scrutiny and run-of-the-mill legal duties, but also receive government giveaways? Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is the culprit. Passed in 1996 as part of the Communications Decency Act, its primary purpose was, as its name suggests, to regulate pornography on the web. The Supreme Court struck down the anti-porn provisions on First Amendment grounds, but Section 230 was upheld and, until recently, remained obscure.\n\nCongress passed Section 230 in 1996 to help the nascent internet platforms and encourage them to censor indecent and obscene content. They did so by altering traditional common law for publishers. In those days, the major internet firms were dial-up bulletin boards such as Prodigy, AOL, and CompuServe. Before passage of Section 230, they faced so-called “publisher” and “distributor” tort liability law, a body of legal rules developed over centuries to deal with newspapers and booksellers.\n\nCourts had reasoned that these early platforms were not the publishers of statements made by third parties on their fora, but were instead distributors. Legal lingo aside, this meant that Prodigy and the other platforms typically could not be sued for libel or be held criminally liable based on comments posted by its users. Distributor liability requires direct knowledge of the illegal comments as well as a failure to act once made aware of them. Thus, a bookstore had no liability for libelous books on its shelves, but could become liable if it was credibly informed of the books’ content and nonetheless failed to act. On the other hand, if Prodigy were to communicate directly to its users or create content, it would be liable for that content.\n\nThis distinction between publishers and distributors rubbed Congress the wrong way, especially in the mid-1990s when legislators were trying to keep the internet wholesome and pornography-free. The legal result was this: when Prodigy promised to create a family-friendly environment, editing for indecent or profane comments, courts ruled that it had lost its distributor liability, and treated Prodigy as publisher of all content on its bulletin boards. Thus, Prodigy, because it took affirmative steps to police speech, became liable for all statements published in its curated bulletin boards. This was a powerful incentive not to curate the internet.\n\nCongress considered this outcome undesirable. One of Section 230’s sponsors, Representative Chris Cox of California, thought this was “exactly the wrong result” because platforms exposed themselves to greater liability if they tried to keep their content clean. Thus, in order to keep things clean on the internet and to ensure the free flow of ideas, Congress passed Section 230.\n\nSection 230(c)(1) ensures the free flow of ideas, exempting internet platforms from publisher and distributor liability posted by third parties. In this sense, Section 230(c)(1) provides common carrier protections. Just as telephone companies, broadband service providers, and even courier services like FedEx have no liability for the content of the messages and parcels they carry, neither does Facebook or Twitter.\n\nSection 230(c)(2) was meant to keep things clean. It relieves carriers of liability for efforts to censor or curate content “in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.” Thus, when Prodigy edits comments for decency, it can do so without becoming a publisher of the entire website.\n\nCongress bestowed in Section 230 extraordinary gifts of liability immunity. Section 230(c)(1) essentially gives internet platforms the immunities of common carriers, such as telephone companies, delivery services, and airlines. And Section 230(c)(2) is simply unprecedented and sui generis. The ease of distributing pornography and other obscene materials on the internet—which in the 1990s was shocking—no doubt motivated this gift.\n\nBut what makes Section 230 truly unprecedented is that Congress gave these legal privileges without any public obligation in return. For centuries, common law has recognized that certain types of industries that exhibit market power have obligations to the public. These obligations include non-discrimination, service to all customers, as well as sometimes more burdensome regulation such as rate regulation. In short, they had to give up some pricing and marketing strategies associated with their extraordinary market power. But in return, they received certain benefits, such as liability exemption and other legal privileges like special property easement or even rights of condemnation.\n\nSection 230 asks for nothing because the early internet platforms like Prodigy and CompuServe had nothing to give. They had no market power upon which to exercise control. Congress bestowed a gift on the nascent industry in Section 230(c)(1) and an incentive for creating family-friendly environments in Section 230(c)(2).\n\nBut times have changed. Facebook, Twitter, and Google now bestride the narrow world like a Colossus. They exercise market power like a telephone company or electrical utility, extracting huge rents from the economy. They receive liability relief for the messages they carry just like a telephone or electrical utility, but with none of the duties of nondiscrimination or service. The result is obvious. Insulated from market forces by their near monopoly power and facing diminished financial incentives given their Croesus-like wealth, the leaders of these private companies can indulge their personal preferences, imposing them on the country’s political discourse.\n\nIn short, the Section 230 “deal” should be up for renegotiation.”\n\n2/2", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> I am claiming that because of it the conclusion should be they should be subjected to new regulation\n\nYou won’t get 60 votes to pass a new law destroy the internet. \n\n> that prevents them to act as a publisher when they want and as a common carrier when they is convenient to them\n\nAgain.

The freedom of movement can become in conflict to freedom of private property and the right of privacy, and seems sensible that those rights prevail over the freedom of movement of an individual that might want to enter your house or warehouse. In other cases it’s the other way around and freedom of movement is respected at the expense of private property, as a landowner whose property has no public access can be awarded an easement to cross private land if necessary to reach his own property. But in the case of freedom of speech it seems as if that right is considered less important than freedom of association in general which is absurd because in the USA the freedom of association is a consequence of freedom of speech, as it was considered necessary (at the time) to be able to associate with other people in order to be able to exercise freedom of speech. \n\n“While the United States Constitution's First Amendment identifies the rights to assemble and to petition the government, the text of the First Amendment does not make specific mention of a right to association. Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court held in NAACP v. Alabama (1958) that freedom of association is an essential part of freedom of speech because, in many cases, people can engage in effective speech only when they join with others.[6] Other Supreme Court cases involving freedom of association issues include:[7]”\n\nSo the USA has freedom of association only because it was necessary to have freedom of speech but now it’s claimed that freedom of association takes precedence and when in conflict with freedom of speech it’s freedom of association which should prevail. It’s absurd.\n\nNow we live in a world with digital newspapers and social media rather than people needing to shout in a corner down the street or associate with other people to make a newspaper. Before, people didn’t have the same access to mediums that allowed them to send that speech to a big number of people, you needed to own a newspaper or a radio/TV channel, now there is social media and is in social media where the political issues are discussed.\n\nBut it’s also a false equivalency because there isn’t a necessity to do it as when companies claim they have a right of freedom of association in regards to fire employees or censor/ban clients they claim that they would face reputation damage if they wouldn’t do it, but if there is a law preventing them to do so they would face no reputation damage at all as people would know they are simply not allowed to fire nor censor based on ideology.\n\nIt also is absurd to forbid companies from asking about the political ideas of their potential employees so they can’t discriminate people based on ideology but then allowing companies to fire people based on the ideas they have expressed outside their job.\n\nAny company also provide their services or products at their private property, and yet they can’t prevent their workers from unionizing. Also, it’s not the same thing because social media is a market with net externalities, meaning the value a service has for a potential users increases with the number of people that are already users of said service. This is a type of externality that works as an entry barrier for other platforms to succeed. The same that OS have net externalities and btw, talking about OS, the government forced Microsoft to allow for other companies to sell their web browsers to Windows users. And Windows is Microsoft private property, you are just an user, the client don’t receive the uncompiled code, you are buying a license and you own a license that gives you permission to use windows property, and yet that private property was ordered to be compatible with the products of other companies against Microsoft interests. So to suggest that you can go and create a different social media (when even founders/owners of social media acknowledge this isn’t feasible anymore) and this would be respecting your freedom of speech would be like saying that you can make a different OS, it’s true, but it also comes with a set of implications that would prevent users of that new platform to gain as much utility from it because most people already use a platform.\n\nAlso, how is it that it’s good for social media to not be a common ground in which all ideas are represented and we consider it a good thing that, at least with certain topics, people shouldn’t have it easy to share their ideas with people with different ideas? The whole point of freedom of speech is to ensure nobody monopolizes the ideas that a group of people are going to be presented with. To allow people to have access to everything, even risking offending them. And yet we are promoting a society that defends spaces in which people can’t have their perspectives challenged?

On the other hand they also claim they are not distributors, so they can curate content just like publishers, but those that curate content (publishers) are liable from anyone demanding them for libel, defamation, falsehoods, etc…. A newspaper is liable if they publish falsehoods (they are publishers), but social media claims they don’t have to ensure that their content is true. So by all means, defend that they are like newspapers and can curate content, but then you should also demand they are liable, and social media don’t want that, they want all the benefits from both publishers and distributors but none of the responsibilities, the same way they tell the public we shouldn’t allow comcast or Verizon to curate content and prevent content to reach the public (because they fear these other companies could censor them, as social media is hosted in Verizon and comcast private property) but they also tell the public they have to curate content and censor users.\n\nThe special figure they were granted for historical reasons in 1996 was a very specific one that Pelosi herself have stated it was a gift, a gift based on the fear in those early years of the internet that pornography would become pervasive everywhere. It’s absurd to justify an absurdly privileged position that allows them to compete with a competitive advantage against traditional media and it never was intended to be used to ban anything but pornography.\n\nAlso, for the people that claim that freedom of speech only protects people from the censorship of the state, let’s remind them those companies are capable of censor users just because the government gave them that special gift, exclusively to them, at the same time the government gifted them with total legal immunity for any content hosted by them (which save them an insane amount of money). Again, publishers can censor but are liable and they can’t publish falsehoods. Why would any company need to censor if they would be inmune to any legal action for the content they host as long they don’t censor? Just remain distributors as before section 230 of the DCA and that’s that. That way they wouldn’t need to censor in order to not be responsible for their content. Except for the fact the government wanted these private companies to curate the content by banning and censor according with some “decency” claims (that’s why it’s called the Communications Decency Act). More specifically:\n\n“Section 230(c)(2) was meant to keep things clean. It relieves carriers of liability for efforts to censor or curate content “in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.”\n\nSo from the very beginning the deal was, rather than you don’t censoring anything and therefore don’t be liable, censor what we want and we will give you total legal immunity for any content you host, and you would be better of as you could host content that may not be true but can be very attractive for the public, something traditional media can’t do as they are liable. Unfortunately, these privileges, these gifts, these special conditions only applicable to them, didn’t specify in a concrete form what kind of content they can curate and what not, and the censorship started to align with whatever ideological bias these companies had themselves, as well as keeping the content family friendly so their revenue source, advertising (this was discovered afterwards as at the time nobody knew what was going to be the business model for these companies), could be attracted. So now we have companies that have all the privileges of publishers and distributors, with none of the responsibilities, that can host falsehoods legally, and can censor according with both their business interests and their bias, which wasn’t for what section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was intended. And obviously without both parties agreeing, these special privileges can’t be taken away, and obviously one party is very happy with the situation. \n\nBut the only reason they can censor is because the government decided to grant special conditions to them so they could censor in the name of the government (or that was the plan). In fact, the Supreme Court decided that based on the first amendment the government couldn’t censor pornography, but this sneaky tactic of using companies to do the censorship in exchange for competitive advantages that allowed them to grow above traditional media wasn’t forbidden. And that’s why we are in these situation. It was proposed just a couple years ago for the situation to remain the same with the sole difference these companies would have to prove to a committee from the congress that they are not ideological biased in their censorship. This was opposed by their lobbies and of course the party that is benefiting from this refused that proposal.\n\nI am not conservative, I am not even American, I am gay and quite libertarian, I never liked the Republican Party before during or after Trump.

{"title": "Tesla Needs Lithium. Elon Musk Suggests It Might Get Into the Mining Business.", "selftext": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk lamented the rising cost of lithium in a recent tweet. He even suggested that Tesla might get into the mining business to help solve shortages of the key raw material that goes into rechargeable lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries.\n\nTesla-as-miner has far-reaching implications for the EV industry. Will locking up long-term lithium supply become a strategic imperative for the industry? Will other auto companies look to backward integrate into the EV battery supply chain? Those are longer term questions for investors to ponder. More immediately, lithium mining stocks—most likely the smaller ones—could react wildly in Monday trading. The larger, more established, players include Albemarle (ticker: ALB), Liven t (LTHM) and SQM (SQM). ( Livent still qualifies as a small capitalization stock.)\n\nThree smaller players include Piedmont Lithium (PLL), Lithium Americas (LAC) and Sigma Lithium (SGML.Canada). The three large players have a combined market capitalization of more than $50 billion. The three smaller players, which are in different stages of ramping up new projects, have a combined market cap of less than $10 billion. “Price price of lithium has gone to insane levels!” tweeted Musk on April 8.\n\nHe has a point. Benchmark lithium prices are at about $78,000 a metric ton, up almost 80% year-to-date. The price for a basket of battery materials Barron’s tracks is up about 60% year-to-date, theoretically adding roughly $2,000 to the price of an EV. Most battery materials, however, are bought on a contract basis. Most commodity prices quoted are spot prices. When spot is greater than contract, it is a sign that contract prices will move higher.\n\n“Tesla might have to get into the mining \\[and \\] refining directly at scale,” said Musk, adding in a later tweet “we have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction \\[and\\] refinement.”\n\nScale doesn’t appear to be the big issue. There are large miners such as Albemarle that produce lithium for well less than $10,000 a metric ton, according to company documents and Barron’s calculations. What’s more, everyone in the lithium industry is investing for growth. Wall Street expects Albemarle’s capital spending to be about $1.4 billion in 2022, more than double levels from just a few years ago.\n\nCurrent spot prices are good enough for miners to put capital into the ground. Instead, the issues appear to be EV demand growth, which is happening faster than people, and the time it takes for the mining industry to ramp up new capacity.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-lithium-elon-musk-51649610496?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-lithium-elon-musk-51649610496?mod=home-page)", "id": "u117cq", "created_utc": 1649658456.0, "score": 275, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "Can we stop making posts about everything that Musk is saying?\n\nMust said he doesnt want a seat at Twitter\nMusk said is getting into miming business\nMusk said he will introduce a humanoid android next year\n\nMusk said this, Musk said that.\n\nOK I get it, he is the richest person in the world and highly influential.\n\nBut can we move on? \nHalf of his tweets are bs, posted without any thoughts.

Nevertheless, the change has had and will continue to have a profound effect on the role of the Federal Reserve in the United States financial system.  To implement policy in its new regime, the Fed not only has to be much bigger but also must continuously grow larger and expand the breadth of its counterparties.  The record indicates that the FOMC did not appreciate the consequences of its decision at the time, and the question now is whether the decision will be revisited given how manifest and serious those consequences are. Specifically, the Fed announced that it would conduct monetary policy by over-supplying liquidity to the financial system, driving short-term interest rates down to the rate that the Fed pays to sop the liquidity back up.

That's why we didn't see elevated inflation from the 30% GPD expansion in 2020 until June 2021.\n\nNow I'm not like all \"thank you savior Biden\" about this...

The same as spending, sitting at the 10 year trendline.\n\nIt's not that it has no effect, there are definitely places in the market where money has leaked out, but it's not the dominant effect by any stretch of the imagination. The model I use predicted the current inflationary curve BEFORE any Fed release happened... that excess money is not necessary to get the current inflation and not as influential as people who just form opinions based on hawkish ideology think.\n\nThe two primary places where inflation is highest are used car prices and energy, and neither price has anything to do with the M2 and everything to do with gapped up demand relative to production, which is not coming from excess spending rather than displaced spending patterns... and energy affects all of the other sectors.

The Fed doesn't give money to individuals and businesses... it interacts primarily with banks and savings and stable investment institutions. \n\nI'm aware that you're also conflating government recovery/stimulus/support programs with the Fed increasing the M2, which are two completely different things. This misunderstanding is common with right-wing reddit trolls, so I'm not surprised to hear you parroting this idiocy.\n\nThe Fed didn't buy bonds from the government, they bought bonds from banks to anchor them against toxic assets, which is why M2 went up... M2 is the bank reserve system, NOT governmental funds.\n\nI can keep going explaining this for about 20 more paragraphs, but the bottom line is you don't know how any of this works... at all.\n\nIn the end, stimulus money was more of an income offset that was accumulated in savings accounts that is now mostly exhausted... it replaced lost GDP in the gap-up at the end of 2020, and served its purpose. That is not excess capital that cane from M2 expansion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Due to the nature of this field, a committed and analytical person can assemble a technical argument to support almost any conclusion, and keep a discussion about it going for approximately a week. So while I generally disagree with your etiology, I'm not going to get into a technical argument about it. That isn't to say I wouldn't benefit at all from a technical argument... but it is to say that I would get about 3 days behind at work.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that a reddit troll would say.\n\nWe're not going to have a debate because you don't know how the financial system works, don't understand Capitalist economics, and the data doesn't support your argument.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The only thing I would say is that if you think prices are going to go back down when the supply shocks are over, I would enjoy hearing a quantitative prediction to that effect. If you don't think that (for some reason like prices are sticky, or it will never end, etc.) nevermind.\n\nAt no point did I state that prices would go down... just the opposite. The excess money in the system WILL be inflationary as the banks release it into the economy, which gets more likely the more dovish the Fed is.\n\nThe Fed's current course, as long as they don't get too aggressive and stifle growth too much, is totally appropriate. \n\nI get this kind of thing a LOT from people who don't understand economics on here like you... when I point out that the inflationary delta curve was cut in half on the back half of 2021, people who don't understand economics immediately jump to \"so you're arguing prices will go down.\"\n\nSlower inflation means prices are going up more slowly... it does not mean that prices will go down. As long as spending continues, prices will continue to go up. \n\nWithout Ukraine, the inflationary calculation would have hit an inflection point in June that would have pushed the YoY rate down even if prices continued to increase... that's a function of the basic math of a declining monthly inflationary average. Now, there's a wildcard because of the war and its impact on the supply chain.\n\nSo I would definitely NOT bet that inflation will go down from here. There are too many unknowns as of the past month...\n\nBut that wasn't the topic, the topic was existing inflation which is mostly supply chain and energy demand. Money in the reserve system will be more inflationary over the next 10 years as the banks slowly release it as credit and lending.\n\nOne place where \"money leaked out\" was in real estate which is more heavily affected by the market since mortgage backed security buys and REITs offer greater speculative impact. While shelter costs are not insignificant, they're not where the majority of the macro inflationary impact is in our economy right now.\n\nThis is where words become important, I didn't say it had no impact, I said it was not the primary cause of most of our inflation... and it isn't. \n\nYou don't need excess capital to drive up used car prices, which are single purchase expenses... nor do you need it to push oil back up to $100/barrel, which was doable with common market cash floats 20 years ago. It's purely demand gap up.\n\nThis is all in the data. It's not rocket science. There's no mystery. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Be careful not to conflate simplicity with ideology.

Calling M2 \"the bank reserve system\" is not accurate.\n\nIt is more complex than this, but you're missing the point of what I'm saying which is that M2 is the total money supply expansion that people are referring to when they reference that expansion. M2 is including (and mostly comprised of) money in the reserve system that is not circulating in the context of the money supply expansion. M2 is not the circulating money supply...

Precisely because economics is so complex, it's important to remember the simple things that remain true no matter how much obfuscation is applied.

The idea that unrelated assets are a hedge against inflation depends on if you think the current prices justify expected growth and demand.  Inflation is priced in already.  It's been the only topic of conversation.  That's my opinion and I really appreciate your counterpoints.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Good points. Demand has a lot of drivers against it for sure. Especially in housing now. \n\nAbout supply, I personally don't understand it, but a logistics friend of mine said already before the Russia war and new China lockdowns that it'll take longer for the supply chain to be fixed than what I suggested based on consensus of the financial news. Issues with container placement and lack of workers. Like 6-18 months. Now we have seen the freight index fall since Nov '21, but very slowly. FBX is still at 9300$, double that of the rate in Apr '21. So if a company ships goods, they still pay way more than what they used to. The slow decline in freight costs indicates that the process of fixing the issues is also slow. I think the ripples of the latest events will take a bit but mostly it'll start to get better, except chips for example. Ukraine produced 50% of neon required for the chip making lasers so that shitshow will continue as long as that war continues. That means we don't get reprieve in car price inflation, used or new. \n\nAnother possible future inflation driver is the owners' equivalent rent component of CPI, iirc its 30% of the weighting. House prices basically ran like crazy, 20% and rents 10-20%(?) but yet OER is at 5%. It's because it's not based on actual prices but a questionnaire for homeowners. It operates with a 6-24mo lag to house prices, so I think instead of being a breaking factor for inflation as before, it'll be an accelerant later on when it starts to reflect the shelter price change that we saw post pandemic. I would guess it'll happen even if prices stop growing now and go flat, because it has to account for what already happened.\n\nOverall, I think another general problem is the effect the pandemic had on people's tolerance for shit low paying jobs. More people will be negotiating better pay or changing jobs more often to shop for better pay. This is possible since there's for now such a labour shortage. It'll add to employer costs and push inflation more I think, later on.\n\nAs for pricing, I think this inflation picture I see has not been priced in. In my opinion there's a massive amount of complacency with the inflation outlook. Many people still kinda have that idea that it'll subside soon, although Fed walked back on transitory. They also think the FED is gonna fight inflation hard. Which they cant, limited by us federal debt and addiction of the entire financial system to cheap money. Something will break before they get to 2%. They'll have to hold or go back to lower rates. That means inflation can run faster. Gold has barely moved, same for silver. Bonds have now dropped but also in my opinion nowhere near the drop they should have done, when considering they'll have highly negative real yields for foreseeable the future. Bonds won't be a safe haven, like 40-50 years ago. They'll be a guaranteed way to lose money. I really think the markets are gonna be shocked when they slowly realize inflation is not going away by the end of the year, just like they were surprised that it wasn't transitory. It is weird, because like you said, it's all that's been talked about. Yet, only the shittiest of shit stocks have gone down appropriately but no hedge moves have gotten widespread popularity yet.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Positions or ban", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "AllCallsNoPuts has challenged someone to post their positions! \n\nAllCallsNoPuts, if someone has made a claim that they bought / sold something and fail to prove it within 24 hours, message the mods to have them banned.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Investment, government spending and net exports are the others.\n\nInflation is already affecting consumer spending, which affects demand, which eventually affects employment.\n\nThe Fed will tame inflation by removing money supply, and likely over-tame inflation causing a recession.
