Tesla shares fell 12% that day, but edged higher on Wednesday by less than one percentage point.\n\nAs the filings became public, Musk wrote on Twitter, ‚ÄúNo further TSLA sales planned after today.‚Äù He made the remark in response to an account that heavily promotes Tesla stock, products and Musk on the social network.\n\nCNBC reached out to Tesla and Musk to ask exactly how he plans to use the proceeds, and whether he sold more Tesla shares after April 27, the latest date on the filings out Thursday. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk is bidding to buy Twitter and take the social media company private for $54.20 per share, around $44 billion total. In order to do so, Musk secured $25.5 billion of fully committed debt, including $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock.\n\nTwitter accepted his offer earlier this week, but the deal still requires shareholder and regulatory approval.\n\nMusk would have to pay Twitter a termination fee of $1 billion if he fails to secure enough funding to complete his deal to buy the social media business, according to a regulatory filing out Tuesday.\n\nOn the other hand, Twitter would owe Musk a $1 billion break-up fee if it accepts a competing offer, or if shareholders reject the deal, according to the same filing.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/elon-musk-sells-tesla-shares.html)", "id": "uecwqv", "created_utc": 1651203174.0, "score": 582, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 142, "comments": [{"body": "couple billion more to go right?", "score": 160, "replies": [{"body": "According to the information, he got a $13 billion loan and an additional $12.5 billion margin loan tied to Tesla stock to help finance the purchase and he said he'd use his own cash to pay for the rest.

They are doing only chips. Any risk with external manufacturing actually materializing and they are taking a direct hit on their core business and growth. Not likely at all today, but we are looking at FAANG companies and we are taking into account in the valuation their growth over 10-20 years. So, if you look at the same small risks over a a 10-20 years period than maybe it looks a bit different. Now, if they would be also manufacturing, they would have something more closely to a \"moat\". \n\nApple on the other are doing so much more than designing chips. Apple is a whole ecosystem and part of their integration they also rely on outsourcing those chips to externals as AMD. They have more cashflow and more leverage and would be able to manage the same risks or issues way faster and better than AMD. Even now, due to their power, planning at TSMC takes place around what APPLE wants and everybody else are fighting for the scrambles. Same risks, they are just a lot more resilient due to revenue diversification and power.\n\nBottom line: could be, but very unlikely. What would stop any company, existing one ( Intel, ARM, Qualcomm, Nvidia, even APPLE) to design better chips, enter their market share, and just buy the same manufacturing capacity as AMD and beat them?

The last decade Intel was asleep and has paid the price, but since semi-conductors are cyclical, it is unlikely to see the returns from 2015 onward for AMD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>ADBE\n\nThey do fit the \"moat\" section of the FAANG stocks, but they mostly appear to professional or a niche. With their price hikes it is clear that they focus on enterprise the most. Could have decent returns, but I don't see them returns 20%+ a year. Also not cheap\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>ROKU\n\nThis is a Tivo in diguise. Most people want to watch Netflix and Youtube on their smart TV. Does not matter if the OS is from Samsung or Roku.They have 0 moat and are not a potential fang. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>PLTR\n\nThey do have a moat, but they lose money head of heels and they have big shareholder dilution.

Offer very high rates for farmed food.  This would spur more development of farms and farmland, pushing into land areas that are typically too expensive to farm on.  This would have secondary consequences like more water and air pollution, and strain on the land and soil.\n2. Then you would pay for transportation on trucks to get the food to ports or their distribution centres.  Then pay for ships and more trucking and distribution at destination.  So we'd have to boost the trucking and shipping industry world wide; more trucks, more roads, more ships, more distribution centres.  This would I assume get more and more tricky as you move closer to the places with starving people as their is presumably less and less infrastructure there; more has to be built with less.\n3. Then we'd need to pay for building and running a last-mile delivery service.  This might be the hardest part.  Not only does all the infrastructure have to get built and maintained and operated, but there will be corruption that needs to be fought.  Undelivered goods, resold goods on black-market, currupt officials that want to be payed off, etc.\n\nAnd this is all to set up a solution that puts the hungry people into a dependent state where they will just go hungry again if you turn the funding off.  It would probably cost trillions of dollars and a decade of work to build out something like this, and then probably close to a trillion a year to keep it running.  That's just my butt instinct for dollar amount.\n\nBut then of course, the real solution would be one that does not create a dependancy.  You have to set things in place such that these people can feed themselves.  What does that require?  You'd have to fix cultures and beliefs, educations systems, government systems, etc.  Shit that would take decades if you even knew how to do it.

With pence there, or not\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/09/21/politics/read-eastman-memo/index.html\n\nJohn Eastman, a conservative lawyer working with then-President Donald Trump's legal team, outlined in a two-page memo a scheme to try to persuade then-Vice President Mike Pence to subvert the Constitution and throw out the 2020 election results on January 6.\n\n1. VP Pence, presiding over the joint session (or Senate Pro Tempore Grassley, if Pence recuses himself **[ME: Or he gets into the secret service vehicle OR the insurrectionists kill him]**), begins to open and count the ballots, starting with Alabama (without conceding that the procedure, specified by the Electoral Count Act, of going through the States alphabetically is required).\n\n2. When he gets to Arizona, he announces that he has multiple slates of electors, and so is going to defer decision on that until finishing the other States. This would be the first break with the procedure set out in the Act.\n\n3. At the end, he announces that because of the ongoing disputes in the 7 States, there are no electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those States. That means the total number of ‚Äúelectors appointed‚Äù ‚Äì the language of the 12th Amendment -- is 454. This reading of the 12th Amendment has also been advanced by Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe (here). A ‚Äúmajority of the electors appointed‚Äù would therefore be 228. There are at this point 232 votes for Trump, 222 votes for Biden. Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected. \n\n4. Howls, of course, from the Democrats, who now claim, contrary to Tribe‚Äôs prior position, that 270 is required. So Pence says, fine. Pursuant to the 12th Amendment, no candidate has achieved the necessary majority. That sends the matter to the House, where the ‚Äúthe votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote . . . .‚Äù Republicans currently control 26 of the state delegations, the bare majority needed to win that vote. President Trump is re-elected there as well. \n\n5. One last piece. Assuming the Electoral Count Act process is followed and, upon getting the objections to the Arizona slates, the two houses break into their separate chambers, we should not allow the Electoral Count Act constraint on debate to control. That would mean that a prior legislature was determining the rules of the present one ‚Äî a constitutional no-no (as Tribe has forcefully argued). So someone ‚Äì Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, etc. ‚Äì should demand normal rules (which includes the filibuster). That creates a stalemate that would give the state legislatures more time to weigh in to formally support the alternate slate of electors, if they had not already done so. \n\n6. The main thing here is that Pence should do this without asking for permission ‚Äì either from a vote of the joint session or from the Court. Let the other side challenge his actions in court, where Tribe (who in 2001 conceded the President of the Senate might be in charge of counting the votes) and others who would press a lawsuit would have their past position -- that these are non-justiciable political questions ‚Äì thrown back at them, to get the lawsuit dismissed. The fact is that the Constitution assigns this power to the Vice President as the ultimate arbiter. We should take all of our actions with that in mind.\n\nEdit: There was 4 ways they could have pulled this off and Pence refused and dodged all of them.

See the below Script Analysis from Scott Myers for reference.\n\n\" *61‚Äì64 Nathan shows Caleb his lab where he makes the AIs. He explains that he managed to crack the problem of creating a convincing face by hacking into all the cameras on peoples‚Äô iPads, phones etc and using that data. He goes on to show a brain, like that inside Ava, made from structural gel that holds its form for memories but shifts for thoughts. The software for the AIs is ‚Äòblue book‚Äô which is Nathan‚Äôs (Google-like) search engine company, that tells the AI how people think ‚Äî thought patterns, impulsivity etc ‚Äî more than what they are interested in. Nathan says he wanted to show Caleb all this to remind him that Ava is just a computer, a grey box, with no gender.* [SOURCE](https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/script-analysis-ex-machina-part-1-scene-by-scene-breakdown-25ebd7b2777d)\n\n\"Ok.... you are probably thinking \"so fucking what?!?\" Well wait there is more.

Only then did its creators realize that the virus *was* Skynet. Exactly one hour later, at 6:18 PM, Skynet launched the American nuclear missiles at their target sites across the world. The ensuing nuclear holocaust wiped out three billion human lives in what was to be known as \"Judgment Day\".
