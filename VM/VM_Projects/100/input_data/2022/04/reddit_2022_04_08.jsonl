Let me repost a very compelling counter posted on a SA comment section (yes, not a very credibly source, but I think it tears apart the analysts):\n\n> Read the statements and previous earning calls and commentary by TSM, ASML, GFS and others. Every fab is booked solid for the next two years. In the past (before the pandemic) just-in-time ordering was the rage. Analysts are used to this. Also used to assuming companies will cut orders at the slightest whiff of reduced demand. Many customers were burned badly because of this assumption that they could just order again and supply would be met just in time. Now it‚Äôs ‚Äújust in case‚Äù where higher inventory is desired regardless of fluctuations in end customer demand. In addition, due to long standing backlogs, fab throughput is not as flexible to schedule changes they used to be.\n\n> We already know there will be some weakness in smart phones (see TSM commentary, Apple reducing SE orders). But for some reason Apple and big tech is hanging in there. We also know there will be sizeable inventory build from autos and other industrials - that is if they don‚Äôt want to forsake billions in sales again for lack of a tiny chip that will barely take up warehouse space and won‚Äôt go obsolete for years. They got burned badly last time and are still supply constrained by the fabs - and their cars and trucks are rusting in snow covered parking lots. Not a great situation they‚Äôd be anxious to repeat.\n\n> We also know EV demand will only increase because of high gas prices. And we know customers who buy EVs are not at the low end who restrict purchases to save when rates go up. EVs and smart cars and self-driving take a lot of chips and data processing. A helluva a lot. And most companies will not want to cancel their orders. Most likely the companies reducing orders are for the low end - eg Android in China ie mediatek for example, where they already have inventory from the past to make up for forecasting errors or sudden demand spurts.\n\n> I don‚Äôt think FB, AMZN, GOOGL or MSFT will be meaningfully decelerating their cloud and data center businesses - where the most profitable segments for the chips are - servers, ML, AI. I also don‚Äôt think the metaverse research and development is all dead. We will be moving to a much more graphically intensive internet one way or another. Solid state devices will keep supplanting hard disk drives. These trends will continue. Nvda is pioneering new industries like virtualization of factories and prototyping. Everything is very silicon intensive.\n\n> In addition carriers are just now ramping 5G. I also don‚Äôt think VZ and ATT and TMUS will delay 5G rollout simply because of an economic slowdown and stop ordering the reqd semis. IOT is also becoming more pervasive and everything with a LED in it or anything that plugs in uses semis that used to cost a few pennys a few years back, but now cost dimes or dollars due to limited supply capacity. The recession, even if it hits, will not suddenly kill peoples desire for semis and electronics, and esp for gaming when consoles are still in short supply, and games more realistic than ever.\n\n[...]\n\nCan't post the link for the rest.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Buy the dip forever.

It seems highly unlikely that a thinly capitalized company founded in 2018 could discover a groundbreaking change in X-ray technology when the entire scientific community has not been able to figure out a lower-cost solution for the past 120 years. Keep in mind that Nano-X has not launched its product in any hospitals, has zero revenue, and posted a net loss of $13.8 million during the first half of 2020.\n\ntheir engineers purchased the technology from sony over a decade ago and they have been doing research and development since. They even have it patented in their name. The article deliberately says \"within the last two years\" to be misleading. The bulk of their R&D had already been done long before NNOX was founded\n\nthe company being founded in 2018 is another statement intended to mislead for the same reasons. The company was only founded once the technology had long been established and proven (in their eyes)\n\nAnd as for the last sentence: they have no revenue because they are still seeking FDA clearance. They can't make money until clearance. They are sitting on over a hundred million in cash in the mean time because of Korean investors (SK telecon particularly) and FDa clearance might be any week now!!\n\n\nthe third point is equally as stupid:\n\n>If the company's technology isn't shady enough, the proposed device's path to approval is even more confusing. In January, the company submitted a 510(k) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of its Nano-X device. However, the 510(k) channel is not for novel inventions, but for devices that are already \"substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device.\"\n\nThis is because their machine isn't a novel invention. Xray machines have already been invented.  That's why their device falls under the \"substantially equivalent\" to a legally marketed device. \n\nthe FDA further gives the requirements for something to be \"substantially equivalent\". The FDA says:\n\n>A device is substantially equivalent if, in comparison to a predicate it: \n\n>has the same intended use as the predicate; and\n\n\n>has different technological characteristics and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness; and\n\n\n>the information submitted to FDA demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as the legally marketed device.\n\nIt clear why they go this route. Their device has the same intended use as any other Xray machine, the main difference is the technology is completely different (the second requirement). \n\nIf it makes you feel better, Deep knowledge analytics published an in [depth look at NNOX](https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging) and it basically called out shortsellers for spamming bullshit\n\nI understand why people are hesitant to buy this stock, but deep research assuages those concerns.

Plus interest being tax deductible makes debt even cheaper.\n\nPreferred Stock is another option. The holders of Preferred Stock have no voting rights or influence over the company.  But they get their dividends first before Common Shareholders. Also in bankruptcy court, they come second after bond holders.  Plus you have to pay fees to float new shares.\n\nFinally a company can raise capital by selling equity. However when a company issues new shares, it dilutes existing shareholders and increases outside influences on the company. Plus existing shareholders will want a higher rate of return because they now have less voting power, have no right to future dividends, and if the company goes bankrupt, they will get nothing. If your shareholders are not rewarded than they can replace the board of directors and the fire CEO.\n\nIt is true that too much debt is a bad thing.

Old Ford Dealership.\n\nWhen we started I thought, optimistically, we had a 10% chance of suceeding.\n\nThanks to incredible work of Tesla team over many years, we got here.\n\nwe now have Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, We've got the most expensive joke in the world, bu we did bring sexy back.\n\nWe've got cars in major segments, commercial and residential energy products.\n\nThanks to incredible work of Tesla team, 2/3 of EVs in the USA, have been made by the hard work of the Tesla team.\n\n\\[Manager of Giga Austin construction drives roadster away to applause\\]\n\nWe have FSD in beta, anyone here used it? Cheers\n\nYou can get a feel for how much FSD will transform society. Car will take you anywhere you want, 10x safer. Will revolutionize world. this is one of the things that comes along VERY rarely.\n\nWe're going to wide beta for all FSD drivers in North America this year.\n\nSO, this is now our 6th major factory, in three continents. Great for us to have two major auto factories in North America. Huge improvement for Tesla, better for environment because you don't have to ship across oceans. Way better to make the cars locally.\n\nWe're entering a new phase of Tesla's future with 6 factories. Scaling to extreme size as you can see, this building is not small.\n\nThis is also Tesla's global HQS.\n\nWhy Austin? Well, actually I asked the Tesla team, uh, California's great, we're continuing to expand, we ran out of room, we need a place where we can be REALLY big. There's no place like Texas.\n\nWe're ten minutes from the Airport, 15 from downtown. Thank you Austin, Travis County\n\nIt wasn't easy building this humongous building, can't express enough appreciation/gratitude for team that built gigatexas.\n\nDeep freeze, rain, quicksand, incredibly fast build, difficult, done\n\n\\[Shows scale graphic of factory on its side taller than Burj Khalifa\\]\n\nIt's 80 feet tall, equivalent to 3 pentagons.

The factory is the product.\n\nPrototypes are easy, manufacturing is hard. This is the largest car factory the earth has every seen. Alien Tech. You know its advanced when it feels like an alien dreadnought landed.\n\nTook lessons from Fremont, buildings are separate, movement between buildings\n\nThink of factory like a chip, IC, combine everything together in one package. This is what you get. This is a case of raw materials come in one side, cell, pack, cast body, pack is structural, out comes finished product.\n\nRaw material in one side, cars out the other side.\n\nBuilding our own battery cells, we think the most advanced cell in the world here at Giga Texas. All footage you see is from this giga factory.\n\nOve time this will be the biggest cell factory in the world.\n\nAnother major innovation is structural pack. We're basically bringing to fruition the things we said we would do - rear casting, cells carry load, like an airplane. New model Y cells carry load, lighter, cheaper, better crash performance, fewer parts.\n\nrevolution in car manufacturing to make car out of three parts, rear, pack, front.\n\nwhat you're looking at are the biggest casting machines ever made. crazy to make a car this way, never done before.\n\nWe called the 6 major casting machine companies in the world, 5 said no, one said maybe. That sounded like yes.\n\nGreat effort from team to radically simplify the manufacturing of the car\n\nModel Y program alone .5M units/year, then we're gonna manufacture CT here. MY line will be the largest capacity line in the world, highest volume car factory in America. .5M/year in one building\n\nCT looks like CGI in real life but its not, that's an actual truck driving around. Cant wait for production, it will be epic.\n\nTesla is growing fastest pace of manufactured object in history.
