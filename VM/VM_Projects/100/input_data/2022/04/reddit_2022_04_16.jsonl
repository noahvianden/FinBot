{"title": "Mark Cuban says Elon Musk is 'f--king with the SEC,' thinks Twitter will 'do everything possible not to sell'", "selftext": " \n\nFROM ARTICLE \n\n[Musk offered to buy Twitter for about $43 billion on Thursday](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/mark-cuban-says-musk-is-f-with-the-sec-thinks-twitter-will-do-everything-possible-not-to-sell?cmpid=fb_fbn)  \n  \n\nDallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban chimed in on Elon Musk's attempt to purchase Twitter for $43 billion, saying that he thinks the Tesla CEO is \"f------ with the SEC\" and that Twitter will do everything in their power not to sell. \n\nMusk, a popular user on the site with more than 81 million followers, announced the offer on Thursday morning to buy all outstanding shares for $54.20 each. \n\n\"I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,\" Musk said in a Securities and Exchange Commission fling. \"I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.\"  \n  \n\nThe offer per share, $54.20, is reminiscent of Musk's infamous 2018 tweet in which he said he had the money to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which caused Tesla's stock to jump but never materialized. \n\nMusk frequently cracks \"420\" jokes, as the number is slang for marijuana. \n\nTesla and Musk settled with the SEC for $40 million in civil fines after he said he had the money to take Tesla private. \n\n\"His filing w/the SEC allows him to say he wants to take a company private for $54.20. Vs his ‘Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.’ Price go up. His shares get sold. Profit,\" Cuban tweeted. \"SEC like WTF just happened.\" \n\n \n\nCuban also said he thinks \"every major tech company… is on the phone with their anti trust lawyers asking if they can buy Twitter and get it approved.\" \n\n\"And Twitter is on the phone with their lawyers asking which can be their white knight,\" Cuban tweeted. \"Gonna be interesting.\"\n\n Musk's offer to buy Twitter came 10 days after he announced that he had been buying shares of Twitter since Jan. 31, netting him about a 9% stake in the company.  \n\n \n\nOn Sunday evening, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal sent a message to all employees notifying them that Musk declined to join the company's board. \n\n \n\nIn the weeks before he announced his 9% stake, Musk criticized Twitter for its moderation policies, saying that \"failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy.\" \n\nTwitter has been criticized in recent years for banning high-profile figures, such as former President Donald Trump, Republican Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. \n\n \n\nMusk said Thursday that it would \"be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote.\"\n\n\"If the current Twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests, they would be breaching their fiduciary duty,\" Musk tweeted. ", "id": "u4s7hl", "created_utc": 1650092594.0, "score": 2081, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 361, "comments": [{"body": "What does jarule have to say about elons plan for Twitter?", "score": 339, "replies": [{"body": "Where is ja!?!?

You’ve literally lost 43% of your value from dilution alone. \n- each share is worth $2.86 but for the price of already owning 1 share + 0.50$ in cash, the other original 9 shareholders now have a position of $5.73\n\nThe other shareholders literally gain a transfer of value from the diluted shareholder. The board can get even more aggressive and issue at $0.01 in which case your shares are worth 1/19 * $50.09 = $2.64.

Waters both upstream and downstream would be affected.\n\nAnother thing is that the region largely has no roads other than small roads localized to the villages.  This is a pretty cool thing because it keeps Alaska wild.  However, if a mine were to open, they would need a way to transport the minerals, so a road would have to be built. The proposed road would basically span the length of lake Iliamna and would turn the pristine wilderness into a heavy metal highway, from which a truck would eventually crash and spill its hazardous cargo.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, Northern dynasty basically downplayed all concerns about pollution.

When Hitler heard about the plan to invade through Ardennes, he loved it [the allies were massed in northern Belgium]. But the high command said: it’s not possible, at night we have to rest, and they [the allies] will retreat and we will be stuck in the mountains. But then the stimulant decree was released, and that enabled them to stay awake for three days and three nights. Rommel [who then led one of the panzer divisions] and all those tank commanders were high – and without the tanks, they certainly wouldn’t have won.\"\n\nYou say no prominent historian would believe this, (even though Ohler verified it with documents) but at least one prominent historian has praised it.

Even doubling wouldn’t bring the fundamentals in line for several years. Also, late cycle investing is terrible for growth stocks traditionally. Tesla/apple/Amazon/google/Microsoft are trying to hang in there, but it could very well be tough sledding for a bit. There could be a lot of opportunity cost, not to mention mid term downside risk to them. \n\nAll that said, I really have come around on Tesla. They are the apple of electric cars. They grow fast. They have a unique CEO. They will be successful. I just wouldn’t expect the same type of returns over the next few years. But who knows. Can’t time the market!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The exponential growth is just about to start. The gross margin is going to be through the roof once the two new factories are at volume.

Sure, you will gain right leaning market share because of the links with Trump, but then you just have TWO echo chambers as those on the left once again kneejerk react and think anything related to Trump = bad! That certainly solves 1 problem - providing a platform for right leaning people..... But fuck me, like we don't already have enough of a problem with the news outlets with the right/left divide! All this would do is create an even GREATER divide! It's just doubling down on the problem Twitter has created! \n\nThe whole point of a \"town square\" is that it is NEUTRAL! It's a place where a wide range of thoughts/ideas can be discussed, even opposing ones. This then allows the shit on BOTH sides to be challenged, and over time, those bad ideas repeatedly don't gain traction and are discarded. \n\nThe problem in echo chambers is that the WORST ideas tend to rise to the top as they often target and appeal to the lowest common denominator in the closed group. That's easy when there is a closed echo chamber, and everyone jumps on ANY decent that might challenge the \"group think.\" \n\nI think Musk is actually intelligent enough to understand this basic fact of human and group think psychology, and he doesn't want to just create \"right woke\" Twitter 2.... \n\nThis does raise another stumbling block in his way, however, and that is the basic stupidity of humans that can't see past their \"team\" view of the world. Because this clusterfuck has swung so far \"left woke\", now all the mouth breathers on the right expect the only viable solution is that they get their own \"right woke\" platform and they don't understand they are just creating a even greater problem. \n\nTo my thinking, Musk has 2 ways of dealing with this. \n\n1 - Work from within Twitter to wind back the \"left woke\" ideology that the platform has taken and take it back to neutral ground so that it can act as a true \"town square.\" (Clearly, this is NOT going to be allowed to happen by the current Twitter board). \n\n2 - Destroy Twitter (or have them destroy themselves) and then move in with a true neutral platform that both the left and the right will onboard. \n\nAll the other options that I see being offered as \"competition\" to Twitter are when you boil it down, right leaning options in response to Twitter going left leaning. At best, they can ever only hope to gain approx. 50% of the market share and create a host of problems along the way. \n\nGoing neutral is what will eventually kneecap Twitter and capture most of its market share.

{"title": "The housing bubble is going to burst soon narrative is the dumbest thing I’ve read since Nam.", "selftext": "I saw a graph today that said the bubble is going to burst soon and showed that mortgage payments are the highest they’ve ever been since 2006. This is the perfect depiction of sheep believing everything they see. I’m going to rip this to shreds, but some idiot who sold 1 loan back in 1999 is going to comment “I used to originate loans back before the burst and yada yada” times have changed. Not even close to the same. First that graph didn’t take into consideration that in 2006 most of the mortgage payments were that high on interest only not including the principle payment coming due that ultimately led to the crash.\n\n\nThe housing market is fine. There is simply low supply high demand and 5% rates isn’t even that high. This has no correlation to people not being able to make their house payments in 08. \n\nFirst, anytime I hear any sort of relation of todays market is similar to the 2008 crash I want to throw my phone. There is absolutely no similarities between the two time frames.\n\nSecuritizations: combining loans into portfolios and trading them in the market. Otherwise known as Mortgage backed securities MBS. \n\nHere’s a loan that was AAA rated prior to 08 crash…\n\nClient: I want a mortgage I’m self employed and I make this much money.\n\nBroker: Ok here’s a $400,000 mortgage no need to submit any income documents for proof. A simple Google search that your business is still active will suffice for underwriting. Best part is your payment is only $2000 per month at a 8% fixed for 10 years! It’s interest only but your home only appreciates in value so by the time your payment amortizes in 10 years you’ll have way more equity so your principal balance doesn’t even matter! \n\nYear 10 comes around and that client never qualified for the fully amortized payment which in now at 20 year term with principal and interest at a total payment of like $5500 per month. Cash out had no LTV limits…actually you could borrow up to 125% of the value of your home. \n\nMeanwhile credit agencies just rated these loans super safe because everyone makes their mortgage payment a priority and WS bet against them knowing they couldn’t. \n\nToday…rates are at half of what they were then…the majority of homeowners have a FIXED 30 year mortgage in the 2-3% range. People today getting rates in the 4-6% still have to qualified for the mortgage they get based on the full amortized payment not just interest and the most popular mortgage is still a 30 year fixed. MBS are clean. Documentation and underwriting process has to be thorough or else Fannie, Freddie, FHA, and VA will not buy them and securitize them. The guidelines aren’t loose. \n\nThey only way we repeat 2008 is if everyone that has a mortgage loses their jobs….that’s not a pressing issue as we in a labor shortage.\n\nTo all you inflation people out there…home values rise with inflation because people value assets over cash and the fixed mortgage payments stay the same. Even if someone got an adjustable rate…those aren’t interest only either and borrowers still have to qualify based on the possible adjustment payment. I/O loans are very very very tiny specific cases and they aren’t confirming so they won’t be bought or securiturized with the confirming loan portfolios. \n\nWill home values collapse? No people still want homes, rates don’t matter. They may come back down a little but nothing like a huge cliff. \n\nTLDR; There is no housing crisis. People that get mortgages are qualified to pay them. If you want to look at possible AAA rated garbage and a crisis…go look SLABS.

Maybe you can explain to me how average Americans will be able to afford to upgrade their homes OR buy a first home when inflation is outpacing income, AND mortgage rates are climbing at a ridiculous rate.  Inflation means the buying power of your money is shrinking.  How could buyers square shrinking buying power, higher rates AND increasing prices?!  Most cannot, and will not.\n\nYou are correct that 5% rates “aren’t even that high”. That’s true from a bigger perspective, but the reality of “what can I afford?” Has NOTHING to do with historical, big picture views.  “What can I afford?” is all about relativity; i.e. if a person could afford $x/month last year with a 4% rate, the number is smaller at a 5% rate, and particularly when daily budget expenses are drastically outpacing wage growth.  I mean, a bubble can only exist if it has LOTS of buyers, right?  Your thesis is based on demand outpacing supply.  I submit that demand is about to begin declining.  It’s still going strong for the moment because there are still buyers out there who we’re already planning to make a purchase in the near future and now they’re scrambling to get it done before mortgage rates go up again.  Check back with me in Sept and let me know how that bubble is looking by then.  The truth is that it will likely start dying by August\n\nAlso, your thesis seems to compare a lot to the ‘08 housing/mortgage crash.  That bubble was fed by fraud in mortgage banking and ultimately in Wall St derivatives.  Banks were putting people in holes that were WAY overpriced.  They wanted to write the loan so that they could turn it over.  They put immense pressure on appraisers to make the appraisal meet the sale price.  It’s a really shady business when your boss is also your customer, so the appraisals didn’t accurately reflect the value of homes.  Even Wall St can only bury that for so long.  When THAT ponzu scheme fell apart, it suddenly became much more difficult to get a mortgage and many who thought they were home shopping suddenly found that they no longer qualified; demand/qualified buyers tanked.  To make matters worse, a huge number of people found themselves underwater in their mortgage; they owed 20-30% more than their home was worth.  Suddenly, one our most common stores of asset value and was gone.  They had no source of collateral for credit.  All they had was mountains of debt.  I have not heard anybody speaking of a bubble pop of that magnitude.  That likelihood of that would be close to zero.  None-the-less, a more natural/normal bubble pop scenario seems entirely likely.

There just aren't enough homes.   \n\n\nThe thing is, even if people did start defaulting on their homes it wouldn't crash the market because of how low inventory is right now.  It's like people aren't even acknowledging that places have 1 month of inventory compared to a healthy 6 month inventory. Homeowner vacancy rate was 3 times higher in 2006 than it is now. I don't know why the most clueless people are the ones that are so oppinionated.

This again marks the lowest recorded overall delinquency rate since at least January 1999.\n\n  \n\\>The reason delinquencies matter is because they’re a sign of distress — and that can signal weakness in the housing market. But this jump in delinquencies was minor, and experts say there’s no reason to panic. “These delinquency rates are so low that they’re not having much effect on the overall housing boom,” says Ostrowski. In fact, Matthew Speakman, Zillow senior economist, says the share of loans with payments overdue by 30 days or fewer remains very low and in line with pre-pandemic levels. “More encouragingly, the decrease in longer-term delinquencies was a reflection of the impact of rolling back pandemic-era forbearance protections. Loans in forbearance were counted as delinquent even though missed payments weren’t counted against borrowers, so as households return to making monthly payments again, serious delinquencies are falling,” says Speakman.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
