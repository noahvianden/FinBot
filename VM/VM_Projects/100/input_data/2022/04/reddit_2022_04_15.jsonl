{"title": "Why the success of Apple M1 series is hard to replicate for other companies and x86 is here to stay", "selftext": "When the Apple M1 series came out, lots of people were saying that x86 is doomed, Intel and AMD will be out of business and every big tech companies will be designing their own ARM-based processor. In my opinion, these statements are quite detached from reality and is a display of lack of understanding of semiconductor and technology. Here's why:\n\n1. It takes a lot of money and time to built a world-class chip-design team: Apple started using their in-house designed ARM-based architecture with the iPhone 4S, which was released in 2011. They should be working on the architecture at least 2 years prior to that, which means it takes Apple more than 10 years to be able to build the M1 series. Almost every generation of Apple's in-house design has a huge efficiency advantage over the standard ARM core, which implies the design team of Apple is far more capable than the team in ARM and Qualcomm. Despite that, it still takes them more than 10 years to accumulate the technical legacy and experience to make the M1 series. Few other companies can afford to spend that amount of money and time do built a design team as capable as Apple's, even if they could, it could still be more expensive than just buying processors from Intel or AMD.\n2. It takes even more time and money to re-write software for a different architecture: processors are expensive, but the time of competent software engineers is even more expensive. Good software engineers are required if you want to migrate your software to a different ISA and have it performing well, and they are expensive and rare. It makes more financial sense for companies to assign these engineers to other purposes than to re-write software that runs fine on existing hardware. On top of that, most companies doesn't have the complete control over their platform like Apple does on OSX and iOS, which would makes this task even harder, more expensive and time-consuming.\n3. Few companies can afford to use the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing node: Apple started using the TSMC N5 process more than 1 year earlier than almost everybody else, which is a significant contributing factor to the efficiency advantage of the M1 series. Even datacenter products with extremely high margin such as the AMD EPYC and Nvidia A100 are one generation behind in terms of process node. It takes an insane amount of money to design a processor on the most advanced process node, hundreds of millions for N5, billions is expected for N3. If processor vendors like AMD and Nvidia can't race Apple to the most advanced node, processors for in-house usage by Google, Amazon or Microsoft definitely won't have the volume to do so.\n4. The M1 series is actually quite transistor-inefficient: the M1 Max contains 57 billion transistors, in comparison, the RTX 3080 contains about 28 billion transistors and the Ryzen 5900X contains about 19 billion transistors, even the Nvidia A100 contains \"only\" roughly 54 billion transistors.  While the M1 Max is powerful, it's definitely not as powerful as the RTX 3080 and 5900X combined, even if it contains more transistors. If only fabbing cost is considered, a M1 Max is more expensive to manufacture than 2 RTX 3080 since the cost per transistor stopped dropping since 28nm. The design of M1 series sacrifices transistor efficiency for energy efficiency, which makes sense for mobile products, but for HPC applications better transistor efficiency should be more desirable. AMD and Nvidia products are still more efficient in terms of computing power to manufacturing cost ratio.\n\nIn conclusion, the M1 series is the result of Apple pouring tremendous amount of resource over a long time, which most companies can't afford to do. Even if they could, it would probably make more financial sense to simply purchase processors from existing vendors.", "id": "u44fqe", "created_utc": 1650015895.0, "score": 224, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "Apple started working on the arch in 2008 when they hired Jim Keller.

{"title": "Twitter Counters a Musk Takeover With a Plan to Thwart the Bid", "selftext": "Today in NYTIMES:\n\nThe company is intent on trying to fend off the billionaire‚Äôs bid to buy it in a deal that could be worth more than $40 billion.\n\nTwitter unveiled its counterattack against Elon Musk on Friday, using a strategy invented to repel corporate raiders in an attempt to block a takeover bid by the world‚Äôs richest man.\n\nThe strategy, known as a poison pill, would flood the market with new shares if Mr. Musk, or any other individual or group working together, bought 15 percent or more of Twitter‚Äôs shares. That would immediately reduce Mr. Musk‚Äôs stake and make it significantly more difficult to buy up a sizable potion of the company. Mr. Musk currently owns more than 9 percent of the company‚Äôs stock.\n\nThe goal is to force anyone trying to acquire the company to negotiate directly with the board. Investors rarely try to break through a poison pill threshold, securities experts say, with the caveat that Mr. Musk rarely abides by precedent.\n\nCompanies are often wary of using poison pills because they do not want to be seen as unfriendly to shareholders. Still, some critics, like Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential advisory group, have indicated that they are open to the tactic in certain circumstances.\n\nTwitter said the mechanism would not stop the company from holding talks about a sale with any potential buyer and would give it more time to negotiate a deal that offers a sufficient premium.\n\nThe pill ‚Äúdoes not mean that the company is going to be independent forever,‚Äù said Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer of finance at Cornell University. ‚ÄúIt just means that they can effectively fend off Elon.‚Äù\n\nMr. Musk announced his intention to acquire the social media service on Thursday, making public an unsolicited bid worth more than $40 billion. In an interview later that day, he took issue with Twitter‚Äôs moderation policies, calling Twitter the ‚Äúde facto town square‚Äù and saying that ‚Äúit‚Äôs really important that people have the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.‚Äù\n\nHe also said he had a Plan B if the board rejected his offer, though he did not share it.\n\nAnalysts have said that Mr. Musk‚Äôs bid ‚Äî which offers significantly more per share than the current stock price but is well below its peak last year ‚Äî may undervalue the company. They have also raised concerns about Mr. Musk‚Äôs ability to cobble together financing. If the board negotiated a deal with Mr. Musk, it could include a sizable breakup fee that might assuage concerns about his volatile nature conflicting with the ability of the deal to close, some securities lawyers said\n\nTwitter attempted to wrangle the world‚Äôs wealthiest man in recent weeks as he snapped up its shares. Last week, Twitter offered Mr. Musk a board seat, but he soured on the arrangement when it became clear that he would no longer be able to freely criticize the company. He rejected the role on Saturday and informed Twitter on Wednesday evening of his acquisition plans.\n\nTwitter said in a statement that its poison pill plan, which will remain in effect until April of next year, ‚Äúis similar to other plans adopted by publicly held companies in comparable circumstances.‚Äù\n\nTwitter‚Äôs other top shareholders, according to FactSet, include the investment giant Vanguard Group, the largest, with a 10.3 percent stake; Morgan Stanley Investment Management, with an 8 percent stake; and BlackRock Fund Advisors, with a 4.6 percent stake.\n\nArk Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, a star of the Reddit investing community who has previously bet on Mr. Musk, has a 2.15 percent stake. One of Twitter‚Äôs founders, Jack Dorsey, who is friendly with Mr. Musk, has a 2.2 percent stake. Twitter‚Äôs board, which includes Mr. Dorsey, voted unanimously to approve the poison pill.\n\nMr. Musk seemed to be girding for a protracted fight on Thursday. ‚ÄúTaking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders, not the board,‚Äù he tweeted, alongside a Yes/No poll.\n\nMr. Musk‚Äôs initial, bare-bones offer left open significant questions. Mr. Musk has hired Morgan Stanley to advise on the bid, although the investment bank is not known for financing large-scale deals on its own. And Twitter shareholders seemed wary: Twitter‚Äôs stock fell almost 2 percent on Thursday, closing at $45.08 ‚Äî significantly below Mr. Musk‚Äôs offer. Stock markets in the U.S. were closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday.\n\nPrince Al Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who described himself as one of Twitter‚Äôs largest and most long-term shareholders, said on Thursday that Twitter should reject Mr. Musk‚Äôs offer because its was not high enough to reflect the company‚Äôs ‚Äúintrinsic value.‚Äù Analysts also suggested that Mr. Musk‚Äôs price was too low and did not reflect Twitter‚Äôs recent performance.\n\nMr. Musk argued that taking Twitter private would allow more free speech to flow on the platform. ‚ÄúMy strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,‚Äù he said in an interview at the TED conference on Thursday.\n\nHe also insisted that the algorithm Twitter uses to rank its content, deciding what hundreds of millions of users see on the service every day, should be public for users to audit.\n\nMr. Musk‚Äôs concerns are shared by many executives at Twitter, who have also pressed for more transparency about its algorithms. The company has published internal research about bias in its algorithms and funded an effort to create an open, transparent standard for social media services.\n\nBut Twitter balked at Mr. Musk‚Äôs hardball tactics. After a Thursday morning board meeting, the company began exploring options to block Mr. Musk, including the poison pill and the possibility of courting another buyer.\n\nDuring an all-hands meeting on Thursday, Twitter‚Äôs chief executive, Parag Agrawal, sought to reassure employees about the potential shake-up. Although he declined to share details about the board‚Äôs plans, he encouraged employees to stay focused and not allow themselves to be distracted by Mr. Musk.\n\nThis is a developing story.

The post pill value of their ownership is 91.3% of $8780 is $8016 (minus their cash put in of $3780, their value of their stake in the business is now up to $4236). \n- Musks pre pill ownership was 16% of $5000 or $800. His post pill ownership is 8.7% of $8780 or $764. That‚Äôs $36 of his value that‚Äôs effectively been transferred to the other shareholders. \n- This transfer occurs more aggressively the greater the discount offered is.

I guarantee you, if you do that, there will be NO CENSORSHIP OF ANY TOPIC on any social network.\n\nWhich is bullshit because reddit banned \"mean\" content and unseemingly content because they wanted money from banks/investors, OnlyFans almost self-imploded for the same reason, Tumblr got rid of porn for some weird fucking reason.\n\nThis is objectively false.\n\nMore bad points:\n\n>Example: the \"lab leak\" theory (a controversial theory that is now probably true; I personally believe so) was \"censored\" at a certain time in the history of the pandemic because the \"debate\" included ... massive amounts of horrible behavior, spam-level posting, and abuse that spilled over into the real world - e.g. harrassment of public officials and doctors, racially-motivated crimes, etc.\n\nThis is incredibly dumb. So is he suggesting that every and all false flag operations will succeed and justifiably so? So if a group of people support a political candidate, but use hate and vitriol in the process, you should ban all positive discussion of the candidate? There is no logic in this point at all.\n\nLet's look at some more:\n\n>It is because at Certain Times, given Certain Circumstances, humans will Behave Badly when confronted with Certain Ideas, and if you are The Main Platform Where That Idea is Being Discussed, you cannot do NOTHING, because otherwise humans will continue behaving badly.\n\nOnce again, let's censor it because some people are looney, ~~or are operating a bot farm that is pretending to be looney.~~\n\n>There is a reason why Jack has a crazy meditation routine and eats one meal a deal and goes on spiritual retreats. Because it takes an INHUMAN level of mentality to be able to run something like this.\n\nIs this a joke? Jack does that because he's Jack. By all accounts Steve Jobs was nuttier. Is running an importer of phones now harder than both a rocket and a EV company? This point is completely dumb.\n\n>These last few years, @Jack did a really good job. And whoever the midwits were who didn't think so have kicked him out, and now Elon thinks he's going to come in and fix some problems.\n\nHe more or less called the current CEO a midwit, and then said Elon coming in wouldn't help.

Inconel retains strength over a wide temperature range, attractive for high-temperature applications where aluminum and steel would succumb to creep as a result of thermally-induced crystal vacancies.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I quit FD‚Äôs last week so assuredly this week we moon.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "God I hope so", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yes.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "ü§∑üèº", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I‚Äôm drunk AF but I think these [two have fucking lost it](https://twitter.com/ajtourville/status/1515547590246424579?s=21&t=v1iD1wk3opsLQ9aBTN59fQ)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "my ICE car didn't come with a gas station hose...", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "You have an ICE car? ü§≠", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "haha no way, but I did back in the day...", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "tom janas üá™üá∫ üá∫üá¶üå±üöµ (@tom_janas) Tweeted:\n@ajtourville You‚Äôre 110% wrong Alex.

Tesla was almost perpetually on the knifes edge between being hugely valuable and going bankrupt. And a lot of big institutions were both betting and sometimes manipulating to the downside. Elon's not unique here of course. Tons of companies were in the same position. And the banks got richer every time. \n\nBut Elon figured out at some point that building a cult following gave him power against these banks... It at least put them on more even footing. And each time the cult following bought more, these companies got squeezed over and over. \n\nI think it's very fair to say that if institutions werent so heavily short Tesla, the company wouldn't have had such a stratospheric rise. A huge amount of capital, real cash money, came into the company due to share offerings gobbled up by fanboys. The stock rose before their split, then rose again directly after the split, and yes I know a split doesn't bring money into the company, but the small 1% share offering post split brought a huge amount of money into the company to allow them to expand and actually keep the upward momentum and also the real upward intrinsic value of the company. \n\nI honestly believe the only reason Tesla went so high is because so many people were so heavily short it for so long and Elon kept getting the tiniest advantage over and over. \n\nCoincidentally this was also when wsb first started recognizing their real power. This split was before GameStop and there were huge amounts of discussion between tsla rise and gme about the power of retail here on this sub. \n\nI would actually argue that the Tesla split was the beginning of the battle against the shorts even if most users didn't see it that way at the time. Everything after that followed as a natural consequence to Tesla's success at trapping the big banks over and over and over. Gamma ramps were hugely instrumental in Tesla's price action during their split, and we all know how important they became during gme explosion. \n\nTesla was an ok company with good ideas but not nearly enough capital to make them happen. To a big bank, they don't particularly care whether a company succeeds directly or goes bankrupt and they can buy the tech on liquidation. They sometimes take short positions to hedge their loans to a company. And if it's more advantageous to the bank for the company to default and the debtors become in control, that won't bother the banks too much either. They won't hesitate to kill a company or wipe out existing share holders if it benefits them. \n\nAnd to be clear I don't blame the banks for some of these behaviors. Some of them are reasonable mechanisms to hedge risk. But I genuinely believe that Tesla would not have become so successful without repeatedly trapping the shorts and converting that situation into cold hard cash usable for expansion. The company had a 50/50 chance of going bankrupt and defaulting on their loans.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I mean dudes not exactly innocent of corruption and dirty practices.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Source?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Just Google it.

The larger battery is more likely to be limited by the charger. If the 2 examples above are each connected to a 125 kw charger, the small battery will draw 100 kw while the large battery will draw 125 kw. If the large battery adds enough weight to make the car 20% less efficient from a wh/mile perspective, then the large battery may gain fewer miles per minute of charge time while the battery is low. As the battery charges though, the smaller battery will slow down. If the battery can only accept 1C at 70% soc, then by that point the 50 kwh battery will only be drawing 50 kw, where the 100 kwh battery will still be drawing 100 kw.

These shorter cycles will not put as much wear and tear on the larger battery, so you may get 2000 cycles out of it instead of 1000 cycles.

That NPR article is actually saying a lot of the same things I am.  Now you've dismissed a lot of the actions Russia has taken as \"artificial\" and I do see logic in that.  NPR labels it \"risky\".  Strictly speaking, they are. But the one action both I and NPR think is the most significant is the exact same thing that has propped up the USD for decades- pricing energy in rubles.  Being able to force buyers of nat gas as well as Russian businesses operating abroad to buy Rubles is actually a demonstration of strength of the currency.  And while it is true that if this ability were taken away the currency will collapse again, the exact same thing can be said about the dollar.  We've fought wars to protect the petrodollar system.\n\nSome things they are doing are a sign of weakness such as banning sales of securities, transferring money, etc.  So I'm not saying things are perfect.  I am saying that forcing countries to buy energy in your domestic currency is a very big deal that has driven geopolitics for decades.\n\nAnd sure shortages are out there because of sanctions.

That's kind of what is happening.  Even Saudi Arabia refused to take a call from Biden and a few days later announced they'd sell oil in Yuan, a break from 40-50 years of precedent.

While some interpreted the lower court‚Äôs decision as casting doubt on the validity of pills generally except when adopted as a response to an actual, specific threat of hostile activity against the company, we note that the Chancellor‚Äôs opinion emphasized the ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù nature of the terms of the Williams pill.Most notably, the pill had a 5% trigger (instead of the usual trigger in the range of 10-20% in the context of an antitakeover threat). In addition, the pill had an unusually broad definition of beneficial ownership, an unusually broad acting-in-concert (‚Äúwolfpack‚Äù) provision, and an unusually narrow exclusion for passive investors.This combination of features, the Chancellor wrote, was more ‚Äúextreme‚Äù than any pill the court had previously reviewed. The court stressed that the terms were so broad (in particular, with respect to the acting-in-concert provision) as to impinge on the stockholders‚Äô fundamental right to communicate with each other and the company in ordinary ways. Moreover, with respect to the ‚Äúpurely hypothetical‚Äù nature of the threat to the company, we would note that there apparently was no corroboration that the board had actually identified even a general threat.*\"\n\nHere are the areas of uncertainty about the court's decision according to the memo:\n\n*‚Äì The extent to which a wholly non-specific threat to the company would be viewed as sufficient by the court in the context of a board that had more specifically considered the potential threat.‚Äì To what extent, even in the face of a purely hypothetical threat, a pill with typical, market (rather than ‚Äúextreme‚Äù) terms would be validated by the court.‚Äì To what extent the court, in the face of an actual and specific threat to the company, would accept a pill with ‚Äúextreme‚Äù terms.‚Äì Whether the court would apply the same analysis in the context of a pill directed against hostile takeover activity rather than shareholder activism.*\n\nThere have been LOTS of research on the impact of poison pills on shareholder value as I'm sure you are aware. The last paper I read on the topic was Bothmer's Erasmus School of Economics thesis titled, '[The effect of Poison Pills on Shareholder Value](https://thesis.eur.nl/pub/43147/Bothmer-L.E.-410351-.pdf)'. Bothmer studied companies in the US and Canada that adopted poison pills between  2000 and 2017. It is worth a read but basically concludes that the adoption of a poison pill increases the bargaining power of management and can lead to higher premiums for shareholders. However, it can also deter a takeover, leading to a loss of potential premiums for shareholders and safeguard the current management from being fired.\n\nIn this case there isn't a clear opinion as to whether or not the poison pill will increase or decrease shareholder value. Mark Kelley from Stifel downgraded the company after the announcement while Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan thinks long term shareholders will benefit if the company remains public. Still other analysts like Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities think Musks will succeed in buying the company.\n\nHope that helps you understand some of the basis for my opinion in this matter.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I want this to happen so much, but I fear many of these judges are corrupt, possibly even former Goldamn/McKinsey alums.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "\"Circumstances substantially changed after the $30 valuation which caused the value to substantially increase\" seems like a pretty easy excuse to use.\nShareholder lawyers are going to have a field day charging thousands of billable hours for a nothing burger.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The class action lawyers who will be bringing the cases don't bill hours...
