Its in my ROTH so no taxes and I'm up 68% right now from a little over a year I think or maybe 1.5 years.\n\nAnyways how much upside is really left in AAPL short term? Maybe $200 if we're REALLY lucky.  And then it won't stay there all year!\n\nSo I've decided to sell all my shares and buy them back after we correct another 25 to 50% after fed hits the brakes on balance sheet.\n\nSomeone said once FED starts reducing balance sheet we're gonna fall maybe 25 to 50%.  Some people are saying the sp500 will go down maybe 90% ..... Dan Niles I think said it.\n\nToday Dan said that we should be 100% cash. I'm 30% cash and hopefully can get to maybe 50% or a little more for the Fed correction.\n\nAnyways I like AAPL long term but if its gonna go to $100 or lower .... Someone online said AAPL may hit $50 a share this summer.... Then id rather cash out tax free now and buy back in for more shares at $100 or even $50 if I'm really lucky!\n\nHow's my plan? Monday hopefully I can start selling AAPL.\n\nThanks all and may the force be with you.", "id": "tub6f0", "created_utc": 1648876419.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.29, "num_comments": 243, "comments": [{"body": "I am someone online and I'll say it could go up to $69420 on 04/20/2022", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "My research confirms this.

These guys don't just parrot what they've heard from others, they verify with their own sources so I'm in the \"no smoke without fire\" camp. It also ties in with reports of further discounts on Teslas in China (as well as the stories of radar being added back).\n\n\nTake a step back - the model S and X are old and aren't big sellers now so they're relying on the 3 and the Y which continue to sell well (although the 3 needs a refresh). At the same time, all of the legacy oems are now bringing their EVs to market. They don't have to be better than Tesla in every respect, they just need to be better in one or two areas that tempts a potential buyer. Tesla can't cover every segment with just 2 models so it's going to cede a lot of market share. \n\n\nThe profitability disparity comes from Teslas being expensive cars. It doesn't cost twice as much to make a car that sells for twice as much. As you say, BYD's margins should increase as they launch more expensive models but they'll also be selling existing models into Europe and the US for more than they sell in China.

{"title": "The 2/10 year yield curve has inverted", "selftext": "Debt is more risky when it's held over a longer time period. Therefore, 10 year bonds are supposed to have higher yields than the 2 year. Yield curve inversion indicates that the bond market sees significant risk higher risk of default in the short term.\n\nThis recession indicator predicted the last 10 out of 11 recessions. There's generally a lead time of 6 to 15 months once the yield curve inverts. The yield curve works so well because delusional optimists will always ignore it and claim that \"it's different this time\".\n\nDuring June of last year, I predicted that inflation would explode and the Fed will cause a market crash combating inflation by jacking up rates. I was right about inflation but wrong about the Fed's response to inflation. It takes positive real interest rates to effectively fight a run-away inflation. Interest rates needs to be higher than the inflation rate to achieve that.\n\n[https://www.etoro.com/posts/0\\_\\_entry\\_\\_ddf66af8-97be-478c-8677-02ff82165ea0](https://www.etoro.com/posts/0__entry__ddf66af8-97be-478c-8677-02ff82165ea0)\n\nIf inflation doesn't cool down, the endgame is either double digit inflation or a painful long term bear market that can last for many years. It can potentially be both like what we saw in the 1970s.\n\nStocks are vulnerable because leverage and debt that are sensitive to interest rates. Companies with D/E greater than 1.0 and negative cashflow are at risk of bankruptcy in a long term bear market. Commodities are the only real hedge against inflation.

{"title": "Deep Dive into the Market Cycle and how it pertains to $GME", "selftext": "***First and foremost, I am not financial advice and this is not a financial advisor. I don't know shit about fvck - I literally lick windows for a living. I pity the fool who takes anything I say to heart.***\n\n**TLDR: $GMEs price, just like every other stock in the US Equities market, is controlled by the people behind the scenes with such precision they are able to force retail into the market cycle, where they accumulate assets cheap and sell them at high prices. DRS is the absolute kill switch to this game of psychological warfare because it takes away their most valuable asset in this war - $GME shares.**\n\nThis post is going to be a combination of different ideas with an attempt at tying them all together to understand what is going on with $GME, and the markets in general. It involves abstract topics, but I believe this is what we are seeing with $GME, and the market in general - at least until a force majeure occurs and we blast off to uranus and beyond.\n\nLet's assume 100% of $GME stock trading is routed through dark pools. We know this isn't necessarily the case, because obviously some buys hit the lit market, but the point in assuming 100% of the trading is routed through dark pools is that regardless of how much is forced to hit the lit market, a greater amount gets routed through dark pools to counteract the damage. I'll come back to this later.\n\nRichard Wyckoff was an early 20th century pioneer in technical analysis. His position allowed him to witness firsthand the fleecing of retail investors, which brought him to his theories of accumulation/distribution. He described the phenomenon as follows:\n\n***\"…all the fluctuations in the market and in all the various stocks should be studied as if they were the result of one man’s operations. Let us call him the Composite Man, who, in theory, sits behind the scenes and manipulates the stocks to your disadvantage if you do not understand the game as he plays it; and to your great profit if you do understand it.\"***\n\nAside from crime (naked shorting, spoofing, etc), how does one LEGALLY take money from retail in the stock market? By getting retail to buy high and sell low, so you can do the exact opposite - what Wyckoff outlined in his accumulation/distribution schematics.\n\n**Accumulation** = pick up assets on the cheap. Following accumulation, as pictured below, is a price mark-up phase. The price is allowed to run to where shares accumulated are profitable.\n\n**Distribution** = dump assets to unsuspecting bag holders. Following distribution is a price markdown phase, where the people controlling the market behind the scenes take profits and hope to scare retail into selling their shares at a loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Credit to u\\/gme2uranus](https://preview.redd.it/qv0aptjq25r81.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c4739ec6bee3bb79f5ed5f0640c2e0df10d82bf)\n\nBased off the image above, we should be in an accumulation phase - which means fairly shortly we should see a mark up phase where the price of $GME is allowed to run. How does this benefit the \"composite man\" behind the scenes? Well, if it WERE to benefit the composite man, we would expect to see him add more shares during accumulation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BlackRock\\/Vanguard 13D\\/G filings](https://preview.redd.it/9f6b50ys25r81.jpg?width=1378&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16fb8d3cf3a569cd4b8c0f7f263bf9e9e0e81dd0)\n\n[Timing of BR\\/VG filings](https://preview.redd.it/kwtikd5v25r81.jpg?width=1577&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55ea95e964f0ea203c15ae53f3fb018a1fca6376)\n\nWell slap my butt and call me Sally. So we know for certain BlackRock/Vanguard added to their positions in what is assumed to be a time period we should see them add, so they can buy low and theoretically sell high. But how does this pertain to $GME, and why did we assume that 100% of the buying in $GME gets routed to dark pools?\n\n[Psychology of a market cycle and how it is used to fleece retail](https://preview.redd.it/n394h72x25r81.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=4af6e8c77aa80a704004d8fb62d34a5f05f90f56)\n\nManipulated movement designed to prey on retails emotions.\n\nThis picture describes the Wyckoff accumulation/distribution schematics in EMOTIONS rather than fundamentals - because regardless of what happens behind the scenes, most retail is impulsive and buys off emotions. Do you feel the electricity from UUSB right now? Can you feel the positive emotion in the air surrounding $GME? **THAT'S THE POINT. FOMO BABY! IT'S MARK-UP TIME!**\n\nThe far left of this picture describes the mark-up period which I believe we are about to hit (I can't give a time frame, just soonish), and the far right of the picture is where I believe we are now - the disbelief rally. Keep in mind Vanguard and BlackRock already increased their position. Ask yourself why? Are they the composite man? Highly likely they are, as well as other big player institutions that have enough money to manipulate the markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Dang](https://preview.redd.it/z8xlijn545r81.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e6a5eb65d3b84716e255034aebce274c390e992)\n\n[Mark-Up Table](https://preview.redd.it/ceneoy3335r81.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da0f5d6ec1eb1c259ae36f520f5ae16df7cf2c9d)\n\nI captioned this the mark up table, because a lot of the DD prior using this table has tried tying it to T+2, FTDs, etc.  It's very possible that is the case, but we also have to assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated. If we assume 100% of the price movement is manipulated, this table describes the MARK UP PERIOD outlined in Wyckoff's methods. I don't care WHY or HOW the price is being marked up - just that it is, and it is at roughly the same intervals (every 4 months). Remember - the price is fake until it's not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I'm glad you asked](https://preview.redd.it/ahmvhhr635r81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=940ffd7f00a583fa5519e2c5c20b60a5956297af)\n\nIt's highly likely that we operate in a completely parasitic system designed to prey on retails emotions by getting them to buy stocks high and sell stocks low. The people with the money (I'm looking at you, Prime Brokers and Hedge funds), are able to manipulate price movement by routing the majority of orders through their dark pools, keeping complete control over pricing of assets so they can enact these mark-up/mark down periods. After all, this is a LEGAL way big players can steal money from retail in the stock market. By buying low and selling high.\n\nHow do we win, if an unknown entity with more money, power than we can ever dream of controls every movement of the stock market? **We BUY, HODL, DRS.** We buy the dip. We buy the rip. We fvcking hold, no matter how gut wrenching the movements are. We do not give into the psychology of the market cycle. We force the composite man to resort to shorting and illegal activities to continue the market cycle, all while the noose continues to tighten around his neck through decreased liquidity and increased cost of doing business. **Most importantly, we** **DRS**. The composite man has a ridiculous amount of money and power at its disposal, but most importantly - **he (through Cede and Co.), has our shares.** One real share to the composite man allows him to create theoretically an infinite amount of synthetic shares to force retail through the market cycles again and again and again - so long as he has liquidity, which he can create in a million different ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Credit to u\\/bowly741 and u\\/Tokyo\\_Metro](https://preview.redd.it/l4mtgxt835r81.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb64f5d3074ed01ad82c285e8dda6ef3fc6e6839)\n\n**TLDR: $GMEs price, just like every other stock in the US Equities market, is controlled by the people behind the scenes with such precision they are able to force retail into the market cycle, where they accumulate assets cheap and sell them at high prices.

Obviously not looking for advice, just an opinion.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Before I answer your question: I do not have a crystal ball so all of my assumptions about future price action could be 100% wrong. Also, with options my philosophy is risk management + preservation of capital for use in future long-term investments, I'm not trying to gamble and win the lottery.\n\nNow then, since you asked...\n\n1. Options give you leverage, but not the same way shares do, because contracts expire. They become less valuable over time, so **you should have had an exit strategy in place when you bought them.** Not trying to be mean, just ensuring that you hear this up top and you hopefully set up every future position with an exit plan in place. No one ever went bankrupt by locking in profits.\n\n2. With these large banks capable of buying enough put options to single-handedly force de-hedging by MMs all on their own (to try to make some extra profits on the way down & shake some paper hands) and cause the very price action that makes their puts profitable/makes the losses on their short positions significantly smaller, things could very well go a lot lower in the short term before they go higher, and then your contracts go in the red.\n\n3. You can always buy more options at a later time. There's nothing wrong with locking in profits and setting yourself up in a new, more advantageous position. **(This can make you extremely profitable if you believe we are experiencing the true play out of the wyckoff model. Not sure if you're even familiar with it, but many think that we are filling the model and will continue too. I honestly don't know.)**\n\n4. The vote doesn't happen until June, and who knows when the split will actually happen?\n\n5. Will people fomo in once the split is approved at the shareholder meeting or will they sell the news? That could already be priced on by then so maybe people take profits, meaning a big price drop at the 11th hour for your contracts.\n\n6. IV is still sky-high and will most likely regress to the mean between now and expiration (at least for a while), which makes you contracts less valuable if the price stays flat OR drops, you lose money every day through IV crush and theta decay (admittedly theta decay is small now but it increases at an exponential rate).\n\n7. If these massive funds have the short position we all think they do, they now also have 2-3 months minimum to start developing a plan to exit their positions with as little loss as possible or even become profitable in this situation, which allows them to maintain their margin requirements & keep their short position & suppress the stock price further after the split.\n\nSo the question becomes: how confident are you that these massive hedge funds, who are trapped in a short position or just really enjoy the profits from lending their shares at a massively high borrow rate, can't come up with a 0lan between now and June?\n\nAlso, please note: I'm not trying to get you to paperhand your contracts, I'm just making sure you are aware of the risks in this trade. Options are not like shares. Options should not often be diamond handed. DFV held his til expiration because he planned (and had the capital) to exercise all of them. If you do not or cannot exercise yours, it doesn't make sense to play it like DFV.\n\nAll that said, I don't know what your positions are so it's hard to say. Personally, I would probably close MOST but not all of the profitable contracts now (let 33% or 1 ride, whichever is more feasible), depending on their strikes (couldn't give you an assessment u less I knew them), start watching GME's IV% on barchart.com and buy some high strikes once it gets closer to (ideally below) 50%. Also, a \"high\" strike price is relative to what the stock price is at when you choose to buy.\n\nLastly, If a squeeze really is going to happen, one will make a larger ROI on a far-dated OTM contract due to change in delta+gamma/IV+minimal theta decay. However the flip side is that if everyone used that strategy, MMs have no reason to hedge their positions and therefore create zero additional buying pressure.\n\nSorry this was so long, but derivatives are complicated.

After this recent bull run I believe that we are in another period of consolidation before the next big move, this should last at least a few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Graphing Calculator](https://preview.redd.it/hdt4rq30d5r81.png?width=1740&format=png&auto=webp&s=a071c6b6d558553867a11c1be63237c074ab2cac)\n\nUsing the overall downtrend from the current year this shows that statistically what happened on Tuesday when SPY closed up at 461.6 was unusual and could not happen by chance alone.

This has been the most hectic first quarter for the market in a long time.  I don't have any major events to speculate on this week, I am now looking at the bond markets. \n\nI remember talking about the bond markets 2 months ago saying an inverted yield curve could come in the next 5 months.  The bond markets are moving very fast however, this is not a good sign and the yield curve actually inverted last week with a 7.5bp negative spread in 10Y and 2Y government bonds.  \n\nIn 2001 when the yield curve inverted this was just about at the top of the market, when the yield curve inverted in 2008 there was still another 8 months before the market crashed.  This shows us that after the yield curve inverts it is only the final speculators that will prop up the market.  In 2001 it was obvious to many big funds that these trash companies were going for an IPO and then running 1000%, they knew that there was a bubble so when the yield curve inverted it was only a short period of time that this speculation crashed.  In 2008 though, the bubble was less obvious to many retail investors and funds, everyone was sure that the housing market was very solid and would forever be.  This caused many people to continue buying even through the obvious signs of a recession (the yield curve inverting).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2esx9y1cj5r81.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=174fde35e21b44ac9431af1b9ac3d3b02cf85793\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hjnlfjdj5r81.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca999f349064faf40057b32eac2d49f1123dfa2f\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not dumb like we all think they are, they are just saying as much positive news as they possible can to try to keep a positive sentiment in the markets.  Unemployment cannot fall any lower... this could be the end of a growth cycle in the markets.  \n\nNext few months will be bearish, this week we will have consolidation with a downward trend, I am not expecting any major movements.  \n\n\\* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more\n\n***TLDR*** (I made the TLDR easier to understand simplifying it into more of a weather forecast)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/67s7aicao5r81.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bef57dcadf1282a002cd4c87d62fe79dade8623\n\n**I will respond to every comment!**", "id": "tup6pj", "created_utc": 1648922844.0, "score": 132, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|23|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|617|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skwpds/spy_current_week_analysis_next_week_predictions/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcoh2o/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_314/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sqwd9c/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_214/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t23ypl/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_228/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7jifc/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_37/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tup6pj/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_44/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tp494n/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_328/) \n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tup6pj)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tup6pj)\n    \nHey /u/5k4_5k4, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "VisualMod has challenged someone to post their positions! \n\nVisualMod, if someone has made a claim that they bought / sold something and fail to prove it within 24 hours, message the mods to have them banned.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That 309k that's been banded around lately is the last-moment revision downward so that tesla can be shown to 'beat' the estimates. Of course, every laps that up because of confirmation bias.\n\nThe fact is that the original estimates for the quarter were substantially higher than 309k. Tesla missed, and most definitely didn't surprise. Think of how it blew Q4 estimates out of the water compared to Q3. Everyone expected the same because they got used to it.\n\nNow, every company that has met or slightly beat estimates this quarter has been massacred simply because they were priced on 2021 growth trajectory, which is unachievable in2022 (beat revenue and profit? that's a -5% for you thank you very much).\n\nIn short, meeting estimates will not cut it to keep the share price flat. You need to blow everything out of the water.\n\nAustin and Berlin won't help because the ramp up will be very slow and given the shortage of parts in the supply chain they are fucked. Shanghai is looking at more lockdowns and covid is hitting China hard, so risks are multiplying for Q2. Add to that the euphoria of a potential stock split several months away that rallied the price already, so where do you go from here? how else are you going to pump the price up? it will have to regress somewhat before the next pump.\n\nI expect tesla to drop a lot this week, but it will also depend on overall market sentiment.
