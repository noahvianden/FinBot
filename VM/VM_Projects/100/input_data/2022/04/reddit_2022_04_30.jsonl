You'll want to pay attention to the cost basis of specific lots when planning sales. You'll also want to pay attention to correlations between Apple and any new positions (eg Energy or Healthcare is going to help more than a consumer discretionary or tech related firm). \n\n* **Exchange mutual funds** These funds facilitate diversification by permitting a stock owner to deposit their shares into a fund in exchange for shares of the fund. Your cost basis in the new fund shares will be that of your deposited stock. Sometimes they have fairly high net worth requirements, and they often have lock up provisions. I'm not crazy about them, but suggest that you learn about them to be aware of the pros and cons versus other strategies.\n\nI strongly recommend that you explore working with a professional wealth manager that is willing to help you draft an investment policy statement and talk to you about the concept of risk buckets.

They have basically dominated the globe and the bull run that started after the 2008 crisis is due to their success. \n\nI don't think you can find a place on developed world where someone never heard of an iPhone, or an office that never used Excel, or an Adobe product, or doesn't have an Instagram, or doesn't check Amazon to buy something etc. There are many more examples. And no, this was not the norm before the last 10-15 years, not this much.\n\nLets look at the revenue growth of some huge *global* companies in Nasdaq index.\n\nAmazon: 2009 - 24 billion, 2022 - 469 billion\nApple: 2009 - 42 billion, 2022 - 365 billion\nGoogle: 2009 - 23 billion, 2022 - 257 billion\nMicrosoft: 2009 - 58 billion, 2022 - 168 billion\nMeta: 2009 - 0.7 billion, 2022 - 117 billion\n\nSo when a company increases their global revenue up to 10, 20, 30 times what do you think will happen to its stock?

QE is an asset swap that leaves the balance sheets of banks unchanged (the QE part meaning the types of assets are longer term treasuries as opposed to the short term ones in typical  open market operations). Banks create money by lending, and literature has shown that open market operations do **not** increase lending directly.

This group includes the so-called PayPal mafia‚Äîformer executives at the online payments company who include Mr. Musk, the investor Peter Thiel and entrepreneur David Sacks‚Äîas well as ancillary figures like the venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, an early Tesla investor who once served on the auto maker‚Äôs board; and Mr. Musk‚Äôs brother, Kimbal, a Tesla board member, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nImagine thinking Elon hates Peter Thiel or anyone else in the PayPal Mafia. In fact he was taking their advice when he was thinking about buying Titter.\n\n>While Mr. Dorsey was on stage at a Twitter all-hands event in Houston in early 2020, he called Mr. Musk on FaceTime. Mr. Dorsey plugged his iPad into the stage‚Äôs jumbo screen, and employees cheered as Mr. Musk‚Äôs face lighted up the room.  \nMr. Dorsey asked Mr. Musk to choose a single tweet to represent himself.  \n‚ÄúI put the art in fart,‚Äù replied Mr. Musk, then 48 years old.  \nThe two billionaires occasionally replied to each other on Twitter, and often traded private messages. One former Twitter executive said Mr. Dorsey would sometimes appear to space out in meetings because he was messaging Mr. Musk during the workday.  \nThe two men‚Äôs shared interests, the former executives said, included exploring whether Twitter could be run more effectively as a private company, as it had been for its first seven years, after Mr. Dorsey launched it with several co-founders. Messrs. Dorsey and Musk were focused primarily on Twitter‚Äôs role as a potential public good, rather than a business focused on short-term profits.  \nAfter his exit, Mr. Dorsey turned openly critical of the company and its board of directors, many of whom he put in their roles.\n\nI want to say it would be nice if Jack returned as CEO under Elon's ownership but I get the feeling he's too busy with his blockchain shit now and doesn't really want a 3rd go-around as CEO of Titter.

The Tesla CEO might get some of that back when he files his 2022 taxes because he likely has a loss on the stock he just sold to fund his purchase of Twitter. \n\nMusk's huge 2021 tax bill resulted from his selling almost 16 million Tesla (ticker: TSLA) shares in November and December. He sold the stock after conducting a poll on Twitter (TWTR) asking if he should sell to accelerate paying tax on capital gains. \n\nA lot of the stock sold came from Musk exercising expiring stock options awarded to him back in 2012. It's those transactions that might enable a 2022 deduction. \n\n\"It's possible some of the stock he sells was acquired through the recent exercise of his options,\" explains accounting expert Robert Willens. \"If so, that stock would have a high basis...and there would be little, if any, gain realized on the sale, and perhaps even a loss.\" \n\nWhen management exercises a stock option they, essentially, pay income tax on the difference between the exercise price and where they sell the stock. That makes sense. The options are compensation. \n\nMusk's average sale price related to those options exercises was north of $1,000 a share, so shares not yet sold also have a basis of that level. \n\nAnd he just finished selling another 9.6 million shares at an average price of about $883 a share. (The cash received is needed for the Twitter buyout.) That implies a loss of about $150 per share loss on the recent transactions--if he sold his highest-basis stock. \n\nMusk sold roughly 50% of the stock received from the options to pay his taxes on the entirety of the shares he got. After paying all that tax, the new basis on the unsold shares is equal to the exercise price of the option plus the amount of income he realized upon exercising the option, explains Willens. The new tax basis is essentially the price where the stock received in the options exercise was sold. \n\nIf he didn't sell his highest cost stock, he should have. No one really likes to pay taxes if there is a legitimate way not to. His total deduction might amount to $1.45 billion. \n\nJust remember that offsets only some of the $11 billion recently sent to Uncle Sam.

And then when he has a ton of unrealized gains, no one is arguing the IRS should send him a check in advance. And even if he does sell at a loss and realizes the losses to reduce taxes, they won't be happy about that.\n\nIt really feels like some people will never be happy unless Musk gives all his money to the IRS voluntarily.
