{"title": "One year ago, I wrote a bear case for AMD. Let's review.", "selftext": "**About me:** I like to write about semiconductor companies and tech stocks. My previous analysis (examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/stzcql/google_announces_privacy_changes_to_android_that/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ss5w5r/big_cloud_winner_will_be_based_on_who_can_make/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks_arm_to_ipo_buyers_beware/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/)) have been upvoted to the top of /r/stocks or near the top. I noticed that Wallstreet tends to be very late on seeing future trends of chipmakers, which allowed me to make a decent profit. For example, it was only last week when Barclays downgraded AMD on competitive trends. I first warned about this exact same thing, in more detail around a year ago.\n\nI also recommended Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, TSMC, Amazon over AMD. This recommendation has done well as they've collectively been much better than AMD. I believe these companies will continue to beat AMD over the long run. By long run, I mean next 3 years.\n\nNote that I rode AMD from $12 to around $80. Then I switched out to the above companies based on the thesis below. It has done extremely well for me.\n\n**Original post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is\\_amd\\_the\\_king\\_of\\_the\\_titanic\\_x86/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is_amd_the_king_of_the_titanic_x86/)\n\nThe basic premise was that the computing industry as a whole is moving away from a duopoly (often monopoly) of Intel and AMD. x86 chips (which is what AMD and Intel make) are being replaced at a rapid rate on servers, and Apple Silicon jump-started the switch at the laptop and desktop level.\n\nAMD was fortunate enough to catch Intel's pants down and it was fortunate enough to be making GPUs during the crypto boom.\n\nBut when the dust settles, AMD's future looks bleak.\n\nLet's review some of my predictions below with comments in **bold**.\n\n\\---------\n\nMost people here focus on AMD vs Intel or AMD vs Nvidia like it's still 2010.\n\nIn 2021, it's AMD vs Intel, Nvidia, ARM, Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Ampere, Nuvia.\n\nIt's tough to see an exponential trend when you're at the beginning. This post spells out the trends for all AMD markets.\n\n**ARM Attack on consumer x86 market:**\n\n* x86 market shrank by 10% the moment Apple announced a full transition to ARM **True. Apple Silicon is both faster, and far more efficient than AMD's very best chips today. Apple's Macs are growing extremely fast as a result.**\n* Even worse, Apple is the forcing function for PC software makers to [support ARM](https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/), paving the way for Windows ARM **True. A ton of software makers have developed ARM versions in the last 2 years.**\n* Microsoft has just announced [x86 emulation on their Windows ARM OS](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/) **Windows 11 ARM can now emulate x86 apps. Paving the way for ARM CPU makers on Windows.**\n* Apple's entry-level [M1](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-13-inch-late-2020) is faster than [4900HS](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/amd-ryzen-9-4900hs) by 55% in single-core and 3.7% in multi-core while using 5x less power. You can buy an M1 laptop today while the 4900HS is a highly binned-part.\n* Apple's entry-level iGPU blows away the very best AMD iGPU\n* Apple's ARM chip allows the entry-level Macbook Pro to have 20 hours of battery life while staying extremely cool\n* Apple is readying [8,16, 32 core SoCs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs). For reference, M1 has only 4-high performance cores.\n* Apple is poised to [significantly increase PC market-share](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/), 100% within 3 years. **On pace.**\n* In order to compete, PC makers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP will increasingly look to ARM alternatives\n* Microsoft is working on in-house ARM chips for Surface **Yes. They hired Apple ARM architect. They're planning ARM chips for Azure as well.**\n* Qualcomm is expected to become [a serious player](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020) in the laptop space **Yes. They bought Nuvia for $1.4 billion to focus on laptops (as the first market).**\n\n**ARM Attack on hyperscalers market:**\n\n* AWS's Graviton2 workload increased by 10x last year. In just one year, Graviton2 is now [10% of all AWS CPU](https://twitter.com/LucidCap/status/1338208878278926338) workloads. **In 2020, Graviton2 accounted for 50% of all new EC2 instances. It's likely much more in 2022. Amazon just announced Graviton3.**\n* Like Apple in consumer market, Amazon is the forcing function for better ARM server software support **Yes. Almost all popular server software now have ARM versions.**\n* Amazon will most certainly prioritize in-house designs over x86 chips. In the future, Amazon will likely offer x86 only for legacy software. **Looking like it. Look up Graviton3. Amazon is all in.**\n* AWS controls 40% of the cloud. If AWS moves most of its future workload to its own CPUs, then AMD can control at best 60% of what Intel used to contol.\n* In house ARM chips allow hyperscalers to differentiate, save on cost, and build chips tailored to their unique challenges\n* Microsoft is designing its own ARM cloud chips **Yes**\n* You can expect Google, Baidu, Tencent to follow soon **Yes. Alibaba, Tencent both launched custom ARM chips for their clouds. Baidu will soon as well. Google has signaled that they will be developing custom ARM chips for their cloud.**\n* Hyperscalers don't want to be controlled by a duopoly. If Intel isn't grabbing them by the balls, then it's just AMD. It's the same thing. Hyperscalers want to control their own destiny and ARM allows them to.\n\n**ARM Attack on small size cloud companies:**\n\n* Ampere will allow smaller cloud companies to buy into ARM **If Ampere was a public company, I'd be buying a lot.**\n* Anandtech just said that Ampere's latest 80-core chip is [42% better than Epyc](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review/9) in terms of cost/performance\n* Ampere is releasing a 128-core chip in 2021\n* Anandtech says Ampere's 2022 N1 Neoverse chip could be 50% faster at minimum\n* Very well-funded startup Nuvia is also competing here **Bought by Qualcomm to bring ARM to Windows laptops**\n\n**GPUs:**\n\n* Apple will no longer use AMD GPUs in their computers. Bloomberg reports that Apple is testing [64-core and 128-core GPUs](https://videocardz.com/newz/apple-reportedly-developing-high-end-32-core-cpus-and-128-core-gpus). For reference, M1 has 8 GPU cores.\n* Nvidia's grip on server GPUs and AI is tight and AMD has a mountain to climb in order to catchup\n* With ARM, Nvidia can now offer complete server units from CPU to GPU to interconnects, just like AMD **Although the ARM deal fell through, Nvidia introduced their Grace CPU which they claim is faster than and more efficient than anything AMD offers.**\n* Intel is joining the cloud GPU competition, and they're expected to use TSMC to manufacture Xe GPUs. **True**\n\n**Consoles:**\n\n* Mobile gaming is now [3x bigger than consoles](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-137-9-billion-in-2018-mobile-games-take-half/)\n* Consoles are a low-margin business\n* It's quite possible that PS5/Xbox Series X are the last consoles ever if AAA gaming moves to the cloud in the next 6-7 years\n\n**TSMC:**\n\n* As more companies move to in-house designs, competition for TSMC wafers are expected to increase significantly\n* Apple is likely to continue to hold a node advantage lead because they have a lot more cash and a lot more volume. Apple's volume will likely increase significantly with Apple Silicon Macs. Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to sell 35 million Macs/year by 2023.\n* Unlike Intel, AMD does not have a node advantage over Qualcomm, Ampere, Nuvia, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.\n* Intel is expected to [make a decision](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4067508) on whether they will invest in their 7nm process node in Spring of 2021 or use TSMC. If Intel decides to go fabless instead, AMD will lose its node advantage over Intel and wafer prices will increase for everyone. **Semi-true.** **Intel will use TSMC 3nm AND continue to develop their 7nm node (renamed to Intel 4). This means Intel will be competing with AMD for TSMC wafers and will continue to build out their own fab.**\n\n**If you're buying into AMD long-term, you have to believe that:**\n\n* AMD will become a monopoly in the x86 market in record time **Not going to happen. Intel's Alder Lake has the performance crown now and better architecture. While Zen4 will be better, Intel is incredibly aggressive with its roadmap.**\n* Intel will not switch to TSMC and does not fix its node issues. Basically, you expect Intel to do nothing. **Intel's Alder Lake is a huge return to the performance crown.**\n* AMD can make enough progress in Zen to delay the inevitable full ARM dominance\n* AMD is working on ARM chips now, or will buy Ampere/Nuvia to enter the ARM race **Nuvia already bought by Qualcomm**\n* Wall Street will respond well if AMD decides to go ARM and bet against their own cash cow: Epyc\n* AMD can eventually compete with Nvidia in GPUs/AI\n* AMD takes a big piece of the cloud gaming pie\n* Consoles will have another generation after PS5/Xbox\n* Microsoft, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Qualcomm, Nuvia, Nvidia, Intel fail to compete with Zen and Radeon\n\n**My personal recommendation:**\n\n* You can own AMD\n* You're crazy if you're still all-in on AMD\n* You should diversify your portfolio with TSMC, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia **This suggestion proved to be wise. AMD is getting downgraded while Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia continue to soar. Amazon is doing well. TSMC is ok.**", "id": "tv20la", "created_utc": 1648964185.0, "score": 709, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 292, "comments": [{"body": "The only thing I can comment on with 100% certainty is that there will be another video game console cycle after ps5/series x.\n\n0% chance gaming goes full cloud before the next generation of consoles come out.\n\nEdit: If you want a simple thesis for this, look no further than Elden Ring.

Designing a processor is extremely expensive, and the cost is rapidly increasing with each new node due to increased complexity. It would cost hundreds of millions, even billions to design a chip in N4 or more advanced node. Not many companies can afford that. Below a certain volume, it's more cost effective to buy chips from Intel or AMD than to fab your own chip with in-house ARM design, and that volume is getting larger.\n3. Building a competent chip design team takes a lot of time and money. A good processor design is built upon years of technical legacy. Apple started designing their own ARM-based architecture with the A5 in iPhone 4S. It takes them more than 10 years to become capable of making the M1 series.

{"title": "\"bUT AMc iS CHeapEr ThAN GmE !!!\" Proven Wrong With Data", "selftext": "# Intro\n\nRecently, I've been arguing with internet finance professionals over the overused and misunderstood argument of \"POPCORN is a cheaper stock to own than GME\" or \"Why would I buy 1 GME share when I can have 10 POPCORN shares?\" or my personal favorite \"if both stocks go to $10,000 at one point in the squeeze, than which one makes more sense to buy now you fucking idiot?!?!\".\n\nAll of which are valid arguments if you have no understanding of equity or market capitalization. But since our world has logic and concepts, they are unfortunately wrong... or fortunately wrong depending on how you want to look at it.\n\nHere are some examples of exchanges I have had recently that pissed me off enough to spend almost two hours sifting through data and subsequently writing up a \"DD\" about it. And really, I'm only writing this because I'm tired of having to explain it, so from now on, I can just link this to them instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/901kgxd2zcr81.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=271070d092e60358faab8a9e33e55bd753200886\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcg55iz2zcr81.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad8385b7a0c05247784da5d62ce52bf253744a3\n\nThere are others, but you get my point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Price, Market Capitalization & Equity.\n\nHere is the most basic example of what I'm trying to prove:\n\nIf company A has 100 shares for $1 and company B has 50 shares for $2, both of their market caps equal $100. If you buy $10 worth of stock in both, you get 10 shares of company A and 5 shares of company B. Sure you have more shares of company A, but your equity ownership in both companies is the same. You own 10% of the company. That’s equity. Price is arbitrary.\n\nIf this is some psyop narrative being pushed by hedgies - congratz. It is working and you got bonus points for wasting my time. But, in the more probable situation... these people are just oblivious and fell for the psychological barrier to entry coupled with the return solely based on future price.\n\nThis \"trick\" is used by many. Recently and more notably, the Qrypto Alt Coin market took this concept by the balls and applied it harder than the investors that bought into these coins applied to Wendy's a few months after making their initial purchase.\n\nThe psychological barrier to entry is the perceived value an investor is getting for his or her money based on the actual dollar price per unit of the investment that they are buying and nothing else. They see this asset as a \"deal\" because of its low price point and their compulsion to buy is compounded by their unreasonable perception of the ceiling for potential future prices might be. Those Alt Coins with a $0.0000001 price per coin are using this concept to a ridiculous degree, which is why a lot of them got any traction in the first place. Moving on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Proof\n\nI took the closing price of both stocks over the past two years (starting from 3/13/2020) and multiplied the outstanding shares (adjusting for any changes in OS) to get to the market capitalization for both stocks each and every day. Finally, I made a line graph chart to visualize the data because I know I'm writing to an audience that mostly indulges in picture books and I need to keep your attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8yg0ibigzcr81.png?width=1623&format=png&auto=webp&s=2332c19385c9ffba89b1a82da1ce765c18c08a54\n\nThe X-axis provides dates starting from 3/13/2020 to 4/1/2022 and the Y-axis provides you with the market capitalization. The red line represents POPCORN and the black line represents GME. I've chosen the colors for the two stocks with coincidence and appropriately… ;). Yes, before the sneeze in January 2021, GME was the more expensive stock. But after the sneeze and the run-ups in June, this is no longer the case. In fact, for the better of half a year, POPCORN was overwhelmingly more expensive to buy than GME. It was only until 1/27/2022 that their market caps were essentially equal to one another and their equity values per dollar were approximately 1 to 1. From 6/2/2021 (the date that POPCORN reached its peak) to 1/27/2022, popcorn was on average 26% more expensive on any given day than GME and maxed out at 43% more expensive on 9/10/2021 when the market capitalization of GME was $14.5B and POPCORN was $25.7B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Let's do a hypothetical.\n\nIf you would have bought $1,000 worth of both stocks every day since 4/1/2021, you would have made $254,000 worth of buys in each stock.\n\n(254 trading days since 4/1/2022 multiplied by $1,000)\n\nI'm using 4/1/2021 as the date since it is the aftermath of the GME sneeze and before the POPCORN run-up to its peak on 6/2/2021. Plus it is exactly one year, so... I think it is a fair place to start.\n\nAs of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,598 shares of GME and 11,156 shares of popcorn valued at $263,595 and $259,924, respectively. It gets worse for popcorn.\n\nNow, let's do another hypothetical and say you missed the run-up in January for GME and the run-up in popcorn in June. You saw the crazy amounts of money people were making and wanted a piece of the action, so you FOMO in both stocks, not knowing any better. You do the same exercise as I mentioned previously by buying $1,000 worth of both each day starting on 8/2/2021. This time, there were 170 trading days. So you purchased $170,000 in both stocks.\n\nAs of last Friday's close, 4/1/2022 you would have 1,144 shares of GME and 6,458 shares of popcorn valued at $188,767 and $150,480, respectively.\n\nIn this scenario, not only are your GME shares worth more, you are actually losing almost $20,000 on POPCORN. This only gets worse as you move closer to 1/27/2022 when the stock's market capitalizations finally converge.\n\nIn the past 30 trading days, on average GME has only been 3% more expensive than POPCORN. So now would be a better time than ever to convert equity to GME.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nztqxpt8zcr81.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc5f575d1bd9eb74ae0d7f4b598f4de2935c853\n\nBut price points shouldn't be the only thing you consider. If you are a POPCORN holder and you don't realize that GME has set itself up with multiple catalysts in the coming months, you need to open your eyes. This may be the last time to get into GME before it explodes my tits. But this really wasn't the purpose of my post. I simply wanted to prove that POPCORN is not cheaper than GME with irrefutable evidence. But it's your money. Do what you want.

{"title": "GME - Stock Dividend", "selftext": "TL;DR short sellers and naked shorts still owe dividends. For short sellers they pay the lender. For naked shorts, they pay the dividend to the buyer. It’s doesn’t make sense to hold the short position if the split is 7:1 or higher. So they’ll have to cover and it could cause a squeeze that could cause a gamma squeeze.\n\nStock dividend isn’t a normal stock split. It has the same effect of a stock split but the mechanism is different.\n\nStock split: if there is 100 shares worth $10 each, a stock split, say 2:1 will make 200 shares each worth $5. In this case Hedgies etc don’t have to do anything. Life stays the same. Market cap is still $1000.\n\nStock Dividend: if there is 100 shares worth $10 and they want to do the same as 2:1 split effectively, the company doesn’t just proclaim a split, instead they give every stock holder a share. Effectively doubling the float as the same as the stock split. Market cap MAY stay high, increase or decrease https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091015/how-dividends-affect-stock-prices.asp\n\nThe reason why this is a nuclear option on short sellers is that they have to buy an additional share to distribute to share holders they short sold shares to.\n\nWhy, that’s the brilliance behind a stock or cash dividend.  \n\nIf I buy a share and lend it out, and the person who borrowed it sold it, I’m still entitled to the dividend. The company will pay me the dividend. But the person who short sold my share either has to rebuy that share (before the ex dividend date) or pay a dividend to the person who bought the shorted stock. And this holds for phantom shares or naked shorts.\n\nThere’s 15M shorts (not including naked or phantom shares) Plus there’s the options chain, which is 10M shares at $200, 15M at $250, 20M at $300 (note my data only looks up to a year so it could be way more!!) So as shorts cover they’ll run into a gamma squeeze.\n\nThe free float is 63M.\nInsiders own 11M or 17%\nInstitutions own  16M or 26%\nThe near other half owned by individuals.\n\nThis is why a stock split it a nuclear option.\n\nIt forces short sellers to buy back shares before the ex dividend date probably sometime in June.\n\nIf they don’t they’re are on the hook for additional shares ie if the split is 2:1, they’ll have to buy 15M shares, if 3:1 30M shares, and if 7:1 they’ll buy 90M shares.\n\nSo I bet the split will be higher than the outstanding shares available of 75M. 6:1 will require 5 x 15M shares bought which is 75M. So 7:1 will cause a case where the shares that need to be bought will be higher than the float.\n\nI’m not going to time when things will explode, short sellers are playing a dangerous game. Friday morning they dumped 1M shares at open:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gLZy29J.png (at the time of the dump, short sales jump 1M)\n\nAlso the stock dividend is perfect vehicle to make the stock grow massively. Just look at Tesla:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/lF6WVPr\n\nSo I’m just loading up now, don’t care about the price now for me because I know it’ll at least double. If 7:1, it’ll be historical.\n\n✌️ \n\nNot financial advice I eat crayons and shit blue", "id": "tvnuao", "created_utc": 1649030372.0, "score": 4848, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 918, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|144|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|828|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/tqqtjv) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sq25iz/gtlb_gitlab_massively_under_value_101_shorted_yolo/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sh1g8e/test/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sxeqdj/game_theory_metafacebook/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t3hc0k/tsla_multi_trillion_dollar_company/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t4ju4p/ev_tesla_community_talk_tuesday/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t55wc7/boil_uso_much_more_room_left/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t8saqb/xop_oil_gas_etf/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sq1hf4/gtlb_gitlab/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sq3lvd/gtlb_gitlab_enterprise_my_next_yolo/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/syv0mn/russian_conflict_stocks_ev_tesla_solar/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t5o3x2/ukrainerussia_gas_pipelines/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql4zhm/shorting_sbux/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o34bsp/russell_1000_and_amc_conspiracy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ql569x/shorting_starbux/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4wwip/gamma_squeeze_gme_be_careful/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tvnuao/gme_stock_dividend/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mknli9/visa_what_more_can_i_say/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tvnuao)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tvnuao)\n    \nHey /u/mlamping, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "VisualMod has challenged someone to post their positions! \n\nVisualMod, if someone has made a claim that they bought / sold something and fail to prove it within 24 hours, message the mods to have them banned.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The new accounting says there are 200 shares, and now 20 shorted shares, represented as -20.\n\nThis is necessary because the short float only exists relative to the long float, it's just a negative representation on it where the person holding the short position either has to provide shares or cash \\*when the shares are called back\\* which only really happens when the original buyer sells. \n\nFTDs do bring an odd fly into the ointment in the metrics whereby you can end up with some calculations showing open shares as higher than the possible float because the expected returned shares don't match... that can happen, but it's a data oddity, not an accounting problem. In the accounting system, the entity who failed to deliver the share still owes the share or the cash equivalent, and generally this requires collateral and/or margin... so the costs just get borrowed on the short side when there's an adjustment. \n\nIn the case of a short position during a dividend stock split, let's continue with your example and say the price of the stock at the time of the split is $5/share.\n\n100 shares means you have equity of $500. The person with the -10 share short position has equity of -$50 that they owe back at that minute.\n\nThe stock splits 2:1\n\nNow you have 200 shares at $2.50 each, for a total equity of $500.\n\nThe short position is -20 shares at $2.50 each, for a total equity of -$50. \n\nThere's nothing missing in this equation.

All the shares that are naked/synthetic beyond that is owed by the naked short sellers. It doesn’t matter that there’s ‘no lender’, a bonafide market maker created the synthetic share and lent it all the same the same way they would a normal share, why do you think it’s so lucrative for them? They basically print and lend non existent shares, but it’s a double edge sword, because come time for a dividend, they are on the hook to deliver it to the shareholder who ultimately ended up with the share.\"\n\nIt does matter who the lender is because shorts don't owe anything more. The buyers of naked shorts may or may not receive the dividend, it's most likely randomized who gets the dividend. The brokers may be liable for any additional shares they are missing. But in terms of naked shorts? How can you tell who naked shorted? If there was evidence who naked shorted they would be in jail by now.
