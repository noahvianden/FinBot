Here is some experience I learned to cut risk (by a lot):\n\nONE: Sell options of Indexes (S&P500, Nasdaq, etc), not stocks, because stocks can become 200% or 50% of its last close price all in a sudden, in which case you lose $50k on the options sold for $1k premium. Recent examples: FB/NFLX dropped huge due to bad earnings, Twitter increased huge due to acquisition news. In contrast, Indexes rarely behave like this.\n\nTWO: For Indexes, sell more CALLs and less PUTs. This is because Index can suddenly drop due to a bad news (e.g. Putin uses nuke weapon), but it never increase that much due to good news.\n\nTHREE: Sell spread instead of naked options. For example: suppose S&P500 is 100 now, instead of selling 105 call naked, sell the spread (sell 105 call + buy 110 call) instead. Reason: 1) loss is limited (though it's a big limit), 2) you pay less margin than selling naked calls.\n\nFOUR: Do not sell (or just sell a bit) options when you think Index can drop/increase a lot. This seems hard but actually it's not that much. When Putin gathers his troops I stopped selling. When SP500 dropped huge in the beginning of 2020, I stopped selling because it might recover in a near future.\n\nThese experience gained me \\~30% yearly return without big drawdowns.\n\nPlease share your thoughts on this topic (reduce risk in selling options) and I'm eager to learn from you!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is exactly what I’m trying to do.

Doing a buy to close will be for a large loss, to be clear, which is why people don't run naked short calls unless they know what they are doing.\n\nEven if you intend to close before expiration, you may get unlucky and get assigned early.

I’m just not understanding how the long call helps. Wouldn’t I still need to buy the shares and sell them if the security is in between my short and long call?\n\nYes, but that's the failure case for that scheme. No scheme is perfect and no scheme works every time.\n\nThis scheme only applies *if you hold through expiration*. If you never hold the options through expiration, this scheme won't work.\n\nAt expiration, there are two possible outcomes:\n\n1. The higher strike call expires OTM\n\n1. The higher strike call expires ITM\n\nIf it expires OTM, it expires worthless and the scheme failed. You still end up short shares on assignment of the call.\n\nIf it expires ITM, the call is exercised by exception. You pay cash (strike price x 100 per call) and receive shares (100 per call). Since the short call (lower strike) will be assigned also, it *receives* cash and *sells shares short*. So the calls cancel each other out. The shares you receive from the higher strike call are used to cover the short sale of the lower strike call. Similarly, the cash received from the lower strike call is used to pay for the exercise of the higher strike call. You will only owe the difference.\n\nExample:\n\nXYZ is $90.\n\nYou sell -1 XYZ $100c May for **$.69 credit**. This is your naked short call.\n\nThe day before expiration, XYZ is $121. It may cost you $21.89 to buy to close the short call, for a $21.20 loss (-3072%). So instead, you buy a long call at a higher strike. The next strike up happens to be 1 XYZ $125c May for **$.96 debit**. \n\nLet's say XYZ expires at $130, so both legs are ITM. You are exercised by exception on the $125c, so you must pay $12,500 cash and receive 100 shares of XYZ. You are assigned on the short call, so you receive $10,000 cash for selling 100 shares of XYZ short. The long shares cover the short shares, so you end up with zero shares. $10,000 - $12,500 = **-$2500 loss**, so when all is said and done, you end up with $69 - $96 - $2500 = a loss of -$2527, which is a lot less than if you just had to cover the short call assignment, which would be $69 - ($13,000 - $10,000) = -$2931, and that's assuming you can even cover at $130. You don't get the shares right away and if XYZ gaps up to $140 on Monday morning, you lose even more money. Of course, the opposite could happen too and XYZ falls to $120, so you actually save money vs. the long call scheme.\n\nBut as noted, the risk is that XYZ doesn't expire above your high strike. If XYZ expired at $124.90 instead, you'd have the full cost of the assignment on the short call to cover with the cost of the call added to the loss column.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Excellent write up.

An extreme bias if this is this big of a deal\n\nNot really.  There are two really well know facts regarding “censorship” on Twitter (which right-wingers will deny and I’ll probably get a bunch of downvotes here, but most know it’s true and ignore it because acknowledging the facts here would collapse their house of cards).  \n\nFact #1:  The right uses Twitter and other social media platforms to spread disinformation, and sow distrust and division amongst followers.  Most right-wing topics and users aren’t banned and silenced, only the ones which were spreading lies and inciting violence.  It was pleasant during a public health crisis having social media actually stand up to disinformation which was (and still is) damaging the public health.  This doesn’t even begin to acknowledge the roll that the abuse of social media played in the “voter fraud” disinformation campaign which led to the violent mob attacking the capitol.  There needs to be limitations on damaging false rhetoric, and using fact-checkers and blocking people who abuse the platform are appropriate responses.  If Elon and friends start unravelling and undoing that infrastructure in place to prevent twitter from being a place where damaging rhetoric can freely spread through the population then this will be very bad, and very scary for everybody.  (And by “damaging rhetoric” I do mean information which is verifiably false, not just information I don’t agree with)\n\nFact #2:  To me this is the bigger concern than Fact #1, and I’ll explain why in a moment.  The right wing claims to be proponents of freedom of speech and Elon, who tends to be a right-wing supporter, claims that his purchase of Twitter is intended to facilitate free speech.  However in the past year or so, since Trump was removed from office and especially in the past 2-3 months, we’ve seen strong and concerted efforts by the right to censor, silence, and outlaw concepts, ideas, and speech which the right wing does not agree with.  Florida is an extreme case, banning math textbooks because they (allegedly, because they won’t detail what books are banned) contain materials they believe will “indoctrinate” kids into the LGBTQ and CRM mindsets (Which likely means because they have depictions of interracial and LGBTQ families) and also banning discussions of such topics.  Texas recently tried to pass a law which prohibited censorship on social media, which itself was struck down by the supreme court as a violation of Freedom of Speech.  My concern is that the people who claim to be “protecting” free speech often end up being the ones who are violating it, and that this takeover of twitter will be the same;  The the right wing will now have the freedom to perform what they see as an Uno-Reverse and start restricting discussion of left-wing talking points on the platform.\n\n  *.     Lastly this shit is so overblown on both sides, I don’t t think much will change to be honest except trump gets unbanned but not much else and the left leaning majority of users will continue to be just that.\n\nThat’s possible.  If Musk and friends can prevent Twitter from becoming a cesspool of false “alternative facts”, organization of violence, and can prevent the silencing of opinions which oppose THEIR own, then this will be a good thing.  But understand that trepidation on the the left isn’t a sign that there’s left-wing bias on the platform and that we can’t live with seeing right wing ideals on social media;  It’s that we strongly feel that with the failure of attempts to form a “right wing” social media service by right wing extremists, which was undoubtedly going to be used to promote disinformation and violence, that Elon’s purchase of twitter may be used to turn twitter into such a platform.

Is there a cult around him? Sure! Is he also a very skilled businessman and investor? The numbers don’t lie there, he is that too.\n\nHe has been talking about having a social media company for quite a while now but the problems is that you’re really not likely to go very far trying to compete with the major players right now. So, if you’re able to get the funding (which he borrowed) then it makes much more sense to buy something with a strong market share than to try to start your own alternative.\n\nSo? Why would he want this asset? The Cult of Elon thinks it’s because he wants to save Free Speech in the west. He’s a businessman, not an activist. The knee-jerk anti-Musk guys think it’s because he wants to dominate the internet for his own control. He’s a businessman, not an activist. He’s only ever done ONE thing in life and that’s try to make money. Having talked about social media for a while and behaved like a private equity investor for a while, I think the best way to view this is as being something like a leveraged buy- out private equity transaction.\n\nThe idea he would try to treat this like Dogecoin is something only someone with a $50 Robinhood account and a bunch of Walstreetbets comments would think. No, that would be foolish. Trying to back out and take gains now would have to be an exit strategy and not the core investment plan. He truly seems to want to own this company.\n\nSo that gets back to why. How does he make money with this? Likely by re-engineering it. The current era of social media can only go so far before it supplanted by something else. The top players of today like Facebook and Instagram are already showing serious signs of age, and Twitter will follow right along behind it unless it positions itself for something new.\n\nThere are a lot of tech developments underway that I’m confident I don’t even know the tip of the iceberg of, but even as someone with no in-depth knowledge it’s clear that we are going at an exponential rate toward a new communication paradigm the likes of which we can’t even yet truly imagine. \n\nSo if you’re Elon Musk. You’re a tech investor. Equities is how you make your money. You’re not particularly diversified and your status as wealthiest man in America is currently doomed to only be on- paper. What do you do?\n\nYou see a rapidly approaching new era or communication technology (5G, blockchain, AR, etc,) and you want to have a slice of that market. You’ve wanted to go into social media for a while and what you know is how to grow shareholder value. You see a market heavyweight that’s losing momentum but is wrapped up nicely with a heap of users and a bunch of assets. You’d buy it and try to engineer it for the next paradigm.\n\nI just can’t imagine him owning this this as a cash flow machine or for a quick flip on the NYSE (after the deal was already accepted and you got got the funding from Morgan Stanley.) No, he’s going to do something with it, and what that is only he knows, but I would entirely expect him to attempt to re-engineer the platform to attempt to get a new generation of users and likely integrate emerging cybertechnologies. \n\nThis thing is looking like it’s going to become fully private and be taken of the NYSE soon so it’s a shame it can’t be traded on now, but I believe it will be very worth watching in conjunction with other social media companies in order to see what direction the current owners believe they should take them for the next era. \n\nTwitter is a 2006 platform that grew for the 2010’s, but we’re just going to have to wait and see what the new business strategies will be for Twitter and competing platforms to gain market share in the 2020’s. Elon Musk is a bit of an odd guy who hasn’t ever invested in a business like this before so it will be extremely interesting to see if his (yet unknown) strategy will be successful or not.\n\nWhat he has said so floated so far is open source algorithms for transparency, being more aggressive against bots and having a human user verification system, and being more hands- off in terms of suspensions and removals. These seem to make sense generally as business ideas, but to win in the next decade he will absolutely have to come up with more than that.\n\nCommunication is entering a new era and time will tell if Elon has a strategy that will capitalize on that well or whether this is a going to be a venture he just didn’t understand. Either way, it’s worth the watch for anyone interested in business, investing, technology, and even sociology.\n\nSide note: If you really can’t analyze this further than team right/ left, just don’t bother trying to analyze the equity market.

For example, if GOOG says they project digital ad spend growth to slow in the coming year due to reopening trends and weakening business confidence then valuations need to come down.

Tesla's success so far came from the \"cool factor\" when they had the premium touch screens and pushed the self driving promises\n\nFundamentally disagree on this one. It's not just about the range (although even here Tesla beats almost all other brands), but about the range per kWh. Anyone can put 200 kWh of battery into a car and end up with a decent range EV, with terrible specs, safety and operating costs. Lucid is the only one so far that is able to compete with Tesla on specs. Compared to all other brands, Tesla wins on efficiency, performance, safety, cargo capacity, software, ADAS, charge speed, purchase cost, depreciation, battery life, etc. Tesla's certainly have a cool factor, but for most people the cost of ownership and/or the better specs, safety and cargo space are a larger factor.\n\n> 2 GM has a modular EV platform and frame that all of their EVs will share, that's a significant reduction in manufacturing difficulty.

It seems unlikely this won't just increase the issues legacy OEMs already have with inefficient piping, ECUs, spacing of parts in general, etc.\n\nAlso, it doesn't make a lot of sense to start by building 30 different models.

At about 40 shares, the combined dividend pays for 1 share \\[share price dependent\\]\n5. You keep adding to shares you have, using the dividend to pay for more shares over time\n6. At about 1812 shares \\[stock price depending, dividend depending\\] you make minimum wage \\[if minimum wage increases: just add more shares\\]\n7. When you have enough shares, the dividend yield is minimum wage, *4 times per year*\n8. 3/4 of that money you use to live, 1/4 of that money goes to buying more shares\n9. Now Goldman Sachs works for -you-. You don’t have to do jack squat and you still become rich. You don’t owe the man, you own the man\n\nIn the 2008 real estate crash, Goldman Sachs owned a whole lot of toxic assets. They sold those toxic assets right before the crash, to another bank. When the crash came and the toxic assets tanked, the other bank went belly up because they now had those toxic assets on the books.\n\nGoldman Sachs is murderously serious about making money. Making money is what they do. You want to own them \\[partially\\] because they’ll pay you for owning shares.\n\nThe share price used to be around $200 a while back, the dividend was $5/share. That same share now yields 60% more. Keep those shares and over time that share will yield more dividend. The only thing you have to do is to keep them \\[*diamond hands for the in-crowd\\]*.\n\nDo the math. One share at a time. Goldman Sachs is not going to stop making money, they might as well be working for you.\n\nTell me why I’m wrong.", "id": "ubgl6q", "created_utc": 1650876877.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|11|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|835|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ubgl6q)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ubgl6q)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This whole post is “put hundreds of thousands of dollars into a dividend stock and collect the dividends”\n\nModern day Warren Buffet", "score": 122, "replies": [{"body": "Hundreds of thousands that's all? brb..", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So, using a format used by one of the richest people on the planet is clearly the wrong strategy.
