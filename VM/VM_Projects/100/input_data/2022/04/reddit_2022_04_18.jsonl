(Of course, if the underlying moves in your favor, you may well make more in intrinsic value than you lost in extrinsic value after earnings.)\n\nIf I had a put up 200%, I'd sell. Your put only has extrinsic value since it is still out of the money. You've benefited from FB losing 15% this week, but your option is still out of the money by a long shot. It would require FB to really tank to be ITM and profitable (because you'll lose all the extrinsic value by Friday).

The only way you can reverse your loss this way is if a miracle happens and the underlying suddenly has a massive swing in your desired direction.\n\nMy recommendation is to bite the bullet and just sell at a loss. But I suppose if you want to attempt to save it, the best I can think of is to leg into a credit spread by selling the same number of contracts with the same expiration, but slightly less OTM. Selling the time premium will help cut back on some losses but depending on how out of the money it is, you may not receive much premium or the volume may be so low you cannot even sell at all, making the strategy unfavorable. Remember, a credit spread will have the opposite outlook compared to your initial trade - so if you had bought calls for example hoping for a rally, a rally now would cause the spread to lose value. If you do decide to use this strategy, make sure you manage your risk and keep an eye on the underlying. If the underlying moves against you, you’ll have be forced to close out for an even greater loss or roll out further, but some traders can get stuck in a trap this way, burying themselves in deeper and deeper losses, which is why I would again recommend just sucking up and taking the loss.

You could instead just use 30 delta OTM on the short leg. Option prices more closely fit a lognormal distribution, so using the stddev of a normal distribution gives a different answer.\n\nThe 30 delta OTM convention backtests well and produces a reasonable balance of risk/reward.\n\nhttps://optionalpha.com/blog/spy-put-credit-spread-backtest\n\n\n> 1std mark, so about 85% chance ITM at expiration Friday.\n\nHow did you figure that?\n\nFWIW, it's equally important to ensure you are giving yourself a good risk/reward to start with. Another rule of thumb beside 30 delta OTM is get at least 1/3 the width of the spread in credit. I shoot for 34% or more of the width. That implies a break-even win rate of 67%, and since 30 delta OTM translates to roughly a 70% probability of profit if held to expiration, the trade should be net positive expected value.\n\nHowever, to your point, you can improve your risk/reward by managing your exit targets to a different ratio.

While I'm still trying hard to improve those skills, I am looking for some strategy which has low risk and doesn't need a good prediction of the trend. Would like to hear your thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The problem with a long straddle or strangle, especially after a downward move like we experienced last week, is that the VIX is high and so not only do you have to have a big move up or down, that move has to be sufficiently high to beat the more-expensive-than-normal extrinsic premium you are paying for. That’s Vega for you. \n\nCan you scalp in an out quickly intraday, however? Might work for you. Might work a number of times. Until it doesn’t. Instead of randomly guessing when to get in and out, you probably want a defined strategy on exist and entry point. But merely having a defined strategy really doesn’t fully solve the equation because you could have a defined strategy with no (or negative) edge. You might want to look into back testing.

{"title": "Elon Musk’s tweets about taking Tesla private in 2018 were false, new court filing says", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/16/elon-musk-funding-secured-tweets-ruled-false-new-court-filing-suggests.html\n\nIn a court filing out late Friday, shareholders who are suing Tesla and CEO Elon Musk over alleged securities fraud said they won part of a critical ruling in their class-action lawsuit. The shareholders are suing Tesla over money they lost after Musk tweeted in 2018 that he was considering taking his electric vehicle company private at $420 per share and said he had funding secured to do so. Tesla’s stock trading initially halted, then shares were highly volatile for weeks after the tweets. Musk later said that he had been in discussions with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund and felt confident that funding would come through at his proposed price. A deal never materialized. The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated and charged Musk with civil securities fraud as a result of those tweets. Tesla and Musk struck a revised settlement agreement in 2019 over those charges, but Musk is trying to terminate that agreement now.\n\nDamages from the shareholders’ class-action lawsuit could amount to billions of dollars that would be paid by Musk and Tesla to those who are members of the class. The shareholders’ attorneys said in the filing out Friday that Judge Edward M. Chen, who is presiding in this matter, had concluded that Musk acted with scienter — in other words, that he knowingly made false statements about having funding secured when he tweeted. This information was revealed in a request the shareholders’ lawyers made for a temporary restraining order against Musk to stop him from making further public remarks about aspects of this case, as he did during a widely viewed appearance at the TED 2022 conference on April 14. Musk also said, “The SEC knew that funding was secured but they pursued an active, public investigation nonetheless at the time. Tesla was in a precarious financial situation. And I was told by the banks that if I did not agree to settle with the SEC that they would, the banks would cease providing working capital and Tesla would go bankrupt immediately. So that’s like having a gun to your child’s head. I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully.” \n\nIt’s not clear why Musk felt he may have been unable to obtain working capital for Tesla, but confident he could muster the billions required to take the company private at the same time. Musk is currently the richest person in the world on paper, and is trying to acquire Twitter, his social media platform of choice, and take it private for around $43 billion. Musk’s attorney Alex Spiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, said in a statement emailed to CNBC: “Nothing will ever change the truth which is that Elon Musk was considering taking Tesla private and could have - all that’s left some half decade later is random plaintiffs’ lawyers trying to make a buck and others trying to block that truth from coming to light all to the detriment of free speech.”", "id": "u62jcy", "created_utc": 1650248873.0, "score": 1429, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 340, "comments": [{"body": "FYI:  It's a court filing.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Has it been 4 years already?

Goldman Sachs: 35% chance of recession within two years", "selftext": "Historically, the gap between jobs and the labor force has narrowed significantly only during recessions, and as a result, Goldman Sachs believes the Fed's economic soft landing is \"on a tough road.\"\n\nHigh-fever inflation in the U.S. is putting increasing pressure on the Fed, and Goldman Sachs sees a 35 percent chance of a recession in the U.S. within the next two years.\n\nJust this past Sunday, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said in a research note that it may be difficult for the Fed to achieve a so-called soft landing for the economy. Because the Fed's main challenge now is to close the gap between jobs and the labor force, and by tightening financial policy to slow wage growth to a pace consistent with its 2% inflation target without drastically raising unemployment.\n\nHistorically, such a sharp narrowing of the gap has only occurred during recessions, and as a result, the Fed's economic soft landing \"is on a tough road.\"\n\nBut Jan Hatzius also added that a recession is not inevitable, and the normalization of labor supply and durable goods prices in the post-pandemic era can be a boost for the Fed. Furthermore, many developed countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Canada, have also embarked on a soft economic landing.\n\nAs for the U.S., of the 14 tightening cycles since World War II, 11 did have recessions within two years, but only 8 of those can be \"partly\" attributable to Fed tightening. And in recent times, \"soft landings\" have been more common. Get it right at Jan Hatzius, and the odds of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months are about 15%.\n\nBefore Goldman Sachs, many institutions and well-known investors have expressed the view that the Fed is difficult to complete the economic soft landing. For example, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said after the company's earnings report last week that the risk of the Federal Reserve accidentally pushing the U.S. economy into recession while it is fighting inflation is increasing. Previously, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers made another \"doomsday prophecy\", saying that a U.S. economic recession was inevitable.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that economists are gradually reaching consensus on the forecast of a recession in the US economy. Relevant survey data show that they predict that the possibility of a recession in the United States in the next 12 months has risen from 20% last month to 27.5% today.", "id": "u6bmnf", "created_utc": 1650283766.0, "score": 828, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 263, "comments": [{"body": "65% chance for another decade of growth and bull market you say?", "score": 932, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly the way I see it too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was a fool taking money out after covid tanked it and it was on its way back up.

It's far more likely another factor is leading to the high inflation rather than QE. That's because QE is just an asset swap with a bank. basically, the Fed swaps a T bond or MBS in exchange for bank reserves, bank reserves are a special kind of money banks uses to settle transactions with other banks.\n\nSee, however, no money is actually added to the system just the composition of assets has changed. The bank previously had a long-dated asset (bond) and now has a short-dated (reserves) but the amount they hold whether it be of reserves or bonds is the same. This does make the bank's balance sheet more liquid, the point of this is to make banks lend more, this will obviously cause a lot of inflation in a normal monetary environment when banks rush to use up all of their reserves but, the Fed can control how much or little of their reserves banks will use to make loans by changing the IORB or interest on reserve balances relative to rates paid to depositors, if that spread is small then it encourages the bank to lend elsewhere if that spread is larger it encourages less lending.\n\nNow QE does make the banking system as a whole more liquid and thus more loans can and will be made which will increase the velocity of money (this ignoring the IORB and other factors. Despite this QE has historically not led to inflation and there's no reason to discount those cases and assume QE = inflation when all evidence is to the contrary, especially because of the things which are driving CPI like appliances, Used cars, gas, etc. Its far more likely inflation is driven by supply chain shortages and high commodity prices (which were sky high even before the invasion)\n\n[https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/third-quarter-2017/quantitative-easing-how-well-does-this-tool-work](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/third-quarter-2017/quantitative-easing-how-well-does-this-tool-work)\n\n[https://www.morganstanley.com.au/ideas/all-about-the-money-supply.html](https://www.morganstanley.com.au/ideas/all-about-the-money-supply.html)\n\n[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654)\n\n[https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/01/how-the-fed-adjusts-the-fed-funds-rate-within-its-target-range/#:\\~:text=In%20the%20current%20framework%2C%20the,funds%20and%20government%2Dsponsored%20enterprises](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/01/how-the-fed-adjusts-the-fed-funds-rate-within-its-target-range/#:~:text=In%20the%20current%20framework%2C%20the,funds%20and%20government%2Dsponsored%20enterprises).", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "Inflation in asset prices is still inflation.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Im not really sure what you mean by this?

They totally make the banks balance sheet more liquid aka. they can make more loans, but because of the IORB there isn't a mad dash to lend out all of their reserves, or the Fed is totally in control of how much of these reserves are used to create loans.

Banks do securities lending, however this market is rather small and not large enough to account for the whole of the increase we've seen in assets, the size of that market globally is 2.5 trillion, the size of just the US mortage market is 17.6 trillion. QE definitely does have a psychological effect in investors which can push up stocks as well as low intreast rates that can help companies grow, but this is all indirect and not necessarily a bad thing. Banks however can't use reserves to buy assets other than bonds, stocks don't meet their capital requirements and any stocks purchased by a bank would have to be out of its Nostro account or in other words only money it makes of profits can be invested in stocks, it can't invest deposits and thus reserves in stocks.\n\n\"and when the debt it purchased is repayed, all that cash goes to the Treasury\"\n\nThis isn't true once the bond Is repaid the Fed destroys that money on their balance sheet, they don't give it to the tresurey, any profits they make are given to the treasury but once the bond is reapid the Fed either reinvents it or they destroy that money.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Fed money printing leads to looser financial conditions, so lending and money in circulation grows and that leads to asset price inflation, as you know.

You speak as if these studies simply prove how 1 + 1 = 2”\n\nI'm not presenting economic theories and I think we're getting sidetracked here but my point and the whole point of this discussion was to explain that QE doesn't cause inflation. what I'm saying is the evidence shows that QE historically doesn't cause inflation, these aren't theories they are conclusions drawn from the evidence, it is the same thing as looking at the data of smokers and seeing how many develop cancer and then coming to the conclusion that smoking causes cancer. A theory is something completely different and far more abstract, and this is just looking at the data. This still doesn't make the fact that if the majority agrees on something it's just “madness of the crowd” The evidence shows that QE has historically not caused inflation and this is near consensus among economists, why? Because it's not a theory it's just what the data shows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I don't buy this default assumption and appealing to authority.

But the banking and central banking system is super complex, and it's really hard to try and write accurately about something that requires I mean… prerequisites to understand. I'll use another example but let's say I'm reading a paper about let's say quantum physics from someone who has no background in that? Yea I'm going to hold the person educated in physic’s views far higher doesn't mean I'll discount or ignore the paper, but I wouldn't exactly use it as a source for a research article either.

There is no list of prevented recessions, not because they don't exist but because it's impossible to know whether a recession was actually prevented. The Fed is obviously not perfect and there will totally be policy errors made because the Fed is run by people. And again ill ink back to the # of recessions before and after the Fed, the number after is nearly half, and not just that the recessions after the Fed were far shorter and less severe than those before. In fact, id says this is solid evidence that having a Cen bank prevents more recessions you would have otherwise.

Either (a) the money multiplier basically does still exist, but instead of using hard legal requirements for reserves (10%, 3%, etc.), the Fed manages bank reserves (and thus money multiplication) indirectly via the IORB or (b) the money multiplier doesn't exist because banks lend as much as they want even with no reserves, and thus the IORB will have no effect on the amount of credit created by banks because no matter how much they store reserves with the Fed, they can create as much credit as they want.\n\nOne thing I don't understand is the relation of QE to this new monetary environment.

What balance sheet target is best? What are the conditions used to determine when to expand/contract/keep the same the balance sheet (i.e. the reserves)? The article seemed to indicate that expansion makes sense when interest rates are at the lower bound but money supply (via loans) is still shrinking and the central bank wants to directly increase money bypassing the bank-lending feature by purchasing assets from 3rd parties who will then use/spend that money.\n\nBut you're saying that you increase or decrease reserves to increase/decrease lending rates. Those are two slightly different things but they would seem to be separate. However, I suppose it is possible that they both are true and relevant. Large scale purchases of tbills both injects currency and lowers long-term interest rates (so I've heard). So maybe both are goals?\n\n>Well, they are chasing very specific investments banks cannot \"invest\" in things other than bonds or loans with their reserves, also remember the Fed pays interest on reserves, and thus reserves are an asset.

I'm pretty sure there's no legal distinction between investment and commercial banks anymore and banks can absolutely hold risky assets in their portfolio so long as risk-capital requirements are met. I don't think banks tend to literally buy homes and act as landlords because their banks not landlords, but they probably could invest money into REITs if that was seen as more profitable than lending right? Or perhaps they can only invest other people's money into those assets? Or maybe lending is just more profitable.\n\n>Now let's talk about lending, the point of QE is to spur lending and thus more people end up getting every type of loan from cars to homes to securities, so naturally, there will be some asset price inflation.

I would point to low-interest rates allowing companies to grow faster and general good investor sentiment.\n\nI mean, home prices and stocks have increased by >30% in two years, bitcoin increased by 300% and gold has doubled. In two years, with a massive economic slowdown and reduction in economic output during one of those years. I don't see how that is anything other than asset inflation. I agree that asset inflation isn't necessarily a bad thing in the way CPI is. But it's still a reality, or seems to be to me. I'm open to being corrected though. It seems to me that because QE injects currency primarily to organizations that deal in assets (hedge funds, etc. that hold lots of bonds), the assets they interact with get inflated first with the hope that that inflation trickles into the consumer economy to compensate for the reduction in bank-lending. Once it trickles in, it can trickle too much or too fast, at which point it is clear that such accommodative policy is no longer necessary and QT can start. If I'm right, then QT will involve bringing asset prices back down so that inflation stops trickling out of them into CPI until asset prices are balanced and inflation can be managed with IORB again.\n\nThat's how all this seems to me at this point but I'm open to correction.\n\nThe only question left is how the bank pays for IOBR when it has to pay more out in interest then it is getting on tbills, if that is even a possibility.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\"But you're saying that you increase or decrease reserves to increase/decrease lending rates.\"\n\nIt's both because it acts on both the demand and supply sides.

This is because a bank has to keep enough capital allocated per loan.

But that's not true at all I don't think, otherwise we would have full reserve banking. If a bank has 100 dollars in reserves, it might have 100 dollars in checking accounts, and say 80 dollars in loan deposit accounts. Or maybe 300 dollars in loan deposit accounts. The bank only needs enough in reserve balance to be able to supply (a) reserves to trade with other banks in settlement and (b) currency in circulation to customers as needed. That's my understanding - and since (a) is only relevant to individual banks and not the banking sector as a whole, that means that as a sector, the only bank-side constraint on bank-lending/deposit creation is their capacity to provide currency (which we require with capital/liquidity requirements). The consumer side constraint is demand, which is managed by interest rates.\n\nSo from what I've read it looks like we do want to make sure there are excess reserves to meet bank demands for currency/trading needs otherwise rates would climb above IORB. QE is about providing even more reserves than that with the hope of affecting indirect stimulating effects by rebalancing bank portfolio's. But, reserves must be kept high enough, even in a contractionary policy context, to keep FFR at the IORB, at least in the current monetary framework of ample reserves and floor.\n\nReading this was helpful for me: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/federal-funds-rate-control-with-voluntary-reserve-targets-20190826.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/federal-funds-rate-control-with-voluntary-reserve-targets-20190826.htm)\n\nAlso, this makes me think I'm right about bank money creation constraints: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/current/default.htm)\n\nCompare reserve balances in aggregate to M1. 4 trillion in reserve balances. 20 trillion in deposits (roughly). So there is (approximately) 16 trillion dollars worth of loan balances in private banks that do not correspond to reserve balances they hold with the Fed, which would suggests banks can loan as much as that want beyond reserves held (so long as basic requirements and capacity to provide currency) are met.\n\nAlso interesting is the BoA balance sheet here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/bankfinancials.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/07/bankfinancials.asp)\n\nYou'll see that they have WAY more loans/deposits than they have central bank reserves", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">that means that as a sector, the only bank-side constraint on bank-lending/deposit creation is their capacity to provide currency (which we require with capital/liquidity requirements).

This is because reserves can be used up more than once, take my example.

They need an equal number of reserves to transfer to another bank to make sure they can make the loan. I think you thinking too short term, far too short term for this to be economically viable. If the bank doesnt have enough reserves to make a loan, they technically can credit a liability (deposit) and debit an asset (loan) on their balance sheet and this is will work fine until the borrower goes out and spends his loan, then the bank needs that amount in reserves or else they cant settle that transaction.\n\n“QE is about providing even more reserves than that with the hope of affecting indirect stimulating effects by rebalancing bank portfolio's”\n\nThis is correct\n\n“A corridor system isn't in use anymore, that much I know for sure.

If you were right, then every time a bank lends out 100, it would have to transfer the reserves that it used as a source for that money away. But then, it also has 100 less reserves to use as a basis for lending, so if they can still lend 100 with 100 less reserves, then those reserves weren't a constraint. And that appears to be the case.\n\nI think it is helpful to think about in a normal reserve requirement environment. With a 100 dollar deposit, and 30% interest, I could lend out 70 dollars even though I owe the depositor all 100 of my reserves. Then that receiver of the loan could transfer their money to another bank and I would have to send them 70 dollars of reserves. So now I have 30 dollars of reserves and 100 dollars of deposits but I can't lend anymore money. But if the reserve requirement is 0% then I can keep lending because my ratio of reserves to obligations is unlimited so long as I have at least some reserves.

It's also true that if every single one of my customers wanted to transfer I wouldn't be able to meet that demand but that's how fractional reserve banking works if everyone wants a transfer/withdraw I won't be able to meet it but it works because this is very very rare, loans, on the other hand, you can bet are spent 100% of the time meaning you will need an equivalent number of reserves to settle the transaction.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">you can bet are spent 100% of the time meaning you will need an equivalent number of reserves to settle the transaction.\n\nThis may be true, but you don't need reserves equal to 100% of the loans.

Some courts have found poison pills to be per se illegal. See Amalgamated Sugar Co. v. NL Industries, 644 F. Supp. 1229 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). While most courts have traditionally allowed the pills to exist, they are sometimes skeptical of managements’ uses of the pills. Generally, when courts find that management has refused to eliminate the pill simply for the purpose of driving up the price paid to shareholders (as a negotiating tactic), courts support the use of pills. However, in situations where boards have staunchly refused to eliminate a pill even in the face of a reasonable bidder with a valuable offer, courts can get angry at the management team that is clearly placing its own interests above those of the shareholders. See Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes Hodlings, Inc., 506 A.2d 173 (Del. Sup.

There's a known issue with the 2017s that out of nowhere the rear door just won't open from either inside or out. Which is, you know, kind of a safety issue.  \n\nWhen I dropped off the car the service lady asked me if there was anything else that I wanted them to look at. Well, yes. \n\nSee, the Bluetooth does this really annoying thing where, every single time I turn on the car, and it finds my phone, it tries to download the contacts. Even though I've told my phone to not allow it, and tell it not to do that, it tries Every. Single. Time. And it's not only annoying, requiring me to touch the screen THREE separate times to deal with the error, but it also plays a default audio message about how it can't connect to the phone and how I need to fix this. Every. Single. Time. And if I'm listening to the radio, or whatever, it shuts down that audio and plays the announcement anyway, so for close to ten seconds, I lose whatever I'm listening to.\n\nI searched through online message boards to see if there was a fix. It's a 5 year old car, right, certainly they've fixed this?\n\nSo I started telling her about how I wanted it to stop trying to auto download my contacts and getting an error every time....and she cuts me off. \"Yeah, they can't stop that.\"\n\nUh, what? Five years to fix your bad Bluetooth software and there's no fix?\n\nNo.\n\n\"You can't even install a software update?\"\n\nShe looked at me like I had grown horns.\n\n\"No wonder Tesla is kicking your ass,\" I muttered, as I walked away.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "and that is something a lot of people miss.

{"title": "Housing Will Correct But Not Crash. The Supply/Demand Relationship Is Still Massively One Sided.", "selftext": "Housing is going to correct slightly but it won’t crash in a 2008 fashion. When equities fall in value during the next economic downturn housing will likely follow to a certain extent but it won’t crash by any means. \n\n“tHiS tImEs DiFfErEnT!” \n\nTL/DR: Covid killed new home supply with supply shortages and labor force shifts. FED massively decreased home sellers through monetary policy. Work from home shifted home buying dynamic. Zoning Laws fuck over cheap housing cause no one wants low income housing near them. FED can’t raise rates high enough to kill enough demand to combat the short supply cause it’ll cause US debt default. Housing go BRRRR, correct slightly, then continue going BRRRR cause the US debt can never be paid off so rate hikes won’t meet low housing supply will remain low for the next decade. \n\nFor people screaming that housing is doomed again need to look at how the US got into this position before assuming that the housing market is gonna go tits up. \n\nCOVID-19 and the FEDs/Governments  reaction to COVID-19 created one of the most one sided setups in the existence of the real estate market. \n\n1. The cheapest rates in history have drastically increased refinance rates for all mortgages (specifically fixed mortgages) for anyone who owned a home. If you had a pulse from 2019-2021 then you refinanced your home with cheap money. Those owners are much less likely to sell as they’ve been given the deal of a lifetime for the next few decades. \n\n2. Low rates and rampant inflation reinforce point #1. Homes have increased 10%-20% in value each year for the past 2-3 years and rates have been sent up almost past 5%.  (up almost 100% from the pandemic rates) Anyone who decides to sell their home and move will have to pay 30%-40% more per month for a similar size/quality due to increased P&I on their new loans. People who can’t afford the jump in financing pricing for a different home will just stay put and not sell their current home thus dropping available supply further. \n\n3. Supply shortages are still a big issue in the building space to help combat the growing demand. All my trades and suppliers send out emails weekly of the next random thing that’s in short supply/longer delivery times/items being rationed. (Pex/PVC Line, HVAC Duct, Electrical Boxes/conduit, Concrete Restrictions On Certain Days, etc.) These issues combined with the labor shortage further hurt the supply side of homes as projects have been taking an average of 15%-25% longer to complete. \n\nAppliances: 12-16 month lead time\nWindows: 5-6 month lead time\nPlumbing Fixtures: 2-3 month lead time\n\nLonger lead times make logistical planning more difficult to complete projects in a timely manner. Add in the De-Globalization Situation due to the Russia Ukraine Crisis will cause everything to take longer/cost more as countries begin becoming more self-sufficient find new trade deals. \n\n4. Commodities are still up massively. Down from their peaks (lumber and steel specifically) but still up big. Production builders can’t promise/deliver cookie cutter homes for a fixed price for very long as prices are changing weekly and sometimes daily (specifically lumber). This causes delays/people taking longer to pull the trigger to build homes. The custom home building industry I am in have it even worse in terms of budgeting/planning/getting clients to pay the ever changing prices on everything. \n\n5. The new work from home environment has shifted demand in certain real estate markets where existing supply can’t meet the massive growth in new demand that the current builders can’t can’t up with even before the supply shortage began.  People value a more suburb style home now that remote work is here to stay. More buyers for less and less homes. \n\n6. Municipalities all over the country are creating/shifting how they do development/zoning laws. Single family homes are and will continue to be the main development for residential housing. Cheaper housing options are better in terms of helping supply but it is not going to happen in most areas. \n\nShould more low income housing exist? \nYes. \nDo people want it? \nYes. \nDo homeowners/people want it near their backyard where they actually live?\nNo. \n\nSad truth but it’s the honest truth. Most homeowner/municipalities only want one thing in their real estate area. Increase in value. Dense housing doesn’t increase value the same way single family does. Zoning laws in developing cities will continue to accommodate this idea with more single family construction because that’s what drives property values higher. \n\n7. More houses coming into the market overtime will help increase supply but that will likely happen in the next 10-15 years after a larger amount of the baby boomer population has passed and their kids sell off their houses. Still a long ways away currently to speculate on existing housing prices. \n\n8. Easiest solution is to drop demand is to raise interest rates to reduce the amount of able buyers to shrink demand down to meet supply. This is the typical route to but the main concern for the FED is that outstanding US debt that our country can’t service if rates pass a certain point. Debt to GDP is now 139%. We’ve never been in this position as a nation.

{"title": "I still don't understand how GME doesn't defy the efficient market hypothesis.", "selftext": "# Post too long, here is TLDR:\n\nEfficient market hypothesis sucks balls because GME is being traded around it's SI rather than it's performance. Overall market go poo poo if theory is true once dividends populate. You go homeless.  I go homeless. Death from starvation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGameStop's share price is **completely void of the company's performance.**\n\nThere is no mathematical financial model for measuring (let alone forecasting) this motive fueling GME's price-movement. I can't think of a stock to-date that has ever been valued this way.  Meaning, value found in the stock pertains to new information about it's speculated SI let alone it's SI borrow rate.\n\nRemember all those important ratios that tell us about a companies performance? *Useless*. Even better are option prices--which for most days, are *hysterical*. The average cost for call options usually equal the cost for puts with rarely ever a one-sided sentiment because too many people are assigning value to it's SI rather than the company's performance. BIG PICTURE, nobody knows where the hell this thing will go each day. If people by the dozens are buying this stock based on speculation around information not just separate from GameStop's performance, but a whole other company's activities, doesn't this make CAPM and other models around return obsolete? *I mean, this is speculation on a massive scale.*  Speculation around private information that is no less private than it has been since day one.\n\nTo narrow this, EMH doesn't account for **any other alternative motive besides the company's performance** and or actions tied the federal reserve.  *This is how the market SHOULD work. This is the market structure assumed to be in place not just for EMH, but for most investors/traders.* Price instead is valued around SI populated daily from [iborrow.com](https://iborrow.com) where, once the price drops to a certain point and borrow rates go up, institutions + retail will unload the buying turning returns (eventually) into a cyclical time trend.\n\nThis isn't to say EMH doesn't account for short-selling (ss) or that ss is bad, but instead, *how out of control abusive naked short selling can get which for GME, if true,* ***is VERY bad***.  We'll find out come June 2022 once dividends are official. If it's true, a cancerous bubble might pop bringing the whole market down with it. Mass-wide margin calls will be made to keep banks up afloat which will end in liquidation equal too (maybe greater) than 2008. This would literally justify why wall street was having a melt-down from what spawned in this sub. A years worth of shorting the stock plus more all because Citadel refused to take the L that came from Melvin's doings by shorting the stock a 140%. That and nobody is buying the reported SI from FINRA.  Not when $50k for \"egregious behavior\" are assigned for misreporting data. It's like the equivalent of stepping on Legos for punishment of destroying the economy.\n\nThe markets crashing in the event this bubble pops will likely be the ***least of anyone's concerns anyways.*** This is because *not a damn soul* will be dumb enough to give wall street their hard-earned money again. Not when market makers have the leverage they do to bring down the economy and everyone else's money over fucking GAMESTOP! Markets will become vastly illiquid simply because regulation doesn't regulation shit and putting your money into the markets is now a suckers game--just like playing slots. Everyone from the SEC, CFTC, market-makers and even institutions not involved will all lose the needed trust of the American people which as of now, is equivalent to nicking a main artery. Not a single American will accept \"more regulation\" as an answer for soundly regulating the markets. If the government cares to have a functioning market, functioning economy, you'll need the trust of the middle-class which likely means one thing: Prison for everyone complicit or nothing.\n\nAnyways, this is my ted talk, I appreciate ya if you took the time to read this. I will be presenting this (plus more) next week in front of 2,000+ people downtown Chicago 10 minutes away from Citadel.\n\n(gonna be kinda awkward)", "id": "u6pp8i", "created_utc": 1650321804.0, "score": 1520, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 480, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|23|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|150|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u6pp8i)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u6pp8i)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think he is saying buy more GME", "score": 1030, "replies": [{"body": "It's some kind of elvish but that's what I took from it too.", "score": 273, "replies": [{"body": "But shellfish.

Staff also observed discrete periods of sharp price increases during which accounts held by firms known to the staff to be *covering short interest in GME were actively buying large volumes of GME shares*, in some cases accounting for very significant portions of the net buying pressure during a period...\"\n\n**The SEC is clearly convinced that the major short positions were closed in this period**\n\n\"...buy volume in GME, including buy volume from participants identified as having large short positions, increased significantly beginning around January 22 and remained high for several days, corresponding to the beginning of the most dramatic phase of the run-up in GME’s price.\"\n\n**Note that the volume selling by shorts is high at the beginning, before most apes really piled on. This is the period when DFV and the original WSB apes routed the hedge funds**\n\n\"Figure 6 shows that the run-up in GME stock price coincided with buying by those with short positions. However, it also shows that such buying was a *small fraction of overall buy volume*,\"\n\n**Apes love to seize on this line because to them it suggests that shorts weren't buying. In context, what it really means is that the shorts were largely finished buying by this point in the cycle, and apes were now bidding up the price \\*after\\* the squeeze.**\n\n\"...and that GME share prices continued to be high after the direct effects of covering short positions would have waned. The underlying motivation of such buy volume cannot be determined; \\\\\\[retardation, ofc\\\\\\] perhaps it was motivated by the desire to maintain a short squeeze. Whether driven by a desire to squeeze short sellers and thus to profit from the resultant rise in price, or by belief in the fundamentals of GameStop, *it was the positive sentiment, not the buying-to cover,* that sustained the weeks-long price appreciation of GameStop stock.\"\n\n**This is by far the most misunderstood passage \"not buying to cover\" isn't the same as \"shorts didn't cover\". What they are saying is that days and weeks after the squeeze, trapped shorts were no longer driving the volume/price action, retail investors were, at least in the view of the SEC.**  \n\n\nBTW: XRT only holds GME in the tens of thousands of shares these days.
