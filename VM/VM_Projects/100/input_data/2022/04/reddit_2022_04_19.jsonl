And there's nothing to say that the 200 Millikon+ subscribers would feel other wise any time soon. You need to consider that the shows you think are crap might actually be highly watched by it's subscribers. Like do you care or have heard of \"The Ultimatum\". It's one of the most streamed shows on Netflix in the world. It's a reality dating show. might not be your cup of tea but it's popular with a lot of women. I just had easter dinner and all the females in my family and extended family were talking about it, instgram people I follow (friends, exes, on Instagram post pictures of them watching it in their stories and I've even seen a handful of tik toks. Based on my anecdotal experiece and NEtflix stats it's super popular but like me you and Iprobably think the show is crap. But like The Dude says \"that's like your opinon\". Again look at linear TV and what the most watched shows are, it's procedural dramas like NCIS.\n\n>  If Netflix had good content as subjective as you say people wouldn't be leaving. \n\nAgain \"good\" is subjective. People can leave because they subjectively don't like what is there or they can leave for other reasons (financial, i.e. we're dealing with hyper inflation). Again all the major streaming services have churn IIRC Netflix was very low compared to everyone else. Also, if Netflix didn't pull out of Russia (due to Ukraine war) they'd be net positive in subscribers this year but they did so they are negative. They are down in NA due to price hikes but that's expected when you increase prices. \n\n\n> What's not subjective is good shows being cut and not finished halfway through on a significant scale.

It doesn't matter the victimisation of Netflix in the streaming world they need to be agile and adapt and not at the cost of the customer or they will go under.\n\nNo that's subjective too. You might think they are good but a lot of people might not. It's like on HBO when people thought Deadwood, The Wire and Rome were good but got cancelled for lower viewers. or on Fox when people thought Futurama, FAmily Guy and Arrested DEvelopment and Firefly were good but cancelled for low viewers. etc. etc. I'm sure there are people that leave becasue of specific cancellations. But you can't please everyone.Espcially when it's tens of million of dollars a year to please what is likely a very small amout of people.\n\nThey are creating value for both customer and shareholder (ideally) if they are doing what they say which they have beeen honest in the past. And the plan to increase prices was long before they expected to lose customers, they increased prices when they expcted Net add of 2.5M still. It's more like that they increase prices and  expected some level of churn (it's just basic \"price elasticity\"), they intention is that some of the people eventually come back and they entice new people.\n\n> It's ironic because this is what they did to blockbuster.

I'd say no earlier than Tesla could mass-produce it and there are clear use cases for them, which in my opinion is something many years away.\n\nFirst of all, bots would not be able to deep learn environment. They would be able to execute a model produced by deep learning algos. That means while they could be able (theoretically) to understand surroundings to an extent which allows to navigate safely, it's not clear how you would teach them how to do actual stuff, because as I said, they wont be able to learn something beyond repeating actions they see. For deep learning you need to:\n\na) have a big amounts of quality data referring the job you want him to do\n\nb) have a processing power to produce the model (there is a reason Tesla builds such a powerfull supercomputer)\n\nRight now I have no idea how you would train it for your needs.\n\nThey probably start with very basic jobs like handling a broom and boxes, but you have to understand that there are already cheap and efficient robots exists for that type of work. Bot would be suitable for non-standart environment where current solutions wont work, but how many of them needed?\n\nSo the power of a bot lies where more complex work has to be done, and for that work to be mastered, you need to produce a model (see steps \"a\" and \"b\").\n\nI'll wait for a viable solution before decide how much bot would contribute to a share price to a given year.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Production this year, no.

Musk already owns over 20% of all Tesla shares, so he'd only need one or two other people/funds with 30% of the shares to be able to do whatever he wanted (within the limits of shareholder rights laws).\n\nThere's also lots of big funds that have been with Tesla and SpaceX for a long time. Musk also has a few billionaire friends as well. So I think getting to 50% control of the company to vote to take it private wouldn't be too hard for Musk.\n\nThen they just need to come up with money or debt to buy up the other 50% of the outstanding shares. I'd guess that this is where a sovereign wealth fund would be useful. Not to be the new owners of the company, but to be willing to make a huge investment at a set price, and probably get something out of it. For example, I think the Saudis wanted Tesla to open a factory or something in their country.\n\nI remember that there was an announcement just before Musk's \"going private\" tweet, that the Saudis had acquired 5% of all Tesla shares? I think Musk was actually worried about them buying up enough shares to cause a problem with him taking Tesla private on his terms. Or maybe he was actually worried that they'd just accumulate a controlling interest through shares/options and going private would be preferable?\n\nEither way, it seemed to me that Musk was willing to let them invest, but didn't want them taking control. Which is kind of a tricky balance to maintain. And could be part of the reason that he felt like rushing the announcement would be worthwhile?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "At the time private companies were massively valued compared to public ones.  Musk just wanted cheaper capital and the saudis could have provided it.\n\nI think he was trying to get people to value Tesla the way private companies were at the time (which didn't work at all, and I think it probably could have if he had said that after the stock market was closed)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, and Tesla specifically was getting their valuation crushed by short sellers. Musk can see very easily what the difference between running a private company (like SpaceX) and a public company is like.

Obvious they took advantage of the stock price shooting up to raise some, but they've mostly used to pull forward some infrastructure investments, paydown debt, etc. Stuff they could've easily just put off until cashflows could cover it.\n\nThe fact that Tesla was getting hammered in the markets and just in the media/online, while it was transitioning to be a cash printing machine is just crazy.
