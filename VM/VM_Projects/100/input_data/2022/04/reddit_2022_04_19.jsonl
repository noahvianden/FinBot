And there's nothing to say that the 200 Millikon+ subscribers would feel other wise any time soon. You need to consider that the shows you think are crap might actually be highly watched by it's subscribers. Like do you care or have heard of \"The Ultimatum\". It's one of the most streamed shows on Netflix in the world. It's a reality dating show. might not be your cup of tea but it's popular with a lot of women. I just had easter dinner and all the females in my family and extended family were talking about it, instgram people I follow (friends, exes, on Instagram post pictures of them watching it in their stories and I've even seen a handful of tik toks. Based on my anecdotal experiece and NEtflix stats it's super popular but like me you and Iprobably think the show is crap. But like The Dude says \"that's like your opinon\". Again look at linear TV and what the most watched shows are, it's procedural dramas like NCIS.\n\n>  If Netflix had good content as subjective as you say people wouldn't be leaving. \n\nAgain \"good\" is subjective. People can leave because they subjectively don't like what is there or they can leave for other reasons (financial, i.e. we're dealing with hyper inflation). Again all the major streaming services have churn IIRC Netflix was very low compared to everyone else. Also, if Netflix didn't pull out of Russia (due to Ukraine war) they'd be net positive in subscribers this year but they did so they are negative. They are down in NA due to price hikes but that's expected when you increase prices. \n\n\n> What's not subjective is good shows being cut and not finished halfway through on a significant scale.

You might think they are good but a lot of people might not. It's like on HBO when people thought Deadwood, The Wire and Rome were good but got cancelled for lower viewers. or on Fox when people thought Futurama, FAmily Guy and Arrested DEvelopment and Firefly were good but cancelled for low viewers. etc. etc. I'm sure there are people that leave becasue of specific cancellations. But you can't please everyone.Espcially when it's tens of million of dollars a year to please what is likely a very small amout of people.\n\nThey are creating value for both customer and shareholder (ideally) if they are doing what they say which they have beeen honest in the past. And the plan to increase prices was long before they expected to lose customers, they increased prices when they expcted Net add of 2.5M still. It's more like that they increase prices and  expected some level of churn (it's just basic \"price elasticity\"), they intention is that some of the people eventually come back and they entice new people.\n\n> It's ironic because this is what they did to blockbuster.

What Disney does right is that content is just a starting point. If your kid likes Frozen or Marvel they're going to want all the Frozen and Marvel gizmos for Christmas, and they're going to beg you all year to take them to Disney World. Disney only cares about content as much as it provides them with unique IP that they can sell experiences and products with pricing power. It drives me nuts that I have to spend ¬£30 on some crappy plastic Marvel toy every Christmas, but that's the genius of what Disney does, if your kid wants the latest spiderman toy, you're probably going to buy it regardless of price. This probably why Disney is fine with an ad model. They can lose money on the content itself so long as they can make enough money elsewhere from that content.\n\nI'm not sure Netflix can replicate the theme park & merch model of Disney, but they could explore alternatives like video games and include that in their subscription. If Netflix offered me a library of video content, video games, music & audiobooks, I'd probably be more happy to pay their prices -- especially if it meant I could cancel my Spotify subscription.

Its totally instantaneous. If it happened during market hours then the same thing would happen. A computer would offer 50,000 shares 12% below the bid and clean out the book and the stock would move accordingly as the model says the stock is worth 12% less. The fact that it still bounces around some is due to different investors have different models and positions. \n\nWhile to us smaller traders/investors it seems like the reaction is sever and instant there is actually a lot of evidence that it takes a few days/weeks for this new information to play out and settle at its true new value.

Musk also has a few billionaire friends as well.

I'd guess that this is where a sovereign wealth fund would be useful. Not to be the new owners of the company, but to be willing to make a huge investment at a set price, and probably get something out of it. For example, I think the Saudis wanted Tesla to open a factory or something in their country.\n\nI remember that there was an announcement just before Musk's \"going private\" tweet, that the Saudis had acquired 5% of all Tesla shares? I think Musk was actually worried about them buying up enough shares to cause a problem with him taking Tesla private on his terms. Or maybe he was actually worried that they'd just accumulate a controlling interest through shares/options and going private would be preferable?\n\nEither way, it seemed to me that Musk was willing to let them invest, but didn't want them taking control.
