Normally the purchase is 90% or more financed by debt and after the acquisition is made the purchaser wants to get their money back somehow so they have a few different options. Sometimes the acquired company might have a huge treasure trove of assets which could be anything from physical things like land and buildings to intangibles like billions of dollars in high value patents. The purchaser of the company will then chop up those assets and sell them off individually because they bought the company for let’s say $100M but the assets are worth $125M if you split them up and sell them individually. Alternatively the new owners can take out huge loans through the acquired company and transfer that cash to themselves through one of many options (usually a giant dividend as the taxes can be lower) and then pay off the debts that they’ve taken on personally for that acquisition leaving the company with the debt rather than themselves. This might be a desirable option if you’re asset rich but cash poor. So for example if Tesla stock is currently trading at $1,000 but you have good reason to believe that it can go to $1,500 in two years then you would be better off taking let’s say a $500 loan per share and using that for the acquisition which you will then pay back in a fairly short period of time once you’ve pulled your capital out of the acquired company (ex. twitter).

If you guys think Elon hasn’t thought through the financials/management aspect of this if it does happen, let’s give him the benefit of the doubt there. He runs half a dozen companies and they’re all doing “alright” I guess.\n\nFor everyone arguing about the free speech thing - Elon never explicitly said (I think) that our first amendment rights are being violated, I believe he’s referring to the ideal of free speech. Twitter is the largest, most popular site of its kind on the planet.  However the content moderation seems to have slid a bit far to the left, on average.  \n\n\nOne example - The Biden laptop story a couple of weeks before the election, a story about the laptop and it’s contents was suppressed in a coordinated and total way that we have never seen before. The NY Posts Twitter account was suspended. Claims were made that the laptop wasn’t even real, and neither were the emails. You couldn’t even send a link to the article via DM. Absolute suppression. Possibly(likely) done in conjunction with some level of influence from the government/the DNC, but nothing concrete there. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, multiple outlets including the NYT come out to acknowledge that the laptop and the emails/images are indeed real and not Russian disinformation as was aggressively parroted by multiple mainstream left-leaning news networks. \n\nThat’s one example that, regardless of political affiliation should paint a clear picture of the type of moderation that is harmful and has the power to influence things in ways that perhaps they shouldn’t. If you disagree, would you feel the same way if Twitter was as big as it is and run by right-wing mgmt and employees who did things like this, to this extent, that benefitted republicans and steer the public discourse a certain way in a presidential election?  \n\nThe Babylon Bee was suspended on Twitter - if you look up the story as to why, with the context that they are a satire/comedy site and don’t see why it’s ridiculous that they’re banned for what they did but tons of absolutely despicable/evil people and organizations who tweet awful stuff are given a platform on the very same site, then I’m not surprised you might be against Elon doing what he’s doing.\n\nI don’t think Elon would allow outright hate, or the advocation of violence and a couple of other no-brainer policies. But I’d hope you also wouldn’t be banned/suspended/punished for not agreeing with the idea that men can give birth, or that someone with a penis is a female, or have a warning placed on your tweets if you say that the second booster is significantly less impactful and perhaps the focus should be on vaccinating/boostering the at-risk and elderly moreso than a blanket approach.  \n\nIt’s all just too much, and really suppressing the potential of a platform that has as wide a reach as Twitter.\n\n\nOne random point - \n\n1.\tElon wanting the plane account to stop tracking him.

{"title": "Ryan Cohen's plan for BBBY and why its going higher.", "selftext": "BBBY is going higher and is going to turn everything around. This last earnings report was horrendous BUT there are some interesting clues in the earnings call we will get to later.\n\nLets start with Ryan's letter to Bed Bath:\n\n[https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf)\n\nSome highlights here. The letter starts out setting the table that management has been garbage with giving returns to shareholders and throws a TON of shade on the CEO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ai3z1jnsret81.png?width=1123&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d23fbe9f6f5bf65c759131362056f5dc8d3d494\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzxqayz2set81.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cdf5d0bba31a4e45b1fccbbd88b7eaf1cc62719\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98h42lq9set81.png?width=1117&format=png&auto=webp&s=11bb2cdaa340fc7cf616d16044bddc99cec360b3\n\nTLDR the CEO is only destroying the company. Returns are down in the market and sales are down while other retailers are doing the numbers they were doing before the pandemic, thus making the pandemic not an excuse for not executing. He goes on to point out the lack of insider ownership:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6lihbftset81.png?width=1123&format=png&auto=webp&s=58aad3fa98775c6101c41ee1bd010720c3946f5f\n\nNow for the juicy stuff:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1krk194tet81.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=38d57db1e13adb77c6a763b14cf73c5c65c372f1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9p6dreptet81.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ed4464118c709092810edc675a9f694f106cd42\n\nThe long of the short here is the market is valuing BBBY so low because the company IS going that direction right now. No insiders are buying, the company has little cash and cannot deploy cash to buy backs and invest in its infrastructure and continue to grow its brands all at the same time. THEY NEED CASH. So how do they get the cash? They sell BABY\n\nHow much cash can they raise with BABY though? Here is Ryan's thoughts:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/my4juvjguet81.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=949c948e64156e84906d0e71df23b046a4a6f08c\n\nHere is what Ryan is saying BABY is worth. Shout out to shark tank for always spamming 5x multiples at everyone when they say their biz is worth 5 million bucks on 20k sales. Going off this logic, if BABY doing sales by 2023 of 1.5 billion then applying the multiple means it could sell for 7.5 Billion.\n\nYou might think this is crazy, why would anyone pay 5x for a business's sales? Well they do it now. MSFT bought ATVI for 68.7 Billion when the 2021 revenues were only 8.8 Billion. That would be a multiple of 7.8. Berkshire Hathaway just bought Alleghany Corp for 11.6 Billion with sales of  about 1 Billion and that would be a 11x multiple. There are other examples but just know 5x is cheap for a big well known name with an established infrastructure and customer base like Bed Bath and Beyond.\n\nTo tie this all together, here is the current value of the company. The great news is that you don't need to bother looking up the share count on unreliable websites and estimates from yahoo finance that differ from market watch that are different from etrade. Here it is from the company itself on their earnings call today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5gsso9gxet81.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=b77e23c714fe7e76eff63027a8485940c90685a4\n\nSo we KNOW there are only 80 million shares out there. 80 million \\* 17.76 (todays close) = 1.420.8 Billion. Funny how the total equals 1.420 just saying when 04/20 is a week away haha.\n\nBUT if we valued BBBY just on BABY alone, the company would be worth 7.5 billion/80 million shares = 93.75. I have seen a TON of speculation as to why Ryan bought calls that exercise as high as $80/share. Well this gets interesting but its quite clear that if Ryan is right about value and they find a buyer, the share price here is going to over 90 which puts all these calls in the money:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/az9azeclyet81.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9564a036cd937bee734e5d6ff34685583e5f826\n\nI did the math so your smooth brain does not have to. The total amount of options he purchased were 16,701 option contracts with a cost average of 1,785,257. NOTE these expire in Jan of 2023. Ryan does not give a dam about the actual value of these contracts at all. These contracts exist for exercise purposes only and are not going to be sold.\n\nRyan has 9.4 million shares right now in BBBY and this represents 9.8% of the outstanding shares according to the letter written back on March 6th.

This part of the letter calls for BBBY to stop commenting on certain things:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8hd2loj1ft81.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdaf7bb18332a662e8f10a9b9df4fee44d28a318\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5r6thnr1ft81.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=55c2876aff197782f6752258d10e938d960df6da\n\nIts obvious that Cohen does not want BBBY to give anything away ever again. Here is the proof from the transcript of this earnings call today:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdysz0v22ft81.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=b592965a3350d1192864cdc2f19dc0c63bfffb6a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ah93hky62ft81.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=f976fc2ce708d58167a29090b9ece7567435c024\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yimz24bb2ft81.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdc38ce5c70285fef6839fdc7456b5003c7c41e3\n\nSo its quite obvious that the board and the CEO are 1000% on board with Cohen here on the plans for the future. This being the case, then there is an extremely strong possibility that BABY gets sold and for a very hefty premium at that around 7.5 billion or higher.\n\nIf Ryan is Ryan here, he will be buying even more BBBY in the future. Considering the spacing of a purchase in August of GME and then a purchase in Dec even after GME moved up over 100% from what he bought it at, this could mean Ryan will buy BBBY even if it moves to the upside here probably in the next 3-4 months. But I would not even be shocked if he made the purchase even sooner than this.\n\nWhat moves stocks? NEWS. If you have been in this game for more than 1 day, you know NEWS is everything. NEWS will move your stock up 20% or down 20%. The market dgaf about anything except for NEWS. Theres an entire NEWS channel dedicated to the stock market, tickers are over tv programs that have nothing to do with stocks. Pure news will drive everything.\n\nWhen the market gets wind there might be a negotiation for BABY or a component of BBBY, this will move the stock, and its going to move hard. The market will have to acknowledge BBBY has an asset generating sales at 1.5 billion with a forward multiple of at least 5x. This company being worth 1.4 Billion is an absolute Joke. Their total liquidity from the earnings call IS their market cap!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.fool.com\\/earnings\\/call-transcripts\\/2022\\/04\\/13\\/bed-bath-beyond-bbby-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcr\\/](https://preview.redd.it/z6sm4o2x3ft81.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34d2eb2cb3fd64a5b21a3977e70adcdd3445aa0)\n\nThere are endless good news cycles ahead. Insider buying, share re purchase program, Ryan buying even more, BABY being sold. Even when the stock gets over 90, Ryan can literally just exercise his options and gain another 1.7 million shares giving him even more ownership.\n\nFor what it is worth, here is the major ownership levels if you care to dig further into who owns what:\n\n[https:\\/\\/whalewisdom.com\\/stock\\/bbby](https://preview.redd.it/awy620gq4ft81.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=da7aae952087cd321dc584b251b9a9b5882baa91)\n\nFeel free to correct me about anything you find wrong here. Too exhausted to go into Twitter but lets just end it with this :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zr25y25p5ft81.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d53bba036825cc8bd47afc04af4e252e886da59\n\nIcahn was shorted by Ackman, held and even bought up to 25% of herbalife. Buffet holds forever. This name change is a clear message for everyone to get out of the way and get on board.\n\nEDIT: I am shadow banned here and the mods refused to do anything about it for the last two weeks.

{"title": "The hiking cycle is almost over, why the fed is full of shit", "selftext": "A few months ago I made this post about how [the fed is trapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s1uf49/the_fed_is_trapped_they_have_to_hike_rates_but/) and can only raise rates roughly 5 times (in increments of 25bp) before they have to start easing again\n\nWell in that time, the market expectation for the number of hikes went from about **FOUR** 25bp hikes in 2022, to now the market pricing in **ELEVEN** 25bp hikes in 2022.\n\nThis absolute madness, and isn't going to happen.  The fed is talking a big game about hiking a ton to crush inflation, but they will instead crush the economy much more quickly than they think.  In fact, after just a single 25bp hike in March, we are roughly 75% done with this hiking cycle already.\n\nHow can that be?  Well the federal government is increasingly in massive debt, and the fed's secret mandate is to help them consistently refi this debt at lower yields to prevent a debt death cycle of increasing interest payments.\n\nJust take a look at how this has worked for the past 30 years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p94l7g7wxkt81.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&s=519081f19be85fe87217b765c734b53382d0d27b\n\nThe blue line (upper chart) is the federal debt multiplied by the average of the fed funds rate and the 5-year yield\n\nThe teal colored line (lower chart) is the fed funds rate.  Be sure to click on the chart so you can read it closely.\n\nBut basically any time the blue line hits that rising resistance level, the hiking cycle stops, without fail.\n\nThis is very inconvenient this time around for the fed, as they are getting screamed at by everyone about inflation, so they are going to have to quit the hiking cycle after just four more 25bp hikes (that could be just two 50bp hikes) while inflation is still raging.\n\nThey have to choose, inflation, or destroy the US economy.  People being able to afford less is the route politicians choose over people becoming unemployed and not being able to afford anything.  They will always choose mass discomfort over devastation for a sizable portion of the populace. People who have their lives destroyed are much louder than those who are a bit less comfortable month after month.\n\nAnd remember 2008?  The housing bubble? Well we are currently at risk of repeating that meltdown, and the fed is hell bent on never allowing another 2008 to occur.\n\nCheck out this chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hi13v5zpykt81.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&s=c842e36213648e89fb168dec28a03e171b4bc87c\n\nThe blue line is the inflation adjusted mortgage payment index.  It's showing mortgage payment burdens for new home purchases are at the level that caused prices to start declining back in 2006-07.   The yellow line is the 30yr mortgage yield, and the green line is housing prices.\n\nThere are 3 ways to get that blue line back down into the \"safety zone\" as I'll call it.\n\n1. Lower nominal prices\n2. More inflation to cover for nominal price rises\n3. lower mortgage rates\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow lower nominal prices risks a housing crash, not something the fed wants. So using a combination of 2 and 3 is likely what we'll get.  And in fact, the 10yr yield (the yield that the 30yr mortgage prices off of the most) is looking very toppy just about now.\n\nIt's sitting precisely at it's 40-year resistance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lp8481y7zkt81.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8b38e2751de78e934054c5a68a40251bcbb9fea\n\nIf this chart breaks it means our financial markets break.  Our society is built on increasingly lower long term rates over time, and increasing debt levels. Is that sustainable over the very long term? Hell no.  But do you think Powell wants to be the fed chief that allows the system to collapse?\n\nThe 10yr is likely tapped out, the fed's jawboning on higher rates actually raises recession risk and is causing the curve to invert, meaning we can still get higher short term rates while long term rates top out or head lower on fears of the recession that the fed is guaranteed to cause with their rate hikes.\n\nBetween the housing market and the 10yr, the market is already telling the fed they don't have much more room to hike before they break things.\n\nSo what happens when the fed stops hiking while inflation is running hot?\n\nMore inflation, yield curve control via QE, and higher prices for real assets.  They are going to inflate away the debt by keeping interest rates on that debt lower than the rate of inflation and allowing nominal GDP to grow in proportion to that debt.  Thus shrinking the debt GDP ratio to a more a sustainable level.\n\nNow for what I like for the stagflationary environment the fed is creating:\n\nsilver, uranium, platinum, energy plays, real estate (in that order)\n\nTickers include PSLV and SILJ, SRUUF and URNM, PPLT or SPPP, USO and PXE, and for real estate I prefer the actual thing over REITS, but you can buy REITS if you like\n\nFeel free to ignore what I like and buy assets you think will be best in stagflation (which we haven't lived through since the 1970s).\n\nGood luck everyone!

But the percentage of the total capital invested in those isn't big enough to justify a high target price. \n\nWith commodities, you find desperate businesses in need of the asset right NOW and spot prices are fucking ridiculous. \n\nThis obviously snowballs inflation and we are not getting out of this before someone actually puts an end to this madness or countries realize the need for food security, sustainability, and a stronger local production capacity. \n\n\nI know this is a Wendy's with a single dumpster in the back but the big picture is a lot bigger than just silver and stocks anymore. \n\n\nJust my two bananas.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "So buy more bullets and beans.

You may need to put in a shift or twelve out back of Wendy's.\n\nRetail ammunition, and reloading/hand-loading, is in an odd place.  I shoot a fair bit and load my own ammo.\n\nRussia exports (exported) 80% of it's ammunition production to the US and Europe, obviously mostly the US.  Something like 30% of the imported ammunition came from Russia IIRC, mostly the combloc calibers that are not widely produced in the US.  7.62x39, 5.45x39, 9x18, as well as a crap ton of 9mm & 5.56.  In the meanwhile the two domestic companies that produce the lion's share of ammunition in the US, Vista Outdoors and Olin, are booked out for at least two years solid on orders due to the ammo shortage spawned by the pandemic and civil unrest.  Millions of first time firearm buyers ran out and bought cases of the stuff, and current owners stocked up.\n\nAdding to this are two more problems:\n\n1. Currently only  two companies make primers, VSTO and OLN, which are needed for every round produced and most of them are going to VSTO & OLN's own production, with smaller amounts going to other manufacturers on contract like Hornady etc.  Hornady (which is privately owned) and some other smaller companies are tooling up for primer production but it's a big capital investment and at the bottom of it each and every primer is filled by a human being with a tiny dollop of explosive.  Yes, they are done in giga-batches with basically a squeegee and a jig to hold bunches of primer cups, but it is still partially a hand work process.  Prices are three to four times what they were in 2019, when you can find them, as excess production is what is sold to the reloading market and there is none right now.\n2. There are only two major smokeless propellant producers that account for most production in the US, General Dynamics, and Alliant Techsystems (GD & ATK).  I think BAE might do some limited civilian production at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant.  A fairly large amount of propellant, especially for relaoders/handloaders is imported.  Mostly out of Europe.  Lovex, PB Clermont, Thales (the guys that make the Javelin missile) Nobel Sport, Vihtavuori etc.  There is a difference between the stuff used for military and commercial production.  Basically, large manufacturers can adjust their loads based on pressure testing by using giant lots of powder, while reloaders rely on very consistent \"canister\" powder to stay within safety margins.  Many popular powders have been out for years or only rarely in stock. Also, just in case you were thinking of going old school, the last black powder factory in the US exploded  a couple years back as black powder mills are wont to do and is not going to be rebuilt.  All black powder, minus \"almost black powder\" like Pyrodex etc, is now imported.\n\nComponents, like cases and projectiles are coming back in stock after a couple years but it's still hit and miss and prices are higher due to higher metals prices. Add to this that bullets are still mostly made of lead or lead and brass (copper and zinc).  We don't mine any lead in the US anymore and very little copper.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "This is the education I did not expect getting today. I am baffled how this went under my radar...

It ~~damn near hit~~ went over $50 at one point ~~IIRC~~.\n\nThere used to be three manufacturers, but Remington went belly-up due to leveraged buyout looting and the ammunition side got bought out by VSTO.  \n\nThe thing is also, because of politics arms and ammo manufacturers have boom/bust cycles. High demand during Democrat administrations, slumps during Republicans.  Circa 2017 I picked up a short case (500 rounds) of 9mm for $88.  Now the equivalent is $125 or more.\n\nThese companies are loath to add extra capacity that will go unused during the lean years, so supply is contacted during high demand.

In real terms, inflation raises the poverty line. What motivations can people possibly have to work and try to improve their lives, if inflation destroys any advances they make. Anyone who didn't get an 8% pay raise this year actually took a pay cut. Every year that inflation remains high will cut labors wages. Why work if your spending power continually decreases? stagflation or inflation, both destroy labor. This is a massive problem. If labor has no incentive to work, the world will starve. Labor keeps the food system going. It is the backbone that the wealth of every society is built on. \n\nYour post talks about the money supply, rates, and housing, but you don't discuss labor at all. All real assets are dependent on labor.  Metals will not be mined, Energy plants will fail, Real Estate will not be maintained, none of your plays will make money unless labor has a reason to keep working. Expensive prices are not a reflection of profit. Inflation makes everyone poorer, without exception. If the fed doesn't get inflation under control, it won't be what play can I make the most money with. It will be, I hope no one knows I have a store of food or they might shoot me for it. I hope you are stocked up on guns, ammo, and food supplies. You should have your own water source, and have some form of private power generation that you know how to maintain. \n\nThis is the most dangerous game the fed and the US government have ever played. Massive amounts of labor have left the market. Labor participation is the lowest it has been in a long time. If inflation remains high, expect all sectors to lose money, while simultaneously having prices the highest they have ever been. The federal government will cease operation regardless of the debt interest payments, if high inflation or stagflation is allowed to persist.\n\nThe solution is to raise rates, and raise them high. Rates should be higher than the inflation rate. As long as rates stay below inflation, debt will remain attractive for anyone with a brain.
