{"title": "Google, Meta, and others will have to explain their algorithms under new EU legislation", "selftext": "https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/23/23036976/eu-digital-services-act-finalized-algorithms-targeted-advertising\n\nThe EU has agreed on another ambitious piece of legislation to police the online world.\n\nEarly Saturday morning after hours of negotiations, the bloc agreed on the broad terms of the Digital Services Act, or DSA, which will force tech companies to take greater responsibility for content that appears on their platforms. New obligations include removing illegal content and goods more quickly, explaining to users and researchers how their algorithms work, and taking stricter action on the spread of misinformation. Companies face fines of up to six percent of their annual turnover for non-compliance.\n\nAlthough the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the effect of these laws will certainly be felt in other parts of the world, too. Global tech companies may decide it is more cost-effective to implement a single strategy to police content and take the EU’s comparatively stringent regulations as their benchmark. While lawmakers in the US keen to rein in Big Tech with their own regulations have already begun looking to the EU’s rules for inspiration.\n\nThe final text of the DSA has yet to be released, but the European Parliament and European Commission have detailed a number of obligations it will contain:\n\n* Targeted advertising based on an individuals’ religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity is banned. Minors cannot be subject to targeted advertising either.\n\n* “Dark patterns” — confusing or deceptive user interfaces designed to steer users into making certain choices — will be prohibited. The EU says that, as a rule, cancelling subscriptions should be as easy as signing up for them.\n\n* Large online platforms like Facebook will have to make the working of their recommender algorithms (e.g. used for sorting content on the News Feed or suggesting TV shows on Netflix) transparent to users. Users should also be offered a recommender system “not based on profiling.” In the case of Instagram, for example, this would mean a chronological feed (as it introduced recently).\n\n* Hosting services and online platforms will have to explain clearly why they have removed illegal content, as well as give users the ability to appeal such takedowns. The DSA itself does not define what content is illegal, though, and leaves this up to individual countries.\n\n* The largest online platforms will have to provide key data to researchers to “provide more insight into how online risks evolve.”\n\n* Online marketplaces must keep basic information about traders on their platform to track down individuals selling illegal goods or services.\n\n* Large platforms will also have to introduce new strategies for dealing with misinformation during crises (a provision inspired by the recent invasion of Ukraine).\n\nThe DSA will, like the DMA, distinguish between tech companies of different sizes, placing greater obligations on bigger companies. The largest firm — those with at least 45 million users in the EU, like Meta and Google — will face the most scrutiny. These tech companies have lobbied hard to water down the requirements in the DSA, particularly those concerning targeted advertising and handing over data to outside researchers.\n\nAlthough the broad terms of the DSA have now been agreed upon by the member states of the EU, the legal language still needs to be finalized and the act officially voted into law. This last step is seen as a formality at this point, though. The rules will apply to all companies 15 months after the act is voted into law, or from 1 January 2024, whichever is later.", "id": "uavfl8", "created_utc": 1650808968.0, "score": 1828, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 337, "comments": [{"body": "> In the case of Instagram, for example, this would mean a chronological feed (as it introduced recently).\n\nIt's several orders of magnitude easier to sort by date than by any of the ML-trained bullshit they're using which makes this \"recently introduced\" feature particularly fucking galling.", "score": 149, "replies": [{"body": "Relevancy might make for a better user experience but the real reason is sponsorship", "score": 53, "replies": []}, {"body": "Chronological also will be worse for their time on site metrics, which will hurt and revenue.

{"title": "Don't Be Fooled. This Environment has no Historical Precedent", "selftext": "This is a response to a multitude of posts I've seen attempting to waive away the current Fed path as no big deal. This is not a doom post. The economy is unlikely to face a major recession any time soon. The pain in stocks on the other hand, is almost certain to continue for a while and may be pretty bad before it's all over. Not all rate hike cycles are the same. The total increase in rates matters, the speed of hikes matter, what is happening in the broader economy matters. But many of these posts leave all of that context out. A lot of you I think are relying on misleading, overly simplistic, devoid of context arguments to inform your thinking and it will probably result in losing money.  \n\nMany people on this board seem to have little knowledge of markets before 2020. Hopefully this provides some education, and convinces you to proceed with caution. The last three years (yes, I'm intentionally including 2019, pre-pandemic) are highly abnormal and almost certainly will not continue. So if your frame of reference for what's normal is the last three years, read on, and seriously consider reducing your risk exposure.\n\nYou've probably seen a number of posts like this, implying monetary tightening is no big deal and you should just shrug it off:\n\n*Market returns during Fed rate hike cycles:*\n\n*Aug 1954 - Oct 1957: 14%*  \n*Jun 1958 - Nov 1959: 24%*  \n*Aug 1961 - Nov 1966: 7%*  \n*Aug 1967 - Aug 1969: 4%*  \n*Mar 1972 - Jul 1974: -9%*  \n*Feb 1977 - Jun 1981: 11%*  \n*Mar 1983 - Aug 1984: 13%*  \n*Jan 1987 - May 1989: 16%*  \n*Feb 1994 - Feb 1995: 4%*  \n*Jun 1999 - May 2000: 10%*  \n*Jun 2004 - Jun 2006: 8%*  \n*Dec 2015 - Dec 2018: 8%* \n\nThe implication is that what the Fed does is no big deal, and a lot of people seem to believe that. Or more likely, nervously convince themselves it's true, because they want it to be. \n\n**TLDR:** \n\n1. Monetary tightening is bad for stocks. This is indisputably true. That doesn't necessarily mean stocks will decline during monetary tightening. If they rise, it will be less than they would if monetary policy were eased. Stocks often decline soon after a rate hike cycle or at some point during the cycle, but the numbers above don't show you that. Conveniently.\n2. Quantitative easing has completely changed the picture. Pre-QE references are not comparable. The combination of high inflation, QT and rapidly rising rates happening simultaneously has no historical comparison. And it is likely to cause a significant bear market.\n3. Don't fight the Fed.\n\n**Refer to:**\n\nS&P 500 P/E: [https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio)\n\nShiller P/E Ratio (CAPE): [https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)\n\nFed Balance Sheet: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst\\_recenttrends.htm#:\\~:text=Charts%20are%20generally%20updated%20at,4%3A30%20ET%20on%20Thursdays](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm#:~:text=Charts%20are%20generally%20updated%20at,4%3A30%20ET%20on%20Thursdays).\n\nFed Funds Rate: [https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)\n\nS&P 500 Chart: [https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data)\n\n**Why is this different than other rate hike cycles?**\n\nQT and rate hikes have only occurred once, at a much smaller scale than what we're facing now, and it caused a bear market. During any of the previous rate hike cycles, QE/QT did not exist.\n\nShrugging off the current path of  the Fed is I think going to result in a lot of pain for anyone who tries to do it. Arguments like the above ignore an awful lot of context. Such as: \n\n* Many of these rate hike cycles did in fact cause bear markets. Just not immediately. Bear markets did occur during the rate hike cycles or soon after. Some of them were quite painful.\n* What was happening with the economy? Generally the Fed has, and should, raise rates at the start of economic expansion, and lower rates as growth slows or contracts. That is the path many previous rate hike cycles followed. Is that where we are now? No it isn't. The Fed is tightening as growth has peaked and is about to slow. Facing headwinds from inflation and supply disruptions. The economy, and stock markets, are better able to withstand tightening when an expansion phase is ramping up than when peaked and is facing many headwinds to growth.\n* Quantitative tightening is a much bigger bomb than the Fed funds rate. QT is almost entirely unstudied because it has not happened on a meaningful scale. **The only example of QT we have, caused a bear market that did not reverse until the Fed reversed.**\n* Stock valuations by any measure are extreme by historical standards. Previous monetary tightening cycles generally began with more historically normal valuations.\n\nStocks valuations are in bubble territory by historical valuation metrics. This isn't disputable, so if you're thinking of trying, don't. You might have convinced yourself that something is different now and the new, much higher than historical valuations are justified for reasons. It's possible you're right, but probably not. High valuations can generally only be supported by low interest rates and QE. Both of these are ending. \n\nValuation using CAPE, we are at a multi decade high, only the dot com bubble has exceeded current valuations. Even during the roaring 20s, which preceded the great depression, valuations did not reach the levels they are at now.\n\nValuation by S&P 500 P/E, we were in the mid 20s at the start of the year. Which is higher than nearly any point in history, other than dot com. Estimated now at around 21 thanks to this little correction. Which is still very high by historical standards. S&P 500 P/E over 20 has never been sustained for long outside of bubbles or when propelled by QE.\n\nMost Fed tightening cycles did include significant periods of pain in stock markets. Or were followed soon after. Though the no big dealers present it in a way that you don't see that. \n\nRight now, we have a stock market bubble, an over heated economy, high inflation, and an aggressively tightening Fed. This combination of factors has no precedent in post-WW2 US history.\n\n**Extreme Valuation Peaks:**\n\n*Roaring 20s - September 1929*\n\nCAPE: 32.56\n\nS&P 500 P/E: 20.17\n\n*Dot Com - Mid 2020*\n\nCAPE: 42.87\n\nS&P 500 P/E: 28.50\n\n*November 2021*\n\nCAPE: 38.58\n\nS&P 500 P/E: 24.5\n\nThe previous two peaks were followed by massive losses in stocks that did not recover for more than a decade.\n\n**Rate hikes plus QT**\n\nBulls are dramatically underestimating the impact of simultaneous rate hikes and QT, at a time the economy has already peaked and growth is going to slow. There is no historical precedent for this.\n\nQE first happened in the US in 2009. QE continued through November 2017. At that point the Fed began a slow QT process. The Fed had previously begun raising rates in 2015. This was a slow rate hike cycle at a rate of about 25bp every 3-6 months. In November 2017, the Fed announce QT. This started fairly slow, and progressed to a moderate pace. All told, QT lasted from November 2017 to August 2019. The Fed balance sheet contracted from 4.45 trillion to 3.76 trillion. A rate of about 31 billion a month.\n\nThe combination of rising rates and QT caused a bear market in the fall of 2018. It ended when the Fed pledged to stop raising rates in December 2018. Then, even though the economy was fine, the Fed started cutting rates in 2019 and resumed QE. The resumption of QE astonished many analysts. The Fed in fact didn't call it QE, though it clearly was. So what was this? This was the Fed put. Stock and bond markets ballooned in 2019, the beginning of the Fed induced acceleration of one of the largest asset bubbles in US history. All because of printed money from the Fed, at a time it was not needed to support the economy. It's important to note, risk assets were not exactly cheap by historical measures before 2019.\n\n**Where are we now**\n\nLet's compare now to 2018, the only other time QT has happened, alongside rate hikes. \n\nFrom 2015-2018, the Fed hiked rates around 25bp a quarter. Today, we're looking at 50bp a month, for probably 3 months, followed by 25bp a month. A rate of increase around 5 times faster than 2015-2018. \n\nFrom November 2017 through August 2019, the Fed reduced its balance sheet by an average of 31 billion a month. Today, we're looking at 95 billion a month. A rate 3 times faster.\n\nA bear market began in September 2018 in response to QT and rising rates. The bear market of 2018 did not stop until the Fed stopped raising rates. QT ended soon after, and was followed by more QE. What happened? In 2018, inflation was not a problem. So the Fed Put was able to kick in. The Fed came to the rescue of the stock and bond markets. Can this happen now? No, not any time soon. The Fed has to fight inflation. There will be no Fed put to save stocks this time, not soon anyway.\n\nValuations were less extreme at the start of the 2018 bear market.\n\n*September 2018*\n\nCAPE: 32.62\n\nS&P 500 P/E: 22.52\n\n*November 2021*\n\nCAPE: 38.58\n\nS&P 500 P/E: 24.52\n\n**Previous Rate Hike Cycles:**\n\nYou don't really need to continue reading if you don't want to. But important context is provided for each rate hike cycle. Most of these were not exactly raging bull markets, and in many ways were not remotely comparable to where we are now.\n\nAug 1954 - Oct 1957: 14%\n\n* The US exited a recession in May 1954. \n* The Fed raised rates into an economic expansion from around 1.5% to 3% over the course of about a year and a half. Briefly touching 3.5%, upon which a recession immediately followed. \n* Bear market from 1956 to 1957\n* CAPE and S&P 500 P/E in the mid teens\n\nJun 1958 - Nov 1959: 24%\n\n* The US exited a recession in April 1958. \n* The Fed raised rates into an economic expansion from around 1.5% to 4% over the course of about a year. A recession followed in April 1960.\n* Stocks dropped from 1959 to 1960 but did not officially enter a bear market\n* CAPE and S&P 500 P/E in the mid teens\n\nAug 1961 - Nov 1966: 7%\n\n* The US exited a recession in January 1961. \n* The Fed raised rates into an economic expansion to 6% over about 4 years. Worth noting this coincided with one of the longest and strongest US economic expansions. It included the Vietnam war and expansive fiscal policy.\n* Bear markets in '61 and '66\n* CAPE and S&P 500 P/E in the high teens to low 20s\n\nThe inflation era from the late 60s to early 80s. I'm going to talk about this qualitatively  because looking at the numbers above is meaningless. You might look at the numbers above and think, oh look, 1977-1981, those were pretty good years in the market. No, it absolutely wasn't. Inflation outpaced market gains. \n\nOn an inflation adjusted basis, the S&P 500 was in nearly a 15 year bear market from 1968-1982. On an inflation adjusted basis, the market declined 65% over 15 years. This does not account for dividends. It was absolutely brutal. P/E on the S&P 500 declined deep into single digits. Yes, that's right, for all you who think a P/E of 20 is cheap, single digits. I believe it bottomed around 6-7. CAPE also declined into the single digits. Why? Stagflation. Interestingly, now is the first time since then that any serious person is seriously suggesting we may enter a period of stagflation.\n\nMar 1983 - Aug 1984: 13%\n\n* The US exited a brutal recession in December 1982. The recession was caused by, you guessed it, The Volcker Fed fighting inflation. Sound familiar? As a reminder (see above) stock valuations were at rock bottom before this rate hike cycle due to a brutal recession. In March 1983, when this rate hike cycle began, P/E was 12.23. A year earlier, it was 7.5. CAPE was at 9.23, a year earlier it was 6.95. This doesn't sound much like where we are today does it?\n* The Fed raised rates into an economic expansion\n* Remember, stocks were exiting a period where P/E had been driven down to single digits. By the end of 1984, S&P 500 P/E and CAPE had risen to 10. When valuations are low enough, stocks can rise even in the face of rising rates. But we don't have low valuations now do we?\n\nJan 1987 - May 1989: 16%\n\n* This period included Black Monday\n* The phrase Greenspan put is born (which would later become the Fed put) following Black Monday. In other words, calling this a rate hike cycle leaves out important context. There was an enormous market crash, and the Fed responded immediately by cutting rates. Only raising rates again once the market had stabilized. Without the Fed put when the market crashed, this period would likely not have been so great.\n* CAPE low 20s. S&P 500 P/E had risen to low 20s before Black Monday, collapsing to low double digits.\n\nFeb 1994 - Feb 1995: 4%\n\n* The Fed raised rates from about 3% to about 6%\n* Stocks went pretty much nowhere. Declining overall on an inflation adjusted basis. There were a couple of significant corrections in this period. At no point was there a rally above the 1994 highs until the fed stopped raising rates.\n* CAPE low 20s, S&P 500 P/E declines from low 20s to mid teens\n\nJun 1999 - May 2000: 10%\n\n* Fed raises rates from around 4.5% to around  6.5%\n* It's hilarious to suggest stocks did fine here, as the Fed rate hikes, among other events, popped the dot com bubble. Which was one of the most brutal multi year periods in market history. Stocks would not recover to the 2000 highs for almost 15 years.\n\nJun 2004 - Jun 2006: 8%\n\n* Another bubble is forming, this time in housing and synthetic mortgage securities. These Fed rate hikes are one reason for that bubble popping, which caused a 60% draw down in the S&P 500.\n\nDec 2015 - Dec 2018: 8%\n\n* We are now in a QE world\n* As a result of slow rate hikes and modest QT beginning in late 2017, a bear market forms in the fall of 2018.\n* The bear market stops only when the Fed reverses course.

I'm not trying to make an argument for why this time is different, but I think it's reasonable to suggest the CAPE ratio is a very fuzzy valuation metric at best and one that needs to be interpreted with care rather than just with a quick glace at a chart.\n\nFor example, if earnings growth over the last decade has been rapid and that growth is sustainable and reasonable, then the CAPE ratio is going to be high while not necessarily being anything to fear. It seems kind of obvious to me that at least part of the reason why the CAPE ratio has been trending up since the GFC is because of the dominance of high growth tech stocks in the S&P500. These stocks have grown earnings rapidly and in what seems to be in completely sustainable ways, and this will of course push the CAPE ratio higher.\n\nIf you look back at S&P500 earnings you'll find very few times where earnings have doubled over a 10 year period with this decade be one of the very few exceptions. Now the question you need to ask is whether or not that earning growth is sustainable? I think the answer in this case is probably yes and that it will likely slow over the next decade as tech growth slows due to scale. If I were to take the other side of this argument though I would probably argue that things like the extent of margin expansion in recent years might be unsustainable and could collapse back to more typical levels now companies have to deal with inflation. This would send earnings lower for some time. But the point I'm trying to make is that you probably need to have an explanation for why the CAPE ratio is too high rather than just pointing out the fact it's higher than it's been historically. That fact alone doesn't really tell you anything.\n\nThat said, the other reason the CAPE ratio could be high is simply that valuations are high, but this isn't the case today with PEs barely above historical averages. And again, above historical averages is probably fine given growth tech companies are such a large part of the S&P500 today and rates are still relatively low compared to historical averages. If you're going to argue PEs today are too high then you need to at least be able to point to companies in the S&P500 that have extreme valuations. I mean I could name a few that are a bit silly, but the vast majority seem about right when you consider growth rates.\n\nAnother thing to note is that when the GFC hit the CAPE ratio only fell as low as it's long-term average. It didn't fall anywhere near its historical lows, it fell merely to its average. Today with CAPE ratios are even higher than when the GFC hit so it's likely to bottom out somewhere higher too. So perhaps instead of dropping back down to 15 like it did during the GFC it will drop to somewhere like 20-25. And that's assuming whatever is about to happen is going to be as bad as the GFC... If it's not, perhaps 25-30 is enough...\n\nAt the end of the day all that really matters is how low earnings will go and for how long. The CAPE ratio can sometimes indicate that earnings growth or valuations are unsustainably high, but if nothing else other than the CAPE ratio suggests that's the case then perhaps it's a false positive. For example if you're worried about the CAPE ratio today, why haven't you been worried about it for the last decade? Why is today different? If you can't answer these questions then the CAPE ratio is practically useless.\n\nPersonally I don't think earnings are about to fall of a cliff so I think the CAPE ratio is probably just a reflection of lower interest rates and high growth rates in recent years. I think it's quite likely earnings will slow and perhaps even decline slightly for couple of quarters, but my guess is that's about it. Monetary tightening will of course bring valuations down, perhaps to around an 18 PE, but with some luck earnings growth will offset some of the price declines.\n\nFinally, you're also assuming that the FED does tightening aggressively. There's a chance that inflation has already peaked and that the FED is going to change their tone dramatically over the next few months. At the end of the day you just don't know. All we know for sure is that over longer periods stocks will trend up. I honestly have no idea what's going to happen over the next few months. If you told me right now that Powell's tone pivots in a few weeks time I honestly wouldn't be surprised. Likewise, if you told me by the end of the year the US was in recession I wouldn't be surprised either.

Can the Fed even raise rates that high? Can they service their debts with rates that high? I actually get the impression they are talking a big game to hit the market, buy themselves some time, see if inflation eases on its own, and that way they won't have to raise rates much. I expect they won't do a series of .5 hikes, they'll find a reason not to.\n3. Influx of retail investors. Retail investors may force institutions to buy a little higher than they want in order to avoid a situation where retail does well buying down to the bottom. Institutional investors don't want to be buying higher than retail. That could happen, especially with tech, if we keep going as we have been. I actually think that some growth companies are a bargain right now and institutional investors may even be biting at these levels to buy back what they sold end of last year.\n4. There is no great place to park money right now. Housing is overheated, inflation is high so cash isn't a great option, bonds suck, gold has fallen out of favor it seems. Certain sectors in the stock market, particularly value and commodities are actually trading at high multiples. KO, COST, etc are probably not too attractive right now.

First of all, great job backing up your argument with research.  You make a very compelling case.  I have a couple of thoughts though as to how it could play out differently this time.\n\n1. We have seen extremes for the last two years related to COVID.  The pandemic caused a severe (arguably the most severe since the Civil War) but brief recession, and it also caused behavioral changes, some of which may prove to be long-lasting.  The US Government (and other governments all over the world) responded by taking treasury yields to close to 0% and by implementing historic stimulus.  Our economy took an unprecedented nose dive in the first few months of the lockdown, but proved to be resilient and was growing again by August 2020.  By the end of 2020, we were experiencing double-digit growth, but most of this growth was catch-up growth from the Q2 GDP drop.\n2. A couple of things happened as a result of people working from home (or in some cases, not working) for an extended period.  First, a significant number of people decided that they liked working from home, or not working at all.  Second, a significant number of people decided that they needed more space, so they took their newfound freedom and fled to the suburbs or the country.  People relocating, along with low-interest rates caused a housing shortage in high-demand areas.  \n3. Unemployment peaked at over 10% in Q2 of 2020.  Today, the unemployment rate is less than 4% or essentially, \"full employment\".  Employers who aren't willing or able to raise wages are seeing their employees leave in droves.  For the first time in decades, employees now have the upper hand over their employers.  Even with wages rising, labor participation is very low, causing output drops, trucking bottlenecks, and shipping delays.  Couple that with Asia still not being fully opened, and it has caused massive supply shortages.  Supply shortages + easy monetary policy + QE = inflation.\n4. I think there is a chance that Powell was right the first time when he said that inflation was transitory, his timing was just off.  Bond yields are rising rapidly, with the market already pricing in future rate hikes.  As the world reopens, that will mean greater output in the worldwide supply chain.  The supply chain crisis may take several years to fully heal, but I think we will likely start seeing some improvement by the end of this year.  The rate hikes are going to slow demand, but keep in mind that the world is still opening which means growth.  Ultimately, stocks trade on growth and the anticipation of growth.  Stocks don't like rate hikes because higher interest rates slow growth, but we now have two diametrically opposed forces; a world economy that is reopening (growth) and higher interest rates (slower growth).  Right now the market is only focusing on inflation and higher rates, but as the supply chain heals, it will ease pressure on prices.  Once the market senses inflation leveling out, it will focus on overall growth, which I think will be above trend for several years as the world adjusts to post-COVID.\n\nAll of that to say, I think there is a path for stocks to start appreciating again this year.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I've sold all but MSFT. \n\nDecided to buy some long term stocks a few weeks ago and everything has been red ever since.

{"title": "Twitter Re-examines Elon Musk’s Bid, May Be More Receptive to a Deal", "selftext": "TL;DR: Twitter Inc. is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid. Two sides are meeting Sunday to discuss takeover bid, people familiar with the matter say. Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner.\n\nUpdate: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ub3qbp/twitter\\_under\\_shareholder\\_pressure\\_to\\_seek\\_deal/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ub3qbp/twitter_under_shareholder_pressure_to_seek_deal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-re-examines-elon-musks-bid-may-be-more-receptive-to-a-deal-11650822932?st=b1weshzy0hvq8ey&reflink=article_copyURL_share) \\- Twit­ter Inc. is re-ex­am­in­ing Elon Musk’s $43 bil­lion takeover of­fer af­ter the bil­lion­aire lined up fi­nanc­ing for the bid, in a sign the so­cial-me­dia com­pany could be more re­cep­tive to a deal.\n\nTwit­ter had been ex­pected to re­buff the of­fer, which Mr. Musk made ear­lier this month with­out say­ing how he would pay for it. But af­ter he dis­closed last week that he now has $46.5 bil­lion in fi­nanc­ing, Twit­ter is tak­ing a fresh look at the of­fer and is more likely than be­fore to seek to ne­go­ti­ate, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said. The sit­u­a­tion is fast-mov­ing and it is still far from guar­an­teed Twit­ter will do so.\n\nTwit­ter is still work­ing on an all-im­por­tant es­ti­mate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s of­fer, and it could also in­sist on sweet­en­ers such as Mr. Musk agree­ing to cover breakup pro­tec­tions should the deal fall apart, some of the peo­ple said.\n\nThe two sides are meet­ing Sun­day to dis­cuss Mr. Musk’s pro­posal, the peo­ple said.\n\nTwit­ter is ex­pected to weigh in on the bid when it re­ports first-quar­ter earn­ings Thurs­day, if not sooner, the peo­ple said. Twit­ter’s re­sponse won’t nec­es­sar­ily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for invit­ing other bid­ders or ne­go­ti­at­ing with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk re­it­er­ated to Twit­ter’s chair­man Bret Tay­lor in re­cent days that he won’t budge from his of­fer of $54.20-a-share, the peo­ple said.\n\nThe po­ten­tial turn­about on Twit­ter’s part comes af­ter Mr. Musk met pri­vately Fri­day with sev­eral share­hold­ers of the com­pany to ex­tol the virtues of his pro­posal while re­peat­ing that the board has a “yes-or-no” de­ci­sion to make, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech is­sues he sees as plagu­ing the plat­form and the coun­try more broadly, whether his bid suc­ceeds or not, they said.\n\nThe Tesla Inc. chief ex­ec­u­tive made his pitch to se­lect share­hold­ers in a se­ries of video calls, with a fo­cus on ac­tively man­aged funds, the peo­ple said, in hopes that they could sway the com­pa­ny’s de­ci­sion.\n\nMr. Musk said he sees no way Twit­ter man­age­ment can get the stock to his of­fer price on its own, given the is­sues in the busi­ness and a per­sis­tent in­abil­ity to cor­rect them. It couldn’t be learned if he de­tailed spe­cific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about want­ing to re­duce the plat­form’s re­liance on ad­ver­tis­ing, as well as to make sim­pler changes such as al­low­ing longer tweets.\n\nMr. Musk al­ready has some share­hold­ers ral­ly­ing be­hind him fol­low­ing the meet­ings. Lauri Brun­ner, who man­ages Thrivent As­set Man­age­ment LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled op­er­a­tor. “He has an es­tab­lished track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the cat­a­lyst to de­liver strong op­er­at­ing per­for­mance at Twit­ter.” Min­neapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twit­ter worth $160 mil­lion and is also a Tesla share­holder.", "id": "ub0j0g", "created_utc": 1650823609.0, "score": 223, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|3 days ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 days|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ub0j0g)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ub0j0g)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Twitter got a peak at their earnings and said this ain’t it chief. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 224, "replies": [{"body": "Honestly, that's my concern.

If you mention state/government work sites I can tell you from personal experience I never used them except once every two weeks to log on as required by unemployment rules. The government isn’t run efficiently enough to gather data from all the job sites, report it accurately, and on time. I know plenty of people who go straight to employer websites to apply and some employers even still use paper only applications. I do not believe the unemployment numbers are accurate any more than theses companies posting jobs that aren’t really open so they can meet the requirements not to pay back PPP loans.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "the government conducts a monthly survey called the Current Population Survey (CPS) to measure the extent of unemployment in the country. The CPS has been conducted in the United States every month since 1940, when it began as a Work Projects Administration program. In 1942, the U.S. Census Bureau took over responsibility for the CPS. The survey has been expanded and modified several times since then. In 1994, for instance, the CPS underwent a major redesign in order to computerize the interview process as well as to obtain more comprehensive and relevant information.\n\nThere are about 60,000 eligible households in the sample for this survey. This translates into approximately 110,000 individuals each month, a large sample compared to public opinion surveys, which usually cover fewer than 2,000 people. The CPS sample is selected so as to be representative of the entire population of the United States. In order to select the sample, all of the counties and independent cities in the country first are grouped into approximately 2,000 geographic areas (sampling units). The Census Bureau then designs and selects a sample of about 800 of these geographic areas to represent each state and the District of Columbia. The sample is a state-based design and reflects urban and rural areas, different types of industrial and farming areas, and the major geographic divisions of each state.\n\nEvery month, one-fourth of the households in the sample are changed, so that no household is interviewed for more than 4 consecutive months. After a household is interviewed for 4 consecutive months, it leaves the sample for 8 months, and then is again interviewed for the same 4 calendar months a year later, before leaving the sample for good. As a result, approximately 75 percent of the sample remains the same from month to month and 50 percent remains the same from year to year. This procedure strengthens the reliability of estimates of month-to-month and year-to-year change in the data.\n\nEach month, highly trained and experienced Census Bureau employees contact the 60,000 eligible sample households and ask about the labor force activities (jobholding and job seeking) or non-labor force status of the members of these households during the survey reference week (usually the week that includes the 12th of the month). These are live interviews conducted either in person or over the phone. During the first interview of a household, the Census Bureau interviewer prepares a roster of the household members, including key personal characteristics such as age, sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, veteran status, and so on. The information is collected using a computerized questionnaire.\n\nEach person is classified according to their activities during the reference week. Then, the survey responses are \"weighted,\" or adjusted to independent population estimates from the Census Bureau. The weighting takes into account the age, sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, and state of residence of the person, so that these characteristics are reflected in the proper proportions in the final estimates.\n\nA sample is not a total count, and the survey may not produce the same results that would be obtained from interviewing the entire population. But the chances are 90 out of 100 that the monthly estimate of unemployment from the sample is within about 300,000 of the figure obtainable from a total census. Relative to total unemployment—which ranged between about 7 and 15 million over the past decade—the possible error resulting from sampling is not large enough to distort the total unemployment picture.\n\nBecause these interviews are the basic source of data for total unemployment, information must be correct and consistent. Survey respondents are never asked specifically if they are unemployed, nor are they given an opportunity to decide their own labor force status. Their status will be determined based on how they respond to a specific set of questions about their recent activities.\n\nSimilarly, interviewers do not decide the respondents' labor force classification. They simply ask the questions in the prescribed way and record the answers. Based on information collected in the survey and definitions programmed into the computer, individuals are then classified as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force.\n\nAll interviews must follow the same procedures to obtain comparable results. Because of the crucial role interviewers have in the household survey, a considerable amount of time and effort is spent maintaining the quality of their work. Interviewers are given intensive training, including classroom lectures, discussion, practice, observation, home-study materials, and on-the-job training. At least once a year, they attend day-long training and review sessions. Also, at least once a year, they are accompanied by a supervisor during a full day of interviewing to determine how well they carry out their assignments.\n\n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm?msclkid=e8efb654c41611ec85521fc9138bdac0#where", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes officer, this is the bagholder right here\\^.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
