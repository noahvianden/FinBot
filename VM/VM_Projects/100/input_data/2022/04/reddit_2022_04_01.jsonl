Their parks will be fine in the years to come but I can't overlook what my own experience with DIS is telling me. Other than the monthly subscription for Disney+ and a random visit to DW, I see it as a luxury. Vacations are a luxury and so is Disney. Park passes are expensive. Yes the park is great and unique but for most they have to pay for flights, hotels, and a rental car or shuttle. Do you really want to pay all of that to stand in line and get annoyed with people? Sure you get to see a smile on your child's face and create a memory but when the kids are grown up it's rare if they go back to Disney instead of someplace else.\n\nWith the Disney apps and movies, new movies are few and far between and once the kids are older they will watch Disney less and less. It has its time and place but unless you're a die hard Disney fan, the Disney app will be canceled and Disney will be an after thought. [This graphic](https://storage.googleapis.com/titlemax-media/1c8ace8f-every-company-disney-owns-13_pageversion-lg.jpg) really shows how much they own.

{"title": "House approves bill legalizing marijuana", "selftext": "https://thehill.com/news/house/3256370-house-approves-bill-legalizing-marijuana/\n\nThe House passed legislation on Friday to legalize marijuana nationwide and eliminate the longstanding criminal penalties for anyone who distributes or possesses it. \n\nLawmakers passed the bill largely along party lines, 220-204, with three Republicans joining all but two Democrats in support.\n\nThe measure now goes to the Senate, where Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) is working with fellow Democrats to introduce a marijuana legalization bill as soon as this spring.  \n\nBut it’s not clear a bill to broadly legalize marijuana could clear the necessary 60 votes to advance in the Senate.\n\nSchumer may not have enough support within his own Democratic caucus. At least two Democrats who represent states ravaged by the opioid epidemic, Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), have expressed skepticism about the proposal.   \n\nSchumer may not have enough support within his own Democratic caucus. At least two Democrats who represent states ravaged by the opioid epidemic, Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), have expressed skepticism about the proposal. \n\nHouse Democrats previously passed a bill to legalize marijuana in December 2020. But that measure didn’t go anywhere in the Senate, which was still under GOP control at the time.    \n\nThe bill, titled the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, would clear marijuana-related convictions from people’s records and formally remove it from the federal list of controlled substances. \n\nThe legislation would also impose a federal tax on marijuana sales to fund programs aimed at helping communities harmed by the so-called “war on drugs” policies that established harsh punishments for distributing and using drugs.  \n\nThe sales tax would start at 5 percent, and gradually increase to 8 percent over five years. \n\nProponents argued that it’s past time for the federal government to catch up to the majority of states that have legalized marijuana to at least some extent. \n\n“For far too long, we have treated marijuana as a criminal justice problem instead of as a matter of personal choice and public health,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chief sponsor of the bill.  \n\n“If states are the laboratories of democracy, it is long past time for the federal government to recognize that legalization has been a resounding success and the conflict with federal law has become untenable,” Nadler said. \n\nBefore final passage, the House rejected an amendment from Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) to clarify that people can’t be denied security clearances over marijuana use due to 12 Democrats joining all but two Republicans in opposition.\n\nDemocrats further framed the measure as a way to reverse the disproportionate impact of criminalizing marijuana on racial minorities. Black Americans are nearly four times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession despite both races using the drug at roughly the same rate, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. \n\n“Make no mistake. Yes, it is a racial justice bill,” said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), a Congressional Cannabis Caucus co-chair and member of the Congressional Black Caucus. \n\nRepublicans argued that marijuana is enough of a mind-altering substance to pose a threat to society.       \n\n“Record crime, record inflation, record gas prices, record number of illegal immigrants crossing our southern border, and what are Democrats doing today? Legalizing drugs. Legalizing drugs and using American tax dollars to kick start and prop up the marijuana industry. Wow,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. \n\nAt least 37 states, four territories and the District of Columbia allow the use of marijuana for medical use, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. About half that number – 18 states, two territories and the nation’s capital – allow it for non-medical use. \n\nSome Republicans who support legalizing marijuana opposed House Democrats’ bill on Friday, arguing there should have been a more bipartisan approach. \n\nRep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) called for bringing the legislation on the House floor on Friday closer to her own marijuana legalization bill, which would limit marijuana use to people above the age of 21 and establish a lower sales tax that would not rise for ten years. \n\n“I have incentives for states not to sell to kids or market or advertise to kids,” Mace told The Hill. “My tax is a lot lower at 3 percent. Theirs is eight after three years, and we all know that you’re going to guarantee illicit markets if you make taxes too high.” \n\nRep. Dave Joyce (R-Ohio), a Congressional Cannabis Caucus co-chair, wrote in an op-ed for Marijuana Moment, a publication that focuses on marijuana policy, that he would not support the bill on Friday either. \n\n“To responsibly end prohibition, the federal government must simultaneously issue a regulatory framework that works in conjunction with states’ specifics needs. The MORE Act lacks this critical element or any meaningful and immediate regulatory safeguards at all, leaving individual states to sort out issues typically reserved for federal agencies in the interim,” Joyce wrote. \n\nThe House has passed legislation multiple times in the past year to allow legally operating marijuana businesses to access banking services and credit cards, so that they don’t have to be cash-only. So far, nine Senate Republicans have signed on as cosponsors to Sen. Jeff Merkley’s (D-Ore.) companion bill in the upper chamber for more narrow marijuana legalization.", "id": "ttvz3f", "created_utc": 1648833063.0, "score": 706, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 177, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|16|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ttvz3f)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ttvz3f)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't believe it.

It isn't that it confuses me.  It's that I hate it.  Years ago, before the Navy, I was in a rather rough spot financially, living in my car, working three jobs, and just trying my damnedest not to drown.  In order to eat, I would go into restaurants that were closing for the day, and ask them politely to use a clean trash bag for any food they were discarding, so that when I dug it out of the trash it would at least be a decent pile of discarded food.  About 8 out of 10 times they'd just pack up the food and give it to me for free.  About 1 in 10 would use a clean trash bag, often with an apology that rules prevented them from just giving it to me.  The last 1 in 10 would tell me to get a job, kick me out, call the cops, and I would go hungry those nights. \n\nI'm lucky to have two dollars a week to invest.  I've been poorer.  I've been hungry.  I've begged so that I can make ends meet.  Any time I think about marketing, it puts me right back there.  I know its different.  I can look at it logically and say \"this isn't the same, I am providing them something for their money.\"  I just can't help it, it's who I am.  I'll ask for help when I need it, but I can't bring myself to beg for people to try my product, and that's what marketing boils down to, for me.\n\n*please note, I understand that marketing is not a job where you beg.

They are used instead of staircases almost everywhere (I would just say everywhere, but I didn't explore every type of ship, or even ever space in my ship, so I just know it was the only way to change decks for me) to save room, and do a wonderful job at letting people get from one floor to the next.  Until someone slips.  When I slipped, my right leg went forward between two \"rungs\", my left leg when backward into free space, and then 230 pounds of sailor went down with all the force Isaac Newton could calculate.  It shredded every ligament, tendon, muscle, pretty much the only thing holding the top half of my right leg to the bottom was my skin.  Jacked me right up.  Went through Navy surgery to get it fixed, surgery was overwhelmingly \"meh\", and I became a devout advocate of not letting the government touch health care.  😀 \n\nAs for schooling, I have an entirely redundant amount of schooling in electronics.  Went to a technical school for 4 years instead of a high school, went to college for a BS degree for it, joined the Navy (enlisted instead of officer, reasons described below) where they trained me for 2 additional years, when the Navy gave me the medical boot they then sent me for another BS (in the same thing) to ITT technical institute, which was then closed by that same government my last semester, they disallowed transfer credits, so they put me back through that same program one last time at a different school.\n\nAs for why I went enlisted instead of officer, when I joined the Enlisted side had a student loan repayment program where you waived your enlistment bonus (17k at the time for my rate) in favor of complete student loan forgiveness (at the time 80k.)  There was also a 2 week wait for enlisted, 8 months for officer.  When I joined I was already in the state of financial hardship I described above, so getting in quickly was very important, coupled with the waiving of 80k in student loans, it was a no brainer.  But then my recruiter misfiled paperwork, and the loan \"magically\" didn't get paid.  They did have the paper showing I chose to waive the 17k enlistment bonus, so I didn't get that, but in the eyes of Uncle Sam I was just so Gung ho Navy I wanted to do it for free.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry to hear that bro.

Let alone browse wsb??", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I answered a similar question, but I've no qualms with answering again.  I was in the Navy for a while and ended up getting injured on the job.  They have a policy of \"we break it, we buy it\", so they cover most of my expenses to exist in perpetuity, so long as I don't spend any money on anything that isn't a bill.  If I want to do something that costs money, be it go to Starbucks or grab some avocado toast, I need to save up to do so.  My budget does allow for about $2 a week in play money though.  I would very much like my financial situation to change.  I don't need to be rich, don't want a yacht, fat checking account, cool car, new shoes, etc., my tastes are very cheap, I'd just like to be debt free, so that the money going towards debts becomes my new \"fun\" money.  So a while back I thought about putting that two dollars a week towards lotto tickets.  But I couldn't get passed the statistical unlikelihood of anything ever changing (I may or may not be a bit of a math nerd).  I figured two bucks every now and then spent in stocks would only be a complete loss if a company went bankrupt, as I'm fine with waiting out dips, and the two dollars was going to go to lotto tickets that won nothing anyway, so worst case scenario I am in the exact same boat, especially since I don't mess with options or any of that \"potentially lose more than you invest\" stuff.  A couple dollars became a couple more dollars, and right after GME happened I took a gamble and switched everything (mostly penny stocks, legit penny, not just \"under $5\") to buy a handful of AMC stock.  I waited a few days, and backed out early to avoid missing the peak.  This left me with a couple hundred dollars to either get out of the market and blow on one extravagant (for me) purchase like a new video game, some books, or a nice dinner, or I could reinvest it and hope to earn enough to pay off my debt and be done with it.  \n\nI decided to stick to the original plan, and am trying my best to find good things to invest in that are actually cost efficient.  Buying one share with all of that money in something like Tesla is pretty much a guaranteed return, sure, but if you buy a stock for $200 and it spikes up to even $250, you only earn another $50.  If I instead spent that money on stocks for $20 a share, or even better, $2 a share, if they go up eveb just $10 dollars, I've earned at least double what Tesla's $50 would have got me.  So I keep my investments in cheaper stocks that seem like they are about to spike upward, make a few dollars here and there off of a few cents raised, and keep an eye out for the next GME.  As is, I need about a 10,000% increase total to be debt free (factoring taxes into play) so I am trying to be realistic and not plan on that being anytime soon, but it's a dream that I am trying to implement realistically, and so far, I have been moving in the right direction.\n\nFor any reading this that want to help, I have like 6k shares in stock called GTLL.  It's OTC (won't do that again, $7 to buy cuts into profits hard when you are manipulating pennies, lesson learned).  So if you all could just invest millions into them until their stock becomes worth about $80 a share, it'd be appreciated 😀   if it helps, they are in the process of buying Tersus Tech (trades about 50 cents a share) and doing a share transfer to their stock, which *should* drive their price up on its own to at least half of that, and since it is currently less than a penny a share, jumping to even a five cents a share is a pretty drastic increase, depending on how much stock you have.  Those with 20k to invest could turn that into 100k (if it stops rising at a nickle) and are likely far less concerned with the $7 buy fee.  If not, that's okay to.
