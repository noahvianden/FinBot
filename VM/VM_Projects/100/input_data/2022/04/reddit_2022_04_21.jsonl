You have to apply for a PoS .\n\nOf course, at the beginning of all these, people is not willing to give their credit card information to untrusted online sellers unless they received the goods.\n\nSo, Alipay is free, easy to setup, you can accepting payment from anyone very quickly.

But after that, the speed of innovation slows down. They kind of stuck once they pushed new products to market.\n\nChinese market, however, is terrible at a pivot type of innovation.

{"title": "Tech Stocks Are Absurdly Cheap Now: putting my money where my mouth is", "selftext": "Buckle in.\n\nInvesting isn't easy, and yet people are--and always will--try to act like it is. Just like every other period in stock market history, retail 'investors' are being lazy and emotional and valuing businesses based off the direction their prices are heading rather than long term fundamentals. Volatility is the price you pay for performance. Thinking it's time to sell tech and buy Kellogg, with corporate profits RISING, will get you into deep trouble. \n\nNo, being a good investor has absolutely nothing to do with being 'contrarian'. It just so happens that retail is too lazy and emotional to notice that prices tend to head fake away from where people should be buying at any given timeframe. Sometimes these head fakes point to different asset classes, other times to different assets within any given class. \n\nRight now, it's both. \n\nPeople think tech is in 2001 territory strictly because of price action, when we are in literally the opposite place outside a handful of overvalued and overhyped names; and people think bond yields are becoming attractive, when bonds are in the worst bear market in years (though this could change at any time considering the overreaction we've seen in Fed rate predictions). **This is precisely when you should be buying reasonably priced tech with strong cash flows, pricing power, quality earnings growth, barriers to entry (either a difficult industry to break into or an outright moat, which is very rare and hard to predict but** ***Facebook has one*****), network effects, and demand inelasticity.** Your stocks don't have to have all of these elements, but the more, the merrier. \n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Here's some oversimplified but VERY true deductive reasoning that 99% of 'investors' fail to heed:**\n\n\\-Companies with higher earnings growth deserve higher valuations  \n\\-Companies with better pricing power deserve higher valuations  \n\\-Companies with higher quality earnings growth deserve higher valuations  \n\\-Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into  \n\\-Proctor & Gamble has a 40% higher relative valuation than Netflix  \n\\-CAMPBELL'S SOUP has a higher valuation than Facebook  \n\\-So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'. \n\n**Okay...**\n\n\\-Corporate profits drive stock prices--literally in lock step--over the long run  \n\\-Inflation is good for corporate profits  \n\\-Inflation requires higher interest rates  \n\\-Higher interest rates are a headwind for stocks  \n\\-Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS  \n\\-Holding cash *is basically taking a financial gun and pointing it at your face and pulling the trigger*  \n\\-The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.\n\n**Millions of retail investors are absolutely convinced that tech is overvalued--but it's not because of poor fundamentals. Honestly, it's not even because of inflation, interested rates, or Ukraine. It's simply because prices are going down.** Do yourself a favor. Look at sentiment from one year ago today. Facebook to $600 was a done deal. Netflix was overpriced, and I wouldn't have bought it at near $700, but if anyone thought we would be below $230, we'd be minting new billionaires by the second because of their OTM puts. Amazon is more underpriced than I've maybe ever seen based off what we can easily see (the market has never understood Amazon, and AWS ALONE is clearly a multitrillion dollar valuation by 2030). \n\n**FACTS:**\n\n\\-**Amazon** PE is lowest ever while its future core businesses--AWS and ads (they are doing more ad revenue than YOUTUBE now, and AWS brings in more profit than any business line now, so if you think Amazon is a retail business you should be buying index funds...)--are growing at 40% or more.   \n\\-**Facebook** PE is lowest ever--last time this happened was three years ago, their stock price crashed to $131, and with this incredible overreaction they're STILL up 54% since then.   \n\\-And now to my favorite part: **Netflix** is at its lowest valuation since the 2000s and perhaps ever--who cares before then, it wasn't Netflix, it was a frickin' mail-order DVD company. Its PEG is .84. Its earnings have plateaued on SEVERAL occasions only to leap, over and over again. Just like Facebook, they were bound to hit a plateau for their core use base at some point. But if you think that means they're done growing out earnings--not to mention expanding other business lines, like Amazon did with AWS and ads, and Microsoft did with Azure--you need to ask yourself whether you have enough knowledge and experience here. \n\nIn a way, investing really isn't that hard. **You just have to actually buy businesses and not obsess over the value of your portfolio every day**. If you do that, you're smart enough to see that tech could fall another 30% right now--and it would only present an even better buying opportunity with even more upside. As Buffett said after 2008, he might've been early, but he still got rich. And trust me, buying now might be early, but it will be INSANELY lucrative. \n\nSO SO SO many companies are just dirt cheap. People think DropBox is a shitty cloud business, when its top line is growing double digits and they're priced like Campbell's f'kn Soup. People think GoPro is a shitty camera business when it has begun adding software with INCREDIBLE margins and is growing rapidly again. Upstart is literally the only company in the market with the triple crown--triple digit growth, massively profitable, and BUYING BACK STOCK--yet its price was cut by 80%. There are just so many tech companies getting caught up in this indiscriminate selling, as if they're DoorDash or Rivian or Nikola or Snowflake, or any of the incredibly overpriced businesses, good or bad, that deserved to be cut in half.  \n\nPeople calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was. This is the literal opposite of the tech bubble. We have companies with tens of billions in FCF being repriced as if they're going out of business. Earnings are GROWING. We are in a BOOM cycle--IN TECH. You are being fooled--AGAIN. During the tech bubble, it's not that companies weren't making money...**THEY WEREN'T EVEN BRINGING IN REVENUE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE?** Not even the most overvalued companies today (aside from Rivian and Nikola) can attest to such an atrocity. \n\nI pity the people who need to see instant green in their portfolios, and I hope to see your sea of !Remind Me! posts for five to ten years from now. **For those of you who take anything away from this post, here's putting my money where my mouth is:**\n\nHere's my portfolio weighted by notional impact--i.e. ITM calls carry more leverage despite moving the same amount as 100 shares of a stock, or ATM short puts I've written to buy at a lower cost basis or just hold the premium. (**I plan on opening a Netflix position at some point soon.**)\n\n**$UPST:** **16.9%** (Pretty much the perfect stock: AI lending company that's barely unaffected by rates and loan origination volume; already profitable by a mile; reinvesting capital into massive TAMs; and already has permission from the board to buy back stock. Hope you don't judge a stock by its PE because that's how you miss pretty much every single winner, from Amazon to Salesforce to Netflix.)  \n**$CIM:** **7.7%** (Retracing like a tech stock right now with fortress balance sheet and 12% dividend yield--and climbing. Chimera did even better following the pandemic after cutting its dividend yield, which made for the perfect time to buy.)  \n**$OSTK:** **7.54%** (Retail furniture business that's stealing market share from Wayfair and growing rapidly yet with a stock price selling as if it's going out of business--oh yeah, and they've got Medici Ventures, which is priced at zero.)  \n**$Z: 6.56%** (Vertically integrated media business of which people seem to have zero understanding. It's literally in the best shape it's ever been: shed of its worst business segment and raising capital from home inventory; growing at over 20%; and selling at a 75%+ discount...yet people hate it infinitely more than when it was up near $200...LOL)  \n**$AMZN: 5.97%** (Enough said above. This is a multitrillion dollar business that checks every box listed above selling at less than half its true value.)   \n**$APPS:** **5.25%** (Growing triple digits, profitable, and with insane barriers to entry--not quite Upstart, but this is a 5x play.)  \n**$URI:** **5.12%** (Picks and shovels play for infrastructure boom ahead. Someone will pass a version of build back better, and this company is a gem even without government subsidy. Also, United Rentals helps balance out my insanely tech-weighted portfolio just a tad bit, though that's not at all why I bought it--because I could care less how much money I lose in the short term to maximize long term gains.)  \n**$FB:** **5.2%** (The greatest network company of all time--a company whose business model will never be repeated--is trading at a multiple 7% lower than the Campbell f'kin Soup Company. Enough said.)  \n**$CLSK:** **4.71%** (One of the fastest growing companies in the world; already profitable; ESG sustainable Bitcoin miner; QUADRUPLE DIGIT GROWTH on the top line; trading at a SINGLE DIGIT forward PE--crashing as if both they and Bitcoin are going to zero.)  \n**$STNE:** **4.37%** (A big boo-boo in their long book and concerns about the Brazilian economy are apparently enough to crash the stock over 90%. Like several other stocks on this list, earnings give a HUGE temporary boost because of how incredibly strong they are, only to watch the gains wither away because of indiscriminate selling in the tech space.)  \n**$AMAT: 3.14%** (Picks and shovels play for the semiconductor bull market that will last for decades to come. Probably the only company on this list that I'd call fairly valued, but it's such a great company it's worth every penny.)  \n**$PLTR: 3.09%** (It's apparently fun to hate Palantir because it was a meme stock. But if you can do math, 30% compound interest for 10 years does not a meme stock make. Probably the only stock on this list that I might even call *over*priced, but I also think it's worth every penny with a smaller position.)  \n**$AMD: 2.97%** (Trading as if China is going to invade, tear down TSM, collapse the market for chips, and send interest rates to 50%. Beyond idiotically cheap.)  \n**$MU: 2.85%** (Micron's pricing power is unmatched in this industry. Very few companies do what they do and none do it as well--and they're trading for pennies on the dollar.)  \n**$DBX: 2.66%** (Apparently it's cool to hate Drew Houston? I don't know, but in addition to what was mentioned above, this company is set to buy back half it's MFing float. Like, are you kidding me?)  \n**$NVDA: 2.61%** (Only reason I don't have a bigger allocation is because NVIDIA puts my total semi allocation at around 9%. I also owned Intel for a hot second before I rolled it into other plays. Think The whole space is going to continue to skyrocket, but no one has the creativity or talent that NVIDIA does.)  \n**$BNTX: 2.6%** (The market thinks that this company stumbled upon vaccines, that covid is ending tomorrow, and that they have no other pipeline. The reality is that BioNTech is set to sell billions more in vaccines for a long time coming, and all of this is an incredibly massive tailwind to their rare diseases pipeline.)  \n**$WBD: 2.22%** (It's always funny when some jackoff at BoA comes out with a report about how the merger between Discovery and Warner Brothers will create synergies that make this a $45 stock--6 months after the deal is announced. The stock rocketed above $30, then was indiscriminately sold off back to where it started--for no reason. The market is so efficient.)  \n**$GPRO: 2.2%** (As mentioned above, this has become a software company with total control over its market and prices. 96% of action cameras in America are GoPros. The recurring revenue on that software makes this at least a $30 stock. But nobody wants to own it because RemEmBEr tHat TiME WheN iT SolD OfF?)  \n**$NOK: 2.1%** (5G is them and some other guy. Enough said.)  \n**$CRM: 1.81%** (This company does not stop growing. One of the best companies in the world and there is no end in sight. Personally think the Slack purchase is being totally swept under the rug. It's just that time of the cycle when you're supposed to doubt Benioff.)  \n**$NLST: 1.33%** (Very unknown memory company with massive lawsuits against a bevy of huge companies and great prospects outside those lawsuits. They settled the lawsuit with SK Hynix and still have pending cases for patent infringement against the likes of Samsung, Micron, and Google--all of which are entirely legitimate.)  \n**$AMRS: 0.8%** (A deep future play for molecules-as-a-function. This one is very nuanced and I'm getting tired of writing. You'd have to look into this one yourself to truly understand the importance of synthetic, sustainable molecules used in the place of limited and/or endangered organics at far cheaper prices across the cost spectrum.)  \n**$SFT: 0.29%** (Kind of a random little lottery bet on a company with a market cap lower than its fourth quarter revenue alone. But with no path to profitability in sight, that's all it is: a lottery ticket with a VERY small amount of AUM allocated.) \n\n*It's not possible to create a perfect weighting with options in your portfolio, especially short puts, but I've done the best I can. For example, notionally, I could be tied to even more* ***Upstart*** *than I've represented here. But Upstart would have to be ITM across three separate strikes (70, 80, and 100) by January 2023, which nobody can predict. (What I can say is that anything under $100 is DIRT cheap for Upstart, so I'm more than happy to own it at about $51, $55, and $66, which would be the breakeven prices at each strike, respectively, when including the outrageous premium I was paid for writing these puts.) I split the notional values of being assigned each put in half to represent the fact that Upstart is currently ITM for my 100 puts, ATM for the 80, and OTM for 70. Arbitrary, but so is anything in this case, even if you'd use Black Scholes somehow.*", "id": "u8fb6r", "created_utc": 1650515580.0, "score": 926, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 584, "comments": [{"body": "Geeze!

They're inversely related to interest rates - so with the expectation interest rates are going to increase, their prices fall. Obviously. This means that Coupon Rates have to increase - or you can buy Bonds when you think Interest Rate Increases are priced in. Then, wait for the next round of Interest Rate Decreases and sell them for a profit. So, yeah... Bonds are fairly attractive right now....\n\n>Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into\n\nYes, Netflix, a company that lost 200,000 Subscribers - the first time it's lost subscribers in 10 Years - is obviously a growth company. Facebook faces incredibly political headwinds and it's growth is slowing. You can be optimistic about its push into the Metaverse - but their core business model is stalling. You'd have to look at their other operations. But, again, biggest factor is regulation for Facebook.\n\n>So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'.\n\nUh... Yeah... Interest rates signal contractionary macroeconomic policy - literally reducing aggregate demand and curtailing investment spending. It is a signal that the macroeconomy is overheating and a general pullback is needed. This means Consumer Staples are considered a relative safe place to put money - because they are generally Recession Proof.\n\n>Inflation is good for corporate profitsInflation requires higher interest rates\n\nInflation is temporarily good for corporate profits - but it also depends on what kind of inflation. Demand Pull inflation is good, Cost Push inflation is bad. The overwhelming majority of inflation is Cost Push which is terrible for margins. Corporate Profits are a lagging indicator and what you really need to look at going forward are Profit Margins. You should be expecting them to shrink as Input Costs continue to increase.\n\nHigher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS\n\nI already commented on this - they're terrible if you already owned Bonds which is why people are selling them. They're attractive once the market incorporates Interest Rate Expectations. Once you feel the Bond Market has priced in expected Interest Rate Hikes they would be a great buy since you'll get a high Coupon Rate and also can sell them in the future during the next Easing Cycle\n\nThe answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.\n\nWhich.... would be Consumer Staples....\n\n>People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was.\n\nGrowth Companies rely on Consumer Discretionary and Easy Liquidity to finance expansion and growth - both of which are drying up fast. I'm not going to go into every company you mentioned, but when inflation is high, there is contractionary monetary policy, and real wages are shrinking, there is no reason to expect Consumer Discretionary will do well. If your real wages are shrinking and you need to spend more money on Consumer Staples (Groceries, Toiletries, Gasoline) you have less money to spend on things you'd normally get from Amazon. You're more likely to cancel your Netflix Account and spend that extra $15 on gas or something else.\n\nTL;DR - Not going to respond to every point, but you're missing the mark completely.\n\n\\--------------------\n\n***Edit***: Just want to point out that The Fed just said a 50 Basis Point Hike is on the table and equities fell on this news.

Binging the same shows over and over, 3/4 times on someone else's account, and now a bunch of the big binge shows are gone to other streaming services. Friends is gone. The Office is gone. Parks and Rec is gone. How I Met Your Mother is gone. Family Guy, American Dad, and Futurama are all gone. The rest watch it for Originals (since Netflix is losing IPs left and right) and even those are a total miss way too much, with a hit only every now and then. And if it **is** good, odds are Netflix will cancel it because they just don't know how to read the goddamn room. Almost every other streaming service has better content with lower prices. Like Jesus, look at Disney+. The catalogue is stacked with best sellers, classics, and record breakers, plus it's cheaper, without that \"How many screens are you using?\" BS. It's literally better in every way.\n\nI really feel like I shouldn't have to say all this but Jesus OP trying to argue Netflix is a good buy because it's PE is the lowest it's been since before it was popular is like the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

This is the basis of any discounted cash flow model (yes I‚Äôm aware analysts will also use comp models, LBOs, etc. but they ALL use DCF and this is the basis for essentially every analysis)\n\n1 - expected cash flows: you mentioned a few times that various companies have rising earnings and strengthening cash flows. While this is obviously good, the reason we are seeing the stock price fall now is because they were using these very strong growth precedents as the expectations. Analysts now have good reason to believe that won‚Äôt be the case any longer. So the DCF models are adjusted and valuations go down.\n\n2 - WACC: the WACC or discount rate is made of 2 components. Cost of debt and cost of equity. Cost of debt is going up, I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain to you why. Cost of equity is a bit more complicated, but one of the factors here is the risk free rate of return. Given that T bills are rising in return, that component is increased. Another factor is risk. As the risk of companies increases so does the cost of equity because investors want a discount for more risk. Given that tech stocks did not previously have a significant discount, this means we can assume investors expected high returns. Now that high returns are less likely, investors have increased their discount requirements.\n\nThese two factors combine give our equation a smaller numerator and a larger denominator, and thus a much smaller final valuation. For these stocks to now be discounted you have to believe that cash flows will not substantially decrease, but that they will also increase enough to overcome the larger cost and risk.\n\nTLDR: stocks declined because EXPECTATIONS (not performance) declined, and the cost/risk increased.

{"title": "On Tesla's valuation (Part Deux)", "selftext": "Five months ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/), breaking down Tesla's hotly debated valuation to determine whether it's really as cheap as Tesla bulls say, or as expensive as most of the rest of the sub thinks it is.\n\nAfter yesterday's earnings report, it seems like my analysis has already been proven incorrect, and I felt it would be worth having another look at it.\n\nFor those who don't like reading, I will again explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to \"The Numbers\"\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The method**\n\nWhile trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might rise slightly higher today, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The trends**\n\nIn terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my last analysis. After Q1, that has grown to $62,190M, with Q1 being a 87% YoY increase.\n\nIn terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q1, that has grown to 19.2%, equalling market leader Ferrari.\n\nIn terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. After Q1, this has grown to $8,399M, with Q1 being a 658% YoY increased.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The future**\n\nLast time, I said the following:\n\n> Obviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.\n\nWe have now seen that not only did the opening of Giga Texas and Berlin not compress margins, margins even increased by 30% or 4,500 basis points from 14.7% to 19.2% during this quarter. This was highly unexpected and very bullish for Tesla's future expansion in my opinion.\n\nI also said:\n\n> That said, these two new factories are each larger than their two current factories combined and are much more efficiently spaced. Additionally, they will be using new technologies like the front and rear underbody gigacasting which should increase margins by quite a bit. On top of that, the percentage of sales that are Model 3's (their cheapest car) will decline as they scale up Model Y at these new factories and reintroduce the refreshed Model S and X, so ASPs should increase.\n\nWhile we have yet to see the impact on margins (only about a thousand cars from Berlin were sold in Q1 and none from Texas), it has been confirmed that Berlin is using the single-piece casted front and rear underbody, as is Texas. Texas is also already using the structural battery pack.\n\nThen I said:\n\n> In terms of future sales, Tesla produced 237,823 cars in Q3. Annualized that gives a current run rate of 950,000 cars. Tesla has announced that they will scale up both their existing factories and start to ramp up both new factories by end of this year. Giga Shanghai ramped up with 300,000 units per year, so assuming Giga Texas and Berlin will ramp up with at least an equal amount, they should be doing 600,000 in 2022, 1,200,000 in 2023 and 1,800,000 in 2024.\n\nI think this number for Texas and Berlin in 2022 proved a little optimistic, given the currently supply chain shortages. Texas and Berlin are currently rumoured to have a run rate of 13,000 per quarter each and are expected to start meaningfully contributing to production in Q3. As such, I would lower my estimate to ~400,000 from Texas and Berlin this year.\n\nThat said, Tesla expects the full ramp-up of Texas and Berlin to happen faster than it did for Shanghai. As such, I'd expect around 1,4M in 2023 and 2M+ in 2024 from Texas and Berlin. Additionally, Shanghai has continued to ramp up and is now approaching a run rate of 900,000 by itself, while Fremont is still around a 500,000 run rate.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The numbers**\n\nPutting all of the information from the previous section together, I had created a worst and a best case scenario for Tesla's numbers through 2024; however, after Q1 Tesla has already significantly surpassed my best case scenarios. Below, I will update my Best Case scenarios while leaving the Worst Case untouched. While I do think the likelihood of the Worst Case occurring has decreased significantly, it is still a small possibility.\n\n**Sales**\n\n||Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|1,400,000|1,700,000|1,900,000|\n|**2023**|2,000,000|2,700,000|3,000,000|\n|**2024**|2,600,000|3,300,000|3,700,000|\n\n**ASP**\n\nLast time I mentioned ASPs would likely increase, but chose to keep them the same as in Q3 2022 at $50,000 to be conservative. After Q1, we know that ASPs did in fact increase significantly, to ~$55,000. With recent price changes in Q1 and continuing strong demand, I expect these to continue to increase to ~$60,000 by 2024.\n\n\n**Revenue**\n\nUpdating the higher ASPs ($55K for 2022, $57.5K for 2023 and $60K for 2024) and delivery projections into a new worst and best case gives us the following numbers:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$70B|$77B|$85B|$105B|\n|**2023**|$100B|$115B|$135B|$173B|\n|**2024**|$130B|$156B|$165B|$222B|\n\n**Operating Margin**\n\nLast time I said:\n\n> Because of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.\n\nThis is where I was most wrong by far. After Q1, Tesla showed an operating margin of a staggering 19.2%. This already surpassed my best case scenario for 2023. As I don't see margins decreasing throughout the rest of 2022, I will need to significantly increase my expectations for both the worst and best cases:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|14%|19%|14%|22%|\n|**2023**|15%|20%|18%|26%|\n|**2024**|16%|21%|20%|30%|\n\n**Net Income**\n\nMultiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$9,8B|$14.6B|$11,9B|$22.1B|\n|**2023**|$15,0B|$23B|$24,3B|$45.0B|\n|**2024**|$20,8B|$32B|$33,0B|$66.6B|\n\n**P/E**\n\nDividing our $1T market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:\n\n||Previous Worst Case|New Worst Case|Previous Best Case|New Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|102|68|84|45|\n|**2023**|67|43|41|22|\n|**2024**|48|31|30|15|\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The conclusion**\n\nAfter Q3, using the $1T market cap I expected Tesla to be trading at a trailing P/E of between 30 and 48 by the end of 2024. Only two quarters later, Tesla was able to beat the expectations (of what some would consider a \"delusional Tesla bull\") by such a large amount, that my new expectations are for it to be trading at a PE of between 15 and 31 by 2024 should the market cap stay flat at $1T.\n\nDepending on which scenario plays out (best or worst case) and what you think is a fair valuation for a company growing revenue and margins as quickly as Tesla is, the stock now only has between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is how, even in the worst case scenario, Tesla will become the most profitable automaker in the world by 2023 ($23B in net income compared to Toyota's $21B). In the best case, they will do more in net income by 2024 than all other automakers combined and more than Apple did until last year.\n\nSo to reiterate, the popular sentiment that \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" is false.\n\n**Important side note**\n\nFor simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business, as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder) as well as AI (Tesla Bot), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid \"FSD doesn't exist\", \"energy is a scam\" and \"the Bot will never work\" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.\n\n**TL;DR:** Tesla managed to beat all expectations by such an insane margin that based on the current trends, they now only have between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in when looking purely at their automotive sales.", "id": "u8ka1h", "created_utc": 1650536252.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "when your competition pays for your ads, and just pays you lmao", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla is the bully.

It would seem like someone would be able to do good margins and good volume and be a profitable company. Or failing that at least be consistent and steady and unleveraged on average.\n\nBut the global auto market looks like it's cut throat, with tiny margins, and is barely scrapping by in the periods between one crisis and the next crisis. There's some brands that can charge good margins, but they have real problems scaling that up. The most reliable segment for long term profits over the last couple decades has been luxury SUVs, but even there over investing in that segment caused serious problems for major players when there was an economic downturn and consumer preferences shifted in the short term.\n\nAt first glance, it would seem like EVs are a godsend for the incumbents, they get to sell a whole new kind of car to all their existing customers. And would hopefully be able to get some subsidies to do it, or at the very least get out from underneath increasingly stringent emissions regulations. \n\nBut basically no major incumbent is embracing EVs as an answer to their long term problems. For a long time they barely made any, just enough to meet minimum compliance needs. And even now they're not investing nearly enough to capture decent market share, while still relying heavily on segments that are going to be problematic long term (mostly SUVs).\n\nAnd when you dig in to their balance sheets, it starts to make sense. They make a huge amount of money selling parts for the existing fleet of installed vehicles. If they push out new cars, that are much less complicated and much more reliable, to replace the aging installed base, their parts sales profits are going to disappear. It will be incredibly hard to fund a transition to new products if they're losing short term profits from high margin vehicles, and also cutting off a steady supply of long term profits from parts. The only real option is to dive in completely and commit to the new market, and it doesn't seem like anyone is willing to make that jump?\n\nPart of the issue might be that most automakers also rely on financing to make money. They're basically banks that also sell cars, and I'm sure that creates a very difficult management structure, especially if you need to convince everyone to make a huge commitment to new a new engineering and manufacturing model.\n\nIt's kind of like how [airlines basically became banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUduBmvQ_4) and rely on loyalty programs to make any real profit.

He's mentioned \"free speech\" as his reasoning to garner support from the public even though this doesn't apply to private platforms.

The people that run Tesla are some of the smartest, craziest, most gifted, most outside-the-box thinkers in the world. They are really doing exactly what they say they will do. Everything they are doing is so smart, logical, and they are constantly eliminating as much corporate/procedural manufacturing bullshit as possible.\n\nAnd thinking about it - I always question myself, is the lounge a giant circle-jerk/echo chamber, are we just all amping each other up on bullshit and fantasies?

With the robotaxi, maybe 5-10x lower cost per mile. It's really quite substantial. Looking at some of our projections, it would appear that a robotaxi ride will cost less than a subsidized bus/subway ticket.\n\nWith a 250wh/mi efficiency and cheap electricity, the energy cost per mile is gonna be like 2.5¬¢.

A reduction of 5-10x gives a range of 4.3¬¢ to 19.2¬¢ per mile. Tesla could absolutely charge 20¬¢ a mile all day every day, profiting 10¬¢ per mile. I think they can and will charge a lot more than this for a long time.\n\nFun lazy math time, with what I think are conservative numbers. 1 million robotaxis produced total from 4 gigafactories in a year. Each robotaxi generates $25,000 in profit over its lifetime. Every milllion robotaxis produced is $25 billion in profits. Need to build a spreadsheet to play around with these numbers.\n\nSide note: what do you do with the Robotaxis that have 500k miles and 5 years on them? Do you build them such that they can be stripped and recycled very easily? I feel like interior needs to be designed to be changed out easily due to wear and tear.

So Musk would lose a couple billion, assuming he cashed out his shares and gave up the takeover. But it would transform Twitter from a social media company to a cash holding company that has about 15% of its value tied up in an unprofitable social media company. And that's assuming that the stock price doesn't tank immediately (which seems likely) and that shareholder are willing to invest the cash to carry it out.\n\nMost likely it would destroy the company to prevent Musk from buying it, or even owning 15% of it. I suspect it would lead to a shareholder revolt, firing the board and massive investment losses by anyone who's currently invested. \n\nIt's a great strategy if you're fighting off a hostile takeover from a private equity firm that wants to \"strip and flip\" the company to make a tidy little return. It doesn't seem like an effective defense against someone who has no economic incentive and is just interested in making the company more open and transparent.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "No idea, but maybe he can get that poisoned pill removed with shareholder support?

{"title": "DD - $AMZN 2500 PUTS 4/29", "selftext": "Amazon will tank on earnings due to 7 factors:\n\n1. Price increase announced in February 16\n2. Amazon stock buyback/split announced March 9, 2022\n3. Amazon 5% fuel/inflation surcharge announced April 13\n4. $JBHT last mile logistics company Q1 results\n5. Valuation/growth issues\n6. Competition hitting inflection point\n7. $UPS earnings 4/26 TBD\n\n\n\n1 - Amazon announced a price increase which reflects that internally they are seeing increases costs and likely new member stagnation. Market has likely reached saturation like $NFLX reached.\n\n2 - This is a gambit to create short term hype. If you review FY21 financials they generate no free cash flow (cash from ops - capex - stock based comp). A $10 billion buyback ONLY keeps their share count flat at best. It does not reduce it. (509k -503k = 6k. 6k / 503k = 1.2% dilution. 1.2% dilution on 1.6 trillion market cap means it requires almost $20 billion free cash flow to buyback the stock comp. We know stock split means nothing in reality but it's used to pump up the market on your company.\n\n3 - This is weird that it came out about a month and change after quarter end. Seems like management/board received draft financials and didn't like what they saw. A 5% surcharge is their \"fix\" for future quarters.\n\n4 - $JBHT just had earnings with 33% revenue growth and huge earnings growth. Except ALL of that earnings growth is because they charge a fuel surcharge. Without it they had lower earnings than 2021.\n\n5 - The valuation for a company growing operating cash flow 10-15% would be in the 20x -25x normally. This company hides the fact that they can't create real cash flow using stock based comp and they are granting so much that they now can't buy enough back to even stay at 0 dilution. We may see Amazon only grow high single digits (inflation rate) and the premium does not make sense. Same issue as Netflix.\n\n6 - $TGT, $WMT, $COST and other retailers are doing a much better job of leveraging their local stores with delivery. They can share the delivery price burden with their retail store sales and absorb more costs. TGT is growing at the same revenue year over year as $AMZN as of FY 20 to FY 21.\n\n7 - Watch $UPS earnings to get an idea of how the costs of delivery were in Q1. This will give us more insight into what to expect for $AMZN.\n\nI am risk averse so putting like 1% of my boomer portfolio into $2500 Puts. If I am right I expect a COVID roundtrip back to $2100 by the end of the month. I expect $2400 to be the realistic initial sell-off. At $2400 you make $250-$300 into $10k so risk/reward is there. I will have a few thousand worth. Have $1k so far but will add as we get closer and likely after $UPS earnings.\n\nBiggest risk is that I DO think AWS will continue to do well AND I think capex for AWS may be cheaper than expected (Check GPU/CPU prices dropping everywhere and becoming readily available).\n\nFor chart fiends there is NO volume between $3k and $2400.\n\nFor street cred on financials: My day job is income tax manager for 20+ billion revenue public company.\n\nEdit: 2 new items brought to my attention. They will mark to market their Rivian loss which could trip up the algos that trade on headline #s. Also, $FDX earnings are out and guidance was not good.\n\n2nd Edit: $AMZN just announced they are opening up prime delivery services to 3rd parties. VERY strange timing at midnight on 4/21. Why wouldn't they save this announcement for earnings call next week?", "id": "u8atpk", "created_utc": 1650501189.0, "score": 190, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 163, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 day ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u8atpk)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u8atpk)\n    \nHey /u/Only_Description7812, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You identified the biggest risk correctly. \n\nAWS can single handedly carry $AMZN.", "score": 103, "replies": [{"body": "How bout their Rivian stake which will need to be written down?", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Negligible in the grand scheme of things.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Should be baked in already.

But the only ones willing to meet with us are Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert. At the meeting Mark makes a passionate pitch, but when when we turn to MTG and LB, they look bored and deeply unimpressed. But then they eye each other, smile, and nod.\n\n\"Oh, we can get the republicans to help\" said one.\n\n\"But we need some 'help' from you first\", said the other.\n\nAnd they pass a note to Mark. I don't know how to describe the look that he gave when he was reading it, but for a second I panicked because I legitimacy thought he was going to throw up.

And drove. All the way back to Silicon Valley. I quit federal lobbying for good. I sent Mark my resignation. His only reply was a single word 'received'. I hoped to avoid seeing Mark because it was just too awkward for me. And I think he felt the same because he made no request to see me.\n\nI got a job as a state lobbyist for Cisco. I was in a much better place mentally and emotionally. State politics isn't as crazy as federal, and the capitol at Sacramento was only a 3 hour drive from my clients compared to the half a day travel going to DC.\n\nBut as someone who works in the tech lobbying world, it was only a matter of time before I run into him again, and that time came at the annual silicon valley big tech lobbying social. It's an opulent secret party in an isolated mansion in the Santa Cruz hills, where the top tech companies execs, politicians, and lobbyists meet to establish their secrets channels of favors.\n\nI noticed Mark and he seem to avoid me at first but them he came up to me with a nervous smile. \"I heard you saw my stunt double getting Eiffel towered by MTG and LB. I have a stunt double in DC btw\". And then he looked at me nervously, as if he was unsure if I would believe him. Did Mark think anyone would actually believe this?\n\nBut I humored him 'Oh yes. He looks exactly like you. I thought he was you tbh\". A big wave of relief spread through Mark's face and body.\n\nWe then caught up, and our conversation ended with a job offer to lobby for Facebook once again, at the state level, with a considerable pay increase from my current job.\n\nAround midnight the party was ending and people were starting to trickle out of the party, giddy at the new channels they established. 10 minutes into my drive I realize I left my coat. I go back to get it. By then the mansion was empty but all attendees are given a key card that lasts for 24 hours. I go to the coat room and open the door to find Mark getting double cowgirled by then senator Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi. Mark yells 'I'M THE STUNT DOUB' but I slammed the door before he could finish his sentence.\n\nI forfeited my coat, got in my car, and drove, non-stop, all the way to my hometown of Boulder Colorado. I arrive at my parents house, who were surprised to see me as I didn't tell them I was coming. I went directly to my old room, and slept, for 14 hours straight.

Or if he was taking a poop he would host an emergency meeting and he would tell them to come over and pop their head over the stall to talk it out.\n\nEveryone just went along with it because it was either YOLO SILICON VALLEY LMAO or they were just too intimidated.\n\nThat all stopped when Michael Moritz, legendary silicon valley investor, and one of Facebook biggest early investors and shareholders, was at the campus doing research for leading a 2nd round of funding. He was doing diligence all day and at one point had to poop and that's when Zuckerburg popped his head over with a smile to ask how's the diligence coming along.\n\nMichael Moritz, not one to mince words, was apoplectic. 'GET THE FUCK OUT HERE YOU IDiOT LIZARD LOOKING FUCKER.' Mark Zuckerburg nervously tried to laugh it off and persisted, because he really loved intimate poop conversations 'Aw c'mon Michael, it's silicon valley'. Zuckerburg finally withdrew when Moritz flung a poop at him.\n\n30 minutes later, Mark was in a very import meeting when Moritz walked into the conference room. 'Everyone except Mark Zuckerburg, OUT'. As intimidated as they were of Zuckerburg, at the time Moritz was the bigger deal, and they all scurried out of the room.\n\nZuckerburg, however, is not one to be intimated by anyone. Not the Winkewoz twins, not Eduardo Savarn, not Peter Thiel, and not one of his biggest shareholder Michael Moritz. Zuckerburg passionately defended his practice, but Michael Moritz was having none of that. Moritz told him that it was a ticking PR and HR catastrophe, and threatened to pull out of leading the 2nd round of funding if Mark continued, which would have been a calamity for the company.\n\nZuckerburg pretended to arbitrate 'Ok fine, but you need to give me a good reason'.\n\nMoritz was flabberghasted at this response. Was this a serious question? He answered with the most obvious answer 'Because it's not FUCKING NORMAL'.\n\nUnknown to Moritz, Zuckerburg had guessed a conversation like this would happen as soon as he was kicked out of the toilet stall, and began formulating a strategy to counter Moritz demands. Zuckerburg knew that Moritz would have all the leverage, but Zuckerburg was a master strategist.\n\nZuckerburg went for the pounce. 'Okay, I'll lets write out an agreement, in writing I'll rescind the policy because it's not normal'. Moritz was dumbfounded, but he was used to being dumbfounded by eccentric tech founders, afterall he was also an early investor in Apple, and he still found Zuckerburg tame compared to Steve Jobs. Moritz had a long day of work so they signed the agreement so that he could go back to doing his due diligence.\n\nWhen Moritz left, a broad grin spread across Zuckerburg's face. \" 'Not Normal' eh? \" Zuckerburg said with a menacing laugh. Ever since then, Mark Zuckerburg has been on a life-long crusade to normalize poop conversations.\n\nHe had a checklist of what he needed to accomplish in order to realize this. His advisors would tell him it's impossible, but one by one Zuckerburg checked off the list. From trusting Mark with their private photos, to normalizing people giving up their internet browsing privacy.\n\nIn 2015, Zuckerburg knew he would hit a wall, having people watch you while you poop was still too much of a leap. That's when Zuckerburg decided to buy Occulus, and eventually shift his company towards virtual reality. If he could coax people into having life-like conversations while they were pooping in a virtual reality, then doing it in the real world wouldn't be too big of a leap.\n\nZuckerburg only has 3 more boxes to check off before poop conversations are normalized.\n\nMark Zuckerburg wants to watch you poop.\n\nAre you going to let him?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KVq4mMF.jpg", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Make sure you hold those through earnings and post results.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Everyone is focusing too much on social media while ignoring that Meta is pivoting to focus on VR.

Most of Tesla's high margin sales are coming from their Chinese plant's production due to the cheap labor costs and MUCH cheaper LFP cells, so with the Chinese plant shutdown, they could take a pretty sizable hit on margins, and prove just how critical that plant is to the company's profits.\n\nThe gross vehicle margins are definitely benefiting from Tesla's price increases, but I don't know how long those can last if we head into a recession within the next 1-1.5 years.\n\nAlso, that lithium shortage isn't a minor issue.  Other OEMs are JUST starting to bring their cell assembly line plants online to ramp up their own BEV production.  Thus far, Tesla has seen very little competition, and they've had the lion's share of the lithium production to themselves.  Prices could go MUCH higher and shortages could hit ALL OEMs, including Tesla with all OEMs desperately competing for the metal... and if that happens going into a recession, it isn't like Tesla can just raise prices to offset it.  Other OEMs can simply push out more ICEVs / HEVs / PHEVs during the storm.\n\nNotice that even the bull cases on Tesla didn't see the target prices go up all that much.
