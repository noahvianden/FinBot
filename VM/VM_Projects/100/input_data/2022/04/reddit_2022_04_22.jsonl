I didn't believe him at the time, how could people not just look at the data and figure out that we're in a bubble, right? Then I went through 08/09 and now this, and of course he was right. By any metric, we are far beyond frothy conditions, yet look at the comments here (and downvotes to your comment). Also they have been trained by talking heads on CNBC etc. like Pavlovian dogs to 'buy the dip' and 'markets only go up', not realizing ever since Greenspan Put, Fed is fueling the unsustainable rise, coming in at every drop to artificially save it (except there is a cost and there is no free lunch). If they will point out to a 50 year S&P500 chart as proof, for their sake, I hope they don't accidentally pull up the Nikkei chart.\n\nI would suggest the only possible hole in your thesis is that you're expecting Fed to act correctly and do the right thing. Fed has shown itself to be absolute slave to the markets. That's why they were a year late in stopping QE even though excess liquidity was showing in every data. Also look at 2018 Taper tantrum, Fed started QT, markets went down as rates increased, and Fed did a turnaround and started QE again.

As I said in my comment, I experienced all of this last year when I suggested that things were frothy and it was the right time to look for value.  Lo and behold, a year later I was right, they were wrong.  And zooming out, I have a feeling I'm going to be right about the big picture, too.\n\nI'll check out Howard Marks.  I recently finished Shiller's \"Irrational Exuberance\", which he published in March 2000, the very same month the bubble popped, lol.  A lot of the things people said then are being said now, and he cited things that were said in the 1920s as well, and those things are familiar, too.  It's really astonishing because you don't have to be a genius to figure all of this out, you just have to read what people thought then and compare it to what ended up happening.  Time and again the mob has walked blindly off a cliff, shunning and insulting those who might warn them of their folly.  It happens every time.\n\nAs far as I understand 2018, it was to fix disruptions in the bond market, not outright to prop up stocks - of course that's what ended up happening, though. To be honest, I don't know what to think about the Fed.  I guess I earnestly believe they think a \"soft landing\" is possible, and I think their intentions are good, but unfortunately they've put themselves between a rock and a hard place and sooner or later it's going to blow up in their face.  These people actually believe the economy is a linear system that can be understood and controlled through linear equations.  Unfortunately, those of us who are honest know that it's not simple, it's a complex adaptive system.  It's their flawed framework that allowed them to get us into such a precarious situation in the first place.  And since it's worked so far, the idea is basically \"so far, so good\". But the perfect storm of high inflation, skyhigh market valuations, and enormous debt in the system looks like it's about ripe to explode.\n\nI think the Fed will try to do the right thing.  I don't think they will succeed.

However I think the markets are oversold currently because Nasdaq dropped almost 1000 points in a week and at this rate we will see those pre-pandemic levels only within a month or 2 at max. But then what happens? I mean, recession in next year is quite possible but this means that the markets should continue to drop throughout the year.

The problem with cars is that they sit unused [almost all the time](https://fortune.com/2016/03/13/cars-parked-95-percent-of-time/). We don't have a car problem in cities, we have a *parking* problem. The great thing about busses and subways isn't that they're high capacity, it's that they're in use most of the time, and when they're not being used they can be parked in out of the way places. For cars to be convenient, there has to be lots of parking in the places where people want to be, which leads to absolutely atrocious urban planning trade offs. The two options are:\n\n* Have convenient parking in city centers. This means we're taking up very expensive real estate with parking spots. Even if we build high density parking garages, that's space that could be used for retail or apartments. And it's still not used that much since it's used mostly by people driving in to the city, so they're only there for maybe 8-12 hours a day, at best.\n* Build your destinations where there's more room, so it's cheap to build lots of parking, which just means making strip malls and urban sprawl. This makes for lots of cheap parking, but is terrible in just about every other way\n\n\nPeople see all these terrible choices being made to accommodate cars and think we should get rid of all cars and just have subways and busses go everywhere. But if you want people to actually take those subways and busses you'll have to make them more convenient and more flexible and basically make a ton of very small busses/subways, that are basically cars or pods. But that would be great as long as the little pods/cars didn't need parking.\n\nOf course, what we're talking about is autonomous cars and/or Boring tunnels. But the fuckcars crowd sees that the vehicles look just like cars and think they're stupid because they don't look like busses or subways, while missing the point that it's not the vehicle itself that matters, it's the infrastructure we need to build to accommodate it that matters. fuckcars should really be r/fuckparking", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Damn great points.

My understanding is this (and hopefully others can chime in):\n\nEasing:\n\n* Central banks create money out of thin air and use it to buy government bonds (loan money to other banks at really low interest rates)\n* Banks have tons of money to loan out so they offer low interest rates to incentivize people to borrow money\n* Lots of the borrowed money gets invested into the stock market (by whom tho? who is borrowing this money and how?  What are they investing in?) and stonks go up\n\nTightening:\n\n* Central banks stop printing money and stop buying bonds.  The existing bonds will eventually mature and the other banks will have to return the money they borrowed to the central bank.\n* To get back the money that needs to be returned, banks will raise interest rates to incentivize borrowers to pay down debt.  (Will they just keep raising rates until they get the desired outcome?  The bonds *need* to be payed off when they mature; the money these banks lent out *needs* to come back by a certain date).\n* Investors who borrowed money to invest in stonks will sell stonks to get back the money and return to the bank.\n\nThat's my crude understanding.  A lot of open questions for me (in parentheses).  My one conclusion, assuming my understanding is accurate, is that the money that went into the market as a result of easing *must* come back out.  Those government bonds *will* *mature* and they *must be repaid.*  Thus, interest rates will rise to whatever they need to to achieve this outcome; whether loans start getting repaid in response to 1% interest rates or 10% interest rates, they *must* be repaid.\n\nEdit: I think one rider here is that the Fed will not seek to recoup all the money that was printed; only a portion of it.

Or maybe it's because you think ICE car sales deserve to be counted. You're missing the exponential increase of EV's over the past decade and the slow progressive decline of ICE cars of all OEM's that nobody ever seems to talk about. Seriously...look at the automative sales of all the major companies. What's the trend showing you? Meanwhile Tesla has increased sales/production exponentially faster than any automaker in history by a wide wide margin. You can look it up. At present, despite a >1.2 million car/year runrate, they're sold out for more than a year despite increasing prices 20-30%.\n\n\"They needed to expand in a massive way to be at a paraity with the big automakers\" Bruh...they make 3x the gross margin on sales compared to OEM. You can literally look up the data. They have 3x the operating margins and 1000x the debt to income ratio. They have their pick of the engineering best talent in the world. They can manufacture cars at several times the rate of the old OEM's (per VW's CEO not me). I think we're past the whole \"Tesla can't manufacture\" stage from 2017. So...again...what are you talking about?  \n\n\n\"Why would someone by a Tesla when they can buy \\[insert OEM brand EV\\]\"  \nWell...again, have you bothered to research this? Tesla has Better brand satisfaction (Tesla doesn't even spend money on advertising in the US), better charging infrastructure (duh), better software, better performance/cost ratios, better safety (all Tesla's are the safest cars ever made in their category), better energy efficiency, better ADAS systems, better availability (production), etc.  I mean again...don't take my word for it. This data is publicly available. There's a reason for the aforementioned domination. You can chose to ignore it like you currently are.\n\n So Tesla's sold millions of EV's so far and they continue to guide for >50% growth /year for years to come, and you think, what...that they're gonna be small because you say so? I don't understand what data this is based on.   \n\n\n\"Tesla was only a major player because they were the only game in town\"  \nYou say this without pondering why that might be. It's been a decade now. EV's have exploded and the market wants them..why aren't the old OEM's crushing Tesla like you and every bear ever keeps saying. The answer is...until Tesla, EV's weren't profitable. After Tesla, they still aren't and now it's worse because they have to sell a competitive EV, not a trash after thought bolt. OEM's make the real money from repairing/leasing cars and NOT from selling cars. Their gross automotive margins for their ICE cars are trash. They're even worse for EV's. Ford, VW, and GM lose 10's and thousands of dollars on each EV they make and will for the forseable future. That's why they pay Tesla emission credits to not expand their production.  \n\n\nThe thing is..nobody wanted to build EV's even though they had the potential to be better. Why spend billions on unproven technology? Tesla forced the OEM's to build cars they never wanted to and invest in technology that is the antithesis of their ICE cars. That is the definition of what disruption is...And the kicker is...because OEM's only make money on ICE sales (dealers don't want to touch EV's and mark them way up), if the OEM's make a compelling EV, it will actually compete with their own ICE sales. This is the other reason why they're not to keen on going big on EV's. Also they don't have the manufacturing talent, technology, battery supply, etc. and they're run by dinosaurs.   \n\n\nYour argument is \"the competition is coming\" while GM sold like 25 EV's last quarter. This is the same argument I've been hearing for years while seeing what has actually played out. There are new players like Lucid, Rivian, Fisker, etc....but they have enormous challenges associated with staying solvent.

Also, all Indian imports have HUGE tariffs because of crappy government policy, that's why there aren't many people jumping in to be competitive there. Only .1% of the population is relevant. In the US it's >10%. By the time the Indian economy becomes more relevant internationally, EV's will have also become a lot cheaper.I see that happening past 2025 or further.

It's plausible they'd be stupid enough for your scenario.\n\nHitting 0 for T notes is going to be a catastrophe", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Disclaimer: anyone that says they know what's going to happen is lying, and real estate is going to be one of the hardest to predict.\n\nReal estate has been proppped up by QE/rates , inflation, and speculation. The question is how much each one has affected it.\n\nif it's mainly speculation, it will drop if rates rise. How much it drops is based on the amount of speculation - how big of a bubble it is. It will drop because rising rates will mean slower growth due to higher loans and less demand while speculators are jumping in expecting prices to continue to rise at current rates.\n\nIf it's real inflation and a devalue of money, it could not drop at all. Especially if inflation doesn't subside. Here it gets tricky because QE will mask real inflation since the FED can always just do QT to reverse it. At the same time once inflation could become anchored QT will not help as much as QE helped cause it - hence the current idea of too little too late.\n\nSince commodities are finite, and growth stocks are dependent on real GDP growth - naturally commodities like housing would rise in an inflationary environment, but growth stocks would drop.\n\nUnfortunately it gets tricky even more since real estate has practically been turned into a growth stock with idea of MBS bringing demand to the selling of mortgages - which caused the housing crash. Back then inflation was low so housing had nowhere to go but down. That time was all speculation. But there was no QE before the housing crash - so the government didn't have a chance to control the drop or prop up asset prices like they can now and did in March 2020.\n\nIf the current rise in real-estate is just people parking their money from the practically free loans or real families buying homes that can afford the interest raises - it will stay there unless money devalues and people need to unpark their money to cover other expenses. The only way this could happen is through aggressive QT, not just raising rates. Somehow, the current value of money has to rise.\n\nI would personally claim that residential real estate is in a bubble, especially in countries such as new Zealand, Australia, and Canada - and most of the movement in these countries has been speculative due to low interest and a historical strength in these real estate markets, as well as the prevailing idea that housing only goes up. Since these countries didn't get hit as bad in 2008, and banks have been artificially propping up real estate values since then, some investors think it will go up forever. I think the USA less so, but it's still in a bit of a bubble imo with the addition of new tools such as REITs with the combination of 2 years of 0% loans.\n\nIf it's QE that's mainly causing the current rise in real estate, then it will drop as the FED has already stopped QE as of this month and does have plans for QT. The tricky part here is... They control it so they can reverse this whenever they want. That being said, persistent inflation is now forcing the FED to play the only available hand - tightening - and imo they will only stop if unemployment rises. The FED cares the most about the unemployment number.\n\nFinally, it seems that farmland is less susceptible to speculation and interest rates in general. This provides less volatility - in a market that is already very slow moving. It's said that housing crashes are seen far in advance as real estate in general is not an instant process like buying a stock.\n\nI would think that the FED has at least one more loose monetary policy in them before they truly need to raise rates sometime later this decade, but it's so hard to tell. Already 3 months after January the market predicts a rate of 2-3% by the end of the year compared to 1-1.5% in January.\n\nConsidering you've already made 100%, my move would be to take 50% out and recoup my initial investment considering the volatility - but because of real inflation and in my opinion the slack to cycle through at least one more loose monetary cycle before mass inequality, I would leave the rest of the 50% in there, and monitor what happens in Q4.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Setting the rate affects supply/demand and it could naturally be deflationary over a long period of time - if demand drops enough.

How?\n\nFirst of all recognize that debt (bond holders) are almost always higher on the list to get pennies when a company drops dead. They usually get paid worse than equity / shares because they are relatively safer. \n\nSo bond holders might make a yield of 3 or 4 or 5%. not great yield, but less risk. If you have lots of money, you allocate a portion to bonds for the monthly income. \n\nWhat happens when interest rates go up? Bonds yield more. You make more as a percent for new bonds you buy. \n\nHow let's say a blue chip stock has a 3% dividend. Pretend you are a big money asset manager for some very risk averse funds. Would your rather own that stock or a 3% bond? Kinda depends I guess. Owning the stock gives you some upside. Owning the bond gives you more safety. What happens when rates go to 4%? A few things. \n\nFirst the stock might have actual adverse reaction to this. They may have to pay higher interest on debt. If inflation is kicking up they may have to pay workers more. In short, that 3% dividend looks much riskier than it used to. You might actually lose money on the stock, you might lose more than the dividend. \n\nIf you were already risk averse, you might see the 4% bond as a good alternative to the blue chip at that point. \n\nWhat happens to other stocks that aren't blue chips? Stocks with huge multiples get beat hard. Those investors might flee to blue chips.
