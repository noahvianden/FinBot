They have a simple model and the cost side is the one side they have a lot of control over.

Q1 of 2022 isn't even an outlier or below the trend line of the last decade.  It has been and is still quite linear overall.\n\nThe revenue side is relatively simple in subscribers times subscription rate.  This mapped out, they were very linear from 2013 to mid 2017.  Then they began ramping up income along a higher slope through 2022.  Even Q1 2022 with the new rate, it's at the highest revenue it's ever been.  Revenue has ALWAYS gone up.  Q3 2017 and Q1 2022 are distinctly the two single large jumps in the revenue model.  History had also shown that the rate increase in Q3 of 2017 did NOT generate a significant loss of subscriptions, a slight immediate down tick, but otherwise overall continued to follow a largely linear path regardless.  If history is an indicator, the rate increase in Q1 of 2022 would generate a slight down tick in subscription growth but otherwise shouldn't really affect overall growth.  Additionally, the rate increase has always generated an overall net increase in revenue and a moderate bump in practice.\n\nNow how Netflix chooses to spend that cash is kind of irrelevant if it's not creating a subscription loss or ultimately a revenue loss.  Netflix can manage its expenses and where they choose to invest those dollars.  That's kind of the easy part after ensuring solid subscriber count and associated revenue.\n\nIn terms of subscribers, Netflix still dominates over HBO, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+.  Disney+ is the only one that's showing faster growth.  Hulu is much shallower.  HBO is mostly flat.  Amazon Prime is significant globally matching Netflix, but Prime encompasses so many other elements besides video streaming.  Even so, Netflix with just video alone, no shopping, no books, has more subscribers.\n\nSo, what's actually bad about Netflix?  What actually warrants a significant trending drop in stock price and a large stock dip recently?  I don't get it.  The input side of the equation is absolutely solid.

You could binge watch your favorite shows (The Office, Arrested Development, South Park, etc.) and that made it appealing to people.\n\nAs soon as the companies that own those shows began to pull content for their own competitor apps (Peacock, Hulu, Paramount, etc), Netflix went into panic mode *just to survive* and began to just throw insane amounts of money at film and TV talent to lure them in.

Their steadfast decision to remain a rental and production house when their rental wing essentially died (as companies pulled back their IP) has been disastrous.\n\n5.)They decided to become political activists.

I actually had no idea KO was part of the dotcom bubble... \n\nThis does look a lot like what we see today with blue chip stocks like V and COST trading at 30+ PEs. Admittedly I've been far less surprised by the tech selloff than I have been by the relative strength we're seeing in certain large cap stocks. The strength large caps have shown over the last few months relative to the rest of the market has been extraordinary. You would think higher rates would bring some of these stocks down to more typical valuations, but high valuation stocks like COST just keep pushing higher. COST specifically is now trading at 2x it's historical PE ratio.\n\nI genuinely have no idea where to turn at this point. The S&P500 seems to be full of overvalued companies that haven't realised rates are rising, while many growth stocks (which would typically be a bad investment in a higher rate environment) seem to be trading at relatively attractive multiples and at least seem to be pricing in the rate increases and economic doubts. But even growth stocks aren't that cheap with many still trading at double digit PS ratios, and if the S&P500 is about to crash there is no way growth stocks won't follow the indexes lower.\n\nSo where does an investor turn? A lot of people seem to be investing in commodities and consumer staples right now which have preformed relatively better, but when you look at the holdings of an ETF like XLP you'll see that basically all of the holdings look extremely overvalued relative to their historical valuations -- a lot of these companies could drop 25-30% and would still be pricey. The only thing I feel any comfort doing right now is picking up solid companies that I feel confident holding long-term which have sold off somewhat. Stocks like GOOG, CRM, PYPL, DIS, etc are expensive, but at least they seem to be reflecting the reality of monetary tightening and are trading at decent discounts to their historical valuations. Still, I'm getting killed by momentum and sentiment on these names because no one wants to own them at the moment regardless of price. I'm also holding a large cash position which I've never done previously because I literally don't know where to put it. My S&P500 valuation model (which tends to be overly optimistic) is telling me that the index is at least 10% overvalued, which is the most overvalued it's been in the last 5 years. The only way the S&P500 isn't over valued is if you're comfortable assuming the bond market is wrong and that rates won't go as high as the bond market is pricing.\n\nI've been wrong for months on my call that large caps crash or growth stocks rally at this point though so it's likely I'm missing something. What I'm now wondering is if valuations don't really matter so long as investors continue to flee bonds and look to the stock market and blue chip stocks for perceived safety. Perhaps counter intuitively the real risk to the market now is that yields and inflation is peaking as this is likely push the investors fleeing to the stock market back into bonds.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "At the end of the day no one knows what's going to happen. Looks like you have a pretty good feel for things, however, so I'll share some of my thoughts that might help complete your theory. \n\nThe only thing I've found reliable is to look at history how frothy markets tend to move in the end game. (Whether it be in the dot-com bubble, or the crypto bubble in 2017, etc.) There is a lot of evidence out there that growthy/frothy stocks tend to get pummeled first, and then finally the large caps come down at the very end. I think the rationale is that investors leave the riskiest names first and rotate to safer ones. However, even the safer ones start to become a problem when there are major structural issues/overall pessimism in the markets. Bull markets don't last forever and sometimes having no position is the best thing.\n\nSo far it's playing out exactly how it played out in the dot-com bubble. I've been shorting speculative/high PS ratio stocks since November, got cut a little bit on the rebound in late March, but have been recently closing them. Last week I began sizing into shorts in expensive large cap stocks like $COST, $AAPL, $ABBV, $DE, to name a few. While growthy names can continue to slide downwards, the risk-reward isn't there anymore. Most of the names I shorted ($CVNA, $NET, $HUBS, $SHOP, etc.) have had large enough drawdowns and asking for another 50% more would be asking a lot. The large cap non-tech stocks I mentioned above, however, are a completely different story. You're spot on with the likes of $COST. They are extremely expensive right now, and while I wouldn't expect a 50% drawdown, I think a 20-30% drop is reasonable from here to reset valuations.\n\nThe stock market hasn't been listening to the bond market for the past few weeks. When it eventually does, turbulence will come fast. Honestly, you really can't fault funds/investors/retail for greeding hard for large-cap names like $AAPL and $COST.  A true bear market hasn't happened for more than a decade. In that time span, fortunes and careers were made off of being a perma-bull. Unfortunately, the vast majority of investors are perma-bulls now. Who can blame them? Year after year it's been ingrained in every investor that being a bear is a losing endeavor.

REITs of course but their business model is somewhat unique. Even then the commercial, mall REITs have traded like shit due to the debt. Ford maybe?

Tesla right this moment is engaged in at least the following active construction projects: \n\n- Austin main factory fit out\n- Austin cathode factory \n- Lathrop Megapack factory\n- Fremont GA4 (tent) expansion and vehicle bridge\n- Nevada ongoing site expansion\n- Berlin stamping plant extension\n- Berlin cell factory \n- Shanghai model 3 plant expansion\n- Shanghai battery pack plant expansion #3\n- Shanghai phase 3 expansion to site capacity \n\nThen they have a bunch of expansion work planned for existing sites: \n\n- Berlin phase 2 “mirror building”\n- Berlin cell plant expansion \n- Berlin drive unit building fit out\n- Berlin phase 3 new model building\n- Austin lithium plant\n- Shanghai new model building\n\nSo they haven’t stopped building factories. Furthermore just because the shell of a building is complete and the drone flyovers get a little more boring, doesn’t mean they’re finished. They’re not even close to reaching their final form. Right now they have installed production line capacity to get to >2.5m vehicles per year and enough factory space to get to maybe double that. \n\nAustin will be a >2m vehicle per year plant eventually from the current building, Berlin has more construction still ongoing that’ll see it get to the same level. I’d be willing to wager they can squeeze >1.5m out of existing Shanghai plants too. But none of that matters until they start spitting out 4680 cells like bullets, and scale the supply chain at those locations. So I’d argue they really don’t actually need any more factories and spending time and billions building more empty sheds is a waste of energy, because they won’t need any more floor space until ~2025 beyond the existing sites already built or planned, which will easily support their needs until cell supply catches up.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t know what the relative scale that is but would that be bigger than say what Toyota has in terms of production capacity?

Namely near the paint shop – an area in the drinking water protection area.\n\nBrandenburg's State Environment Agency (LfU) denies any risk to humans, groundwater and the environment. \"It is not an incident,\" said spokesman Thomas Frey. Tesla responded correctly to the disruption, which was reported verbally on April 12 and then reported in writing on April 14. The Oder-Spree district also rejects any environmental damage. But contradictions remain.\n\nThe environmental organizations Green League and Nature Conservation Union as well as the citizens' initiative Grünheide call for clarification, the ecological-democratic party (ÖDP) even a production stop. \"It stinks to high heaven,\" said Michael Ganschow, Managing Director of the Green League, on Tuesday in the Tagesspiegel. \"That's very worrying,\" said Steffen Schorcht from BI Grünheide. “We work with water-polluting substances in this plant. Our fears that it should not have been built here are confirmed.”\n\nBrandenburg's Ministry of the Environment had already confirmed last week that on the evening of April 11 in the paint shop \"when filling a container within the paint shop, a liquid escaped through a valve that was not completely closed, which was completely collected in the collection container of the storage facility and from there through an approved waste disposal company has been pumped away.”\n\nA smaller amount of liquid was still absorbed with binding agents, it said. “The incident happened inside the buildings. No water-polluting liquid escaped into the open air or onto the ground. There was no danger to the environment or the neighborhood.”\n\nFor the State Environment Agency is a disruption \nBut now the Brandenburg ÖDP has published photos - taken on April 12 by an employee of the Strausberg-Erkner water association (WSE) in the plant from a car - which show a liquid bound with a brownish binding agent outside in front of the paint shop and vehicles from the Tesla company fire brigade .\n\nThe LfU explains the contradiction with the fact that when the hoses were picked up and loaded on April 12 by a waste disposal company, two to three liters of hose content leaked out. \"It is a matter of incorrect operation by the disposal company,\" says Frey. Therefore, there is no need to impose conditions or order follow-up measures.\n\nIt is up to the operator whether organizational consequences are drawn. The LfU only now shared further details about what had happened inside: \"The leaked liquid is about 15 cubic meters of treatment bath from the electrophoretic coating.\" It is still not disclosed which chemicals are involved. According to the LfU, an inspection of the LfU was carried out on April 12th. \"At the time of the inspection, the effects of the disruption had already been completely eliminated.\"\n\nLaugh in front of the paint shop on April 10th\nAnother contradiction is even more serious. According to him, a drone video recorded on April 10th and published on YouTube by the local factory observer “Fly Brandenburg” shows (from 10:30 a.m.) a clearly visible pool of liquid in front of the paint shop’s hall door – the day before the official version, and in an otherwise all-over dry environment.\n\n\"It can't be solvents, that would have evaporated. And there is no work in the factory on Sundays,” says Schorcht from the Grünheide citizens’ initiative. Just under a thousand meters away from the site is the Hohenbinde main well of the Strausberg-Erkner water association, which has an annual capacity of 5.6 million cubic meters. \"If that should fail, there is a risk of a supply emergency in the region.\" According to the drone photos, it cannot be ruled out that chemicals have seeped away next to the road.\n\nAssociations have lodged an objection to Tesla approval\nDuring the approval process, the Green League and the Nature Conservation Union had repeatedly warned that the accident prevention measures were inadequate. The State Environment Agency recently rejected such fears as unfounded in the 536-page main permit for the plant.\n\nFor Managing Director Michael Ganschow from the Green League, the question arises as to \"whether Tesla has met all the requirements of the approval and who controls it.\" The incidents showed how justified the warnings were. \"What if a major accident happens? The approval authority is responsible.”\n\nAccording to the authorities, there is no risk of liquid escaping from the Tesla factory near Berlin\nNo danger according to authorities\nThe Nature Conservation Union and the Green League have now formally objected to the main permit for the Tesla factory. Ganschow criticized the fact that the publication of the administrative files and the blackened passages of the approval from the state environment is still being refused.

They know their suppliers capacity and are eeking out every last drop from them while encouraging them to grow / factoring in that supply growth.

Back when the BLM protests were ongoing, I came across a set of videos on a reddit post in an obscure sub (was a branch off wsb actually). They were personal taken videos from around the country where the protests were going on. Those videos were so incredibly disturbing that I literally had to go to therapy afterwards. I'm not lying. I thought I saved the post, but I can't find it.. and I'm honestly not surprised I unsaved it because it literally gave me nightmares and anxiety attacks. The videos consisted of groups of African Americans brutally beating and stoning white people, stores being looted, people being chased down and beaten in the streets, and I distinctly remember one where a group surrounded a semi truck on the highway to get it to stop while chanting \"kill him! kill him! kill him!\" I remember glibgloby.. people laying in a pool of their own blood, arms and legs literally broken.\n\nSo what I'm saying.. is that the BLM protests 100% ended up being a means for extreme violence and looting. That's it. That's what I'm saying. You can choose not to believe me because I can't find the post and links to the videos, but I also suspect you know I don't lie gliobgloby.\n\nTo me, \\*you\\* are the one believing a false narrative. To me, you are in denial in order to protect your preconceived notions. To me, what's rational is to realize, that those speaking out against organized BLM protests are not racist (necessarily), and they're not simply trying to silence a cause against racism.. like what the media would have you believe.. but maybe those speaking out have a point.\n\nMe personally.. I 100% agree that there's racism in this country that I'd like to see go away, but the BLM protests were not the way to help, and in fact, they made it worse.\n\nE: also, my heart started racing and my anxiety peaked while I was trying to find that post.

They want people to tune in every week, see whatever the story is, and inch forward the season's story by about 5 minutes per episode, except for the finally, mid-season finally before they take a break for at least a month, and occasionally just one episode the wraps the last few up into a shift in the narrative.\n\nEvery season finally or mid-season finally ends with someone dying or coming back to life or something unexpected that will keep viewers watching when it starts again in a few months. They've had this formula down since the 90's with shows like Buffy and Charmed, and they tend to make spin-offs as much as possible, though they often have a 50-50 chance of even making past the first season because they usually just transplant a somewhat popular character into their own show. They prop up the spin-offs with crossover events, but if they fail they just move the character(s)  back to the original series and make some vague references to whatever was going on in the failed show, even if the returning character was supposed to be dead or comes back with new powers.\n\nThey'll never compete with the big series, but they've essentially carved out a niche at making soap opera styled TV that is aimed at a demographic that other Network TV doesn't really have much interest in even trying to compete with.\n\nWith all that said, shows like Supernatural, Charmed, Smallville, The Flash, Arrow, and Buffy have all been general positive and even won awards from time to time. It's usually the first couple of seasons that go great (Supernatural would have been a perfect show if it ended at season 5, but it went to 11 because there was still too much money to make) and then take a turn for the worse.

{"title": "The game-changer in mobile broadband connectivity - $ASTS", "selftext": "Fellow degenerates,\n\nToday, I will do an update of a DD I posted about a year ago ([first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6b5f9/asts_a_global_mobile_broadband_solution/)) regarding [AST SpaceMobile Inc.](https://ibb.co/8D9BL9C) ([$ASTS](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/asts) \\- c.$1.5bn market cap) and why I think this is one of the most asymmetric risk/reward play in the market (100x opportunity with limited downside over the next few years).\n\n**The company will tap into the $1T cellular broadband market while lifting millions out of poverty and making cellular dead spots a thing of the past.** The current market environment has created a unique opportunity for retail to frontrun institutional investors.\n\nFirst of all, I am still young and full of cum. I have been a long time lurker on wsb (joined somewhere about 5 years ago) and started gambling with about $1,000 in February 2020 (my only deposit). I currently [peaked at $1,031,507 and change in January 2021](https://ibb.co/hm27s7f) after selling $GME at $357. I withdrew about $15,000 to go on holidays and the rest I kept invested (basically 100% of my net worth). My goal is to reach 8 digits by the end of the decade.\n\nI attribute my current result to mainly three things:\n\n* Obscene amount of luck on several plays during an exceptional market environment in 2020 and 2021.\n* Cutting losers quickly and letting winners run (while also being numb to numbers on a screen).\n* A focus on asymmetric risk/reward investments, insane upside potential with a tamed downside risk.\n\nAnyway onto the actual post.\n\n# Finding diamonds in the wasteland of recent IPOs and SPACs\n\nHumans in general vacillate between fear and greed. This creates mispricings in the markets.\n\nIt is hard to argue against the fact that most IPOs and SPACs in recent times have been the result of massive greed and hype. Almost all of these companies have overstated their business case which has resulted in an avalanche of overvaluated shit (HOOD, BMBL, most SPACs, etc.) being fed to the public markets.\n\nThis has among other things resulted in a massive sell-off and extreme fear in most speculative/growth stocks which for the most part may be justified. However, it has also created an opportunity to pick up diamonds in the dirt.\n\nI believe ASTS is one of those rare diamonds.\n\n# The business case for AST SpaceMobile\n\n>Our aim is to bridge the connectivity gap faced by billions. - Abel Avellan\n\n**ASTS is building the first cellular broadband connectivity constellation** and addressing accessibility and affordability issues faced by billions of people all across the globe. **Their solution does not require expensive fixed antennas (Starlink dish) nor a specialized satellite phone (traditional satellite solutions), just your regular smartphone**.\n\n**The Adressable Market**\n\nThere are currently [5.3bn phones moving in and out of cellular coverage](https://www.gsmaintelligence.com/data/) as people go about their everyday life. This is an >$1T market currently.\n\nAnother way to look at it is:\n\n* usage gap (refers to those who live within the footprint of a mobile broadband network but are not using mobile internet services) of about 3.4bn people, and\n* coverage gap (refers to those who live in an area not covered by a mobile broadband network) of about 0.5bn people.\n\nThis represent almost [4bn people who would benefit from an affordable mobile connectivity solution](https://www.gsma.com/r/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-State-of-Mobile-Internet-Connectivity-Report-2021.pdf). One cannot overstate the importance of affordable connectivity to lift people from poverty and generate growth in our economies.\n\n**The Value Proposition**\n\n[Image of the satellite](https://preview.redd.it/r81cw0csfnu81.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79cad7428b7c2f35ae04888792a8e9562aacdb74)\n\nIn order to achieve their goal, the company will initially build a 168 satellites constellation (of huge satellites called BlueBirds) in [multiple phases](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001780312/000095017022005212/asts-20211231.htm).\n\n[Phases and countries covered](https://preview.redd.it/aaqbppptfnu81.png?width=1715&format=png&auto=webp&s=451a91386e8902dd7f2b04c47da9f607909dc05d)\n\nThe Equatorial Phase (covering 49 countries) is scheduled to launch in Q1/Q2 2023, while the rest of the constellation will be launched by late 2024. MIMO functionalities will be enabled in 2025.\n\nThe uniqueness of their solution (compared to Starlink, Kuiper, OneWeb and traditional satellite constellation) is the ability to connect to a regular smartphone. In order to *talk* to regular smartphones you need some big ass satellites (Your mom-sized satellites) as well as the right spectrum (can't do it with spectrum owned by current satellite operators like Starlink).\n\nYou can think of their satellite (BlueBirds) as American Tower ($AMT) towers in space. ASTS doesn't own the spectrum and therefore relies on Mobile Network Operators (MNO, such as Vodafone, AT&T, etc.) to provide the right spectrum ([for 2G, 4G, 5G and other LTE-protocols in the 3GPP family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)#/media/File:Cellular_network_standards_and_generation_timeline.svg)), basically allowing you to watch 4K porn anywhere on Earth (wink). It is therefore important to see how well they are able to attract MNOs.\n\n**The MNO Agreements and Early Traction**\n\n[Countries currently covered under agreements](https://preview.redd.it/0oi83uxwfnu81.png?width=1449&format=png&auto=webp&s=cca8ce3adb72f5b3d9ad41b75619b0a8c9d2fec9)\n\nThey have agreements for a revenue-share model with at least 17 (more have been found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1tHqty8-LoaN4NkSE-O2M9AJPS2rrKzJ84uTXRWz-7vM/htmlview?pli=1#)) of the biggest MNOs representing more than 1.8bn potential users that can be turned on as soon as the constellation is operational.\n\n[Known agreements and subscriber count](https://preview.redd.it/pgflwjczfnu81.jpg?width=279&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba8960d3e2f88b37d9e34aa73cd1ef7941c35a4b)\n\nThey will be able to easily turn on these subscribers as soon as the constellation is online. Now imagine if they can just tap 5% of the 4.0bn people in the usage and coverage gap. That's 200m additional subscribers which would make ASTS one of the biggest MNOs on the planet (twice as big as AT&T). This is not even accounting for the fact that their solution could attract mobile subscribers from other MNOs. It it also important to mention that some of these companies are also heavily invested in the company.\n\nNow this surely seems very attractive and therefore it is important to ask about competition, this is my next point.\n\n**The Competition**\n\n>Competition is for losers. - Peter Thiel\n\nThere are often big misconceptions about who the competitors are.\n\nCurrently, ASTS is the **first and only** company building a mobile **broadband** connectivity constellation **directly to any smartphone**.\n\nThere is another private company that is building a similar yet widely different constellation already capable of *talking* to regular smartphones (proving the concept). It is [Lynk](https://lynk.world/). However, they only offer the ability to send a few text messages a few times a day (their satellites being to small = less power), can't stream or call someone. They are way underfunded ($10m raised) and have way less MNO agreements than ASTS. On the other hand, they prove the technological feasibility of ASTS.\n\nIt is important to note that other LEO constellations like Starlink, Kuiper or OneWeb are not direct competitors to ASTS. They cannot *talk* directly to smartphones (but need a an [antenna - dish](https://ibb.co/VHfPKvH)). Think of it like mobile subscription vs. fixed internet subscription.\n\nOn the other hand, other satellite constellations (usually GEO) like Iridium and are potential competitors. However, they do not have the spectrum for broadband (aka MNO agreements - satellite operators and MNOs traditionally hate eachother btw) and their satellites need a [specialized satellite phone](https://ibb.co/2PVNdPc) (like that scene in the movie Wall Street) vs. your regular smartphone.\n\n**The Management**\n\nAbel Avellan, the CEO, is deeply aligned with shareholders as he hold 43% of economic rights and is only paid minimum wage. That's what I call skin in the game. Moreover, he is behind most of the key patents protecting the company's technology and manufacturing processes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, the business case seems strong, but what could it be worth?\n\n# How to value this business\n\n>The easiest investments are when you don't need a calculator to understand that it is a bargain - Warren Buffett\n\n**Revenues**\n\nAST SpaceMobile solution aims to target most people on Earth. [There are 8bn people on Earth currently](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/). We can safely remove people from China, Russia, North Korea and the like from this equation (about 1.8bn people, but let's say 2bn just to be on the safer side).\n\nSo that equates to 6bn individuals. Out of these individuals you have people who already have connectivity (let's assume 50% of those - GSMA estimate is 51%), some who are in the usage gap (40% of those - GSMA estimate is 43%) and others that don't have connectivity yet (10% of people - GSMA estimate is 6%).\n\nNow we have:\n\n* 3bn connected people\n* 2.4bn usage gap\n* 0.6bn unconnected\n\nLet's assume some market penetration for each category:\n\n* Connected people in the cities will likely not need ASTS service in their daily life, only perhaps people who hike, go the sea, take the plane from time to time or commute through deadspots. A rough guess could be that 1% of people in that segment use ASTS service regularly.\n* For usage gap people, they likely want connectivity but it is either not accessible everywhere or it is too expensive for them with currently available plans. A good guess is that the market penetration might be much higher for these people, let's assume 5%.\n* For unconnected people it might be even higher, something like 10% maybe, as ASTS is will likely be their only affordable option.\n\nThis is gives us about 210m people that would be monthly subscribers to ASTS service. Let's now make assumptions for the average monthly revenue per user (ARPU).\n\nCurrently the ARPU worldwide is about [$8.5 / month](https://www.gsmaintelligence.com/data/). But ASTS wants to be more affordable than that (and will most likely be).\n\nSo let's group our first segment \"connected people\" on one side and \"unconnected people\" on the other (usage gap + unconnected gap).\n\nLet's assume connected people will pay $6 / month ($3 go to ASTS and $3 go to the MNO in the respective countries). For unconnected people we will assume affordability is a big barrier currently so they will pay much lower prices. Let's assume $2 / month ($1 to ASTS and $1 to the MNO).\n\nIn total we get **$3,240m revenues a year** (we multiply ARPU x months). This is I believe a very conservative estimate as the ARPU is significantly lower than current market and therefore the market penetration might be significantly higher). Moreover, the company management aims for higher numbers (about $6bn for their 168 satellite constellation) but the truth is likely somewhere in between.\n\nLet's keep our base assumption and move to the next part, expenses.\n\n**Operating expenses**\n\nYou have two main components of operating expenses for this type of business: paying your engineers/tehnicians and flying the satellites. The latter is actually quite negligible for a 168 constellation which can be mostly automated.\n\nThey currently have about [566 employees](https://investors.ast-science.com/static-files/659b5e67-3374-4dbd-a60f-86b59c8eba76) working for them (of which 386 FTEs). Let's conservatively assume they still need to double the workforce to 1,000 employees and they pay on average (technicians, engineers, back-office people) an average of 100k a year or even 200k a year. Let's assume the latter as you want big brains in the company.\n\nThat's $200m a year in personnel costs, we can add $40m for other expenses such as rent, energy, flying the satellites etc. So in total we have **OPEX of $240m a year** (92% EBITDA margins).\n\nYou might think these type of operating margins are insane, but they are quite common in these types of businesses (look at American Tower or other satellite providers if they didn't need to sell antenna dishes or satellite phones). The significant part of the costs are in CAPEX, so let's talk about that.\n\n**Capital Expenditures**\n\nYou actually need to build the constellation in order to generate those revenues. The constellation will consist of 168 satellites as discussed earlier. Management estimates the costs per satellite to be between $10 and $15m. (These could significantly be lower if SpaceX manages to start launching their Starship launch vehicle).\n\nAt $15m a pop, we have total capex of $2,520m. **Let's round that to $3,000m total constellation capex** just to be on the safer side (you know inflation and what-not). This is quite conservative as it is almost 2 times what management expects to pay for the constellation. But better safe than sorry. You can also compare that with Starlink's projected costs of $20-30bn for the whole constellation.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nNow, the big question remains. How much is this business worth?\n\nYou pay $3bn for a constellation that conservatively generates about $3bn in EBITDA every year (with the constellation lasting about 7-10 years). Let's look at a comparable business such as American Tower.\n\nThey generate generate about $5bn in EBITDA and trade at 24.5x EBITDA (EV/EBITDA multiple). If we use this multiple in our case, we get a Enterprise Value north of $70bn (about a 46x current price - company is worth around $1.5bn currently). Even at a very conservative multiple of 10x EV/EBITDA (S&P500 average is between 15x to 17x, Iridium - more capital intensive and less profitable is 16x), this is still a 20-bagger in just a couple of years.\n\nDisclaimer: this is obviously a very rough valuation and you can make other assumptions if you'd like.\n\nThis valuation does not account for expected growth in number of users, ARPU and expansion of the constellation to more than 168 satellites. If we take a more bullish stance, I strongly believe this could  become a 100-bagger if the company executes over the years.\n\nIf you want other opinions here are a few Target Prices (my estimates are more conservative):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Current Price|Target Price|Bearish|Base|Bullish|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Deutsche Bank|$8|$32|$6|$35|$86|\n|Barclays|$8|$29|N/A|$29|N/A|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, a 100-bagger obviously does not come without any significant risks so that's what we will discuss next.\n\n# Key risks that need to be accounted for\n\n**Funding risks**\n\nAs of right now, the company is only fully funded for the Equatorial Phase of the constellation (first 20 satellites) - thanks to the SPAC (with little to no redemptions unlike many others). This phase will already generate significant cashflows thanks to highly profitable business model but will likely not be enough to fund the whole constellation. Therefore, it is important to consider the different avenues for funding:\n\n* Capital raise: this is likely to be honest (as any high growth transformational company - a good example is $TSLA - however Tesla's business model is much more capital intensive), but there are a couple things to consider as well:\n   * First, the shareholder who will be most hurt by dilution is Abel Avellan (the CEO), he owns 43% of the company and is only paid minimum wage. Skin in the game. This is likely to minimize the use of such funding.\n   * Second, even if they dilute the shares by 50% (highly unlikely) this is still between a 10x-50x opportunity.\n* Warrants: they can raise >$200m with the warrants they have already issued.\n* Debt/loans: their business model will be quite stable (typical of the industry). Thus, they will likely be able to get advantageous loans in order to fund the constellation.\n* Government grants/subsidies: bridging the digital divide (bringing connectivity to everyone) is a strong priority for every government and is a primary topic on any political agenda. This will come in many forms such as the recent [$9B 5G Rural Fund](https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-441408&f_number=SATPDR2020041300034) (US example), and many other grant programs in all the countries across the world (Starlink got more than $900m in funding from grants). It will come as funding for the constellation, subsidies for end-users smartphones (especially for the unconnected part of the market), etc. This is also likely to be a major catalyst once the technology/business is de-risked (more on that later).\n\n**Technology risks**\n\nA proof of concept has been provided by their initial prototype BlueWalker (BlueWalker) and the fact that one of their competitor has been able to also connect to regular smartphones from space. Another de-risking event will happen with the launch of BlueWalker3 later in June this year.\n\nASTS is the holder of more than 2,100 patents and patent claims designed to protect their intellectual property. While this may not guarantee that they won't be imitated it gives us some protection and moat around the business.\n\nVery informative [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUm3PyiLU0E) on the technology. Another [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3talrmxiQ) from ASTS.\n\n**Launch risks**\n\nAST SpaceMobile does not launch its own constellation. They are reliant on large launch providers in order to complete their constellation (such as SpaceX). They have already [agreements in place to launch their satellites with SpaceX](https://ast-science.com/2022/03/09/ast-spacemobile-announces-multi-launch-agreement-with-spacex/) (it explains the recent price movement).\n\nThe company has been very clever in designing their satellite to be able to launch aboard Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. Moreover, they are able to launch their satellites with other Starlink satellites reducing their reliance on overbooked Transporter rideshare missions (few times a year) and allow them to book launches way more frequently (almost weekly Starlink launches since early this year). This is very significant as Blue Origin has booked most other launch providers and their is a crunch on launch services since nobody is willing to launch aboard Soyuz russian rockets anymore.\n\n**Regulatory risks**\n\nASTS needs regulatory approvals in every country to provide their service. They are helped by local MNOs in order to fast-track approvals (and navigate regulatory hurdles) and most of these approvals will come closer to commercial service in early 2023. Any regulatory approval will be a significant derisking event and catalyst.\n\nAll of the above are potential sources of delay that need to be accounted for.\n\n# Protecting the downside\n\n>Heads I win, Tail I don't lose much. - Mohnish Pabrai\n\nIf everything fails, with this company isn't worth 0.\n\nI will quickly estimate the price floor for the stock based on three things:\n\n* Cash and cash equivalents as of the [last 10K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001780312/000095017022005212/asts-20211231.htm) are $324m\n* AST SpaceMobile holds a 51% participation in a highly successful private company called Nanoavionics (the revenues you will see in the 10K are consolidated from that subsidiary). There are no market price for that company but they grow very quickly (108% from 2020 to 2021) and are likely worth anywhere between $300m and $500m, 51% of that is owned by ASTS.\n* They hold 2,100 patents and patent pending claims that could have some value (maybe).\n\nTherefore, I think the current floor might fall somewhere between $600m and $800m or in stock price that would be $3-4. A 50% loss in value is much better than most of us here anyway.\n\n# Imminent de-risking events and catalysts that will likely close the gap with the business intrinsic value\n\nNow comes the good part, why invest in the company now and why is it so undervalued (other than being a deSPAC with high growth potential)?\n\n**BlueWalker 3 Launch**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6sywdsg3gnu81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fcbbbc13231e8648f123cdf3b8538680c5ca83f\n\nThe [launch](https://ast-science.com/2022/03/09/ast-spacemobile-announces-multi-launch-agreement-with-spacex/) of their latest prototype - called BlueWalker 3 (or BlueWalker3, a smaller version of the final design) on which they have been working for the past 3 years this summer will be the main de-risking event of the company. The prototype is fully built and is currently undergoing final testing before the launch with SpaceX later in June 2022.\n\nThe exact launch date could be announced any day but will likely come early-mid May (price went up almost 100% when the launch agreement with SpaceX was announced).\n\nThe satellite will undergo major testing in many different countries across the world and will educate the final design (mainly on the software side) for the BlueBird constellation (to be launched early 2023 as mentioned before).\n\nThis event will be the first major event of the company since it became public and put a lot more eyes on the stock.\n\n**Regulatory approvals**\n\nAny regulatory approvals and market access approvals in are major de-risking events from a commercial standpoint. The most imminent approval will come from the FCC on BlueWalker3 testing (CEO is confident in receiving the approval before the launch later in June - but this is the FCC).\n\n**New MNO agreements**\n\nNew MNO agreements are likely catalysts as BlueWalker3 is launched and as we get closer to commercial service. A recent example is the agreement with [Orange](https://ast-science.com/2022/03/25/ast-spacemobile-announces-collaboration-with-orange/) (>200m subscribers). ASTS already has enough agreements but the more the merrier.\n\n# Final comments\n\nMy parting words will be; do your own DD. This is a long-term play (not a get rich quick scheme). This is not financial advice.\n\nThere are many more topics I could have gone into but I tried to keep it short, sweet and balanced.\n\nThank you to all the awesome people who provided help in researching this company.\n\nTL:DR;\n\n* AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS) is the first and only company to build a mobile broadband connectivity constellation (read the DD if you think this is another Starlink copy cat).\n* The business model is likely able to target a massive market of more than $1T with highly attractive margins.\n* Overall, while the business contains various risks, I believe the risk/reward ratio to be massively favorable. This is a potential 100-bagger (will play out over the next few years, you degenerate) from where I stand.\n\nPositions: [40,000 shares](https://ibb.co/XWYSgkz) (bought 5,000 more since last time).\n\nSee you in a year for another update.\n\nEdit: typos", "id": "u7s7lm", "created_utc": 1650445474.0, "score": 227, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 210, "comments": [{"body": "!remindme 1 year", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "I can tell you that the DD I read of ASTS 1-2 years ago when it was still a 10$ SPAC sounded about just the same... now it's 8$.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I remember reading about it last year too, but it's at a very low price atm, so I'm tempted", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "Was $11 a few weeks ago, shit will be volatile for the next 2-3 years I am guessing", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "The actual trading float is not very large. \n\nThis will rocket on positive news (as the run from $6 to $11 in response to the SpaceX multi-launch agreement news shows), and dip harshly on news of any delays (or even just lack of activity and allocation away from risk/speculative tech by investors).", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nope once tech is proven the only volatility will be on the upside..And barring any further setbacks that should be by this fall.
