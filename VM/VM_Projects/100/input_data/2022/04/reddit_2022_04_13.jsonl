Inflation did not cause the great depression.  Inflation used to be normally around 4-5%, so that was normal back then.\n\nWhat caused the great depression was the same thing that caused the 2008 banking crisis: Too much leverage.  Banks were not regulated in the 1920s, so when they got into investing they leveraged up massively, which caused them to fail and instead of the US gov bailing the banks out there was bank runs.  These bank runs caused a large chunk of the middle and upper class to lose their life saves even if they had never invested.  This caused companies to fail, because banks held company loans, so companies left and right went under when the banks went under and then suddenly you had 25% of the population unemployed with no new companies opening up because the surviving banks had no money to loan, so no new jobs opened up while everyone was struggling.  Companies slashed income by 50% due to customer shortages and that's how you ended up with massive deflation, which turned into a decade long spiral.  It was so bad families, parents and kids alike, would eat one meal every 48 hours.  Starving and hunting was normal.  When a recession hits you have deflationary pressure.  When a depression hits you have larger deflationary pressure.\n\nIn 2008 banks were deregulated in the 90s due to both the Republican senate at the time and Bill Clinton.  Clinton later said it was the worst mistake of his presidency.  Banks leveraged tits up, a crisis happened, and instead of letting banks fail like in the 1920s the gov bailed them out.  Even with the bailout it was the worst financial disaster since the 1920s and will most likely be the worst of our lifetime.  Even if during the Trump administration banks have since been deregulated, with this still fresh in their minds they're not going to leverage up like that again.  Give it 30-60+ years once the mistakes of the past have been forgotten.\n\nedit: https://youtu.be/Y3AM00DH0Zo", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I think the CRA had more to do with it than bank deregulation.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Inflation usually is a precursor to a sell off .

Anyone who rages for/against him is similar to 5 and 1 star Amazon reviews, I simply ignore them. \n\nTo answer your question he's had battles with the SEC and there's a lot of context that needs to be understood before drawing conclusions. He is taking the battle personally and believes they've suppressed his right to free speech. I see both sides in this one because while I don't agree with a lot of what he tweets, he never lied. SEC is notorious for doing an overall piss-poor job of tackling the major issues that face investors.

The share price was on a trajectory similar to a SpaceX rocket during that period.\n\nWe don’t know when he started buying.  For all we know, he owned 4.7% on 3/7.  So with that, let’s look at price history.  Price was up and down from 1/24-3/14, ranging from 32.14 to 39.08.  During that period TWTR makes a big jump end of Jan, but similarly to SPX futures.  From 2/2 to 3/14 TWTR drops a bit but there is always someone buying the dip, and then someone selling the rip, whereas SPX futures was in a steady slide.  In a 5 day period from 2/23-2/28 price rose 10% from 32.28 to 35.95.  By 3/8 it drops to 31.90 and then spikes another 8% in 24 hrs to 34.50 on 3/9.  It seems reasonable that he may have been buying during those periods, but we really don’t know.  Over the next 5 days (3/9-3/14) price drops 6% to  ~32.47.  So far, assuming Elon was buying during that period, he was buying dips and driving price up, and then others are taking profits.  So Elon was the source of many profits that otherwise likely would not have existed.\n\nSo by 3/14 he has ~$1.6B in a 5% stake at a cost ranging btwn 31.90 and maybe 36-37.  Prob not that high, but we’ll go with that.  On 3/14 ES futures open in a slide and continue down 100 pts, but TWTR has begun an ascent with a trajectory similar to that of a SpaceX rocket, and that continues until 3/30, starting at ~32 and climbing to $41.  So Elon drops another cool $1.4B in a 2 wk period with the price moving up the vast majority of time.  Using rough numbers and guestimation, Elon pd an extra ~$87M  on his final 4% stake, which is, on avg, ~3% higher than his avg cost pre-3/14.  The argument that he withheld information so that he could save money doesn’t hold water, and the fact is that shareholders benefitted from having Elon buying the dips.  It is ONLY thanks to Elon that the share price didn’t drop to 25!  \n\nWas he wrong?  Absolutely.  But the fact remains that shareholder benefit far outweighed any alleged benefit to Musk.So he was wrong.  OK.  Fine him.  End of story.  The alternative would be that he could have made the disclosure by 3/14 and there would prob have been some incremental price increase, but honestly nobody would be THAT excited about 5%.  And so he would have waited for price to return to low-mid 30s and buy some more.

For those who have been misled into thinking war is somehow good for the economy it is time to take a reading field trip to Investopedia.com\n\nWhen money and productivity have to be spent to replace things or repair something that should already be working then they are lost. That money is not creating something new or invesing in the future. If that thing that is broken or needs replacement was intentionally damaged then that is a cost and not an investment. \n\n\nIf suddenly Amazon warehouses spontaneously ignite and need to be repaired that is not a benefit to AMZN nor the American economy nor the world economy. If someone went around destroying delivery trucks around AMZN distribution centers that would not be creating jobs for the economy and would not be adding to anyone or anything it would be reducing overall productivity. Instead of AMZN expanding distribution it is delayed while trying to fix what it **already had**.\n\n\n*The broken window fallacy argues that there is no economic gain from fixing the destruction caused by a certain event. Even though capital will be spent to repair any damages, that is only a maintenance cost that does not spur the economy in the long run, as it is not a true increase in economic output. The money and time spent on repairing damages could be spent on more productive goods and services. In war, resources are diverted to creating weapons as opposed to using those resources to invest in areas that could increase actual economic output.*\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/broken-window-fallacy.asp", "id": "u2ryuy", "created_utc": 1649861182.0, "score": 163, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Its a social thing to make people become a collective mind hive.\n\nThe primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of *doublethink*, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work. The world of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward.\n\nThe essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. \n\nIn principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. \n\nBy the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter—set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call ‘the proles’. \n\nThe social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.\n\n- Emmanuel Goldstein, *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM*, Ch. 3 'War is Peace'", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Unless those resources and capital were idle, which was the case during the Great Depression.

They become thin, but survive.\n\nThe following year, the flooded ant is farming again. However, he owes money to the birds and must pay 1/3rd of his annual income over the next three years to the birds instead of spend it on repairs. The repair ant doesn't owe the birds money, but his income is reduced due the indebted ant spending less on repairs. The American ant, after making a killing the previous year, does poorly because a) his farming competitor is supplying food again; b) the other two ants are poorer and are now spending less on food; c) the reduced food demand has caused an overall drop in food prices, so the birds are paying less for his exports.\n\nAfter five years, the three ants hire an accountant.

But anon what is negative gamma and negative delta, worry not little retard Daddy BGC is here to help.\n\nNegative delta is the number of shares that are needed to be shorted in order to hedge selling a put position, eg: -0.67 = 67 shares short. why is this important? because everyone is now loaded to the tits with puts on most indices and shitcos, the Market Makers selling the puts will have to hedge that position and are now short the stock.\n\nGamma is the rate of change of delta, so higher gamma means a greater increase in the rate of delta, for put options it's the same but the delta is negative. Now, why is negative gamma important? because right now we have a fuckload of negative gamma set to expire on the indices and that will lead to massive decreases in negative delta leading to Market Makers covering short positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The gamma\\/delta profiles for SPY](https://preview.redd.it/590txq8k57t81.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=5946cf43a82ae310e7f2edaf30ed57aafdcc9805)\n\nNow for the retards in the room on the graph it shows we have around -5 BILLION delta on SPY (Billion with a B) that's a lot of shares that are short. We also have around -1 Billion net gamma.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs many of you know theta takes without asking and many a retard's account been blown up buying 0DTEs, this is important here because as theta decay exponentially increases we have the value of put contracts decreasing much more quickly as we approach the end of the day. This would cause people to sell their puts leading to a reversal on the indices as market makers rehedge and cover shorts as people sell their puts, this is known as the charm effect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe also have a double OPEX both on Wednesday and Thursday so we should see heightened volatility so swings up are exacerbated especially given how much negative delta there is.\n\nWe are likely to see another massive bear rally and if there is any good news or the fed walks back a bit we will see SPX 4520 before Thursday's close.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[OI and Volume for SPY](https://preview.redd.it/wnx4lf9o77t81.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&s=463306c5316561d841c254d0e949ba06b28f1b71)\n\nThe same goes for Tech and Semis they are all shorted to fuk as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Vol surface plot for SPY puts](https://preview.redd.it/g95zsvf287t81.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=806c2fd88988275c441f5fdbdf2bf224d09c4a2a)\n\nThe IV for puts is around 25% greater than calls furthering the case for a massive bear rally in the next two days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Another face-ripping bear market rally incoming, BEARS R FUK BUY THE DIP\n\nPOSITIONS: 30 APR 14 445Cs going to add a lot more when/if we dip on Wednesday", "id": "u2erj4", "created_utc": 1649813505.0, "score": 383, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 260, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|154|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u2erj4)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u2erj4)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "OP uses 3d charts, trust OP", "score": 440, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)", "score": 146, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "And… this ☝🏼", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Bro all that shit doesn’t apply here.

{"title": "JPMorgan Profits Drop 42%, Bank Writes off Russian Assets", "selftext": "# Pre-Markets: JPMorgan (JPM) Hits New 52-Week Low!\n\nThe nation's largest bank by assets said it earned a profit of $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share, down from a profit of $14.3 billion, or $4.50 a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results missed the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, who were looking for JPMorgan to earn $2.72 a share, according to FactSet.\n\nMuch of JPMorgan's profit decline came because, the year before, the bank released more than $4 billion in credit reserves tied to the improving economy and waning COVID-19 pandemic. For more than a year, JPMorgan and other banks had been releasing the funds they had socked away to cover potentially bad loans. Those releases had boosted the bank's profits significantly, but investors knew these one-time bumps in profits were temporary.\n\nNow JPMorgan is going in reverse. The bank set aside $1.46 billion to write off its assets tied to Russia as well as assets that have been negatively exposed to persistently higher inflation. The bank said most of the Russian exposure was in its investment banking division as well as its asset management business.\n\n\"We remain optimistic on the economy, at least for the short term – consumer and business balance sheets as well as consumer spending remain at healthy levels – but see significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine,” said JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon in a statement.\n\nJPMorgan is the first of Wall Street big banks to report their results for the first quarter. Analysts expect Wall Street will report a modest, but noticeable, hit to its profits as banks individually report their exposure to Russia. JPMorgan had a modest business in Russia. Citigroup, which had both an investment bank and a consumer banking business, will report its results on Thursday.\n\nThe volatility in markets the first three months of the year due to Russia's invasion as well as inflation also negatively impacted the bank's trading desks. JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank posted a 26% decline in profits from a year earlier. Investment banking revenue and fees dropped sharply, as companies put deals on hold. Stock and bond trading revenues also declined.\n\n[CLICK TO ENLARGE CHART](https://preview.redd.it/9efrumedfat81.png?width=1467&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b4654ad8917a156d4a1ac5609c848ba1f3629a)", "id": "u2orq3", "created_utc": 1649851480.0, "score": 713, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|62|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|36|**Previous DD**|[x](https://banyanhill.com/i-think-pot-stocks-will-rise-1000-in-2022/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rwoq61/cwbhf_insiders_issued_125000_shares/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sd9k59/vampire_fangs_next_target_are_fat_juicy_faang/) [x](https://i.redd.it/8yywpknpcmu71.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q6lg2q/stocks_short_squeeze_rating_jumps_to_983/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q3wmii/whales_are_buying_cwbhf_what_is_your_opinion/) [x](https://stockscan.io/100-popular-stocks-robinhood) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwu3f/its_time_to_look_at_cannabis_stocks/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sdz9g2/the_following_10_stocks_have_short_sale_borrow/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u2orq3)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u2orq3)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "im in the process of moving to a homeless shelter", "score": 196, "replies": [{"body": "Transitory ?", "score": 96, "replies": [{"body": "They prefer the term \"migratory\" now, like birds.", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "A group of squids is called a squad 🦑", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "A bunch of crows is called a murder.
