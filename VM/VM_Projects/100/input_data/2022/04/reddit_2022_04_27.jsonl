And even though the premium is higher, you have a much greater chance of being ITM. Pay attention to your breakeven as well, since it factors in the collected premium. 30-60 days isn’t as long as you would think. Of course it is way better than a call expiring in a week or a few days, but your timing of the expiry is also an important piece of the option play you choose. We still have upcoming rate hikes.

In terms of decay, theta decay is more impactful no matter what once you reach 30 days to expiration, regardless of being ITM or not. At 30 days the extrinsic value will begin to decay much faster. This is why you should always choose options IMO no less than 3 months out. I personally try not to buy anything less than 6.

This goes for all the big banks, so there’s more money supply (loans), which means the rates and requirements for loans are somewhat eased.

No QE means zero purchasing of bonds. \n\nAnd QT is the exact opposite of QE. You only start QT once you fully stopped buying bonds through the QE program. In a QT program the central bank not only no longer buys up bonds, they also let current bonds mature (money has to be paid back to the central bank, reducing their balance sheet) and actively sells bonds to regular banks.

Tesla has still shown TREMENDOUS year over year and quarter over quarter growth in sales numbers, with no signs of slowing. Their demand is so insane that ordering the basic model puts you on an approximately 9 month wait, and that wait time is only getting bigger, not smaller. All the while they keep raising prices in an attempt to stiffle demand and it hasn't even worked but has given them more profits.\n\n2. They have navigated ship shortages much better then all other auto manufacturers by far. This raises costs for others who are trying to keep up, and allows them to sell more then others are.\n\n3. It is clear the the demand for EVs is only increasing at an exponential rate\n\n4. With an increasing demand for EVs, it does not matter that competition is catching up. \"BMW already has a better lineup of EV's\". Do they? If they truly did, the demand would reflect it, but they aren't selling to the same capacity. If tesla controls say 75% of the EV market, and the EV market is 10% of all cars sold, it does not matter if 5 years from now tesla only controls 30% if EVs have grown to 50% of all cars sold. They will still grow because the entire sector will grow. 75% of 10% is 7.5% of all cars sold. 30% of 50% is 17%, which is still a growth of 2x.\n\n5. Profit margins are increasing to the point of being competitive with Apple. 30% profit margins is unheard of for a car company, and is almost triple the industry average (10%)\n\n6. Robotaxi potential if (in my opinion, when) FSD is completed for real. This is a completely untapped market and whoever captures it largely first will be the leader and profit margins for this will be tremendous. Think uber but without the requirement of a driver, which is the majority of uber's cost. Instead of it being a $40 uber to go 30 mins to a bar, it will be $15-20 and half of that will be profit.\n\n7. Tesla is more then just a car company. They are battery tech. And their batteries are far ahead from everyone else.\n\n8. Supercharger network costs are lower then all other companies, and superchargers are a factor in what EV you buy. Why buy a comparable BMW Ev when the cost to use the tesla supercharger network will be 1.5-2x as much? More revenue for non-tesla EVs goes to tesla for use of their network, AND theres a big incentive go to tesla over others.\n\n9. Improved solar panel potential\n\n10. Tesla insurance has insanely competitive rates due to their data driven car that can to a very high degree predict accidents very accurately, allowing them to charge far lower then other insurance companies. They're in the process of rolling this out.\n\n11. They STILL have not spent a dime on advertising, cuz they don't need it, which leaves them more money for R&D.\n\n12. Listing in SPY and QQQ, the markets biggest indices available in the US, means that anyone buying broad market indices is going to be buying tesla indirectly. This is huge for the stock in general because it is tied more heavily to big tech and the market in general, as opposed to being an individual volatile stock that is not listed in major ETFs\n\n13. Using last quarters earnings revenue as a benchmark, and 30% profit margin which rivals apple, they are pulling in roughly half the revenue of apple with a similar profit margin. Apple at a 2.5 trillion $ market cap means that tesla at a 1 trillion $ market cap is actually cheaper then apple.

But given that Amazon just purchased a ton of ULA and Arianne flights paired with future New Glenn flights to launch Kuiper, One Webb launching on F9s to establish their own constellation, Rocketlabs talking about potentially being a constellation deploying launch service +/- having their own, it's entirely possible that SpaceX may simply choose to keep Starlink in-house; and opt to remain a fully private entity, never selling.\n\nPlus, China also has gone on public record where it intends to build a multi-thousand satellite orbital shell similar to Starlink for it's own nation. China also has allies across the world it would offer that capability to. There's many more players emerging in the market, and one of them is a nation state *itself.*\n\nAgainst that kind of capital and capability, and with the revenue potential of Starlink world wide and now potentially integration opportunity with airlines, cars, Twitter, etc, remaining as one entity might make more sense.\n\nIn which case, any one of us could save tons of money and it won't matter because SpaceX will remain private forever. Plus, Elon has said that Starlink won't IPO until it's in the black for several years. Currently, they're still building the network, and scaling it won't be possible until Starship is flying by the dozens per month, which is at least 2-3 years out.\n\nSo, mathematically, the earliest hypothesis for an \"IPO\" consideration of this entity would be 2022 +3 (starship+Starlink) +3 for in the black and building up a ~$1-2Tn war chest for Mars colonization aka 2028. Add in 1-2 years of buffer due to regulations changing, potential accidents and investigation downtime, and 2030 is my guess for earliest talks of actual IPO. 2032-2035 realistically.\n\nWith that in mind, while my \"plan\" is to do that for above, it's so far away, that it's purely fluff. It's more a dream than anything else, and while I hope to live a long and healthy life, this nearly a decade out.

Well, if you look at the product capabilities of the Boring Company, there's an option for freight tunnels.\n\nEverything here after is speculation:\n\n1. Consider future gigafactories don't have material ingress at the ground level. Instead, there's direct boring tunnels from centralized material stores instead. The same platform that makes the robotaxis, is copied into a freight skirt that has 3-4 model 3 motors where it's 4 motors, 90% battery, 10% FSD. It's purpose is to move freight from this source directly into the factory ingest. The same Starlink dispenser concept for Starship is applied to freight. Where Tesla creates a custom container for their resources. Everything is packaged in a standard at the source and shipped by these boring tunnels on these FSD freight sleds. They arrive, connect with the factory, transfer. While they are transferring, the batteries will be recharged. Because they'll be empty minus the container mass, the FSD can travel 1.5-2x velocity on the return trajectory relative to arrival. This means that the space that is dedicated to gigafactories for roads, truck load/unload, permits for traffic management, regulatory costs around that, the people cost for getting materials, signing, the truck drivers, **all that**, goes away. The sheer overhead savings of this, theoretically, is massive. Plus, it could lead to the same level of production efficiency improvement the same way 4680, tabless, and DBE (from Maxwell Technologies) brought to the table (ala battery day). It could be anywhere from a millions to hundreds of millions of annual cost that's removed from the balance books, and that becomes money that can be reinvested in r&d, expansion, and all around growth and supporting the company/employees.\n\nThat's just one. There's likely others, I haven't really sad down and considered. Tesla is involved in the following sectors:\n\n* Energy\n* Biologics (filters for air/germs)\n* AI\n* Robotics\n* Gigascale manufacturing\n* Silicon Engineering, Compute, and (potential) DNN training hyperscalar service offerings\n\nSynergies options:\n\n* Aerospace: gigacasting alloy is made with partnership with SpaceX. SpaceX uses model 3 motors and battery packs for control of wing surfaces and grid fins on SS/booster, avionics, and internals. Moon and Mars rovers and other vehicles, transport services, all but guaranteed that any cargo SpaceX pushes will heavily leverage materials from Tesla as the m3 motors and battery packs have insane torque and efficiency per watt hour and any mechanicals build off world will benefit immensely from the tech, etc.\n\n* Boring: as mentioned above, FSD robo taxi + short/medium distance travel, and in future Hyperloop\n\n* Neuralink: integration of the bmi with Optimus so that paralyzed can leverage robotics to assist them or act as second limbs. These become vehicles, literally and conceptually, to facilitate integration with Tesla where you can summon your vehicle with your mind or request a robotaxi with your mind, far future options are too esoteric to take seriously at the moment (too \"sci-fi\", let them make the bot proper and I'll revisit this)\n\n* Twitter: +FSD, you can setup a secure communication with your car via API keys and VPN links, you can \"tweet\" instructions to your car to come/go, drive to grocery store where the screen displays the number or auth qr code the grocery person has to scan to get payment and confirm that groceries have been deposited, plus internal camera snapshots action taken (as an option)--applies to other store via Tesla Appstore ecosystem too. 30% cut from each of that, recurrent stream potential is vast, this in addition to Tesla's becoming loanable assets that generate revenue\n\nTo name a few.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "This did not age well 😣", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Eh, it's fine.

Has been replicated many times over. Healthcare laws were loosened massively in the early COVID days and are now tightening. Teledoc is intended to perform an “all in one” healthcare package…doctor/mid level visit, charting, video/audio capabilities et al. However, many physician practices and healthcare systems have their own similar platforms which conform to state law, state licensing, pharmacies, etc. TDoc was brilliant in the moment but is now pretty obsolete in my opinion. In-person encounters are increasingly expected and state licensing compacts are going back to what they were. For example, during the pandemic height, states issued reciprocity to all of the other states’ medical licenses. Now there is tightening back to more specific requirements for state licensing. For example, I am in Texas and Texas does not acknowledge reciprocity with any other state. During the pandemic, a Texas doctor could work and/or provide telemedicine services to any other state and vice versa however now a Texas patient requires a Texas licensed physician. Not to mention pharmacy/prescribing rules…there are a ton of telemedicine platforms now which are customized to the individual practice, templates, prescribing patterns, etc. In my opinion this does not bode well to Teledoc at least as it pertains to use in the States.

Nothing prevented the painful losses from being incurred by those short sellers who ended up having to close out their positions at stratospheric price levels.\"\n\nYet, [a recent investigation reveals how the vw short squeeze 'distorted' the stock the market](https://today.ku.edu/2021/11/02/investigation-reveals-how-porsche-vw-short-squeeze-distorted-stock-market).

This makes sense, because hedge fund managers have to liquidate other assets to buy to cover GameStop.  So, it doesn't matter what comes first: the chicken or the egg.  They happen together.\n\nToday, the NASDAQ fell 4%, which puts us at the beginning phases of the GameStop squeezarooski of 2023.

Also there is the fact that I could find employment at a variety of places within my field of study with different opportunities and benefits.\n\nCapitalism also takes power from the government and gives it to the people. This makes it hard for a government to enact it's control over its people. Most fully socialist countries are authoritarian and have less freedoms compared to capitalist countries.

However, I do agree there are more freedoms, especially perceived freedoms. Like sure you can choose what fief you want to work for, but the result is always the same. The serf is extorted to produce more than they retain for the benefit of the duke to collect off the top and deposit as profit to the fiefdom. Then pay its dues to the king and court.\n\nAlso you may say you could go and make your own fiefs, sure. But can 287 million fiefs exist? Sure, but that would be socialism by that point as all people own the means of their own production and none could be exploited for profit. However, now there is a required separation of class where many are forced to do things they don't want because it's needed as a \"job\". While an actually free system in this case would allow for automation of such jobs with modern technology without hurting society or those who used to perform the job as they are no longer desirable.\n\nWhile I agree capitalism does take power from the government, I disagree it gives it to \"the people\" I bet there are plenty of people who feel like they have a significantly reduced input on government authority based on their capital.\n\nA recent case of this complaint is the comparison of America being an Oligarchy because of its ability to be in debt to businesses and the rich. Since those less well off has less to offer, legislation will continue to favor those with more money, and therefore more power.\n\nAs for the socialist countries becoming authoritarian, it makes them less socialistic. As by then, production, distribution, and wealth is not commanded by the community but the government.

Surprisingly someone has been buying a ton of 04/29 $120P. Maybe speculative apes?\n\nOver the last couple days in the run up to earnings, IV has gone from 40% to 160%, and will likely continue to 200% by market close.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gr319apt72w81.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=a83af45d80fd23c708b542ad2cfefb60670b30fc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFB is also quite far from its delta neutral (Green line). Most recently, delta neutral has been a point of resistance. That may continue to be true for foreseeable future. Notably, the increased put buying has brought delta neutral down.

It's possible all this dropping is priced in from the previous quarter. It's also possible that Meta's headwinds have accelerated and further future statements will paint a more dire picture of the company.\n\nRemember that the cost of IV crush will be massive. So you need to pick a strike price that you reasonably expect will expire ITM.\n\nSo with that being said, these are the positions I intend to open before market close:\n\n* ~~04/29 155P at $2.75 or less~~\n* ~~04/29 157.5P at $3.00 or less~~\n* ~~04/29 160P at $3.25 or less~~\n* 04/29 160P at $4.50/share\n\nUnclear to what point I can get fills at these prices, but I'm going to try.\n\nEdit: Doesn't look like I'm gonna get filled at the prices I want.\n\nEdit2: Stock price went up and probably hit the high for today, so bought 04/29 160P for $4.50. Not ideal, but this is probably the best price I'm gonna get. Need FB stock to be at \\~$155.5/share at market open to break even.\n\nEdit3: Rip my puts.

They have such deep market penetration that growth in users might not be much going forward in any case.\n\nMore importantly I think AI was going to help them continue to increase dollars realized per active user which is simply a huge opportunity for them still.\n\nAs to the Metaverse stuff, not sure the big deal. It works and pays off or it don't and they still have a great business.\n\nWith the decline in share price the PE ratio is ridiculously low and if I am right that they are not in decline as some predict the company is ridiculously undervalued. Q1 earnings will be either show there is a decline in their business or it will show the concerns from Q4 were unwarranted.\n\nBased on Q4 numbers my expectation is the stock should trade 290-370 (20-25 forward PE Ratio), but even taking a conservative approach with a 15-20 PE ratio the price should be between 220-290.\n\nMy plan was to hold till around 300 per share.

Lol.\n\nIn any case, from my comment above I did note RIVN might impact short-term and accordingly I would not have bought calls. I did also note that cloud will have strong growth and the numbers they reported bear that out. For the record I think the weak income on the retail side is what is moving the stock more than the RIVN stuff, but that is just my guess.\n\nI still think AMZN is a good long-term investment. I think the cloud business will easily justify a market cap of 1T+ within a few years and their massive retail business, despite any short-term numbers, should long-term only improve justifying the current share price and then some.
