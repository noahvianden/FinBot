I'm going the boring-but-solid road of automatically investing a fixed portion of my income each month so that I don't even have to think about it and absolutely passively build up a nice amount of shares over time. Also this is supposed to eventually (in about 20 years, calculating with an average 5% annual return after taxes) generate a cashflow that will allow me to “retire”.  \n**What I’m thinking of doing**  \nI’ve been diving head first into everything I could find about options and tried to get a good understanding of it. One thing that particularly struck my attention was the Poor Man’s Covered Call (PMCC). Maybe this could be an upgrade to my current strategy?  \n**Here’s how I would want to run it**  \n\\- Buy DITM LEAPS options of a broad ETF (like SPY for example) with a \\~0.97 Delta and an expiration date of 2 years out  \n\\- Sell Covered Calls with a strike price of 1 standard deviation above the current market price, a \\~0.85 Delta and 30-45 DTE  \n\\- Take profit on the CCs at 50% profit  \n\\- If about to be assigned on a CC, roll up and out  \n\\- If the stock price is down close to LEAPS expiration, roll out  \n\\- Rinse and repeat  \n**Here’s why I think this could be a good idea**  \nMy current approach is basically the lazyman’s approach since I’m not picking stocks or analyzing anything. I did my due diligence about the ETFs once and now the investment runs on autopilot.  \nI feel like with just a little more involvement I could improve on this strategy because:  \n\\- Capital required for controlling 100 shares with LEAPS is far less than buying the 100 shares outright  \n\\- The CCs could generate some additional income along the way  \nHowever, there are so many variables to this that I cannot fully grasp and I fear that what I find “simply logical” is in fact super misleading. That fear is backed by me reading about buying and holding a broad index fund being the best strategy because no-one can beat the market consistently anyway.

Thank you for your time and explaining this to me.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> Question 1- what happens when price goes above your selected strike before expiration but then comes back below your strike at expiration?\n\nUsually nothing. The thing to understand is that it costs the exerciser the time value of the contract when they exercise. So if they would make $2 off the shares by exercising but they would lose $3 of time value by exercising early, who would purposely take a -$1 loss for no reason?\n\nTime value approaches zero on expiration day, which is why most exercising happens on expiration day.\n\nSo as long as the time value of the contract is \"relatively large\", no exercise will happen. How large is relatively large? Think of it this way: How big of a dollar bill would you be willing to take out of your wallet and set on fire? $1 sure. $5 maybe. $10 now that's getting silly. $20 no. $50, are you crazy? $100, gtfo! It's the same process when someone is deciding to exercise early, assuming they know what they are doing.\n\nThis makes clear why there are some exceptions, like the shares are about to pay a dividend. Using my example, exercise gains $2 on the shares, loses $3 in time value, **but** suppose owning the shares makes you eligible for a $1.50 dividend? Then the net gain is +$.50, which would be worth doing. So early exercise of specifically calls sometimes happens shortly before ex-dividend dates.\n\nIf the stock price is below the strike of the call at expiration, the exerciser loses money on the shares if they exercise, so again, there is no exerciser in their right mind that would do that. Even though time value is guaranteed to be zero at expiration.\n\n> Question 2 - would it work, from purely a premium income perspective, to select the strike price (one month out) the same as the cost basis?\n\nAbsolutely not! Do not do this.\n\nTry to select a OTM strike that is above your cost basis. If you end up holding the CC until assignment, you want to make some kind of profit on the shares, right? Setting it to the cost basis ensures you make no profit on the shares at all. Setting *below* the cost basis is even worse, since you lock in a loss on the shares on assignment.\n\nSome people rationalize poor strike selection by taking consolation in the credit received. If they lock in a $2 loss on the shares by writing $2 below the cost basis, but get a $2.10 credit, they pat themselves on the back for being net profitable. I hope it's obvious why that is dumb. If they had instead taken a strike that is $2 *above* their cost basis, even though that might only pay a $.69 credit, they still net $2.69 on assignment.\n\nLater on once you are more experienced and learn more about the trade-offs, you may find it necessary to write strikes closer to or even below your cost basis, but that would be for a very specific purpose where the inherent costs are understood and a lesser evil than not doing so.\n\n> such that i would incur no capital gains from the sale of the stock and just pay taxes on the premium i received at the initial purchase?\n\nLet me recast this question in a different context and see if that helps.

Any thoughts?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Don't use \"in the money\" to mean \"currently profitable for me.\"  ITM has a specific, narrow, technical definition when it comes to options.  It means an option has intrinsic value.  This means that, for a call, the spot price of the underlying is greater than the strike price, and for a put, the spot price of the underlying is below the strike price.  That's all it means.  It doesn't make sense to say that a butterfly is \"in the money,\" because at any given time at least one leg will be ITM and at least one will be OTM.\n\nMax profit is a *theoretical* value that occurs *at expiration only.*  It is the amount of profit you will have made on the trade if all legs *expire* at a price that is maximally favorable to you.  For a butterfly, this means that the underling is exactly at the strike of the middle leg.  In this case, that's 1090.  Think about what happens in that case.  The short 1090 puts are not assigned.  The long 1085 put expires worthless.  The long 1095 is exercised, and you sell 100 shares of TSLA at 1095, shares which you can currently buy at 1090.  That's a $500 profit.  Subtract the $15 you paid for the trade, and that's a $485 profit.  That's your max profit.\n\nExcept that can never actually happen.  For one thing, exercise/assignment occurs after hours on Friday.  You can't actually buy the shares until Monday morning.  You could buy them Friday in after-hours trading, but what are the chances TSLA is going to stay exactly at 1090, especially with a volatile stock like that?  What if before you know it, it shoots up to 1100?  This is why max profit should be seen as a theoretical value only.  Options traders don't leave their positions open in hopes that they expire with max profit.  They set a profit target (with debit trades like long butterflies, 25% of max profit is common) and close it at that point.\n\nSo, regardless of the current price of TSLA, a trade you just opened yesterday that still has 2 days to expiration is not going to be anywhere near max profit.  If TSLA is at just the right price on Friday afternoon, it might be close, but before that, it won't be.  That P/L diagram your brokerage shows you is at expiration only.\n\nWith TLSA at 1041 this morning, you're currently well into max loss territory.  You opened this position with too short a time to expiration, and too narrow a profit window.  You only make money if it expires with TSLA within a narrow 10 point range.

I just went out a week and the premium was like 2.10  for a strike that was ( i cant remember off hand how far up I put the strike)  But anyway, the very next day the stock came down enough to where that short i sold was already worth 50% profit  , So i bought it back and made the 100 dollars.  Then I waited until end of day when it went up again and sold another call this time premium was 300 ish.. next day, same thing I ended up buying it back for half the amount.\n\nOk I got lucky , very lucky twice..\n\nSo now here is my question.

What do you mean by \"shorting GOLD normally\"? That term means *shorting shares of GOLD* and has nothing to do with options.

I assume a call from all the other numbers you wrote. You could clarify all that by using standard option trading notation, like, \"I bought 1 BRK.B 345c 4/29 for $7.40 back on 4/4.\"\n\n> I could sell it now for a 50% gain making 370 dollar profit.. plus I already made money from selling those premiums.\n\nThat is what I would do. Who cares that you made money writing calls? That's ancient history and should have no bearing on your forward-looking trading decisions. The same if you had *lost* money writing calls.  Each trade should be evaluated on what it's P/L does for you today, with no consideration for what has happened in the past.\n\nMy profit target for long calls is 10% gain, so you are already 5x above the gain where I would exit early for a profit.\n\nHolding longer puts that 50% gain at risk, on top of your original capital at risk. You are risking more for less gain, which is never a good plan.\n\nMore detailed explanation here: \n\n[Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/risk_reward_and_exits)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "sorry about that, I did butcher my explanation.

The rental company, which filed for bankruptcy during the pandemic because of a collapse in demand, has pledged to offer the largest electric rental fleet in North America, and “one of the largest in the world”.The order number represents twice Polestar’s entire sales last year, which were 29,000. The carmaker, which is backed by Volvo and China’s Geely, currently produces its battery models at a plant in Chengdu, China, and is increasing deliveries.EV sales are rising across the world, as carmakers push new electric models to meet emissions targets and as consumers turn to the new technology. In Europe, electric car sales overtook diesel last year, while in Norway more than 80 per cent of new cars sold are battery-driven.Dealers and industry executives say that test drives are critical for winning over motorists, giving them the chance to experience the silent driving and instant acceleration of electric vehicles.Polestar chief executive Thomas Ingenlath said the agreement with Hertz would “bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience”.The first Polestar sales will be this spring for European fleets and later in the year for the US and Australia.“By working with EV industry leaders like Polestar, we can help accelerate the adoption of electrification while providing renters, corporate customers and rideshare partners a premium EV product, exceptional experience and lower carbon footprint,” said Hertz chief executive Stephen Scherr.Last year’s Tesla-Hertz agreement led to a spike in the carmaker’s share price, helping its value top $1tn for the first time, although the stock has since come down.Polestar is planning to list its shares later this year through a merger with Gores Guggenheim, a special purpose acquisition company.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I’m so pissed my ggpi calls expired last month", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'll be very curious to find out if Hertz paid list price for the Polestars or got a deal.

In particular, modeling intersection extents is now entirely based on network predictions and no longer uses map-based heuristics.\n* Improved the precision of VRU detections by 44.9%, dramatically reducing spurious false positive pedestrians and bicycles (especially around tar seams, skid marks, and rain drops). This was accomplished by increasing the data size of the next-gen autolabeler, training network parameters that were previously frozen, and modifying the network loss functions. We find that this decreases the incidence of VRU-related false slowdowns.\n* Reduced the predicted velocity error of very close-by motorcycles, scooters, wheelchairs, and pedestrians by 63.6%. To do this, we introduced a new dataset of simulated adversarial high speed VRU interactions. This update improves autopilot control around fast-moving and cutting-in VRUs.\n* Improved creeping profile with higher jerk when creeping starts and ends.\n* Improved control for nearby obstacles by predicting continuous distance to static geometry with the general static obstacle network.\n* Reduced vehicle \"parked\" attribute error rate by 17%, achieved by increasing the dataset size by 14%. Also improved brake light accuracy.\n* Improved clear-to-go scenario velocity error by 5% and highway scenario velocity error by 10%, achieved by tuning loss function targeted at improving performance in difficult scenarios.\n* Improved detection and control for open car doors.\n* Improved smoothness through turns by using an optimization- based approach to decide which road lines are irrelevant for control given lateral and longitudinal acceleration and jerk limits as well as vehicle kinematics.\n* Improved stability of the FSD UI visualizations by optimizing the ethernet data transfer pipeline by 15%.\n* Improved recall for vehicles directly behind ego, and improved precision for vehicle detection network.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "same as 10.11 I think", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "same as previous 10.11s apparently", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "These are just the same v10.11 release notes, right?", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "an entry in a database.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "After a certain point yes, at this point it still matters a lot how many digits that entry is", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "honestly I'd love another digit on mine, but if I don't get it in my lifetime, I'm not going to be disappointed.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Are you already at seven digits then?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "8", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Congratulations and fuck you :)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, it was 1% self-discipline to save every penny I could for like 15 years and 99% hard work from Tesla employees.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I agree, but you never know.
