Do you truly believe that?\n\nThe stock and the company are separate and you can like one and not the other. Any way you look at it, no matter the type of calculation you go by P/E, P/FCF, DCF modeling, it is overpriced at this moment to get a good return in the long run. It's also predicated solely on Elon being driving factor. If he loved his company so much and their revenue was phenomenal and he greatly appreciated his shareholders as much as his customers whom buy these vehicles, then why does he continually dilute the shares? Have you checked out the share dilution graph QoQ or YoY? We're talking about some of the worst dilution with the exception of true meme companies that are just keeping themselves alive. He uses the shareholders and laughs all the way to the bank when he essentially gives and board approves his company 0% indefinite loans to spend on the company.\n\nI love Tesla and Elon as a company & visionary, don't get me wrong. I want a Tesla despite their quality control issues and the failure to release their FSD software still after continual promises. I think there is still much growth company side for Tesla, but the stock, for the moment and the foreseeable future is drastically overpriced if you actually want a good return over the next 5-10 years. I'm not a hardcore fundamentalist but I try to at least educate myself from a value perspective. In that, you want to evaluate the company, not just the market sentiment for the stock. What you are buying at this price is purely speculatory with a complete disconnect from any fundamental. Right now you are paying for all future cash flow. Most people don't like to look at competition but look at it from a historical sale perspective. There are only so many cars that one can make and sell globally. Compare that to the entirety of the vehicle market in the last 10yrs. Also, look at the potential EVs that are coming from large manufacturers over the next 3-5yrs. While Tesla is ahead right now, there are only so many people that will pay 50k out the door costs for a basic Model 3 with the current rising price from himself (so much for my 38k version). There are only so many people that are going to pay 80k for a truck (what it most likely will cost when it goes to production, lets face it), only so many people will pay 100k+ for the Model S/X. Unless he comes out with a $25k model, a significant percentage of the US population is not going to buy a Tesla vehicle. So, already limited there. I do acknowledge other business perspectives like Batteries, energy companies, and larges amount of other potential licensing deals but there are already other competing companies in all of those spaces. Also, he mentioned an IPO eventually for StarLink so that's not going to be part of $TSLA just like SpaceX is not going to be either.\n\nYou have to think realistically. If you were in the stock prior to the S&P 500 listing and before that 1st stock split then sure, I would say it was a justified P/E and long term investment potential. But, right now the stock at $1000+ is just ridiculous, no matter what YouTuber tells you, or how you think it might be justified. Just do a quick calculation for a return. If you even want a 12.5% reasonable \"historical market beating\" return for the next 5-10 yrs, you are saying the company will make TRILLIONS in revenue. Does that make sense to you?

Not many people are going to pay $80k for a solar roof when you can get comparable and more reliable companies for 1/2 that, be realistic), and at the moment no one is licensing any of the Tesla Vehicle AI software, everyone is deciding to go on their own, and a couple companies are having decent success.

(*ed. note*: The source documentation is from 2008, and the [CPI Housing survey has used 2020 Census Data since 2021.](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ce.html) Additionally, anyone with a solid foundational background in statistics will observe that this sample size is **far** in excess of that required to obtain a sampling distribution with a *p*-value of less than 0.05.)\n\n> It’s also not factoring in capital expenditure inflation, property taxes, interest rates and other closing costs for mortgages. Then you factor in the inefficient regulations that make building anything other than high end units not a possibility and the supply gets restricted more and more.\n\n#Why doesn’t the CPI (Consumer Price Index) include the cost of buying and financing houses as well as property taxes and home maintenance and improvement? \n\nHouses and other residential structures are not consumption items and, therefore,\nshould not be CPI items. All buildings and structures are capital goods, which are\nitems that provide a service. In the case of houses and other residential structures,\nthat service is shelter. \n\n> Soon you get owners leaving their investment properties vacant and just banking on the appreciation, as even charging the full rental increase amount allowed due to rent increase restrictions and differing maintenance is still not keeping up with the other inflationary expenses and they are forced to cap their rent instead of letting the market dictate.\n\n#Price Change for OER and for Rent\n\nUsing the sample of rental units, the CPI calculates a measure of price change for\neach CPI index area for the Rent index and for the OER index. The first step is\nstandardizing the collected (market) rents, putting them on a monthly basis, and\nadjusting them for a number of circumstances that should not affect the CPI. These\ninclude adjusting for any changes to the structure, such as changes in the number of\nrooms or bathrooms or in the type of heating and cooling equipment, or changes in\nthe number of pets. These standardized rents are called normalized rents.\n\nIn addition the CPI adjusts the rent for the effect of aging of the rental units over\ntime. The Housing sample collects the rents from the same housing units every six\nmonths. Consequently, each time the CPI observes the rent of a sample unit it is six\nmonths older. To account for this aging, an age-bias factor1 is applied to the current\nrent; this raises the rent slightly because the older unit is slightly less desirable. For\nexample, a unit with a rent of $900 might have the rent adjusted to $901.\n\nThe CPI assumes that sample units reported to be vacant are transitioning to new\ntenants. Experience with rent data has shown that units tend to experience rent\nchange when the tenant changes. To avoid missing this rent change for vacant\nunits, the CPI performs a class-mean imputation to estimate their rents. The estimated\ncurrent rent of a vacant unit is its previous rent times the average rent change of\nnewly-occupied units. For example, if the average rent increase for new tenants in\nan area was 5 percent, a currently-vacant unit that rented six months earlier for\n$1000 would have a current estimated rent of $1050. \n\n> A mom and pop owner who has two houses renting out one may not be able to cover both mortgages and potentially a long and an expensive eviction process due to social policy restrictions incentivizing them to invest in a different investment vehicle. \n\nA sad story, to be sure, but not relevant to the CPI calculation methodology. \n\n---\n\nTL;DR: the economists responsible for calculating CPI have, believe it or not, systematically accounted for each of the concerns that you have raised with he determination of Market Rent and Owner's Equivalent Rent in the core inflation index.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1st point: We simply fundamentally disagree about your fundamental statistics. It’s economic theory you believe in the Keynesian theory where I believe in a more Austrian approach. Do you really believe that the 1990 Census taken with those numbers as a frame, then boiling it down 32 years later to a mere 32,000 houses to represent inflation of a whole country’s rent, has no wiggle room for a lie of statistics so that people with a foundational background in statistics would be able to agree on how it’s obviously correct? Even on the same street houses can have so much variability, let alone comparing one neighborhood to the another on the opposite side of the city. I’ve been in a good amount of units throughout a county both residential and commercial and it’s just to much of a difference. Then you compare county to county and even wider. Ambiguity to say the least. \n\nPoint 2: I don’t care what category you or anyone else want to put it in because they simply won’t get an accurate picture of inflation and they don’t when it comes to rents. It’s kind of my point that it’s not in CPI, but it is but it isn’t, but still people consider CPI inflation on how our economy is handling inflation and allowing monetary policy to interject and try to play market god to correct which is all just a bunch of nonsense. Your over complicating a simple reasoning. Have you seen the purchasing power of homes go significantly down since about 1933 when we got off the gold standard? Yes or No? \n\nThere are metrics that they try to factor in this and that, but they simply can’t, and the reality is in the results.  Not the words some people say, no matter what position of authority they may argue from. The market will always self correct in one way or another and it may just be hard to see in this capital goods category of shelter compared to inflation of real estate as an assets. Especially if misjudge real estate and your not familiar with seeing different ownership styles in so many areas. Just one example: Is someone going to report having mold in a rental unit when saying their low rent? What about the owners who want a well qualified tenant and rent at a lower price? What about the owner who wants a high price for a moderate house and get it? Different tenants live different lifestyles. What about the fact that a lot of people are in at least a 1 year lease so there is a massive delay of at least that in current market inflation which a year is a lot? They say rent doesn’t change significantly until between tenancies. I would say that’s way to individualized to tell.  Now we’re seeing even more of higher increases during tenancy since If owner gets their property tax raised, vendor costs increased, insurance, HOA fees go up, etc. so they won’t want to eat those costs and potentially even have negative cash flow because so the market corrects and the inflation is passed through as inflated rents. Owners may also have variable interest loans versus a 30 year fixed which could potentially affect rent increase decision price and insurance increases\n\nPoint 3: Sample not big enough and government not smart enough to capture the whole rental market let alone real estate as an assets when it comes to inflation.

I could of picked when we got off the gold standard to the housing prices now which makes it more obvious. If we looked at a historical chart of all major assets (gold included as a metric), compared to each other versus the US dollar, the inflation of asset pricing (real estate) shows the predicable result of the monetary policy implemented ex. QE1, QE2, QE3, to now QE infinity. Unnaturally raising and lowering interest rates instead of allowing the market to correct, which we all know is a great strategy looking at the returns of a lot of top stock traders and most of individual traders and how their portfolio perform’s over the long term compared to the return of just putting it all in the S&P500 according to data. Most can’t beat the market even as top professionals in the field. Heading in the direction of stagflation as they fail to raise interest rates at the same rate that paces inflation. The World Economic forum was talking about exploring negative interest rates in some European countries which Japan has been implementing and some are saying not to get deeper into negative rates. The CPI that just came out was 8.5% just saying and not even true inflation it’s going to be hard to even net even without riskier and riskier investments if inflation holds long term as we the dollar slowly diminishes from being the world reserve currency.\n\nAll those variables you listed for supply and demand are reasons that Real Estate has currently inflated significantly in price on top of the inflation of assets. A lot of those factors in my opinion result in local policy, federal monetary + social policy, and global policy combining as the economy is an eco system. It’s obvious how much inflation has risen prices over time adjusted when you think of a young person starting off at any point past 1933 (year of getting off gold standard) and a young person is 2022 and look at their purchasing power when it comes to assets, let alone majority of other categories, leading to even less purchasing power of assets as their are other essentials first. In California, I see inefficient regulations and permitting processes while also implementing tighter rent control, higher property tax, and less property rights. Getting rid of 1031 exchanges and capital gains tax even as well, potentially. What does that signal to the market? A lot of the immediate impact is determined from social policy but the monetary policy is always in the background playing its role in inflating asset prices. Should the citizens who worked for their wholes lives for their money get to control it, or can central banks implement policy that can create inflation but are disguised from the average person for a long time before they realize their wealth is draining and while make themselves richer. Rich people generally have more assets and don’t get affected by inflation compared the average American and depending on how many assets they have may even benefit if they sell before any collapse. It might be too late by the time the average American realizes how much inflation is impacting them but right now people can see it.\n\nI can tell by looking at the rising major asset values, gold included as a metric, on historical chart compared to cash and adjusted for inflation and there’s a difference. Real estate is inflation protection if you have a 30 year fixed rate as banks eat the inflation and the individual owner benefits. This leads to higher asset prices which are only compounded by inefficient social policy that leads to development not keeping up with population growth= lack of supply but high demand and then long term lack of supply for rentals and a hyper demand as investors are more discouraged to buy a property and rent it out versus leave it vacant and hold it for the appreciation as the risk of renting it out becomes greater and the opportunity costs of other investment vehicles becomes bigger.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I was addressing food and gas specifically.

Consequently, in short, with the Street modeling TSLA’s sales/EPS growing from $17.8bn/$2.72 in 1Q22 to $19.597bn/$2.50 in 2Q22, we DO NOT believe this news is priced in (our contact believes TSLA could lose money in 2Q22 vs. the current Consensus est. that they will deliver $2.50/shr in EPS [or $2.873bn in net income]).\"\n\nGLJ's contact in China, when asked if the factory will close longer than just through the end of April, said:\n\n\"Yes, it will shut for a minimum of 4-6 more weeks and most likely at least June 1 absent recession of the Dynamic Zero Covid policy. I also expect re-ramp to take 2-3 days for every day the factory is closed. So a closure through May won’t have Shanghai back to full production until late Q3. It’s a non critical factory (food, medicine and military) and mixing people from multiple districts is strictly forbidden because then every district would have to go on lockdown. My best case estimate for Q1 production is 190k. And that’s based on a mid May open. I fully expect the quarter to come on around 160k and be a loss.”\n\nJohnson says he thinks that Tesla's Shanghai plant is >100% of the company's profit and, if this becomes obvious, that the views around Tesla's other factories' efficiency may come under pressure”", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">But analyst Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research is forcing that issue into the spotlight, writing in a note to clients on Monday that on the ground contacts are telling his firm that Shanghai may be closed for a prolonged amount of time.\n\nImagine paying him lol...oh wait no one does\n\n>I also expect re-ramp to take 2-3 days for every day the factory is closed.

With commodity driven input costs, yes your margins are getting crushed. However, if you have scale and you're in a business that is not incredibly price sensitive, you can pass those costs on dollar for dollar. Also depends on your distribution channels and what you're selling. For the most part right now, prices of all goods and services are higher for both elastic and inelastic items/services. If there has ever been a time to increase prices, now is the time. The customers will take the price increases unless you're in a hyper competitive commodity market. The price of lotion is up and the competition for lotion is fierce. Same thing for tooth paste and other consumer staples. You think Kimberly Clark cares about passing along a price increase for toilet paper? No! You think even if customers noticed, they'd stop buying toilet paper? No! It's middle market disposal income type goods that suffer but increases can still happen there too. Same with the luxury goods and services markets. Ultra high net worth individuals are not sensitive to price.\n\nFollow supply and demand laws. Increase prices until demand slows down and prices drive the new supply/demand equilibrium.\n\nNow, I'm not suggesting you push through price increases because that is part of the problem. Inflation is a perpetual cycle that feeds on itself until there is no available disposable income, then there is a recession. After that, then there are necessities, once those become unaffordable, then there is a crisis which will lead to an overall price collapse and deflation followed by depression.\n\nThe cycle  continues...each time, shorter and more dramatic from peak to trough.\n\nYou experiencing cost increases for material is smoke and mirrors. It's all one big game to transfer wealth every 2-5years. The companies that are part of the S&P 500 have had record profits and none of the issues that you have. They experience cost increases and pass them right along to the consumer all while increasing wages only slightly. Margins have compressed a bit but not much.\n\nThe big companies are winning. The small business owners, depending on the industry, are not. However, everyone is a price taker right now so the small businesses have an opportunity to set pricing for favorable profit margins.\n\nThe labor market deserves better and corporations have the funds to cover increased labor costs. The material costs and other indirect costs will decline over time with supply chain easing but prices are going to be pretty sticky in some areas which equals higher profits on the backs of under paid labor. It's even worse in a recession because companies get \"lean\" to cut costs, work the existing employees harder, and generate the same or higher profit.\n\nI'm an entrepreneur and have worked in corporate finance and banking since 2004. It's a big game and the ones at the top always win. Just raise prices, wait for volume to stabilize at the new price level and pay your people. They'll work harder for you. The reason people leave is:\n\n1. Culture\n2. Their direct manager\n3. Lack of engagement\n4. Unsatisfied with the work\n5. Lack of upward mobility\n6. Money\n\nIt's not just money. Money alone, will not bring in quality hires and money alone will not keep people there. Many people left and got unemployment during the pandemic because they were in service jobs that dealt with othe people directly. The were either laid off or furloughed. You can't get unemployment if you leave voluntarily.\n\nOther people that did leave voluntarily from service jobs probably did so because they were afraid of getting covid. If they had enough saved up beforehand, they made a cost/benefit decision not to expose themselves to the pandemic directly.\n\nOn the product and manufacturing side, same thing just less extreme. White collar and office jobs largely went remote so the impact to inflation via unemployment was minimal.\n\nInflation was the result of the fed lowering the fed funds rate to 0% and buying US treasuries mortgage backed securities. The interest rate is the price of money which basically went to zero for almost 2 years. Buying 10yr, 20yr, and 30yr notes kept burrowing cost low for corporations and buying mortgage backed securities kept mortgage rates low. All of that is unwinding now. Also, the government issued direct stimulus checks three times, increased spending on health rated items for covid and stated aid for its covid relief packages, extended student loan moratoriums, and provided evidiction moratoriums. These things are the drivers of inflation. Unemployment is at the lowest level in history at the same time mortgage rates were the lowest in history. Plus supply chain issues because of globalization and outsourced labor. Soooooo many contributors. Not people not working during covid. The wealth and wage gaps continue to persist and inflation/deflation does not help on either end.

There were just under 500 thousand homes available for sale last month.  In 2018 there were about a million homes for sale. For supply to meet demand we would need roughly 1.5 million homes.  There simply are not enough development projects in the works to come close to that figure in the near future. \n\nWhich means the wealth threshold for ownership will continue to increase and push would be Buyer’s out of cities into lower cost markets for them.  Take someone in California as an example making 200k a year working remotely.  When that individual sees a 500k 2000 square foot home it instantly sparks interest because that same house goes for 2.5 million where they want to live in California.\n\nThat’s not the entire issue though, developers have continued to focus on low to mid low density projects in high density environments. Imagine building 100 large homes in an area that requires 4,000.  That would mean only the top 2.5 percent of earners in a given area would be in the running to purchase a property. You need to consider that 10 percent of purchasers will be second home owners and investors which will further cut the field of potential buyers.  Now with interest rates increasing people are hoping values would go down.  The issue is the people who have just got cut off from the market were already unlikely to buy a home because bidding wars have been happening at a higher income bracket than their own.  There is also the issue that those would be Buyer’s are now resigning rental contracts driving rents higher and increasing the value of rental properties as a whole. \n\nThere is a constant fear cycle that is taking place among homeowners regarding home values as well. Committees in cities across the US, but substantially in California, have utilized zoning to restrict building to protect home values.  Cities want to see themselves as the next Beverly Hills and purposely design their regulations to push out poorer residents to attract wealth and professionals.  Current residents will complain their cities are changing any time they see a construction site. Common themes are, “That big ugly condo building is ruining the look of our city.” “There isn’t enough water for all these new people that will fill these homes.” “Where will all these people park? The traffic is going to be so bad.”  “All these out of town era are ruining how my city used to feel.”  All of these comments lead to highly restrictive building designed to limit growth and push property values higher.  \n\nEvery article about a potential bubble spreads fear among constituents which drives protectionist regulations to limit development, which drives supply shortages, which drives values higher, which causes more stories about bubbles, which drives more regulation as developer limits and so on and so on.  \n\n Now everyone is upset about the issue and complains there is too little affordable housing, but when new developments are purposed housing authorities will come in and restrict development because development would mean less demand for existing homes.\n\nThat’s what has been happening in much of California.     \n\n That’s before considering inflation been high over the past two years which means tangible asset values will increase with inflation.  Inflation is also not static across the market. New rents are mixed with existing rents to determine those numbers. It’s not simply the difference between what someone signing a lease today vs a year ago would be. Which means many starting new leases may face 30 percent increases in rent vs their neighbor still working through their two year lease.    \n\nSomething else to consider regarding resale. If you bought a home a year ago with a fixed payment protected from growing prices for the next thirty years and you could afford it, why would you sell and rent?\n\n  Renting is the alternative, but from a practical standpoint if you own a home and are deciding your next move, seeing rent prices skyrocket will give you pause. Should I really take the cash and have rent price uncertainty? Inflation is high which means those rents will go higher. The mortgage is fixed at a low rate. Why sell only to pay more?\n\nAll this to say, until supply can meet demand, we won’t see stable prices.

The Legislative Analyst’s Office (LAO) tried to separate these factors and concluded that, to avoid extreme price increases, the state should have been building 70,000 to 110,000 more housing units beyond what it actually built in each year from 1980 to 2010. Summed over the whole 30-year period, this shortfall comes close to the 3.5 million new homes Governor Newsom has said the state needs by 2025. California has not been matching the LAO’s number. Average annual production has actually slowed, from 147,000 per year in the first decade of the century to just 71,000 per year since. Construction dropped almost everywhere, but the drop was larger outside the expensive coastal counties (Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego, as well as the Bay Area). And while the pace has picked up recently, it is not enough to overcome the years of lag.”\n\nHow bad is this shortage? Here is a graph:\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ACTLISCOUCA\n\nIn January there were 23,615 homes for sale down from a high of 94,734 in October 2018.\n\nSo the question is how bad is it nationally. Well here is the Redfin data of all markets as a whole:\n\nhttps://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-home-prices-rise-most-since-summer/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=1033387&inquirySource=365\n\nNow one may say active listings are low because homes are selling so quickly driving inventory down, however if you notice listings have been dropping year over year. People are holding property.\n\nHow about those builders? Builders work through to the end of projects, before they start new ones. Part is because of capital limitations, part is labor, and part is materials. This means that even if developers want to build more housing they can’t. They are stuck waiting. Delays increase the cost of a project which pushes price requirements to hit required profit margins. Which means the incentive to build middle class and low income housing is not there. As a result they only take on high margin projects which take longer to build, a low density, and take longer to complete. All of which fails to fully address housing shortages.\n\nNow about California markets, let’s look at LA’s issues specifically:\n\nhttps://www.acceinstitute.org/thevacancyreport\n\nThe gist of the report is that the market is very much controlled by the wealthy and corporate interests. The shortages are very much by design to ensure growth in equity that can be used to finance other projects and produce residual income.\n\nHere is another link highlighting the job growth numbers over the last decade compared to available housing:\n\nhttps://www.stessa.com/blog/states-building-least-new-housing-relative-to-job-growth/\n\nThat’s 2.5 million jobs created while providing less than a million new homes over the last decade in California.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "> Now one may say active listings are low because homes are selling so quickly driving inventory down, however if you notice listings have been dropping year over year. \n\nthose statements do not contradict each other at all. people knew 3% interest rates would not last. that's the reason for FOMO offers on every property. and listings are down by an insignificant amount, after last year was basically the work-from-home shuffle across the state. the bubble is popping now as california has actually lost population over the last 2 years while houses have become less affordable than ever, which will be amplified as interest rates continue to rise.

They bundled a bunch of these mortgages together into CDOs (say, 80% junk status & 20% decent) and then paid rating agencies to give them AAA status. Although they were worthless. Then they sold these bundled mortgages to unsuspecting investors. \n\nThis is why houses became so expensive: you didn't even need income to get a mortgage. Anybody could get one.\n\nThis time it's not the same, this time the cause originates from the low interest rates following the '08 crisis and the expanding money supply. Which is a fancy way to say (asset) inflation. Houses haven't become twice as expensive over the past decade. **Money has lost half its value**. It's also why the S&P500 quadrupled. Not because we're 4x as productive as 10 years ago, but because of a couple of tech behemoths & inflation. \n\nOnly now inflation is catching up to consumer goods (CPI) caused by shortage supplies etc. It partly amazes me it has taken so long. But in general, assets start to inflate much faster than consumer goods (houses, stocks etc) because it's impossible to produce a lot more of those in a short period of time.\n\nThe reason why consumer goods will lag behind in terms of inflation compared to assets: It's very easy (relatively speaking) to create more toothpaste by scaling up production. Until supply chains break due to a pandemic...\n\nThe reason prices will not go down after the supply chains are fixed, is because it's going to take multiple years to get the supply chains back to the required capacity. (In addition and this is VERY important to realize, we're going to enter a decade of energy shortage; we should've built wayy more nuclear reactors during the past decade) Anyway, people are going hungry, because of 'transitory' inflation. The inflation does not remain 'transitory' because people are going to go to their bosses and demand wage increases. Which in term causes the bossman to increase his prices, further fueling inflation. You see how this creates a feedback loop.\n\nAt this point, it seems unlikely to me that we can avoid annual inflation rates between 5-10% until the end of this decade. The FED can raise interest rates but 1) there is a significant lag between raising rates and having significant impact on the economy 2) current inflation is largely caused by the supply side, which isn't as easily influenced by the FED as the demand side. 3) there are limitations to where interest rates can be hiked, as many countries have 100%+ debt/GDP ratio's and annual government deficits already. If they raise interest rates above 5%, the US government will default. \n\nThere's little doubt in my mind that if you have 100k USD sitting in your bank account right now, by 2030 it will have lost half of its purchasing power.

{"title": "Where One Falls, Another Rises. DWAC To The Future - The Information Bubble Of A Lifetime", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n# Not financial advice. Manage risk.\n\nGoing to do another full DD since the last one I did was in December and we've learned a lot since then to say the very least\n\nIf you're going to click off or say something because of FUD I encourage you to read the FUD section first before responding to save us all some time of reading your old debunked information.\n\n# The Basics\n\nTrump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is a company aimed at\n\n* Social Media (like Facebook and Twitter etc.) - TruthSocial\n* Streaming Services (like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Discovery+ etc.) - TMTG+\n* Alternative news (like Fox, OANN, newsmax etc.) - MxM app (Don  junior's new app, merger unconfirmed)\n* Possibly other general webservices (like Stripe, Amazon Web Services, etc.), not going to talk much about this in this DD, something to watch for in the future. See agreement with Rumble\n\nAgreement with Rumble (~~32~~  45m+) users for a youtube alternative and hosting services for Truthsocial etc. and it is speculated there may be other aspects of the company.\n\n# SPAC Structure\n\n$DWAC is in a definitive merger agreement with TMTG to take it public. After the merger is complete DWAC shares will be worth roughly 37.21 M / 193.4M (shares post merger) **\\~19.2% (dilution factor of about 5.2 or around 80.8% dilution)** of the company. This means currently at \\~$48 a share the current marketcap is priced in at \\~9.6B . Shares will automatically be converted to the stock ticker symbol $TMTG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ej6aby395t81.jpg?width=729&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7736963bc0de81800eff4a846aa61929a8fa8a64\n\nThe PIPE funding is the largest in history and will provide them with about $1B plus $300M from DWAC's trust. We'll talk more about the PIPE and potential investors later\n\n# Basic Sector Understanding\n\nCompared to its competitors Truthsocial has massive upside potential. For starters, TWTR IPO'd with zero profit for a marketcap, adjusted for inflation, of 30-40B . From our math from before, this translates into a \\~3x-5x the current share price of \\~$48, $162-216 a share.\n\nNow let's take a look at the competitors\n\nIn October 2021 right before the TMTG announcement\n\nFB Marketcap: 910B\n\nTWTR Marketcap: 50B\n\nPINS Marketcap: 34B\n\nSNAP Marketcap: 85B\n\nNFLX Marketcap: 295B\n\nPresent day\n\nFB Marketcap: 528B\n\nTWTR Marketcap: 26B\n\nPINS Marketcap: 14.5B\n\nSNAP: 46B\n\nNFLX 150B\n\nThis translates into\n\nFB: -42%\n\nTWTR: -52%\n\nPINS: -57%\n\nSNAP: -54%\n\nNFLX - 49%\n\nCompare this to the Nasdaq\n\nQQQ only -11.5% since Oct 20th, 2021\n\nWhat this means is these companies should of only collectively lost\n\nFB: 105B; TWTR: 6B; PINS: 4B; SNAP: 10B; NFLX: 34B\n\nInstead they have lost\n\nFB: 382B; TWTR: 24B; PINS 20B; SNAP: 39B; NFLX 145B\n\nThis a net difference of\n\nFB: 277B; TWTR: 18B; PINS: 16B; SNAP: 29B; NFLX: 111B\n\nFor a grand total of $451B loss in only just under 5 months.\n\nWhere is this money going?\n\nDWAC + 14B\n\nAAPL + 105B at a time when it should be tracking -11.5% benchmark (loss 280B) so a net offset +385B\n\nThere's a lot of nuance to this because there are more companies that are not publicly traded or hard to track because they are apart of GOOG or DIS etc. (to be honest even the AAPL is a hard one to compare)\n\nI'm guessing about $500-600B in related market competitors marketcap has disappeared in net ahead of their indexes since the threat of TMTG's competition has presented itself.\n\nMy latest reasoning for a lag in this flow of capital is liquidity issues and requirements that this smart money cannot dump into DWAC. It's too small a float, even post merger. It's also probably outside of their requirements and perceived risk tolerance since it's a SPAC and hasn't filed an S4 yet.\n\n# Comparing The Fundamentals To Their Sector Competitors\n\nI'm going to start with TMTG+ streaming services **(headed by the producer of America's Got Talent and Deal or No Deal)** since it's a much more simplistic model to users paying the company directly for its services.\n\nNetflix - 214 Million Paid Subscribers (this one has lost some serious marketcap since my last DD, comparable to above numbers for the other sector competitors)\n\nDisney+ - 118 Million Paid Subscribers\n\nHulu - 44 Million Paid Subscribers\n\nDiscovery+ - 15 Million Paid subscribers\n\nNetflix has 167B marketcap compared to 222 Million Paid Subscribes. This translates to about $752 in market cap per subscriber.\n\nLet's say TMTG+ achieves only 23M subscribers with only $600 per sub in marketcap . This alone would justify the current share price based off 14B marketcap.\n\nLet's say TMTG+ achieves only 50M subscribers at only $600 per sub in marketcap. This alone would justify a \\~2x increase in the share price based on a 30B marketcap.\n\nTranslating this aspect of the business you can roughly translate **every 10M TMTG+ subs to an additional $31 in share price.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's move forward to the Social Media aspect\n\nFacebook - Dec 2021 - 2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 917 B marketcap, $317 per monthly user in marketcap. - Mar 2022 -  2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 582 B marketcap, $182 per monthly user in marketcap.\n\nYoutube - 2 B Monthly Active Users (MAU), 500B marketcap, $250 per monthly user in marketcap.\n\nTiktok \\~1B users, \\~400B marketcap, \\~$400/user\n\nSnapchat \\~347MAU \\~ 58B marketcap \\~ $167/user (down from 264 since Dec)\n\nTwitter - 330M MAU, $30.5B marketcap, \\~$92  user marketcap. (down from 100 since Dec)\n\nYou can see that some companies are more valuable than others because of success of monetization. some companies are valued a lot higher per user. Giving these a market cap weighted average is about \\~$275 users/ marketcap (give or take a bit, the markets have been volatile)\n\nI'm going to say TS, given its much higher APRU is going to actually be above average on this list. I said 100 per user back in Dec but given the latest info I'll get into I'm going to put this at 193 for now\n\nThis would mean 100M users would translate into 19.3B in marketcap. So **for about 100M users you can add an additional $100 to the share price.**\n\nLet's talk about the news aspect of the business model.\n\nFox has a marketcap of 22.5B, lets say it achieves 25% of Fox's audience. That's an additional 5B in marketcap or **an additional $26 a share for every 25% of Fox's audience size from news. Or about $25 for every 500,000 viewers.** Also keep in mind Trump's rallies even now are getting a few million live viewers when you count all of his rallies across Rumble, Youtube, RSBN, OAN etc.\n\nDon Junior is bringing an app to market called MxM which is an aggregator app to compete with Apple and Google news it's getting independent funding and may merge with TMTG in the future. Do a quick search on that.\n\nWho knows what other business venture and revenue will be brought in.\n\n# Key Performance Indicators\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qb8ie84595t81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f99d561af3dd32b979dfbadd759c1e60c3f9cbb\n\nHere's a chart of projected revenue from the corporate slide deck you can find the SEC filings\n\nThese numbers are understated to be over delivered, clearly.\n\nTS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -Washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)\n\nFrom the user feedback on Truthsocial so far, it has been demonstrated that users with way less followers are getting way more engagement. Maybe even by a factor of 10x less followers getting 10 x more engagement. This is huge for ARPU (average revenue per user)\n\nTracking Trump's followers from people in the app suggests the App just hit 1 million users in the first month despite being in a highly limited access period where people are getting mostly wait listed. Trump has \\~700k followers using assumption that 70% of people are following Trump. Truth social is currently only available on the Apple App store and in the US for those on the waitlist. This should be opening very soon for web browser, android, and non-us as the infrastructure scales.\n\nExtrapolating this growth rate has been done in a few ways\n\nThe current linear growth rate is something like 20M/yr even in this limited period. Which is astounding\n\nHowever this rate has been increasing rapidly partly due to increase in infrastructure\n\nUsing a very aggressive approach (see the methodology in my post history)  Extrapolating Trump's Follower's Growth Report 3-21\n\n13262e\\^(0.175\\*365.25)\n\nIt says Truth would surpass Facebook in only 71 Days. (assuming 100% following of users.. obviously less days when you use the 70% following Trump assumptions)\n\nLets be a little more conservative and use the polynomial\n\n671.52x\\^2+7553.7x+9074.4\n\nThat says\n\n92M per a year, and that's with obvious near increases back to reverse of rate comparisons saying this will be even higher in the near term.\n\nUsing the 80% assumption this is 131M per year, a number which should easily increase before then (a new faster equation)\n\nAlso noting that this is for the first year. It would increase to a rate of 363M/yr by the second. 814M/yr by the third. And surpass Facebook around the Fourth or Fifth\n\nOf course we'll need more time and data to come in to build further confidence in these models, confidence and data which I believe will shock the markets and potentially serve as a major catalyst.\n\nThe big opening was said to be before end of Q1 so I'm guessing that will be a big uptick in growth allowability in the next few weeks\n\nFor some comparisons\n\nPath to 1M users\n\nTumblr 27 months\n\nTwitter 24 months\n\nPinterest 20 months\n\nFacebook 10 months\n\nDropbox 7 months\n\nSpotify 5 months\n\nInstagram 3 months\n\nTruthsocial 1 month\n\nI have not yet been able to find any service or platform to exceed these rate assuming they weren't using existing infrastructure such as AWS, which TS is not. It using Rumble's infrastructure\n\n# Lets talk about Profit Margins\n\nTruthsocial is actually much likelier to have a much higher profit margin than Twitter because of severely reduced operating expenses, and why TMTG will probably be trading at more comparable ratios to Facebook not because of success of monetization but because of success of low operating expenses.\n\nFirst let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter's balance sheet\n\nStarting on page 43 of Twitter's Annual Report from 2020 [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\\_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020\\_Twitter\\_Annual\\_Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf)\n\nWe can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services, 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue\n\n1.37B Cost revenue\n\n873M in 'Research and development'\n\n888M in 'Sales and marketing'\n\n562M in 'general and administrative'\n\nTwitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.\n\nLet's break this down again\n\nTwitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent\n\n37% on cost of revenue: servers, buildings, upkeep etc.\n\n23% on Research and development: software engineers, sociologists, artists, focus groups (market research) (I believe moderators is in here as well)\n\n24% on Sales and marketing: sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.\n\n15% of general and administrative: executives, legal, finance, info tech, hr, consulting, moderators (in both categories probably), customer service etc.\n\n3% on interest and other: interest on debt financing, operations etc.\n\n29% on taxes.\n\nYes these numbers add to 131% of revenue or in other words a 31% net income loss.\n\nWhy is Twitter so expensive to run, why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money?\n\nLets go back in time to Twitter in 2011-2013 - Here's the same report from that time period. [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\\_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf)\n\nPage 57\n\nGoing to compare to Twitters Monthly active users (MAU) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:\\~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)).\n\n2013: \\~225M monthly active users (MAU)\n\nCost of Revenue : 266 M (\\~330M inflation adjusted)\n\nResearch and Development.(R&D): 593M (\\~740M inflation adjusted)Sales and Marketing 316M (\\~400M inflation adjusted)General and Administrative 124M (\\~160M inflation adjusted)\n\n2011: \\~100M MAU\n\nCost of Revenue: 62M (\\~85M inflation adjusted)\n\nR&D: 80M (\\~110M inflation adjusted)\n\nSales and marketing 26M (\\~36M inflation adjusted)\n\nGeneral and administrative 233M (\\~310M inflation adjusted)\n\nOk so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users\n\n2020: \\~330M MAU\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$4.15 per monthly active user\n\nR&D: \\~$2.65 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: $2.7 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: $1.7 per monthly active user\n\n2013: \\~225M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$1.47 per monthly active user\n\nR&D: \\~$3.29 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: \\~$1.78 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: \\~$0.71 per monthly active user\n\n2011: \\~100M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$0.85 per monthly active user\n\nR&D: \\~$1.10 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: \\~$0.36 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: \\~$0.85 per monthly active user\n\nSo what's alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.\n\nLet's recap\n\nCost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **388% increase**\n\nR&D went from $1.10/user in 2011 to $2.65/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **141% increase**\n\nSales and marketing went from $0.36/user in 2011 to $2.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **650% increase**\n\nAnd general and admin from $0.85/user in 2011 to $1.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **100% increase**\n\nLet's see how Facebook does from their annual reports [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf)\n\nPage 64\n\n2021: FB 2.91B MAU (2,910M monthly active users)\n\n(CoR) Cost of revenue: 22.6B -

This also brings down the cost of office space etc. with remote work and fewer headcount.\n\nThis is one of the things they fear more than even the political ramifications is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare.\n\nIt would be much harder and more expensive to program an AI to be biased towards political ideas instead of more hard set rules of logic. It would require constant upkeep to keep up with flip flopping rules and exemptions etc. An AI would be a much more solid long lasting algorithm if it was free from these ever changing agendas.\n\nIn other words being woke will be obsolete by superior unbiased artificial intelligence. Also selection of ad space being removed from political and PR expense etc. nonsense. The free market will bid up ad-space and engagement to increase naturally from a more exciting and free environment free from biased and expensive bureaucratic moderation and selection.\n\n# Lets Talk Share Price\n\nSo currently the markets are priced at \\~72 a share would would translate to something like\n\n40M TS users ($40) + 8M TMTG+ subs ($25) + 4% of Fox's audience ($4.16), \\~ $69\n\nYou can see this is a bit comical for what's being priced in for a someone who is as well known as DJT who had over 150M followers online and over 71M votes in his 2nd run for president. We've all seen the portfolio trackers and many others get banned off TWTR lately. Pelosi tracker is back up on Truthsocial already\n\nHere's a potential scenario\n\n300M TS users (\\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 25M TMTG+ subs ($77.5) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $429.5 and still have massive room for improvement\n\nMore scenarios\n\n600M TS users (\\~1/5th of facebook) ($600) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $776 a share and still have massive room for improvement\n\nA total blow out of just one of the aspects\n\n1B TS users (\\~1/3rd of facebook) ($1000) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = **$1228 a share**\n\nAnother example\n\n300M TS users (\\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 60M TMTG+ subs ($186) + 100% Fox Audience ($104) ($52) = $590 and still have massive room for improvement\n\nImagine in these scenarios it will be trading for much more aggressive ratios **so**\n\n# DWAC 1000\n\nwith much additional upside after on fundamentals is not a mathematical challenge.\n\n1.5B TS users (\\~1/2 of facebook) ($1500) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \\~**$2000 a share**\n\n3B TS users (\\~1/2 of facebook) ($3000) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \\~**$3414 a share**\n\n3B TS users (\\~entire market) ($3000) + 250M (entire market) TMTG+ subs ($775)  + Above Fox Audience ($400)  = \\~**$4200 a share** along way to go to get there\n\n# Who else is bullish\n\nKevin O'Leary from shark tank has said this is \"going to work\" search of O'Leary DWAC.\n\nSpeculated Possible/Likely of the 36 PIPE investors to be disclosed (another catalyst): Lutnick, Thiel, Musk, Schnatter, Chamath, White, McMahon, Salman,, Steve Wynnn, Bernard Marcus, Roger Penske, Carln Icahn, Rex Tillerson, Lindell . More info about these people in my post history and why, at least in some cases like Lutnick, Musk, and Thiel there is a lot of info to suggest this is probably true\n\n# Short Interest and Gamma Ramp\n\nThere's been reported to be about 4-5M Shares shorted on this low 28.7M float. A recipe for disaster for shorts. Is also on the reghso FTD list\n\n\\~4M in SI and \\~1M in FTD. At least. It's also been hypothesized that the market markers are only holding \\~4-5M shares based on Liquidity Pool (LP) Theory Math (see post history) this would mean the Short to Liquidity Pool ratio is over 100%, reported SI is 13.4%, Days to Cover Ratio \\~2, basically no shares left to borrow (100% utilization), cost to borrow is \\~70% but has been seen usually above 100% and has gone as high as >300% at some points.\n\nThere is massive gamma ramping in danger of happening on call options and float evaporation potential. I won't get into it more here and now, check post history and google search maxpain dwac\n\n# FUD\n\n**Addressing common FUD - Understanding actual risk and nonsensical Fear Uncertainty and Doubt**\n\nI know many reading this will get very emotional both long and short and will look for any reason to make this sound bigger or smaller or impossible or dumb. There's also many people who do not want this to happen for their own personal benefits. So here's some common things that are said and a general counter to it.\n\n**FUD:** \"People won't want to advertise there\"\n\n**Counter**: According to CNN facebook was never at risk of this. This rhetoric never had much grounds in reality\n\n>Facebook generated $69.7 billion from advertising in 2019, more than 98% of its total revenue for the year. And most of those ad dollars don't come from companies like Starbucks ([SBUX](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SBUX&source=story_quote_link)) and Coca Cola so much as the sprawling list of small and medium-sized businesses who use Facebook to attract customers and build their brands.when COO Sheryl Sandberg said the top 100 advertisers represented \"less than 20%\" of total ad revenue.📷The Facebook ad boycott is starting to rattle investors\"Facebook has an enormous number of advertiser clients,\" said Nicole Perrin, an analyst at eMarketer. \"They're definitely pretty reliant on the long tail of small business advertisers.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Even as Facebook confronts by far the largest advertiser boycott in its history, the sheer number of advertisers on its platform may insulate the company from too much financial fallout. At the same time, it remains an open question whether many big and small advertisers can afford to stay away from the powerful platform it built for very long\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"I think it's relatively unlikely that small businesses \\[and\\] small brands will join the boycott, because they're the ones most reliant on Facebook for access to their customers,\" Perrin said.\n\nCNN's website  slash 2020/06/30/tech/facebook-ad-business-boycott/index.html\n\n**Counter:** There will be direct monetization outside of ads (see TMTG+ section) also Companies will have to go where people are advertising with their attention and dollars. It's easy for companies to dissociate from where their ads are located when the free market forces their hand. \"Our ads are located in places that do not represent our beliefs as a company, we are solely interested in providing business to our customers despite their personal identities\" \"\n\n**FUD:** \"\\*The merger might fail or get blocked resulting in this going bad.\"\\*\n\n**Counter**: SPACs don't fail for the reasons described or eluded to by the outlets. [u/independence\\_hall](https://www.reddit.com/u/independence_hall/) has a great post \"The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger\" please see his post history and read it. He did the leg work and debunked this. It's almost a zero chance of happening. See posts  \\*\\*\"\\*\\*An update to my SEC/FINRA inquiry post and possible S-4 timeline \" and \" The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger. Another COMPLETE breakdown of the SEC/FINRA inquiry, and how the SEC ALREADY APPROVED A SPAC MERGER in the past that was sanctioned by the SEC for lying to its investors.\"\n\n**FUD**: The roll out has been slow and unsuccessful\n\n**Counter:** Actually no it has been record breaking and see the part of the DD above about growth rate projections. Anyone who doesn't understand this is comparing to AWS or existing infrastructure rollouts. I have not yet had one person point me to a valid example of a new platform or service rolling out faster at its inception with its own infrastructure. Also this platform was said be rolled out by end of Q1. It is not end of Q1 yet. TS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)\n\n**FUD:** They Have Offices in Wuhan\n\n**Counter:** So do: IBM, Deloitte, EY, Huawei, PwC, HSBC, Walmart, Fedex, Hewlet Packard, Pfizer, Apple, Uber, Starbucks, Procter and Gamble, Cummins, Morgan Stanley, Siems, Byte Dance, KFC, Motorola, Nissan, Alibaba, NIO,\n\n**FUD:** \"Trump doesn't know what he's doing he can't even open email\"\n\n**Counter:** Trump just got over a billion in PIPE funding (largest in SPAC history). There's plenty of well paid people with the right background on the company. Trump is largely here for traction, which is the primary issue all social media companies face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gga6xbf895t81.jpg?width=1361&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9ac72e87543a5f39f77664c4a134d5e3dda3cf5\n\nThere's also an agreement with Rumble to use their services\n\nAlso Lmao, linkedIn etc. FUD is nonsense, these guys are under NDA and are in the top 1 percentile of talent, networks not bound to these nonsense companies are not the sole arbiters of resources\n\n**FUD:** \"This will be GAB/Parler 2.0 failure\"\n\n**Counter:** TMTG+ and the other services are nothing like the markets that these are in. Secondly Parler was becoming massively successful very quickly before it was pulled from the app store and AWS violated contract removing it. Parler is back now. TMTG is safe . Also it's likely Apple and TMTG have a deal since it seems everything is an Apple exclusive at first and their marketcap has been doing well (see that section in the above DD)\n\n>**What Happened:** According to a [Variety](https://www.benzinga.com/)report citing data from the analytics firm **Conviva**, **World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.'s** (NYSE:[WWE](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WWE#NYSE)) **WrestleMania 38** drew a combined 2.2 billion impressions across all social media platforms in its April 9-10 presentation, whereas the **NFL’s Super Bowl LVI** brought in 1.8 billion impressions on Feb. 13.\n\n[https://youtu.be/5NsrwH9I9vE?t=41](https://youtu.be/5NsrwH9I9vE?t=41)\n\n[https://youtu.be/vVeVcVBW\\_CE?t=1291](https://youtu.be/vVeVcVBW_CE?t=1291)\n\n[https://youtu.be/vVeVcVBW\\_CE?t=309](https://youtu.be/vVeVcVBW_CE?t=309)\n\n[https://youtu.be/5NsrwH9I9vE?t=86](https://youtu.be/5NsrwH9I9vE?t=86)\n\n>Everyone wants to know what is on Truthsocial, it is the digital platform for the entire reformed republican party with the midterms coming up. It is highly relevant in the culture war and the reimplantation of fair meritocracy based content (that is aside from politics) the removal of shadow banning, bots, and algorithmic manipulation. There has never been an agreed centralized effort for everyone to regroup. It doesn't become relevant until traction is there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Rumble Reports added 9M users QoQ , 22% QoQ\n\n**FUD:** \"Trump steaks\"\n\n**Counter:** Trump steaks and the other very few things like 'From the Desk' that were unsuccessful account for a very small percentage of his ventures. Those are also very different products in very different markets. Investigate this further if you still think it's relevant, you'll be surprised the actual facts and not what low effort FUDs would have you believe.\n\n*The master has failed more times than the novice has tried.*\n\n**FUD:** \"Myself and other have moral/ethical dilemmas because of our ideology\"\n\n**Counter:** I'm not here to argue with you to try to show you why everything is wrong, it's a simple observation that at minimum hundreds of millions of people disagree with you and there is a massive market for it and a demand.\n\n**FUD:** \"Open source\" \"Bad security\" \"Software licensing\"\n\n**Counter:** Source is released and posted, security is fine. Android and Linux are OS as are many projects. There's billions in funding, tech people have already solved this issues for many other services. The issue is Traction. That's where Trump comes in. Rumor of Thiel involvement (he was raising money for campaigning with DJT junior recently)  I wouldn't be surprised if Palantir is involved in some way for security.\n\nI'll add a lot more to this since I'm sure there will be plenty more to come.\n\n**FUD**\n\nDrop in downloads etc.\n\n**Counter**\n\nIt's in load test phase, and still the fastest growing platform in history. Do your own research, fake news would have you buy Twitter right now while it's about to get clapped.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere's a lot of upside and demand that isn't priced in IMHO\n\nI have shares, warrants, and calls and I believe full launch may cause a massive surge in price expectations once more hard data rolls in (in the coming weeks), if not then by the time the revenue rolls in.  The risks are often nonsensical or overstated by people with strong opposing political ideology and lack of financial and technological understandings.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n# Inverse Cramer\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Not financial advice.
