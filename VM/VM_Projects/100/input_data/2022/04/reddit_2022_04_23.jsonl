{"title": "Can FB keep going lower? In-depth analysis", "selftext": "There's a lot of bearishness around Meta right now, and bearish market conditions going into next week. A lot of fair concerns with the company as far as smartphone ad restrictions, slowing growth and overinvestment into the metaverse. Hence analysts project an abysmal 2.51 EPS, would be a 35% decline QoQ. I think there's a case to be made this thing has overshot to the downside. Down another 15% just in the past 3 days on a market downturn/NFLX scare. \n\nIf you look at FB's past earnings and the fundamentals, things look perfectly okay. Last earnings weren't great for a few reasons but not bad either, their revenue and Monthly Active Users made all-time highs. But the big news was that Daily Active Users declined for the first time, from 1.93m to 1.929m.. Yep, a QoQ decrease of 0.05% and the stock dumps $237 billion of market cap in the most cataclysmic fashion possible. \n\nNow here we are trading at a P/E ratio of 13.63. That is rock bottom for a profitable tech stock which puts up consistent earnings and also has plenty of avenues for growth even if the metaverse endeavor falls flat. At this multiple I'm inclined to believe the concerns are overblown for the future of this company. Even in the depths of the 2008 recession, ad spending only went down 13%. Wouldn't necessarily expect that again, and ad spend is still rotating away from traditional media. All indications say ad spend is fine in Q1 2022, at least.\n\nHere's a rarely mentioned fact, India is FB's largest democratic with roughly 329m monthly active users vs. 179m in the US. So FB has all this selling pressure from recession concerns, when India is the fastest growing major economy in the world. May face headwinds from global downturn, sure. But nice to see the INDA (India ETF) holding up really well atm, just as another data point. Also, FB has little to no headwinds as far as supply chains or inflation like other names. They're positioned well going into an economic downturn. Another fun fact, people tend to value their relationships more when money is tight, and spend more time socializing. Also more time at home. FB could perform well in this environment. \n\nSo overall, could we miss the already terrible 2.51 EPS projection and dump more? I guess, but we have a major trendline at $160. Would be very surprised if it dumped beyond there even on bad earnings. How much more do you want it to dump at this multiple? For reference, NFLX was at a 31 P/E ratio before earnings, now 19. FB at 13.63? Hard to see a lot of downside, it's not a utility stock.. It still has some growth potential, but basically all of that has been priced out now. Already trading well below the P/E ratio of SPY at 21 and QQQ at 28. Lots of upside potential, limited downside. Below $160 is concerning in the short-term. \n\nSo for all you FB bears out there, can you find me another large cap stock like this with global growth potential trading at a P/E less than 14? Or any profitable large cap tech stock? Please show me how wrong I am that this stock is underpriced. I'm always open to see more data or learn something new. \n\nI'm in a small call option lotto play for earnings, $235 5/6.", "id": "u9tddr", "created_utc": 1650675132.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": ">India is FB's largest democratic\n\nI think you meant demographic...

Who do you trust?\n\nAMD still has the best server products (by far) and only has 20% of market share. The market share of intel and amd will invert in server, if amd's tech remains superior. The 5 year roadmap of AMD looks very good. Even if there were Zero growth in server over the next 5 years, AMD's server business has plenty of room to run. But of course, servers are growing like a weed. There will be contrarians who say that ARM and AAPL/AMZN homegrown servers will reduce sales, but they are just two companies. There are literally thousands of companies who have need of high throughput computing-- even companies like Specialized, a cycling company, is using HPC to model how they design their bikes. Modeling/machine learning is absolutely booming in application, from protein shape modeling, drug interactions, to aerodynamics, optimizing power grids/water supply for crops, etc. There is efficiency to be obtained, there are cost savings to be had.\n\nAMD is not just a gaming company, not just a crypto enabler, not just a niche server market of programming nerds. But even in personal computers, the same can be said about market share. Even a flat sector could still have room for considerable AMD growth. Intel's products for personal computers are much more competitive for now, but we will have to see what this year brings. Intel has clung to performance by blowing out the watts, and still wins on single core performance, at least last I checked. However, the world is getting more multithreaded, not less, and I see more avenues opening up for power-thrifty and multithreaded amd cores. Both will have a place, but again we are talking about market share here. \n\nI think the market is being absolutely ridiculous right now, treating AMD's share price as if there were 30% dilution without any revenue/earnings growth-- the XLNX acquisition. There was also the expiration of that 1-time tax credit in Q4 2020 on our 1-year performance, so it \"looks like\" everything is going downhill if you google AMD (everything is red). And then they say the sector is downcycling. Terror. Panic in the streets! Dump the shares!\n\nA few things that I think will happen:\n\n1. Intel has a poor earnings report. People think the sector is slowing down. Maximum Fear of Morons hits.\n2.

This stock is certainly looking good for the long run.  A 'pull forward' doesn't mean that purchases are permanently reduced.  It means demand may temporarily be impacted for a quarter or two.\n\nAMD's enterprise, embedded and semi-custom business is about 50% of their revenue... so while I agree with what you're saying, PCs and GPUs are still a large part of AMD's business.  A slow down can have a big impact on the growth perception of the company, which is what justifies the inflated stock price.  If there's concerns that the company won't grow across the board, then traders will pull their money and look for something that is still growing; at least temporarily.\n\nHowever, I might suggest that based on AMD's huge revenue increase in 2021, there's a high chance there's been pull forward in their enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom business as well as their PCs and GPUs.  Interest rates were low.  The FED was injection huge amounts of capital into the market.  Of course businesses would decide that's a great time to add or replace server processors throughout 2020 and 2021.  Today, with interest rates rising and a potential recession on the horizon, for those businesses that didn't upgrade, they could be questioning whether it's wise to spend cash or take loans to upgrade servers.  That hesitancy could cause lower demand, and potentially price cuts by AMD to persuade demand.\n\nI think we have to remember that the stock price SPIKED between October 2019 to February 2020, to $59 from the previous high of $34, right before the pandemic sell-off.  \n\nWithin 1.75 years, the share price nearly tripled from that all time high (2.6x) to $160 a share.  Even after the sell-off, it's now sitting at $88 per share.  50% higher than it was at the pre-pandemic spike high.\n\nIn early 2020, a lot of people already thought the market was too high and that we were heading for a major market correction; possibly a recession.  The argument for why it didn't happens is because the pandemic caused the FED to inject trillions of dollars into the markets through QE that they otherwise wouldn't have, and lowered what was a rising interest rate at the time down to zero.  \n\nAs to the recent stock movement, we're showing a downtrend.

Why do you believe they will steal market share? Just because their branding is good?\n\nPersonally, I can't comment on the branding too much. I'm European and HNST products aren't really a thing here, or at the very least not a product that stands out in any way. And I don't think they'll be able to steal away from Pampers (P&G), which kinda is the nonplusultra and actually has a moat because of it's standing.\n\nHNST will compete with many other businesses in the space they are, and the entry barrier for new competitors isn't high. So branding will play a part, but I think it remains a very risky and highly speculative play if you just bet on their branding being successful.\n\nWhat's more, you refer to them targetting millenials having kids. Let's see, so Millenials are roughly between 25 and 40 years old at this point. That means a majority of the millenials who have children probably has had at least one by now. I find it difficult to imagine that people who, let's say, bought Pampers for their first child and didn't have any issues will suddenly switch to HNST for the second.\n\nWhat's more, millenials tend to - on average - look up brands and products on the internet more. And when they look up HNST, they will be confronted with HNST having used a chemical substance in their products in the past (don't know if they still do) which they claimed to avoid before since it was on their list of chemicals they avoid - or at the very least one with the very same chemical structure. Now granted, this is not a product that's known to be very harmful, and most research points at it raising the risk of developing allergy or skin irritation slightly at most, but that doesn't change the fact that this sort of behaviour is 1.) a bit fishy and more importantly 2.) will influence the buying decisions of mothers if they read about it. They won't want to take any risk.\n\nAll of that aside, HNST is  most certainly a type of company that will get hit by inflation. I don't know where their pricing lies compared to competitors, but if it's on the higher end, they might get hurt from the consumer side as well. Not just that, but they'll obviously be hurt from the supply side due to inflation. Their cost of revenue may rise as well. And with rising interest rates, securing funding for growth will be much more difficult, any debt they take on will be more difficult to service. And not just that. If the market was to go in a recession, people usually rotate out of the riskier growth plays. This may cause the stock price to go down further which in turn means that HNST will have to dilute the shares much more if they want to raise money via that route. Which will, in turn, put even more downward pressure on the stock.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I really enjoy your analysis and agree with you on multiple fronts.

Which is my largest holding by far.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you! Obviously it's still very superficial (although it's probably more than most big \"investing\" Youtubers will give you), but I enjoy looking at companies every now and then just to see where they're at. Obviously a lot more work would need to go into it if it was about a buying decision.\n\nYeah, being a \"premium\" aka more expensive brand isn't a good thing in times of high inflation if your name/brand isn't on the level of \"Pampers\", even if your pricing is somewhat competitive for that spot. And if you're lower doing there's more competition compressing your margins. So having 1% in it as a speculative play is probably alright. Personally I think it's too early for any more than that and I'm not intending to buy them at this point.\n\nPhew, COIN is a pretty tough one, very difficult to value and project in my opinion, at least with my knowledge and my set of skills. And you can see that with analysts as well. They have no f\\*cking clue what to expect, and the difference between their projections is therefore absolutely massive. The only thing they seem to agree on is that COIN will have lower earnings (per share) than they did last year. Most assume that revenue will decline as well, so no one is really expecting this to be a great year for COIN.\n\nIt's hard to tell because it leans so heavily on crypto which is an entirely speculative and hype-driven market for the most part. I don't think I can give any target price that's actually got some substance and holds up for this one. All I can say is that I would not make it my biggest holding, and I would treat it as a rather speculative stock, because I believe that's what it is.\n\nNow if the crypto-hype returns/grows stronger, COIN will most certainly be a great way to capitalise on that. But it's not as straight-forward. It doesn't even track BTC directly, although the movement has been similar since BTC does give some indication on how excited the crypto market is.\n\nAll in all, it is a speculative play and widely depends on what you expect from the crypto market, which is where the speculation lies.\n\nThe advantage COIN has over it's competitors is it's name. They are big and they are amongst the first on the big stage. This means that if crypto makes it into the \"real\" world with actual proper widely used use-cases and or as a currency, chances are existing banks will form a partnership with COIN if they believe that they will benefit from it more than if they implemented their own system/used their own brokerages. How realistic is that? I don't know.\n\nUntil then, however, COIN is a speculative, highly volatile and quite unpredictable stock. I could very well see it tank a lot further. I believe sentiment in the crypto market has slowly been turning more and more negative and fearful, and that's something that COIN will feel a lot. So I could see them miss on earnings - and they are barely expected to make a profit in Q1 as it is. So them missing significantly and recording a loss could send the stock below $100 I think. And I'm not even sure if it's a buy for me then. Probably not since it's too speculative and I could see the crypto market cool off significantly and for a prolonged period of time.\n\nNow if I could even somewhat reasonably estimate their earnings for the next couple of years that might be different, but that's not the case. They might have an EPS of 10 or they might have an EPS of -2. As such it's entirely impossible for me to value this stock on a fundamental basis when looking at it like this.\n\nJust tried looking to their financial statements, but unfortunately I didn't find what I wanted to even just make some assumptions (and even then those would have disregarded inflation and rising interest which will both heavily affect the market).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's your thoughts on COIN?

Bear in mind, current teslas and even other EVs are now even more efficient:\n\n“A common rebuttal to electric vehicles as a solution to carbon emissions is that they simply transfer the CO2 emissions to the power plant. The obvious counter is that one can develop grid electric power from a variety of means, many of which, like hydro, wind, geothermal, nuclear, solar, etc. involve no CO2 emissions. However, let’s assume for the moment that the electricity is generated from a hydrocarbon source like natural gas, the most popular fuel for new US power plants in recent years.\n\nThe H-System Combined Cycle Generator from General Electric is 60% efficient in turning natural gas into electricity. \"Combined Cycle\" is where the natural gas is burned to generate electricity and then the waste heat is used to create steam that powers a second generator. Natural gas recovery is 97.5% efficient, processing is also 97.5% efficient and then transmission efficiency over the electric grid is 92% on average. This gives us a well-to-electric-outlet efficiency of 97.5% x 97.5% x 60% x 92% = 52.5%.\nDespite a body shape, tires and gearing aimed at high performance rather than peak efficiency, the Tesla Roadster requires 0.4 MJ per kilometer or, stated another way, will travel 2.53 km per mega-joule of electricity. The full cycle charge and discharge efficiency of the Tesla Roadster is 86%, which means that for every 100 MJ of electricity used to charge the battery, about 86 MJ reaches the motor.\n\nBringing the math together, we get the final figure of merit of 2.53 km/MJ x 86% x 52.5% = 1.14 km/MJ. Let’s compare that to the Prius and a few other options normally considered energy efficient.\nThe fully considered well-to-wheel efficiency of a gasoline powered car is equal to the energy content of gasoline (34.3 MJ/liter) minus the refinement & transportation losses (18.3%), multiplied by the miles per gallon or km per liter. The Prius at an EPA rated 55 mpg therefore has an energy efficiency of 0.56 km/MJ. This is actually an excellent number compared with a “normal” car like the Toyota Camry at 0.28 km/MJ.\n\nNote the term hybrid as applied to cars currently on the road is a misnomer. They are really just gasoline powered cars with a little battery assistance and, unless you are one of the handful who have an aftermarket hack, the little battery has to be charged from the gasoline engine. Therefore, they can be considered simply as slightly more efficient gasoline powered cars. If the EPA certified mileage is 55 mpg, then it is indistinguishable from a non-hybrid that achieves 55 mpg. As a friend of mine says, a world 100% full of Prius drivers is still 100% addicted to oil.\nThe CO2 content of any given source fuel is well understood. Natural gas is 14.4 grams of carbon per mega-joule and oil is 19.9 grams of carbon per mega-joule. Applying those carbon content levels to the vehicle efficiencies, including as a reference the Honda combusted natural gas and Honda fuel cell natural gas vehicles, the hands down winner is pure electric:\n\nCar\tEnergy—Source—CO2 Content—Efficiency—CO2 Emissions\n\nHonda CNG\tNatural Gas\t14.4 g/MJ\t0.32 km/MJ\t45.0 g/km\nHonda FCX\tNat Gas-Fuel Cell\t14.4 g/MJ\t0.35 km/MJ\t41.1 g/km\nToyota Prius\tOil\t19.9 g/MJ\t0.56 km/MJ\t35.8 g/km\nTesla Roadster\tNat Gas-Electric\t14.4 g/MJ\t1.14 km/MJ\t12.6 g/km\n \nThe Tesla Roadster still wins by a hefty margin if you assume the average CO2 per joule of US power production. The higher CO2 content of coal compared to natural gas is offset by the negligible CO2 content of hydro, nuclear, geothermal, wind, solar, etc. The exact power production mixture varies from one part of the country to another and is changing over time, so natural gas is used here as a fixed yardstick.”\n\nSOURCE: https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Curious, are EVs more carbon efficient than ICEs to manufacture as well?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That’s what the Yale study answered.

S&P dropped more than 10% in a week, Nasdaq Comp falling 17.9% this year alone. \n\nPersonally, i am still learning about investing and i have bought a few tech stocks during the dip. Examples include: NVDA at 230, MSFT at 285, PLTR at 11.07. I see this dip as a good buying opportunity to jump in and buy more shares. Let's just say i have about $1000 more to spend on stocks. Should i wait it out for a few more days before i purchase or should i just buy in the shares and wait it out for the long-term? \n\nI have been eyeing stocks such as AAPL, DIS, MSFT, NVDA, PLTR, NIO, AMD to add to my portfolio. Of course, no one can predict when or where will the stocks bottom at. Hence, i try my best not to time the market and purchase stocks when there is a dip.\n\nI also want to know what you guys think about the recent dip. Do you guys sell, hold off buying stocks or do you guys see it as a great opportunity to acquire more stocks? How do you guys normally react to these situations? \n\nThank you for taking your time to read.

Keep in mind that I don't know the total number of contracts in play and the numbers are just examples to illustrate the larger point. They're not \"real\".\n\nThe way the short works is that if the price drops below a specific threshold, the short goes in the money and the sheer number of contracts x100 shares leveraged means that if theoretically, the price shifts by 2 cents ITM, your gain is like $5M or $10M. You're making *millions* off of cent differences. If the price were to theoretically shift say $2 below the threshold, then the total num of contracts then your gain might be $500M or $1Bn.

They're trying to do different things, in different ways.

You have tons and tons of researchers, working on similar problems, all the time. And also, there's just so much more high quality data. Humans are very good at labeling image data, with some tools we can easily and quickly annotate a lot of data. We can easily correct for image artifacts, lens flare, blurriness, dirty sensors, etc. And we can also check labels very quickly and accurately and spot mistakes, whether those labels came from another person or a machine.\n\nAnd the more data you start with, the easier it is to make autolabeling tools like this, or what Tesla is already using. And it's easy to check and improve the output. By comparison, humans aren't naturally good at interpreting and labeling the kind of 3d point clouds you get from lidar. The data needs processing and cleaning just for us to understand it, and especially things like catching and fixing errors can be very hard. \n\nCreating an autolabeling tool like this for lidar data is probably much more difficult, especially one that operates with a very high degree of accuracy. And checking and fixing that data could be a very slow process. It's just difficult to get to that level without a big community all working on the problem and lots of people able to contribute to the labeling problem in lots of different ways. \n\nIt makes me think that labeling lidar data might just be a huge bottleneck, especially considering how important it is to solutions like Waymo's.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": ">but it seems like they haven't improved significantly in a year or two at this point? \n\nMy guess is that Waymo has run into the same \"local maximums\" problem that Tesla has run into for years: making a lot of progress but eventually hitting a wall where their approach eventually doesn't meaningfully improve the outcomes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I was trying to figure out why they couldn't just throw more money and resources at the problem.

This is because the time required for the new programmers to learn about the project and the increased communication overhead will consume an ever-increasing quantity of the calendar time available.* ***When n people have to communicate among themselves, as n increases, their output decreases and when it becomes negative the project is delayed further with every person added.****\"*\n\nA leaner team of elite engineers will almost always defeat a huge team composed of mostly average engineers.\n\nThis is also what most non-engineers (chiefly fund managers and Wall Street analysts) failed to understand through the 2010s.  They assume that Toyota, GM, and Volkswagen can simply throw money at engineering issues in order to accelerate and \"catch up\" with Tesla.

In a series of subsequent tests covering three periods over the next 31 years (up until 1999), the model was found to be approximately 80%–90% accurate in predicting bankruptcy one year before the event, with a Type II error (classifying the firm as bankrupt when it does not go bankrupt) of approximately 15%–20% (Altman, 2000).[2]\n\nThis overstates the predictive ability of the Altman Z-score, however. Scholars have long criticized the Altman Z-score for being “largely descriptive statements devoid of predictive content ... Altman demonstrates that failed and non-failed firms have dissimilar ratios, not that ratios have predictive power. But the crucial problem is to make an inference in the reverse direction, i.e., from ratios to failures.”[3] From about 1985 onwards, the Z-scores gained wide acceptance by auditors, management accountants, courts, and database systems used for loan evaluation (Eidleman). The formula's approach has been used in a variety of contexts and countries, although it was designed originally for publicly held manufacturing companies with assets of more than $1 million. Later variations by Altman were designed to be applicable to privately held companies (the Altman Z'-score) and non-manufacturing companies (the Altman Z\"-score).\n\nNeither the Altman models nor other balance sheet-based models are recommended for use with financial companies. This is because of the opacity of financial companies' balance sheets and their frequent use of off-balance sheet items.\n\nModern academic default and bankruptcy prediction models rely heavily on market-based data rather than the accounting ratios predominant in the Altman Z-score.[4]", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Rivian got 6?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "They have a lot of cash (something like $18B from ipo) so it is almost impossible for them to go bankrupt in 2 years.

They will milk the ICE just long enough to fund the venture where it can start generating profits of its own. They will employ the \"Elon model\", new design philosophy, short iteration times, vertical integration, maximizing margins and factory output. No dealerships.

Although the binging was also a big reason why people liked Netflix, but yes it usually takes a while for for shows to pick up steam and releasing it all at once just doesn’t allow for that.\n\nThat being said, I think Netflix’s big strength was giving shows a “second life” things like the office, friends, breaking bad, 30 rock etc all got second runs and built back up because Netflix gave it a life that just couldn’t happen in syndication. Great example for me was Star Trek. I sort of remembered Star Trek TNG when it was originally on, but being able to watch it without commercials and without cable was great.

People seem to forget this is normal behavior for Netflix.  It's like people forgot Netflix doing the same stuff several times in the past.\n\nI really don't get the 2 million subscriber BS either.\n\nWhy do I say this?\n\nBecause ever since 2013, subscription rate has been largely linear.  Despite multiple sharing changes and despite multiple price increases, the subscription rate has stayed linear.  People don't care.  Why can I say this?  Because history has repeated itself quite a number of times, and the subscriber count never tanked from it.\n\nI don't know why people are spamming about the 200,000 subscriber drop, the 2 million subscriber guess, the price hike, and the sharing.  I would assume anyone growing up with Netflix over the last decade are seeing deja vu, because it really is nothing new.\n\nBut here's the rub.  Subscriptions are still linear and even for Q1 2022 is NOT below the linear trend line going all the way back to 2013.  Revenue is the highest it's ever been.  And because people don't care about the price hike, they'll keep subscribing and not caring.\n\nSo, subscriptions are solid, revenue is at an all time high, the data shows subscribers don't care about the rate increase or sharing changes (they've done both a bunch of times), and despite being rock solid for nearly a decade, the stock still tanked and is a cheap as it was nearly half a decade ago.\n\nThe only thing this media blitz seemed to generate was a great buying opportunity to get into Netflix stock.  It's as cheap as it was almost 5 years ago.  It's basically a 2x to 3x easy jump right back up in the coming months.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the competitors aren't desirable.  The data shows Hulu, HBO, and Disney+ WAY behind in subscriptions.  HBOs growth rate is pretty much zero.  Hulu's growth rate is far less than Netflix.  Disney+ is less than half the subscribers, but it's the only one with a better growth rate, you know, because Disney and every streamer is going to eventually buy into it.  The only streaming service on par with Netflix is Amazon Prime, but even Prime sits in numerous other market spaces to grab customers, and it still just barely is able to match Netflix.  In the end, the competition isn't competition at all.  Prime is Prime because it does a bunch of other stuff too.  Disney is Disney, and you usually subscribe the moment you realize it even exists.\n\nThe fact of the matter is no one is pulling market share away from Netflix.  The data doesn't show it.  And their current behavior will only grow revenue.  Yeah, you'd fear some of the elements for subscriber loss, but the data also doesn't show sensitivity.  You also need to realize that 200,000 is just 0.1% of subscribers, and even 2 million is just 1% of subscribers.  Even losing 1% from the price hike or any other factor would STILL have Netflix being the most profitable it's ever been.\n\nBut the stock?  I don't have a fucking clue.
