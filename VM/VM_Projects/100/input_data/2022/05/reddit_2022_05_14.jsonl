{"title": "Why Inflation Has Most Likely Peaked according to this BLS Analyst: Joseph Politano", "selftext": "I wanted to highlight a superb Substack [blog post](https://apricitas.substack.com/p/peak-inflation?s=w) by Joseph Politano, an analyst at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I'm going to briefly summarize the article and pepper in my own graphs and commentary, but as always, *please read and support* his work. His blog is called [\"Apricitas Economics,\"](https://apricitas.substack.com/); his [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/josephpolitano) is also full of excellent insights.\n\n\n**Point 1:** Annualized prices depend heavily on the 'base' effect, i.e., what happened at the start of the period going back 12 months. He writes,\n\n> \"April, May, and June of 2021 had the fastest pace of core CPI growth in nearly 50 years thanks to a spectacular increase in used vehicle and other durable goods prices.\"\n\nBecause those spectacular increases will exit the window of calculations for annual inflation, there will necessarily be a reduction in measured inflation (all else held equal). This isn't a guess as much as a mathematical consequence. See [Graph 1](https://i.imgur.com/5ECRfDE.png) here from his article.\n\n**Point 2:** The limited Fed tightening and communications have already tightened financial conditions. Proof: [Graph 2](https://i.imgur.com/E1q0GAT.png) depicting the Piper-Sandler index, [Graph 3](https://i.imgur.com/c0OEJXh.png) of 30 year fixed mortgages, and [Graph 4](https://i.imgur.com/72pvlqK.png) from Joseph's article of the Chicago Fed's measure of financial tightness.\n\n**Point 3:** Bond markets are swiftly pricing in dampening inflation (relative to their previous estimates). See [Graph 5](https://i.imgur.com/euetX2R.png) of 5 Year, 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation rate and [Graph 6](https://i.imgur.com/YO7WBuw.png) the 10 Year Break-even. The 5 Year Break-even is also falling. I explain more in my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uonvmr/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_may/i8grf60/) what these mean and provide some additional sources. [Here is Joseph's plot, Graph 7](https://i.imgur.com/HaSJSvo.png).\n\n**Point 4**: This is really an extension of Point 1, but the massive increases in used car prices has slowed down dramatically. See [Graph 8](https://i.imgur.com/wZjFoE4.png).\n\nThus, inflation will remain elevated for a few months, but the extraordinary factors in the spring of 2021 will no longer be represented in upcoming annual calculations of inflation. Further, the Fed is now finally walking the walk. You can argue that 0.5% increases in the interest rate are minuscule historically, but Graph 3 through 7 show that the market is taking it seriously and tightening on its own (e.g., 30 year fixed mortgage rate hitting 5.6%). The Federal Funds Rate and QT doesn't need to have a simple, linear relationship with actual financial conditions.  \n\nThe caveat is that we still have upcoming issues with the supply chain, such as in the [diesel](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uklg1n/forget_gasoline_diesel_is_even_more_important_to/) sector, but there have been meaningful improvements in [trucking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ueoqvn/supply_chains_recovering_auto_inventory_with/) and [shipping](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u5ujf3/wsj_shipping_stocks_will_sink_as_us_consumers/), as I wrote about in my previous posts. But I believe the other factors mentioned imply that inflation has peaked, as Joseph more convincingly argues.\n\nWhatever you believe about the Fed's past actions, they leave me reasonably bullish for say 3 months from now. What do you think?\n\nEDIT: To avoid the dozens of future comments about it: nowhere in this post or article is it claimed that inflation is going to be at 2-3% in a month, gas prices are back to normal, oil is literally shooting up from the ground all around us, it was all transitory, Fed was right all along, the CIA did nothing wrong, etc.\n\nEDIT: Joseph noticed this post LMAO!", "id": "upjbv5", "created_utc": 1652541312.0, "score": 1005, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 474, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Those long term inflation expectations are still not very elevated. \n\nIn a period of similarly very low long term inflation expectations and similarly low unemployment in 1950-51, The Fed only raised the discount rate a quarter point (to 1.75%) as CPI inflation spiked to 9.6% and unemployment fell to 3.1% by April 1951.

This is a perennial issue: what's a good selection of goods to assess inflation with. \n\nThere are obvious issues with relying on used cars as reliable proxies for consumer discretionary good price changes over a short time window (month to month), because the demand for cars can be seasonal and cyclical. Also, used car prices are directly dependent on supply chain issues, which is another factor in inflation issues in  other, more indirect ways. So if you're interested in making inferences about inflation, I question using used car prices because they reveal more about direct supply chain issues of the auto industry than they do about systemic inflation that arises as an indirect result of supply chain disruptions among many other factors. And it's the latter that is really what we want to understand. I think used car prices are meaningful if you're interested in buying/selling used cars (and I just sold one this past week in a rush to beat sinking prices). \n\nI would use another basket of goods to make inferences about the duration of the current inflationary period. But then this is what a lot of people say in response to most measures of inflation: it's the basket you choose. \n\nI feel that home inflation is more significant if you're talking about timelines. But again, that's a more complicated subject than simple data about mortgages might imply. The federal reserve is also removing support for mortgage backed securities as well as rates rising, so that's a double hit on the real estate market. The shifts in the housing sector cycle are complicated and forced, because it's a Fed-driven issue at this point, and it's not in a natural population & labor driven cycle. Simply constricting mortgage financing & liquidity might have unforeseen side effects. For example, forcing a slowdown in home building and mortgages due to fed action right now, opens the possibility that rents might also likely to rise sharply due to inventory for homes being so tight in a period of rising demand, and if rents rise sharply, so will demand for increased wages. This is what I mean by the housing/mortgage factors of inflation being complicated as the cycle is being driven by fed action rather than natural market cycles in housing (say by shifts in populations such as baby boomers). \n\nShipping is taking a big hit mostly due to the China slowdows and not slowing consumer demand. The LA port is rushing to clear its backlog of containers in anticipation of being buried again once China's lockdown lifts. I respect all your commentary on the issue and all the articles being written, but that's another metric that's being impacted by arbitrary government policies (in this case, China's Covid-zero). There is an issue with shipping supply increases, and that's part of the market cycle, and I agree that this will ease shipping rates slowly going forward. \n\nChina's lockdowns have a far bigger footprint on inflation than just slowing down the rate of goods shipping from China, though. There's a whole lot of pent-up shipping demand that is currently suppressed due to China's lockdowns as China consumes an enormous amount of inputs for its production economy, like commodities from other countries like Brazil. Not only is this adding to a slowdown in shipping but a drop in commodity prices overall, especially mining and metals. So a very large set of inflationary factors are deferred to the future during China's lockdowns. \n\nFinally, there are the NATO sanctions in its financial war vs Russia, that no one seems to be mentioning. \n\nIn sum, there's quite a bit about today's inflationary picture that is all due to government policy and lawmakers, nothing more. Much of the inflation we're struggling with has been created out of thin air by our governments. The problem is that like Xi's lockdowns, NATO's sanctions against Russia, restrictions on working age immigration, supply chain disruptions due to the trade war vs China, and the long, slow pace of the Fed's tightening, there's no easy way to predict that government are going to do anything meaningful to address inflation that they themselves are causing with their easily-reversed actions. \n\nOur leaders are engaging in showboating nonsense like [\"Price gouging\" legislation that Larry Summer rightly calls \"dangerous nonsense\" on par with Trump's comment about injecting disinfectants to beat Covid infections](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2022-05-13/summers-price-gouging-legislation-is-dangerous-nonsense-video?sref=GOn3bpWn). The fact that our leaders are staging these spectacles show they're not serious about containing inflation because inflation has largely been created by policies and conditions they have created and can reverse (but won't), including the sanctions on Russia.\n\nI'm with Larry Summer that the main factor in inflation is and will continue to be rising demand. If we assume that every inflationary government policy out there, including the slow pace of Fed tightening, sanctions v Russia and so on, remains in place, we're going to have inflation for some time simply because China's lockdowns should ease soon, shifting the inflationary landscape from one problem of a short supply of Chinese made goods here in the US to a resumption of the commodity boom and shipping as China's production economy resumes full pace. \n\n> Whatever you believe about the Fed's past actions, they leave me reasonably bullish for say 3 months from now. What do you think?\n\nI'm not sure whether I can say I agree or disagree with you, but I can say that I think at present inflation is a government-caused problem and that following geopolitics and the decisions of world players like XI, NATO, Biden and OPEC is more likely to help one forecast inflation than economic approaches based on the price of used cars. \n\nBut you are right to be bullish. The relief rally in stocks on Friday was allegedly due to Powell's focusing on his concerns about a hard landing. That suggests a slow/inadequate tightening regime rather than a fast-paced/adequate one, which is bullish for tech/growth stocks. I'm also more on the side of betting on ongoing inflation because of geopolitics as governments are playing a key role in inflation and I don't think they'll reverse their policies any time soon.

Further, lower income earners pay a higher percentage of their income on subsistence and shelter, so they have less ability to flex their spending on rent increases. When housing inventory is low then demand for rentals will stay high or increase, putting pressure on on rental demand. I think the material that describes the latter connection is straightforward can be explained by ECON101 material that describes substitute goods, where the price/availability of houses for sale and rental prices will exhibit a positive cross-elasticity of demand. \n\nIf you want papers, there won't be papers written on these elementary concepts like cross-elasticity of demand, but there are lots of papers modeling these connections.

That is true at least with a margin account, not 100% sure if with a cash account the put also offsets the margin.\n\nIf you go further on the time you can even get a  better deal.

If, by historical measures, the market is undervalued by a standard deviation or more, you own stocks and you keep holding until such time as the market approaches being over-valued by a standard deviation, at which point you start to trim. The higher the market goes from there, the more you trim, and as the market approaches being over-valued by two standard deviations, you get out.\n\nI'm being specific to make my example concrete. The principle is that if stocks begin to look more like speculation than investment, you get out.\n\nIn a world of black swans, this plan can fail you, but this is at least a version of timing the market that makes use of the notion that over a time scale of years, it is possible to assess whether the market is \\*likely\\* to return more than alternative holdings.\n\nTwo things can screw this up badly. One is that you are investing in a very small number of individual companies. The risk of a surprising event, in either direction, is considerable for an individual company. The fewer your holdings, the more potential there is for the company to be subject to something wonderful or awful.\n\nThe other thing that can screw it up is normal, short-term volatility. In the short term, the market is driven more by emotion than reason. If you're talking about a handful of trading days, emotion can trump reason significantly. If a market drops 20% over six months, that likely reflects a change in conditions. But the daily swings up and down on the way there will be many multiples of 20% and will be the result of how market participants are feeling about the market on that particular day.\n\nTechnical analysis aims to capture those changes in sentiment, and technical analysis can be successful if it's predictive for slightly better than half the time. Technical analysis will thus be wrong \\*close to\\* half the time at least, and the shorter the time frame, the worse it will perform.\n\nSo the shorter the time frame and the smaller the number of stock issues being considered, the less there is to reliably say about where the price may go next. To hold on to shares with money that you're going to need in less than a year is speculating, not investing.\n\nAnyone can get surprised by an unexpected need for cash, but that's also something to consider before buying shares.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I am very grateful for your thorough and understandable help, my friend ♥️ I so wish I had this kind of knowledge when younger!\n\nI will probably be needing funds in 2 months or so, have 336 of Apple, 20 of FB.\n\nThanks again and take care ♥️", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I hope that your shares are up on Monday morning.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you with all my heart for your kindness!

During these last few weeks, having my money in TSLA actually gives me peace. Even though it's down \\~40% from ATH, it's still faring better than the likes of SHOP, and tons of other tech small caps, and I know it won't stay down here for long.\n\nHowever, something I've always struggled with is how to evaluate the key-man risk that Elon represents to the company, which I believe to be the only risk that TSLA faces in the short/mid term.  Here are my main thoughts:\n\n\\- He's a generational visionary, and the reason why many people invest in TSLA. I believe if he stays healthy and involved, TSLA will be the largest market cap stock within the next 10 years.\n\n\\- However he's gradually attracting more attention; from the negative sentiments surrounding the Twitter deal to receiving threats from Russian actors, the target on his back is growing bigger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here's how I think of quantifying the key-man risk:**\n\n\\- During any given year, there's a small but real chance that something bad could happen to Elon, (health, accidents, etc) let's say it's 2%.\n\n\\- If that happens, how would TSLA stock react? My guess is an immediate 20-40% haircut, for various reasons. Not to mention Earth would lose one of the most valuable human beings alive.\n\n\\- Therefore, in any given year, my portfolio could see a 10-20% drop from this key-man risk alone. (50% allocation \\* 20-40% haircut). This would be on top of any drawdown caused by macro conditions.\n\n\\- It may take many years for Tesla to prove that the culture and roadmap Elon has built was robust enough to take the company to his original vision, if it can find a capable operator (like a Tim Cook) to take over.\n\nI understand that everyone has their own risk tolerance.

Just made 300% on LCID puts, by the way.   \n\n\nThere are many catalysts, very much present.  \n\n\nOns catalyst is all the U.S. Government debt piling on from '08. It was bad under Obama, just as bad under Johnald *in half the time* and Biden is now hitting it out of the fucking ball park. What does Govt debt have to do with stonks, you say?  \n\n\nGood question, ape in the back. The Gontorment spent this debt into the economic system, insane fiscal spending, over the years and, you guessed it, this has caused surges in demand. But no new stuff was created. That's **inflationary**.  \n\n\nAnother catalyst is how the Fed purchased open market securities, or \"printed money\" for the apes in the crowd, and how it has essentially translated in a 40% increase in the U.S. monetary supply during 2020 and 2021. That's **really inflationary**.  \n\n\nThe abovementioned elements are not in Bloomberg, or coming from the mouth of the highly alert, sharp-witted Man In Charge, Joe Boden. You're forgiven if you missed it. If you do follow these two highly unbiased and credibly sources, who have no ulterior motives, you'll surely be aware of two more catalysts:  \n\n\nPutin's War in Ukraine. The resulting economic sanctions are causing massive supply disruptions, no Western country is buying any wheat or fertiliser or any other critical resource from *11% of the landmass of the world* a.k.a. Russia and no Western country *can* buy anything from Ukraine, because it now resembles the cratered surface of the moon. This is **pretty inflationary**.  \n\n\nNumber two? I know these are a lot of words, so if you have been reading up until now, I'm very impressed. Your wife will be so proud, you should tell her when she comes back from her boyfriend. You read the smart things on reddit! Maybe you'll turn your cratering portfolio right round, go honey.  \n\n\nOkay. Number two. COVID lockdowns and their effects on supply chains. Whilst these are certainly Pow-Pow's favourite word, transitory, they have caused a lot of cost-push inflation to date. What's even worse, is the fact that China is literally caging people inside apartment buildings right now in order to stop their newest wave of the Cool-Aid virus. Why is this worse? Because China's *supply chains are getting disrupted, again.* This is **inflationary**.  \n\n\n**This is the 5th part in bold, so now all the retards can link up with the apes that have just been reading the word \"inflationary\" 4 times**. And that's my point, apes - there's so much fucking inflation right now, and it's not going to stop. I can talk more about the current US CPI basket isn't the same as what it always was, the basket is only a synthetic instrument and inflation isn't really as simple as just a scalar figure, but I can tell you're struggling already.   \n\n\nWhat does a lot of inflation, imply? It will fuck the economy. That's really bad for stonks over the longer term (although it will be good initially... oh wait a second, the graphs have been looking very green for a long ass time! Almost as long as... wait... since '08?).\n\nOkay, so just go into recession, and the inflation stops, right? **Wrong**. Yes, decreases in demand during a recession will lead to less inflation, but a U.S. recession will do sweet fuck-all to combat the economic fallout of Daddy Vladdy's power trip and XJP's chokehold. See the oil price graph. In addition, inflation driven by money-printing is also not stopped by recessions (think WeimarBabwe).  \n\n\nOkay. So inflation is **really bad for stonks**. \n\nSo how do you fight inflation, then? With higher interest rates. \n\nReally, really high interest rates, actually. I don't know why everyone on CNBC or who snorts coke at Goldman has seemingly forgotten this, but let the retarded Actuary remind you. Real rate = interest rate - inflation rate. If we want to cancel out inflation, we have to get pretty close to interest rates that are *higher* than the current inflation rate, which is conservatively at about 8.3% right now. FFR from 5 May 2022 is 1%.\n\n1% - 8.3% = -7.3%  \n\n\nWe need rates a lot closer to 8% to fight this. I'm not going to explain this part, because I'm bored now, but high interest rates **are really bad for stonks**.  \n\n\nTL;DR (for the truly smooth brain monkes)  \n\n\n**Current High Inflation really bad for stonkers.

Past crashes are up to around 50%.  And this moderate drop has repeated several times previously.  Comparatively, we are only around half way there.  I looked at this exact same thing a couple weeks ago and came to the same conclusion.\n\nThe question for me revolves more around what should I be in to buffer that loss and is that position cash, other assets, or key stocks that are either insensitive or possibly closer to the bottom than the general market.  Indicators on the general market are still that it's heading down.  And without a major external influencer it will likely stay this way.  \n\nThe problem now is the general public is cash poor, and the consumer market is heavily bloated in cost.  You can't drive an economy without cash flow.  I could see a couple moves that would push the market up.  Tariffs could be removed to allow raw material imports to cheapen and drive down sell costs of goods. And I can see a federal push for higher minimum wages to push up baseline cash on hand for consumers to actually spend.  We saw a huge boom from the Covid relief checks, and that wasn't much actual cash.  A wage bump would allow consumerism and allow ramp up of business operations.  Wage is probably the single best tool we have.  I also do see federally driven infrastructure plans to be effective too, but the value of it is narrower in scope.  There is dollars flowing but only to certain groups.\n\nI fear we're just waiting to finish sliding down the hill, down until the market finally settles at a point where the relatively low cash flow balances.\n\nBut, THIS then becomes the point where you leverage yourself to become rich.  The challenge is having cash on-hand to actually make a move, and the time to take money out of the market was, well, late December.  Everyone's game since then has been how to minimize losses and end up with a good cash value on-hand at the bottom.  If we're only half way now, where is the money going before we hit bottom?  And are there good plays right now, next month, the month after that might even allow growth?  Since December, oil has been a good place for growth, and about the only place available.  But I fear that's near its run right now, and nobody really knows the next play.  Even myself, I'm banking on only some general concepts that historically have been pretty mixed in actual reward.

That's it.\n\nBut, government has the size and ability to enact broad changes that can benefit a nation.  Reduction of taxation on imported raw materials will bring down prices of goods so manufacturers can more easily build and consumers can more easily buy with available cash.  Government can also push for higher base wages which would add buying power to consumers.  This will offset the removal of tariffs on raw goods US manufacturers need to build, but because wage stagnation has existed since basically the 1960s, the rate of buying power scales VASTLY faster than the increase of sell price of goods when you raise wages.  So again, it still improves consumerism and business flow.\n\nThese are not bad things and can be enacted as broad sweeping strokes.\n\nThis isn't a question of government good or government bad.  A government still and always will have a highly valuable function to society.  It is the only entity capable of performing nation wide acts on a scale no single or even group of companies can do.\n\nWhat I'm discussing has nothing to do with money supply.

I can't install quartz counter tops into a cow.\n\nBuilding houses requires many different types of material. Making more cows just requires...more cows and a couple of bulls.\n\nBut the number one reason is because human beings living in developed countries place a higher value on homes than they do cows. A home is worth what a person is willing to pay for it and so is a cow.\n\nDoing quick searches...\n\nIn the US, cows are worth somewhere between $700 and $2000 depending on breed.\n\nIn Kenya, a cow is worth somewhere between 28,000 and 250000 shillings, which equates to $241 to $2,150. The average annual salary in Kenya is 3,382,073 Kenyan Shillings, which equates to $29,080 US dollars. So, in Kenya, they are willing to pay about 7% of their annual salary for a high-end cow.\n\nIn the US, the average salary is $59,916. In the US, we are willing to pay about 3% of our annual salary for a high-end cow.\n\nThe average house sales price for a home in Kenya is listed for about $138K. Only 4.7 times the average annual salary.\n\nThe average house sales price for homes in the US is about $508K. This is 8.5 times the average US salary.\n\nIt is clear to me that Kenyans value cows more than Americans do and they value homes less than Americans do.\n\nSo, why have home prices shot up as much as they have since 1971 and milk has not?

Inflation is starting to cause issues everywhere across the world, seriously this is happening everywhere.  Countries are starting to limit their exports because of how bad shortages are getting.  \n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine their wheat supply was completely cut off, India stepped up and started exporting more wheat, and people's fears of shortages faded away.  This is gone now, yesterday India just shut off all wheat exports to save it for their own citizens.  Inflation is accelerating at dangerous levels when the global economy is slowing.  I think that a 100bp rate hike is necessary but Jerome Powell does not have the guts to do that.  By the June meeting, a 75bp rate hike will be expected.\n\n The global economy is getting worse and worse.  I expect stocks to rebound this week though.  The bond market finally reached this trend line which has indicated every other past recession.  Usually, there is one final rally after the bond market tops though.  The market definitely will not reach near all-time highs but at this point, a bear market rally is extremely likely.  \n\nI still believe there will be a huge panic sell but that day is for sure not next week.  It will happen when wall street realizes that the world economy is slowing down.

{"title": "The Most Undervalued Stock In All The Market RN!", "selftext": "Edit: News just came out that Warren Buffet bought more than %10!!! I will do another write up later with an update. Valhalla, here we come!\n\nHello fellow autists. If you're tired of losing money on 0TDE options and starting to think about buying good companies, that make good products/ services, make a profit and you're thinking about leaving your money there for a couple of years playing the long game...say less.\n\n**The Markets**\n\nThe markets (including almost every stock within it) have bled since about Nov of last year. We are coming up on the 8th month and [according to Google](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=how+long+is+the+average+bear+market&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), the average length of all bear markets has been 289 days, so 9 and a half months. You may want to start thinking about front running and nibbling on some of your favourites. Sure, we can go a bit lower...but good companies are on sale rn and markets have historically recovered %100 of the time! Plus, the fear in the markets is same or worse than March 2020, the valuations have shaved off more capital than all the other downturns combined, and everything is technically VERY oversold. Again, we can go lower...but the risk vs reward is heavily skewed to the upside now.\n\n**The Play**\n\nParamount Global (ticker: PARA) is ViacommCBS and I am going to show why I think they are one of the most undervalued, overlooked companies in the world, and therefore possibly one of the best investment opportunities in the markets rn.\n\n**The Who**\n\nParamount has some of the most iconic and [highest grossing media brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises) ever made thanks to Nickelodeon. Just between Dora The explorer ($15.8 billion), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ($15.4 billion) and SpongeBob Squarepants ($14.8 billion), they've made $46 billion dollars. They have many, many more big brands (think licensing for merchandise, etc) as they host one of the richest content libraries in all media (Star Trek, Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Paw Patrol are just some of the other ones). Their broadcast channel CBS is no slouch either; 7 out of the top 10 Most Watched Broadcast Series in the 2021/2022 season belongs to CBS (this allows them to demand top advertising dollar).\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/2aie1bx2biz81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=60b49a630001eaf9e1e44a7bf629db5da1c662ee](https://preview.redd.it/2aie1bx2biz81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=60b49a630001eaf9e1e44a7bf629db5da1c662ee)\n\n**The Fundamentals**\n\nThey have about 608 million shares outstanding and made just above $6 per share profit last year. They pay a $0.96 annual dividend which amounts to about %3.4. They have about $10 per share in cash.  Here, we have a company trading at a PE ratio of under 5 that is trading well below it's book value. Book Value is around $35. That means, if it went BK over night and they stripped it and sold off it's assets, you would get $35 a share...yet, the commons are trading at just above $28 today! Now, some people will say \"ya but that book value includes goodwill and intangibles\"...but the intangibles are those same brands I mentioned earlier. For example, Disney bought Star Wars for $4 billion, and they also bought Marvel for $4 billion. How much would selling each of the brands I mentioned fetch? Probably a lot more than the $18 billion market cap that the company stock is worth today! If they have $10 in cash per share...then ALL those other brands are worth $8 billion dollars? Not a chance.\n\nNow, Paramount is also turning to growth as it transitions from making money off licensing it's products to other networks and streamers, to going DTC through it's own streaming service, Paramount Plus. P+ is only a year old, but was CBS All Access before. They are growing at an enormous clip. Where did all the Netflix subscribers go? I think a lot are moving over to Paramount, who is growing so fast, management revised it's projections from 60 million subs next year to 100 million subs. Currently, between P+ and their other paying subscription services (Showtime, OTT), they have 60 million paying subscribers! By comparison, #1 Netflix has about 220 million and Disney has 205 million paying subs. Paramount is not likely to take over the #1 or #2 spot, but 3rd or 4th is a lock. Third place would be Warner Bros Discovery with about 100 million. Currently PARA is in 4th with 60 mil but I believe they can over take WBD in the next few years as they bring more of their licensed shows back in house - as is their game plan (%25 of whats on Netflix belongs to Paramount, which is all coming back in house). This shows they are very undervalued pegged up against it's industry peers and the industry averages. They will get to 200 million subscribers in the next 3-5 years, unless they get bought out before then. So there is tremendous growth ahead, yet it's not getting the same \"growth\" type valuations. It's being valued as solely a legacy cable business that has shrinking profits. Not true. While the year over year revenue declined in the most recent financial filings, this was due to the fact they had the Super Bowl last year and not this past January. Without the \"Super Bowl\" effect, revenue is actually up. They are a Free Cash Flow machine. While they themselves are projecting their earnings to go down in the next 1-2 years, this is bc they are spending more on content and investing back into their streaming business...by 2024, they are going to be doing 9 billion in revenue from the streaming DTC side alone. This is getting 0 love. I believe it will all change and the stock will double, if not triple from these levels. Even at double the current price, at around $56 per share, I'd say it's undervalued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Industry Peers](https://preview.redd.it/ioo5wdoxaiz81.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b2523b7abe405a659deb7f77804c4e84e1c310b)\n\n**The Technicals**\n\nThe stock has bounced off the low 27s twice now since the new year and bounced up to the 37 resistance zone. It's dropped now once again due to shitty market conditions, but I believe it is now setting up the rare triple bottom. I'm aware it dropped a bit lower than the previous $27.25 low, but I don't believe double/ triple top or bottoms need to be to the exact cent, I think %1-2 is within range. There is a juicy open gap around $35 that I believe will get closed sooner rather than later, and then there's the open gap way up top around $85 which I also believe will close -albeit that one may take some time. Maybe not though. There is also evidence of some bullish divergence on numerous time frames as is also evident in a ton of other names, and even the indexes. I believe they've got everyone on the short side, buying puts...and the markets are about to melt up fuelled by short covering, and people jumping back in with FOMO as they realize they missed the bottom.\n\n**The Bonus**\n\nShari Redstone is the controlling shareholder of the Board. She put down almost $3 million of her own money and bought the commons in Feb between $28 and $29, so basically where we are now. She also bought back in November 2021 at around $36 but that was a much smaller buy. They say do as insiders do and Shari has loaded up over $3 mil of her money as she feels like me, this is very undervalued and we should be able to make some money buying shares down at these levels. On top of this organic growth, there has been much speculation that Shari wants to sell the company. Since there has been a lot of consolidation in the industry (Amazon buying MGM, Warner Bros buying Discovery, etc)...people feel Paramount is next to be swallowed up. At just $18 billion market cap, someone could want the content library and fairly low valuations even if you bought it at $60 a share, that would still be under $40 billion dollars. There are only a few people that could do that, in my opinion it would be between Amazon, or Apple. I'd say Disney and Comcast in there as well, but those deals might involve separating CBS out of the deal and just buying Viacomm, as there might be some anti-trust issues if they took in CBS as well. Earlier this year, when the [CEO Bob Bakish got asked a question](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/03/paramount-sale-viacomcbs-bob-bakish-1234705887/) about his company, he gave a really odd response starting with \"When I look at buying a company\"....why even mention that IF it isn't the game plan? He's hinted the company is up for sale and why not, PARA is a prime acquisition target and while that may not be a reason to buy into a company on it's self, it's just one more reason I sleep easy at nights.\n\nAnother short term bonus is that Top Gun 2 is coming out in a couple weeks and it's looking like it's going to be one of the biggest blockbuster in recent times! [Early reviews are crazy good](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/top-gun-maverick-first-reviews-the-most-thrilling-blockbuster-weve-gotten-in-years/)! They are going to blow the box offices out of the water, make an absolute killing and I'm looking forward to the buzz :)\n\n**Positions**\n\n15k shares at $28.50. Target is $65 within a year when the market wakes up and realizes how incorrectly they've been pricing PARA. Stop loss: What's a stop loss? I'm not selling if it dips to $25, I won't sell if it dips to $15...I won't even sell if we get a black swan event and it dips to $5. I will buy more. I will buy 5k shares every $5 drop. This entire write up has felt very DFV'ish (minus the short squeeze aspect) as I sit here and back a company I believe is being mispriced in a big way for whatever reason and am playing the long game believing the reversion back to the mean will happen. DFV was banging on the table about GME for about a year and a half before the actual squeeze happened. He spent a lot of time getting shit on by you degenerates, so please, go easy on me. lol\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nPARA is undervalued amongst it's peers and is growing in streaming like crazy rn and in the next few years. I believe they are getting valued incorrectly solely on their legacy cable side and getting nothing for all their intangibles which they could sell for multi-billions if they wanted to and their streaming side of the business (which is where all the growth is). All that content is coming in house, plus big blockbuster films are coming out - and it's a potential buy out target. Sitting on the low lows. Big upside potential.\n\n\\*Disclosure: Purple crayons taste best.
