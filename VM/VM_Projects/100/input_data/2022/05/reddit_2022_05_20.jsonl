Continued uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine are adding to the uneasiness.\n\nFinancial markets fell again on Thursday, a day after the DJIA suffered its worst drop of the year.

If Samsung, BYD, QS, whoever, builds a battery that can last 2x-3x as long vs current battery tech, NIO can implement this new tech because the have swapping, but others cannot.\n\n\\#3 - I think most people think there is growing competition in the EV industry, which there is, but the majority of the upcoming \"Legacy Auto\" EVs can only go like 300 miles... The vast majority are not going to pay $30k for a car with a range of 300 miles, when a $15k ICE car can go 500+ miles (my car goes 500 miles and that's still not enough for the occasional road trip if I don't want to stop). The NIO ET7 has a 620 mile range and if battery tech improves, it will be a lot easier for Nio to roll out new tech vs competitors who have to do a different cost/benefit analysis... Battery swapping offer a lot more flexibility than people give it credit for.\n\n\\#4 - I think China wants to become a manufacturing/export powerhouse for EVs similar to how they're a manufacturing powerhouse for lots of other goods like consumer electronics. They just cut their borrowing rates today while the rest of the world is increasing rates... China is just starting their growth stimulation while the US is tapering. \n\n\\#5 - From a fundamentals perspective, their stock price is in-line with Legacy Auto (Nio trading around 3x P/S while Tesla trades around 30x).

People took on more debt thinking the markets would only go up. \n\nI do want to point out that there *were* people back in 2008 that were doing somewhat ok financially but were set up with ARMs and fucky balloon mortgages and didn't understand them. Then as the value of the homes dropped suddenly as they did in 2008, they'd have big balloon payments they couldn't make, they couldn't refinance into another mortgage due to the decreased value of the home (they were underwater), and many lost their jobs and were out of work on top of that. If the home prices hadn't dropped many would have been ok. \n\n>As the real estate market pushed to its peaks in 2005 and 2006, teaser rates, ARMs, and the \"interest-only\" loan (where no principle payments are made for the first few years) were increasingly pushed upon homeowners. As these loans became more common, fewer borrowers questioned the terms and were instead enticed by the prospect of being able to refinance in a few years (at a huge profit, the argument stated), enabling them to make whatever catch-up payments would be necessary. What borrowers didn't take into account in the booming housing market, however, was that **any decrease in home value would leave the borrower with an untenable combination of a balloon payment and a much higher mortgage payment.**\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/subprime-overview.asp\n\n>Though \"balloon mortgages\" may sound friendly and harmless, they have caused a lot of trouble for home buyers. In a balloon mortgage, a buyer pays low monthly payments on his new house for the first 5 to 7 years. Then, at the end of that period, he has to pay everything he still owes on the house. He can take out a new loan with a higher interest rate, sell the house, or find the money to pay off the loan. Balloon mortgages attract buyers because they don't require a large down payment. They have low interest rates and enable people to buy bigger houses than they could otherwise afford. But balloon mortgages are only a good deal as long as property values keep rising.\n\n>In 2007, housing prices fell. People with balloon mortgages could not sell their houses or get new mortgages. The banks foreclosed on their homes and took them back. **The wave of foreclosures made house prices fall even further. This meant that an increasing number of people owed more on their houses than the houses were worth. At the same time, the financial sector collapsed. Companies laid off many employees. But most of these people couldn't afford to sell their houses, so they couldn't move to find new jobs.**\n\nhttps://flexbooks.ck12.org/cbook/prep-for-7th-grade-math/section/2.7/related/rwa/how-balloons-destroyed-the-economy/\n\nI blame a lot of it on financial illiteracy and/or too much risk-taking to take on such an exotic mortgage.

With that said, there are many structurally different issues between 2000/2008/now. The biggest financial issue of the day in terms of macro markets analysis is, of course, inflation. And you do have a tech stock issue where cheap money + insane valuations and unrealistic growth expectations are getting exposed as mirage. Again, it's nowhere near as bad as before, as there are numerous tech companies that are profitable, well managed, and responsible. \n\nAnother difference is access to information being far easier now than before. Anyone can plot  hypothetical growth of $1 starting in stock x and how much it would be worth now despite two and likely three recessions. If you can wither a storm for a year to a few years, you're still going to do better than if you didn't invest in stocks/indexes/mutual funds across the board.

I was raised in an \"end of days\" cult and didn't think the world would last into my now middle age. That made me angry and reckless, I almost went to prison but had middle class parents who paid for a lawyer. That's a huge advantage, a poor person would have been ruined *for life*.\n\nWe can blame young me for not going to business school. We can blame young me for not starting a retirement plan when I started later at my family's business. I'd be set for sure. But that doesn't change what's happened to the whole country over the last 20 years. Wages haven't kept up with basics. The poor are literally having a harder time than you and me did.\n\nFast-forward 25 years. I'm a husband, father and homeowner.\n\nWhile working for him, my father suddenly collapsed and went into a sort of coma. When he came back, he'd lost his recently built memories but had old memories, very painful to watch. The manager and I offered to keep it open, but my dad had been ruining it poorly and my mother didn't think it would work.  She liquidated it and ended 6 people's middle class jobs.\n\n**This is the shock I had when I lost my 60k career in an extremely specialized field after 15 years: starting wages don't even pay rent and food.** All this talk of avocado toast is pure propaganda. Rent, food and life services are twice the price and min wage, which I'm above, hasn't doubled in that time. So that means all young people are starting out with less than you or me. Anyone set back can't just work harder to catch back up.\n\nAfter my career loss, I was laid-off twice in a row. Each job paying less.  I was up 25' in the air on power/telephone poles, in the rain and lightning, for $15hr. Literally risking my life daily for insulting wages. No one deserves that, not the kids just starting out, no one.\n\nThen the divorce and having my life's work taken and given to another man in the span of a few months was devastating. I still went to work every damn day. From the lack of sleep, I crashed a company vehicle and got fired at my job *that was paying less than I make now* anyway\\*.\\*\n\nI'm in the process of starting a guitar manufacturing/repair business.

Mostly fighting.\n\nSince I retired I've mostly dabbled in 3D printers. Haven't done much with drones or software.\n\nThe hardware probably interests me more than the software too, because honestly the software is more tedious for the most part. However, I am currently really interested in GPS data processing. Current state of the art in consumer and commercial drones is that a black box GPS chipset produces a position estimate without any help from other sensors and then that is fused with other data. The better way to do this is to process the raw data and use the other sensors (IMU and barometric altimetry) to help determine which of the various GPS signals to believe. Can be taken further than that - the high bandwidth/accuracy estimated velocity can be fed forward into the actual carrier wave tracking loops, making the signal lock more robust.\n\nAnyway I need to find someone who will actually pay me to work on it.

Drought. Production shortages. Historically low inventories. And pandemic backlash. Energy markets across the planet have been put through the wringer over the past year, and consumers have suffered the consequences of soaring prices. But, somehow, things are on track to get even worse.\r  \n\r  \nBlame the heat. Summer in much of the Northern Hemisphere is a typical peak for electricity use. This year, it‚Äôs going to be sweltering as climate change tightens its grip. It‚Äôs already so hot in parts of South Asia that the air temperatures are blistering enough to cook raw salmon. Scientists are predicting scorching months ahead for the US. Power use will surge as homes and businesses crank up air conditioners.\r  \n\r  \nThe problem is that energy supplies are so fragile that there just won‚Äôt be enough to go around, and power cuts will put lives at risk when there are no fans or air conditioners to provide relief from searing temperatures.\r  \n\r  \nAsia‚Äôs heatwave has caused hours-long daily blackouts, putting more than 1 billion people at risk across Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and India, with little relief in sight. Six Texas power plants failed earlier this month as the summer heat just began to arrive, offering a preview of what‚Äôs to come. At least a dozen US states from California to the Great Lakes are at risk of electricity outages this summer. Power supplies will be tight in China and Japan. South Africa is poised for a record year of power cuts. And Europe is in a precarious position that's held up by Russia ‚Äî if Moscow cuts off natural gas to the region, that could trigger rolling outages in some countries.\r  \n\r  \n‚ÄúWar and sanctions are disrupting supply and demand, and that‚Äôs coupled with extreme weather and an economic rebound from Covid boosting power demand,‚Äù said Shantanu Jaiswal, a BloombergNEF analyst. ‚ÄúThe confluence of so many factors is quite unique. I can‚Äôt recall the last time they all happened together.‚Äù\r  \n\r  \nElectricity Loadshedding Amid Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. Supply Issues\r  \nSouth Africa is on track for a record year of power cuts.Photographer: Dwayne Senior/Bloomberg\r  \nWhy Blackouts Bring Suffering and Economic Pain\r  \nWithout power, human welfare will be under duress. Poverty, age and proximity to the equator will increase the likelihood of illness and death from unrelenting temperatures. Prolonged outages would mean that tens of thousands may also lose access to clean water.\r  \n\r  \nIf blackouts persist, and businesses shutter, that will also bring huge economic shock.\r  \n\r  \nIn India, power shortages in many states are already nearing levels from 2014, when they were estimated to have shaved about 5% off the country‚Äôs gross domestic product. That would mean a reduction of almost $100 billion should the outages become more widespread and last through the year. A run on electricity would also likely contribute to more gains for power and fuel markets, raising utility bills and further fanning inflation. When plants on the Texas power grid failed this month, wholesale power prices in Houston briefly jumped above the $5,000 a megawatt-hour price cap, surging 22 times higher than the average cost of on-peak power that had been secured for the day.\r  \n\r  \nSoaring Demand\r  \nIndia's power demand is soaring above historic seasonal highs\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSource: Vidyut Pravah\r  \n\r  \nThe world is grappling with ‚Äúmore than two years of global supply chain distress caused by the pandemic, the spreading fallout from the war in Ukraine and extreme weather caused by climate change,‚Äù said Henning Gloystein, an analyst at Eurasia Group. ‚ÄúThe main risk is that if we see major blackouts on top of all the aforementioned problems this year, that could trigger some form of humanitarian crisis in terms of food and energy shortages on a scale not seen in decades.‚Äù\r  \n\r  \n \r  \n\r  \nHow the Energy Transition Brings Strain\r  \nThis year might enter the record books for the biggest-ever strain on global power, but the hurdles aren‚Äôt likely to go away anytime soon. Climate change means that the extreme heatwaves of today will become more common, continuing to mount pressure on electricity supplies.\r  \n\r  \nAt the same time, a lack of investment in fossil fuels in recent years coupled with strong demand growth, especially in Asian emerging markets, should keep markets tight for the next few years, said Alex Whitworth, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Shanghai. And while wind and solar‚Äôs share of total capacity is expected to soar over the next decade, until energy storage facilities catch up to the shift, that will place even more stress on grids, he said.\r  \n\r  \n‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be facing a supply scare every time there‚Äôs clouds or storms or a wind drought for a week,‚Äù Whitworth said. ‚ÄúWe really expect these problems to get worse in the next five years.‚Äù\r  \n\r  \nOf course, the switch to renewable power is crucial in the fight against climate change. Burning even more coal now to cope with the energy shortage would just increase emissions, creating a vicious cycle that can lead to more heatwaves and more strain on grids.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Here‚Äôs a look at what‚Äôs happening across the globe. \r  \n\r  \nInside The California Independent System Operator During The Solar Eclipse\r  \nThe California Independent System Operator said this month that the state may be at risk of blackouts for the next few summers amid extreme weather.Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\r  \nUS\r  \nSupplies of natural gas, the No. 1 power-plant fuel in the US, are constrained nationwide and prices are soaring. Power in much of the country and part of Canada will be stretched, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. It‚Äôs among the most dire assessments yet from the regulatory body. Consumers will be asked to step up to help keep the grids stable by curtailing their consumption.  \r  \n\r  \nIn California, the most populous state, gas supplies are clipped even further because of a pipeline rupture last year that has limited imports. Plus, climate change is fueling drought, severely curbing hydropower supplies. The California Independent System Operator said this month that the state may be at risk of blackouts for the next few summers amid extreme weather.\r  \n\r  \nOn the 15-state grid operated by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), consumers in 11 states are at risk of outages. MISO, which serves about 42 million people, projected it has ‚Äúinsufficient‚Äù power generation to meet the highest demand periods this summer, especially in its Midwest states. The grid has never before given a warning of this kind ahead of the start of summer demand.\r  \n\r  \nIn Texas, the grid ‚Äúis still at risk‚Äù of shortages despite the state‚Äôs scramble to improve resilience after a February 2021 winter storm that left millions in the dark for days, said Gary Cunningham, director of market research at brokerage Tradition Energy.\r  \n\r  \nAging infrastructure and maintenance delays during the pandemic have added to the problems of more severe weather, said Teri Viswanath, lead economist for power, energy and water at CoBank ACB.\r  \n\r  \n‚ÄúThe US is experiencing more outages globally than any other industrialized nation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAbout 70% of our grid is nearing end of life.‚Äù\r  \n\r  \nRead more: The outlook for US summer blackouts\r  \n\r  \n \r  \n\r  \nEconomy As India CPI Figures Are Released\r  \nIn India, 16 of the nation‚Äôs 28 states have been grappling with outages of two to 10 hours a day.Photographer: Kanishka Sonthalia/Bloomberg\r  \nAsia\r  \nThe epicenter of the outages so far has been South and Southeast Asia, where brutal heat waves have put air conditioners on full blast. Blackouts have been basically nationwide in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, home to a combined 300 million people. And in India, 16 of the nation‚Äôs 28 states ‚Äî home to more than 700 million people ‚Äî have been grappling with outages of two to 10 hours a day, a state official said this month.\r  \n\r  \nIndia‚Äôs government has recently directed firms to increase purchases of expensive foreign coal, while also rolling back environmental protocols for mine expansions to try to increase fuel supply. But it remains to be seen whether these moves will ease the strain. The looming monsoon season should bring cooler temperatures and trim energy demand, though it can also flood mining regions and hamper fuel supply.\r  \n\r  \nIn Vietnam, the state-owned utility has been bracing for power shortages for more than a month as demand rises while domestic coal supply has sagged and foreign fuel costs have surged.\r  \n\r  \nIn China, where coal shortages led to widespread power curtailments last year, officials have promised to keep the lights on in 2022 and have pressed coal miners to boost output to a record. Even so, industry officials have warned that the power situation will be tight this summer in the country‚Äôs heavily industrialized south, which is far from inland mining hubs and therefore more reliant on expensive foreign coal and gas.\r  \n\r  \nJapan had a power scare in March, when a cold wave triggered a demand surge just days after an earthquake had knocked several coal and gas plants offline. Power supply is expected to be tight during the upcoming summer months, and demand will likely exceed supply again next winter as well, according to grid forecasts. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has started a campaign for energy conservation, asking residents to take measures like watching less television.\r  \n\r  \nEnagas SA Gas Storage Facility Tour\r  \nSpain has only small gas connections to the rest of Europe, but has about 30% of the continent‚Äôs liquefied natural gas regasification capacity.Photographer: Angel Garcia/Bloomberg\r  \nEurope\r  \nThe risk of blackouts is lower in Europe, because fewer people use air conditioning at home. The continent is also racing to fill its gas storage. \r  \n\r  \nBut there‚Äôs little room for error. A dry spring in Norway has limited hydropower supplies. Adding pressure to prices and supplies are extended outages at Electricite de France SA's nuclear reactors. The region‚Äôs biggest producer cut its nuclear output target for a third time this year, the latest sign that Europe‚Äôs power crisis is worsening.\r  \n\r  \nIf Russia were to cut off natural gas supplies to the region, that could be enough to trigger rolling blackouts in some countries, said Fabian Ronningen, a power markets analyst for Rystad Energy.\r  \n\r  \nWhile he said the chances that Russia would make that bold move are ‚Äúunlikely,‚Äù his views have become more pessimistic as the war in Ukraine continues; two months ago, he said, he‚Äôd have put the chances at ‚Äúhighly unlikely.‚Äù\r  \n\r  \nSome countries have been receiving huge imports of liquefied natural gas and would probably have adequate supplies to absorb the blow, including Spain, France and the UK. The story might be different in Eastern Europe, where nations including Greece, Latvia and Hungary use gas for a significant portion of their power and are heavily dependent on Russian supplies.

Inventories have shifted from deficient to excessive and will need to be redressed with price discounts. The growth in money supply has literally collapsed and there is nary a pulse in money velocity. Fiscal policy, in the span of a year, has shifted from radical stimulus to restraint that would cause the remnants of the Tea Party to blush. The cyclical aspect to the commodity bull market is in the rear-view mirror. And as Jay Powell myopically focuses on ‚Äújob openings,‚Äù a very soft data point, he is missing the upturn in layoffs and the retreat in company hiring plans.\n\nInflation is going to melt in the coming year, and few - if any - are prepared for it. I feel like I am reliving the summer of 2008.\n\nEvery recession in the economy necessarily involves a contraction in earnings, which hasn‚Äôt happened yet. It‚Äôs all been about the multiple.\n\nSo far, that is. A plain-vanilla GDP recession, no matter how mild or severe, sees corporate profits decline more than 20% from the peak. And so that is the next shoe to drop. And it also means that once the analysts start to come to grips with reality and begin to cut their numbers, investors who are dipping their toes back into the market now because they believe that valuations have ‚Äúimproved‚Äù enough will face an ugly reality. Based on where the consensus will be forced to go on their future EPS estimates, the equity market is not nearly as ‚Äúcheap‚Äù as it appears to be at the moment.\n\nNobody can ring a bell at peaks or troughs. But there are well-established patterns at the fundamental lows. For one, the recession view has to become mainstream. Analysts have to overdo their downward earnings projections. There is no market trough until the Fed is done tightening; and in a recession bear market as opposed to a liquidity-led drawdown (as in late 2018), it takes actual policy easing to put the market lows in. That is a considerable time away.\n\nThe stock market also needs help from the Treasury market for ‚Äúrelative‚Äù valuation support. In the past, the end of a bear market in equities required an average 135-basis point drop in the 10-year Treasury note yield. So before anyone can turn bullish on stocks, history shows that we need a big bond rally first. Memo to asset mix teams. That means a slice back below 2%.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the dividend yield on the S&P 500 is a puny 1.5% ‚Äî bear markets do not typically end until the dividend yield converges on the bond yield. Which arithmetically means a low for the S&P 500 closer to 3,300. So the answer is ‚Äî no, we‚Äôre not there yet.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Selling off to 420 then we gud.

And while there was a bubble throughout growth stocks through 20-21, that has largely burst at this point with most of those falling 80-90% from their highs.\n\nBut not Tesla. It has remained amazingly resilient. But now cracks are starting to form. And because of the way the market is configured and the relative position to Tesla and other stocks in the indices this could be setting up for a very unique crash scenario.\n\nIn past crashes there was heavy correlation between individual stocks and the indices. They all moved as a unit. But Tesla and a couple other fang stocks have been extremely resilient. Tesla though still trades at a massive premium and operates in a very capital intensive business. Not a great combo when liquidity starts drying up.\n\nNow because of the fact that most of the market has already experienced a massive correction I don‚Äôt think there will be much correlation between Tesla and say the S&P. Why is that significant? Because limit down rules apply to indexes not individual stocks. And while exchanges reserve the right to halt trading if spreads are too wide and volatility too great, as we‚Äôve seen that rarely prevents giants moves.\n\nI think the recent price action and volume in Tesla looks like a market about to crash. Again I think this would be largely limited to Tesla if it happened as the overall markets looked to firm up a bit last week with a lot of damage done.\n\nI could see Tesla falling 40-60% easily from where it is in a couple of sessions.\n\nCrashes usually follow this pattern whether it be a single asset or an entire market: initial break on innocuous headline, continued downtrend, volume begins to mount and then you get basically a week of extreme selling on higher and higher volume that crescendos into a crash. I think the overall market weakness combined with Elon‚Äôs antics might just be enough to trigger it.
