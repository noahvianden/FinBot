Have about 50k in there saved for many years. So I thought well, US market is pretty good for options so I might have better luck there. And then the nightmare began last week.\n\nLooking for high volume, I chose weekly NVDA and TSLA... yea... you know where this is going. Got lucky with NVDA on a pretty OTM put spread, but TSLA burned me. I chose a couple of +10% OTM put spreads 2 days before Friday and still got my ass handed to me. I was able to roll it to this week, and then to next week, but it looks grim\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/hLMWu2j\n\nThis is already putting me pretty close to my equity margin, and Schwab is not allowing me to roll it forward anymore. I have around 10k in premiums received last week that I could probably open some positions with (maybe?). So... is this salvageable without fucking my whole portfolio? Any alternative strategy I could try to fix this? What would you do?\n\nSorry, I know I mismanaged the risk with that first trade and opened a bigger position that I should. And this will be a valuable lesson if I can't get out of it.

Even if you have 1000 wash sales for 1000 trades, as long as you close the washing trade in the same tax year, the wash sales have no impact on your net taxes whatsoever. This is because the loss is deferred into the cost basis of the washing trade. Losing 500 just increases the cost basis of the washing trade by 500, so your eventual gain on that washing trade is reduced, exactly as what would happen if your deducted the loss on taxes.\n\nWash sales are only an issue if the loss happens in one tax year and the deferred cost basis trade is closed in a different tax year. This is where the section 1256 part comes in. Because section 1256 contracts are \"mark to market\", meaning, you must pay taxes *as if you realized a gain/loss on the last business day of the year*, when you continue to hold the position through to the next year. This means the wash sale rule can't be applied if the mark to market results in a loss, since you can't be held accountable for holding a substantially similar position (the actual identically same position, since you never closed it) when it wasn't your decision to take the loss in the first place. It's a special case.\n\nI find conflicting information about realizing a loss *before* the end of the year on a 1256. One source says normal wash sale rules would apply, like if you closed a SPX call on June 1 for a loss, you could still wash if you bought the same call from May through July. Another source says such contracts are market-to-market at the end of every day, and so can't be washed. Maybe /u/redtexture can clarify.\n\nBut whatever the case, it's still a non-issue.

Experienced folks, please explain!  \n>  \n>Say, there's an AMD call for $87 on May 27. What now?! Is it not a put?\n\nHopefully you've heard that a call option is a contract entitling its holder to buy 100 shares of the underlying security at the strike price by the expiration date.  And a put option is a contract entitling its holder to sell 100 shares of the underlying security at the strike price by the expiration date.  \n\nSo think of a call option like a retail coupon.  Imagine you had a piece of paper that said \"This certificate entitles the bearer to buy 100 shares of AMD at a price of $87 per share (or, a total of $8700 for 100 shares.)  Expiration date: 5/27/2022.\"\n\nWhat's written on that piece of paper doesn't change depending on whether AMD's current market price is greater or less than 87.  So how could it become a put?  It doesn't matter what AMD's price is; it's still a contract allowing you to *buy* AMD at a specific price, not *sell* it.\n\n>Why would I buy a stock that I believe in, predicting it'll be $87? When it is now over $90 at the moment.\n\nYou're not buying a stock.  You're buying a coupon that lets you buy that stock at $87 per share.  That's not a prediction that the stock will be at 87.  Let's say a bottle of Tide laundry detergent is $20 at Target.  And I have a coupon for 1 bottle of Tide for $15.  If you buy that coupon from me, does that somehow imply that you think the price of a bottle of Tide is going to drop to $15?\n\n If the stock is currently at 90, the ability to buy it at 87 is a good deal, right?  And if the stock goes up to 95, the ability to buy it at 87 is an even better deal!  So if AMD goes up in price, the call option becomes worth more.  And if it's worth more, you can sell it for a profit.  That's the goal.  NOT to exercise it and buy the stock; rather, to treat the option itself the same way you want to treat stock: buy it low and sell it high.\n\n>  \n>  \n>And the last question on which the advice would be appreciated - what do I do with my BestBuy 05/27 67C put?

Have you had greater difficulties rolling credit spreads on profitable stocks?\n\nBy using spreads, contracts can be closed earlier for a higher win rate resulting in more profit overall.

I'll do me and outline my reasoning below.\n\nFact: Spreads are  not harder to roll  if they are written on stocks with high liquidity and timed appropriately. Try it. I have rolled a great many and I have also rolled a great many straight put contracts. The key is the underlying. Regardless of what we read online, we both know that quality stock selection is the cornerstone of any trading strategy and it is essential with either approach. (This gets neglected in these forums.)\n\nFact: Assuming the same strike price, the far lower risk per contract of spreads compared to straight put contracts (15 to 20% of comparable max loss if the long leg is wide enough to create a drag of less than 30% on the premium) means that typically five spread contracts could be sold to reach an equivalent total max loss as a single put contract. I would generally lower this to create additional buffer. In such a case, max profit is still typically 200 -300% higher.\n\nGiven the potential entanglement of two legs, the solution is to exit the spread quicker, at a lower gain percentage. Even so, profit is still much higher than with single contracts. An exit point of 25% - 35% of initial premium results in a higher win rate, faster turnover and ultimately greater total retention of premium than with single contracts, with a lower potential max loss. Spreads are better protection and make more money if run judiciously with significant cash in the background. Just be particular on what stocks are being run (and market conditions.)\n\nFact: Non-performing spreads requiring rolling do accumulate in market downturns just as assignments accumulate for those running the wheel. And they do occasionally take a while to work their way through your account. Still, in my judgement they are preferable to selling covered calls. They are a far smaller drain on buying power than 100 long shares. \n\nSay what you want, but the well known fact is that covered calls are not as profitable as CSPs and reasonable premium is hard to consistently achieve without having your stock called away. In general it is better to perfect the profitable side of the wheel and only use the other half to accumulate stocks you like long term and then to take profits.\n\nThere. I've done me.

We ended up turning it into an iron condor and closed for a modest loss.  My put was rolled and ended up being closed for a small profit when the stock moves back up.\n\nOne other thing on calls is that they do vary based on IV, so this may be a factor.  My method usually has the net stock cost lower due to the premiums collected, and this is closer to ATM so I can sell some very rich premiums.

And this has always been the case, you can read these stories from over 100 years ago.\n\n***It will continue to drop.*** \n\nCompanies are starting to lay people off right now. That has a domino effect.  Unskilled workers are already suffering from the high inflation costs. This will have a really bad effect on the economy and communities. \n\nAs costs rise, people will cut back on spending. It's all fairly predictable. And that spending is cut back, those companies start missing earnings (retail stocks).\n\nThat will in turn pull down other stocks. Those companies will then start making some cuts.\n\nOnce companies start losing some of the top employees, they will draw the line and have to make the call. Do I worry about my stock price or do I worry about the company?\n\nThen you've hit the bottom.\n\nLayoffs will be the first sign we are nearing the bottom. Once we're at the bottom and these types of events are normal in the news, the mission changes. As companies operate in a recession and there is talk about \"the new normal\". Then slowly the money will start to eek back into the market.\n\nWhen you look at the market overall, what we just witnessed is a 1 in a 100-year event. Look at the \"max timeline\" of the S&P 500 and that is obvious. \n\nDraw a trend line on it. We broke up hard. \n\nWe vastly increased the money supply. The leverage at play is significantly larger than people realize. The average person does not understand how our fractional reserve monetary system works.\n\nI believe we will correct, not to the trend, but somewhere above it when factoring in the money supply effects and the fact that Europe and China are not good places to invest and protect money. So we'll have the added benefit of international investment in US stocks.\n\nIf you don't think people knew this would happen, just go find all the \"inflation\" conversations from when the PPP and COVID bailout programs were just starting to become a thing.\n\nYou can't give away free money without paying the piper.\n\nThat money goes into the market, and then all of us who know how money works cash out while we're ahead and shaking our heads at the idiocy of \"diamond hands\" or \"to the moon\". To the moon? Sure, then the gravitational pull of the moon slings that spaceship around and right back at Earth which enters the atmosphere in a blazing ball of plasma.\n\nWhat about the margin calls? Are any of you watching the economic calendar as well as 30-60-90 credit default rates? The 60 day default is higher than pre-COVID, and we didn't have this inflation Pre-COVID.\n\nThe real-estate market is overpriced, more over priced in % than the 2006-2009 crash. (I disagree with the 2009 crash, the crash happened over 3 years).\n\nThose people all paying larger mortgages, more for food and gas, etc. That's not going to go very well. People got the COVID money and felt rich, they then went out about bought things as if they'll continue to have all that extra money. \n\nWe'll see some really low disposable income numbers in about 18 months.

What I can say is that if they were to somehow fix or circumvent the iOS14+ privacy changes they would absolutely regain all of the ad spend from before the issue as FB WAS working, and working well. \n\nTikTok, SNAP, Pinterest, Twitter, BING, these are all either low-volume, or low-ROI channels.

Google is not. So, **in terms of reallocation you have Google & Google Display Network (GDN) to increase spend on and still hit +ROI.**\n\nLonger-term, we'll eventually leave FB like we did Yahoo 20 years ago, or BING in the last 5 years.

It's an odd choice. If you dive through platform-side metrics you can see clicks for each device type, but conversions? Oh, that's under N/A. Doesn't matter where it came from, it gets lumped into N/A. \n\nGoogle doesn't do this, and the only reason I can think of that FB has decided to do this is because it helps them promote a more *holistic approach* for advertisers and to say \"quit relying on conversion metrics for specific devices and let's focus on the many touch points that lead to a conversion!\"\n\nThis is what Google is rolling out now as well, it's called Data-Driven Attribution (DDA) that will soon become mandatory for all ad campaigns. Instead of a last-click model, they'll shift to a \"here's all of the touch points a user that has converted has been exposed to\"\n\nIt's a way to both shift the blame of attribution on iOS and to promote a model that will make way more money - forgetting about last click attribution and focusing on advertising on every channel within the ad platform because it all leads to conversion. \n\nOf course, I'm digressing a bit, but that's total bullshit. I expect all ad platforms to implement this new attribution model and all it means in the end is more money for the advertisers. \n\nNow you say \"fucking awesome, that means FB and Google and SNAP and all of them will have even BIGGER earnings', but that's where it breaks down. \n\nWithout proper attribution, and then adding higher spend, you're essentially getting similar results with less attribution visibility for way more money. It simply won't back out for us advertisers. CPM's have already skyrocketed. Throw in not knowing where the hell the conversion came from and you're stuck dumping money into all of the ad channels (i.e. Audience Manager, IG, IG Video, .etc) and not knowing which of them is working. \n\nIt's complicated for sure. Ultimately, it just boils down to this. Advertisers will be forced to spend more money for less visibility and it's already too expensive to justify for many of the companies I work with (some being Unicorns) \n\nWe all want to hit the time machine and go back.

Well, let me tell you - it's far from over. \n\nThe pandemic created so much demand for online shopping that Amazon started building up warehouses left and right thinking they were taking over the planet and nothing could stop them. I assume some of their top managers are regards from this sub so they thought demand was going TO THE MOON FOREVER and approved every construction project that crossed their desks. The chicken are now coming home to roost. \n\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-21/amazon-aims-to-sublet-end-warehouse-leases-as-online-sales-cool\n\nWith the dawn of the era of free money, people are now living paycheck to paycheck and getting their bill-paying money behind Wendy's. Inflation is hitting millions of Americans really hard and they no longer think about shopping on Amazon because the national average gas price is over $4 and some groceries have doubled or even tripled in price. Demand is collapsing very fast!\n\nApparently, they now have so much excess warehouse capacity that they don't know what to do with it. Based on various sources, it is anywhere between 10 and 30 million sqft of vacuum with 4 walls. Amazon reps tried to play it cool and said that it's an easy one - they'd just sublet it. But with rocketing inflation in almost everything, what dumbass will get into it? \n\nBasically, Amazon is fuk and going to shave off another 50% soon along with the rest of the market.\n\nPositions: 75% cash while on my knees behind a Wendy's.

{"title": "Why Lululemon will tank on earnings (june 2nd) and how you can profit (puts)", "selftext": "This is not financial advice, but do exactly as I say and you will get very rich, I pinky-promise.\n\nPosition: 10 puts with 270 strike price and june 3 expiry.\n\n**‘Athleisure’ is not a moat**\n\nLululemon sells yoga pants. Fashion media widely credits Lululemon with inventing, and then commendably exploiting, ‘athleisure’: combining yoga pants and other workout apparel with a vest or jacket so you can look as hot as you think you do in the gym while doing non-sports related activities. You might recognize this trend as something you have furiously masturbated to. Athleisure might be the single biggest fashion trend of the last five years and it got an extra boom with pandemic lockdowns, because who wants to wear tight jeans while binging on Ozark and mayonnaise.\n\nHowever, inventing the idea that Hailey Baldwin can combine expensive yoga pants with a Balenciaga jacket for a fresh look is not a moat. Over the last few years countless brands have jumped on this trend. Each with their own little subcategory that they’re catering to, for instance, really fat people who should probably refrain from wearing sportswear altogether.\n\n**Unless you work behind the dumpster at Wendy’s, you’re not wearing yoga pants to work**\n\nAlso, athleisure is probably a thing of the past anyway. In fashion blogs, return to the office is the single most discussed topic these days. Because what will we wear? Not the same stuff as pre-covid, because we have gotten fat, even fatter than before. Also, we have grown accustomed to the idea that track pants, joggers and slippers are things that are perfectly suited for pretty much any activity. Most fashion blogs recognize this and are anticipating that work clothes will be a lot more relaxed from now on, dress will be a little less formal and conservative and more relaxed and creative. Retailers say demand backs this up.\n\nHowever, that is not the same thing as wearing yoga pants while walking the dog, which is what made Lululemon great.\n\nLululemon seems to recognize the days of overpriced yoga pants selling like hotcakes are over, so now they’re trying to do something else: fit into this new trend by trying to get us to wear sportswear to the office. Their site now is full of pants that look formal but are actually jogging pants, or button down shirts made from a breathable fabric with tiny holes in them.\n\nI don’t think it will take off. What I think will happen is a continuation of the trend that brands will create a lot more casual blazers and pants with elastic bands and what not. What I don’t think will happen is people wearing jogging pants and golf shirts to work.\n\n**Men want to fuck, not wear, Lululemon**\n\nThat brings me to the bigger problem. One of the big pillars of LLL’s growth strategy is that they want to quadruple sales in the men’s category. The problem with that is the LLL logo is either a woman doing down dog, or a vagina, depending on how you look at it. Furthermore this brand is and will forever be associated with tight asses in yoga pants. Just go to their website right now and tell me the first thing you see. This is a brand that heterosexual men want to fuck, not wear. I don’t think they can pull it off and I think we will see the first signs of that this quarter.\n\n**Mirror is the dumbest thing since Peloton. Remember Peloton?**\n\nLululemon forked over a half billion in cold hard cash to acquire mirror, a magic mirror that screams at you to do another round of pushups. It’s the most ridiculous thing you have ever seen, it is literally a giant mirror that displays fitness video’s. It is also 1400 dollars with a 40 dollar monthly subscription attached to it. The proposition was preposterous to begin with but with lockdowns being a thing of the past not to mention the recent sweltering heat or, I don’t know, a recession on the way, this is just ridiculousnesses all around. Already sales forecasts are being adjusted, meaning, shredded. It’s not even that this mistake will hurt the company that bad, it’s more of a sign that the people running the company have no idea how to sustain this incredible growth that they have been promising at every earnings call.\n\n**Their running shoes will almost certainly flop**\n\nWhich brings me to another new product, running shoes. Lululemon made a big stink about their new running shoe, the ‘blissfeel’, a name that will certainly appeal to the coveted male demographic haha not. Some analyst recently claimed the shoes received ‘generally good reviews’ and ‘key colors and sizes were sold out, which is a good sign’.\n\nHowever, those claims do not hold up to scrutiny. For one, the shoes being sold out probably just means they’re having supply chain issues, which they already told us about. Also, it’s 2022. Everything receives good reviews, because whoever is doing the reviewing is most likely trying to sell you the stuff as well. With that being said, Blissfeel reviews were middling at best. For instance, Runners World wrote: ‘The shoe’s lack of a ‘pop’ is a bit of a bugbear: they don’t feel ‘dead’ when your foot hits the ground – far from it – but with just a little more bounciness from the midsole foam, you’d have a shoe that would potentially make your long runs feel easier – and your speed sessions faster. To be realistic though – no one gets it perfect first time and, as Lululemon’s first foray into the running shoe market, we’re genuinely impressed.’\n\nBut that’s the thing – the consumer does not care at all that this is your first foray into this market. Au contraire mon frère, people want something tried and true from a running shoe. Like Asics. Tom’s guide wrote:\n\n‘In today’s world of carbon fiber plates and technical midsole foams, the Lululemon Blissfeel is a pretty basic running shoe, but it’s not pretending to be anything more than this. It’s a solid workhorse, designed for Lululemon fans who want to head out for a run a few times a week, while repping their favorite brand.’\n\nThat doesn’t sound like a roaring endorsement to me.\n\nSo who is this shoe for? Women –certainly not men- who don’t really care about an optimal fit (interestingly, Lululemon actually tries to sell this lack of options as ‘diversity’, as in, this shoe is for everyone), running technology (see reviews above), a trustworthy brand, or looks, as they look incredibly basic. I am guessing that’s a small market. Then there’s the fact that there’s a lot of shoes out there, especially in the $150 range. Nike Pegasus, Adidas Ultraboost, Hoka’s, Asics.\n\nAlso, who’s running anymore, we did that during the pandemic, now we’re back doing crossfit or whatever. This Q will give us a first glimpse at how these shoes have sold and I’m guessing it won’t be very good.\n\n**Breaking into other continents is hard when you’re not a virus**\n\nAnother part of the LLL strategy is incredible growth in other continents. Which is harder than it sounds. See you can go to Brazil, go into the woods, walk for 50 miles through the rainforest and arrive at a hidden village of 20 people, and you might spot someone wearing a Nike swoosh, or at the very least, they will know what Nike is. I’m not sure that is the case with Lululemon. It is not easy to break into new markets. In my not to be named European country, there is only a single store. Besides a few die hard yogis, the brand awareness is virtually non-existent. LLL’s plan so far just seems to be ‘expand into Europe? Let’s just do it’ which is a Nike slogan by the way but for a sports brand that’s just not as easy as it is for let’s say a virus from China or Nigeria.\n\n**Nike and Adidas will run them out of their hood**\n\nLululemon is planning to branch out to a bunch of different sports, like tennis and golf. But those sports already have brands. Nike is paying Naomi Osaka $10 million a year, just so you might be persuaded to think that your tennis shorts should have a swoosh on them. These markets are kind of like certain neighborhoods in that you can’t just show up there one day and say hey you know what I like what you guys got going on here let me get a piece of this action, because you might get, you know, yourself killed.\n\n**Freight costs and other supply chain issues**\n\nLast quarter, Lululemon was complaining a bit about how freight costs and supply chain issues were hurting their bottom line. All of their stuff is made in countries like Vietnam and China. This quarter, they will likely complain a lot more.\n\n**American budgets are tighter than yoga pants**\n\nDid you know that a recent Gallup poll has shown that, during an economic downturn, 86% of American families say $120 yoga pants are among the first expenses they might cut back on?\n\n**China lockdowns**\n\nLululemon’s biggest market besides the US is China, where they operate 86 stores (of 500 total) with of course a whole bunch of them in the Shanghai area. China did not have a great quarter this quarter. After more or less inventing covid, they are now the last country on earth to figure out how to deal with it. There were a bunch of lockdowns and consumer confidence isn’t doing so well. I doubt they bought very many overpriced yoga pants this quarter. Maybe some people got a mirror though. I hope the classes are available in Chinese. Also, from what I heard the Chinese attitude towards work is decidedly un-relaxed, so wearing joggers to work is probably out of the question as well.\n\n**Retail will get 'punched in the face'**\n\n“A lot of CEOs have come on TV and said ‘oh I have lots of pricing power and I can do whatever I want and make a lot of money’,” Bullard said Friday, [in an interview on the Fox Business Network.](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/feds-bullard-says-recession-will-only-come-if-theres-a-large-shock-to-economy)\n\n“But I think some of them are going to get punched in the face here with the fact that consumers have to react” to higher inflation, he said.\n\nEarlier on yahoo, analyst ADRIENNE YIH: \"Yeah, they have extreme pricing power. The pants run anywhere between $118 up to $128. And so that is, that is an extraordinarily high price for arguably a legging.\"\n\n**P/E ratio 36**\n\nJefferies analyst Randal Konik wrote in a note to clients that Lululemon’s plans ‘will require an added level of execution prowess, as well as stability in the broader macroeconomic environment, that may be difficult to attain’. As your portfolio might have noticed, that stability has indeed proven rather difficult. Even though Lulu has already fallen a lot, it is still priced for enormous growth. Expectations are incredibly high. If the numbers are good, not great, the market will rightfully judge it as ‘terrible’ and it will tank. Which is why you might consider getting puts.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nLululemon apparel is too expensive at a time where people are cutting back on consumer discretionary and are shifting expenses from ‘at home’ to ‘at the office’. There are plenty of cheaper alternatives, their shoes are terrible, Mirror is preposterous, men don’t want to wear vagina’s, joggers will not be worn to the office, supply chain issues and freight costs will weigh heavily on the bottom line, and China is not buying anything, all while the stock is (still) priced for enormous growth. Like a girl with a big ass in yoga pants in one of the many BangBros videos about yoga class, Lululemon earnings will get their back blown out.\n\nPosition: 10 puts with 270 strike price and june 3rd expiry, 5 puts 270 expiry june 17th", "id": "uw1jbn", "created_utc": 1653316255.0, "score": 138, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|494|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uw1jbn)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uw1jbn)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not disputing that it will tank and that mirror is fully retarded but you are dead wrong about their mens clothes.

{"title": "Big Bear with Big Bull Implications ($BBAI)", "selftext": " \n\nThis has all been posted by [u/Pennyether](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pennyether/), I'm just relaying the message to all you apes so you can get in on this amazing play (see original posts [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PennyEther/comments/ut7r72/bbai_something_going_on/) and [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PennyEther/comments/uu1ut8/bbai_great_setup_for_next_week_1m_float_verified/)).\n\n**BBAI** \\- Great set-up for this week, 1m float verified.. but awaits a catalyst\n\nThe Float - confirmed 1m\n\nFirstly, the float. In my last post, I noted the float was around 1m, but that Ortex had said it was 4m (literally seconds after me posting my DD).\n\nThere was [a somewhat contentious twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ORTEX/status/1527332982876299269) between some BBAI bulls and Ortex. Ortex thought the float was 4m, others thought it was 1m. Well, upon further review, **Ortex agreed that the float is 1m.**\n\n[Here's their correction](https://twitter.com/ORTEX/status/1527666484276625408)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dp295fnru8191.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=36c04a7886c63b92283803d7ff05bcb33653117b\n\nThe ramifications of a confirmed low float?\n\n1. The stock is clearly illiquid.. but it's nice to know that 3m shares of outflow can't (in theory) come out of nowhere, should the price rapidly rise.\n2. The SI of approx 780k shares implies a short % float of 78%. That's pretty high. Makes sense CTB is 720%. These numbers could put this stock in the spotlight, and on screeners. One minor caveat is the 1m float number is unlikely to be fixed in the standard datasets. (But this could work in our favor.. MMs might also operate off this higher float number.)\n3. Being in both the \"high-SI\" and \"low-float\" and \"optionable\" category makes it more likely there's a pile-on at some point, fueled by the squeeze-hungry masses.\n\nNone are particularly ground-breaking, but all play in my favor. So, I *definitely* like this news.\n\nOI and Gamma\n\nLet's see what happened yesterday:\n\nLook at 1-day change. May OTMs closed... good news\n\nBasically, a lot of the OTM options were closed, presumably on the brief ramp up. For me, that represents a lot of sellers that left the options market. The magnitude of the corresponding dip yesterday wasn't even that bad, all things considered. So, I like this.\n\nWe see some addition to June $10 and $12.50 .. that'll boost gamma for next week. I still think these are relatively cheap and worth the gamble. If this ticker catches on, their IVs are sure to skyrocket... especially if MMs start getting defensive.\n\nWe're left with this breakout:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tzkc71wv8191.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd65e09611afb20e13972e60fde10185064c0d26\n\nBreakout of OI per expiration\n\nAnd here's the latest gamma:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2288lrwv8191.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7fc6e4629f6080554724a53a34ab5141c9e6c2e\n\nLatest gamma... just absolutely insane\n\nThe gamma is clearly insane, but I don't really think it's going to count for much. Today is OPEX, and MMs aren't \"forced\" to hedge. If price creeps up above $10.00, yeah, they'll lose a bit of money from the ITM options, but that's better than trying to scoop up shares and furiously running the price up.\n\n**What's more interesting to me is the gamma on Monday**:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0w670dxv8191.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=de75fa2bd19cbfadf9fc5809713e34386f1ea0e7\n\nDeltaflux as it will be on Monday\n\nWith the Mays expiring, there is still *plenty* of gamma here. Remember, >0.30% is considered high... so 3.50% is just insane. And relative to the daily volume? It's nuclear.\n\nIt will be a real game of chicken against the MMs -- do they want to risk the price running up and taking fat losses, or do they want to hedge? *Can* they even hedge? There is simply no liquidity here... so they kind of have their backs against the wall, hoping that share price doesn't rise up.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nI don't think MMs are hedging very much here. They are content to sell calls, thinking that retail will pass them around to one another, and eventually the MMs will be the only ones willing to buy them back at a big discount.\n\nBut... the stock is *so* illiquid, that I just don't see how they can be selling them for 150% IVs.. it makes no sense. That seems like quite a large gamble on no *real* catalyst happening to the stock.\n\nWithout MMs hedging, we're stuck at the familiar \"retail gambling on retail piling on\" conundrum. And if retail only apes into options, well, nothing will happen... it'll just be a game of hot potato with options, and whales might try to slosh the underlying around in an attempt to sell their calls at a favorable price to \"greater fools\". You can play that game too... trying to sell your calls when the price jolts up.\n\n**What I'm hoping for is any/all of these three things**:\n\n1. A very slow trickle upwards. This could be because there are no sellers.. the stock is in a status and is only seeing inflows.. so it'll trickle up. Maybe retail \"holds the jewels\" here. If this happens, at some point MMs may start to hedge, or they'll offer to buy back calls at higher IVs.\n2. Some sudden in-flow and a big price spike offering liquidity. This could be either:  \n\n   1. A whale that already has calls and decides to make things exciting\n   2. Ticker picks up traction on social media / discords / whatever\n3. Shorts cover. IMO, normally very unlikely -- they are likely fundamentals-based and can weather the storm. However, during this highly volatile bear market, they might choose to bail out early due to other stressed positions. So, I'd upgrade this from \"very unlikely\" to just \"unlikely\".\n4. **MMs get caught offsides.**\n\nThe first two possibilities already make getting June calls worth it, IMO. A market rally, a squeeze-mania on other stocks, etc... lots of things could draw interest here. I think it has the best set-up to pull in that crowd.\n\nBut #4 would be the jackpot.\n\n**It's entirely possible MMs are wholly unaware of the low float and low liquidity.**\n\nAdmittedly, I don't think it's likely -- they've encountered dozens of optionable SPAC tickers in the past -- but it's *possible*:\n\n1. **The stock has persistently had low daily volume.** From MMs point of view, that means less likelihood of a high-volume / high-volatility day.\n2. **They might have the wrong float.. off by a factor of 400%.** Getting the float requires manual labor to deduce. Yahoo and others report it as 4m, and thus MMs could be operating off the same dataset. That would mean they are, again, overestimating the liquidity by quite a large amount.\n3. **MMs might be on autopilot.** Given the above, if the price *does* spike, even from retail FOMO or a whale, MMs might just auto-flip the switch and say: \"we don't know what's going on, let's just hedge a bit before this gets out of hand\". \n\nMMs have their own risk tolerances. Even if they're aware of the situation, at some point they might be willing to throw in the towel and take an L on this.. because 49/50 times they take a W on other tickers in the same bucket (SPAC, low-ish float, retail-driven) that never play out against them.\n\nI'd find it hard to believe they're paying close attention to situations like these, given what's going on elsewhere in the market lately.\n\nThe Wildcard (S1 effect)\n\nBBAI filed an amended S1... again. It contained quite a few changes, so I personally doubt an \"effect\" comes through soon. BBAI has been pending an effect for quite some time and nothing has come through.\n\nHowever.. it's always possible.\n\nI'm trying to find out just how many shares would become unlocked if/when it occurs.. but I think from a pure sentiment standpoint it would probably be a killer. So... consider this a bet action takes place before an effect.", "id": "uw2z38", "created_utc": 1653320115.0, "score": 587, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 461, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|14|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|867|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uw2mhz/big_bear_with_big_bull_implications_bbai/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uw2z38/big_bear_with_big_bull_implications_bbai/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/pwjsnt/ptra_and_ftd_moonshotting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rh93md/planet_labs_pl_to_the_moon/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qfhpzd/bkkt_ortex_data_10252021/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppem97/root_to_boot/) \n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uw2z38)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uw2z38)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It was so obvious ....
