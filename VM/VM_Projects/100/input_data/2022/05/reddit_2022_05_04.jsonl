At $20 they will be trading at 6x price to sales and for a company growing revenue at 80% Q/Q I am willing to take that risk even though they're not profitable yet. \n\nI don't know how metaverse and all that hype will turn out and my experience is purely anecdotal.

Roblox isn't a static game, it's an ecosystem of hundreds of mini-games and because of this I think they are more than a trend and will be here to stay for a long time. Brands have started partnering with them and kids are eating it up. \n\nAgain this is the riskiest pick on my list for all the reasons you mentioned which is why it needs to fall another 40% before I'm willing to take that risk. But sometimes these speculative plays are the ones that really pay off. I put less than $5k in TSLA and SHOP 4 years ago before they were profitable when everyone was shitting on them and ended up making life-changing money.

Because the global economy is intertwined in a very convoluted fashion. And a lot of money across the world exchanges hands multiple times for me to get an iphone in my hand. And the world is screwed.\n\nChina, the defaco factory of the modern world is reeling from another COVID outbreak. It could last a few weeks or a few months or a year. Who knows?\n\nRussia, perhaps the most natural resource rich country in the world is embattled in a war, and the west is collectively attempting to ban / sanction Russian products.\n\nAlso, China might decide to re-assert itself on Taiwan.\n\nFurther, during COVID, when we got the stimulus money, and spent most of it, the world was still reeling. And the traditional way businesses ran broke. Inventories dried up almost instantly, and soon we started facing shortages. And when we start facing shortages, economics kick in and manufacturers started charging more.\n\nThis isn't necessarily wrong. Because when COVID hit, essentially everyone stopped placing orders. This forced manufacturers to slow down, lay off staff and even shutter factories.\n\nIt all started with the great TP shortage of 2020. It's essentially the same story, though different products are affected by different factors. The balance of supply and demand skewed heavily in favor of demand. With Supply having zero hope of keeping up.  And so we saw inflation seeping into the economy.\n\nRampant inflation and supply chain issues have made the price of grain and raw materials so expensive that the financially less secure countries are predicting they won't be able to afford food. Sri Lanka is in financial default, and is in the process of restructuring their debt.\n\nThe Fed has to skew the balance of Supply and demand back towards supply. And the way it does this, is by reducing demand. They achieve this through increasing interest rates. But now, USA also has a massive debt problem. The Fed needs to reduce it's balance sheet. When the Fed sent everyone stimulus checks, and wrote egregious bailouts for businesses, they also backstopped the stock market. Essentially, the bought Mortgage backed securities and Equities ( through some complex financial instruments) and now they're going to have to sell this.\n\nThe Fed owns almost 30% of all MBS in existence, and will now have to find a buyer for it. On one hand they're increasing interest rates, which will reduce demand. But they're also going to be selling MBS and Equities, which will increase supply.\n\nThe BEST case scenario-they do this precisely, they will turn the scales in the direction of supply. Intuitively, this seems good. If there's more supply, prices should go down, or atleast moderate. Which would be great !\n\nThe BAD Scenario - They are too slow\n\nIf they are too slow, then prices continue to rise and the people suffer immensely. Supply chain woes are not fixed because demand keeps outpacing supply. Till the point that supply catches up. This may take a while, and we go through stagflation. - Slow economic growth due to high inflation\n\nThe WORST Case Scenario - They are too fast\n\nIf they are too fast, demand gets destroyed. The shock of high interest rates and balance sheet run off leads to a crash in asset prices. As Stock prices fall, businesses prioritize capital and Unemployment starts to creep up. This leads to a vicious cycle where people can't afford things because they do not have money. And then we have negative economic growth. This is a recession.\n\nThe ARMAGEDDON Scenario - they do nothing. Supply chains keep breaking. And one leading cause of inflation is replaced by another. Prices keep rising, and we get to hyperinflation, wherein a loaf of bread costs a ton of money.\n\nThink of these 4 cases as a continuous distribution and not absolute outcomes, and it might make more sense.  Q1 GDP growth in USA was negative. So, it looks like the most probable outcome is shifting in the wrong direction.", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "You can have a recession even with economic stimulus and low rates. If that happens, however, the economy is basically done.\n\nYou can reach a point of where to sustain the growth induced by lax monetary policy, that the stimulus is not even enough to keep that going, and the cycle of the economy will end up forcing a recession since debt will be gradually become more expensive, and the only way out of it would be to basically hyperinflate the economy beyond any level of sustainability.\n\nThe fed getting to 3% will not be enough. There is still too much inflation in the pipeline, as reflected by the leading indicators including PPI, and factory orders.\n\nA recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of reduction in GDP. It is highly likely that will happen again as our core industries are facing headwinds, and the global economy is similarly entering a period of stagflation (reduction in growth, inflation). This will ripple to our economy.\n\nDo stocks have to fall during a recession? No. But stocks are inflated even after falling. We are not that far off of the cocaine-induced ATHs coming out of the pandemic. We are closer to realistic valuations.

Inflation by definition is a phenomenon that takes a sizable amount of time to play out even in cases of hyperinflation.  If inflation was a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, then we would see inflation be limited to specific commodities relating to Russia and the sanctions.  Same as if a twinkle factory burned down and caused a shortage, thus increasing prices.  That is not the case, as we are seeing broad market inflation across all assets and commodities.  \n\nThat also ignores that the inflation rate hit 5% one year ago, more than double it’s average for the past decade. (That also ignores that they change how it’s calculated whenever it’s confident for them, so if we revert to the same formula they used to calculate it in the 80’s it hovers closer to 12%, in may of LAST year).   This is what a decade of QE does to an economy.  \n\nIf the fed wanted to fight inflation, they would have to hike rates up to at least 20%, same as volkner did in the 80’s.  However they can’t do that, as the economy is so loaded with debt that this would cause the US government to default.  Sending us into a severe depression, having likely 80% of publicly traded companies (which are loaded with debt) go bankrupt.  And losing the US’s status as the WRC.\n\nThe other option is to continue to print, causing severe inflation but maintaining government solvency, which is almost always the strategy counties choose.  (Guess which one we’re going for). This can be modified by increasing rates slightly, giving the image that they are trying to contain inflation.  And when the market takes a downturn reversing course, which was always the plan anyway.\n\nThe fed couldn’t even get rates above 2.4% in 2018 before a bear market ensued and the repo market blew up. Forcing them to reverse course.  That was two years before all the additional covid stimulus.  And a sign that something is seriously wrong with the us economy.\n\nSo tell me, how is any of this Putin’s fault?

What other the first principle maneuvers there would be available to cause $TSLA shorters to shiver? What is the lowest transaction cost to do these things? We live in the modern digital world, do we?", "score": -14, "replies": [{"body": "You're getting downvoted like crazy without anyone actually correcting you, which is unfortunate. I'll give it a try. I'm no expert on this though. If anyone happens by, please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nIn principle your idea is to have many small splits instead of a big single one. The way you suggest doing it doesn't work in practice though. Let's first check out why and then look at a many-small-split scenario that does work.\n\nIf I'm understanding correctly, your suggestion is to, instead of giving everyone 19 extra shares for every share they currently own, give them 1 extra share per month for 19 months. This does not work for at least this reasoning: We're giving everyone shares based on their *current* holdings. In the 20:1 stock split, a person with 10 shares today, would have 200 tomorrow (10 + 10*19), which they are free to trade without further hassle. In your scenario, if you have 10 shares today (month 0), tomorrow you would have 20 (10 + 10) shares. If you then sell those shares, the next month you would be getting 10 shares again (because you're them 10 based on their holdings of last month). Tracking this becomes a hell of a mess and also leads to very weird situations.\n\nIf you were suggesting that we should give everyone 1 extra share for each share they own in a given month, every month for 19 months, this wouldn't work because you're doubling everyone's shares for 19 months straight. You're effectively performing a 524288:1 stock split spread out over 19 months. The math here is: today you have 10 shares, tomorrow you have 20 (10 + 10, 1 extra for each you owned), next month you have 40 (20 + 20), then 80, then 160, and so on....\n\nWhat they *could* do is decide on a final split that's a factor of two and then spread that one out. If, for example, tesla decides on a 16:1 stock split as the end goal, it could decide to spread those out over two years by doing 4 2:1 splits, each 6 months apart.\n\nThe question is *why*, though. What's the point? Tesla wants shares that are cheaper per unit than what they are now, because cheaper shares means more retail engagement, and makes it easier to give shares to employees as part of a compensation program. That's it. There's no magic here. A split does nothing but make the unit price smaller while increasing the number of units available. Supply doubles, while price halves. Simple\n\nThe reason a stock split is seen as a big deal, is because people are not rational and for some reason buy when a split is announced. There's an argument to be made that a lower share price makes it easier for mom-and-pop to buy shares without having to save up. That's true, but at the same time there's loads of brokerages where you can buy fractional shares. So there really shouldn't be any point.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for comments.

Banks create money via loans (look up fractional reserve banking).  When interest rates are higher it’s more expensive to borrow money, and so less people and businesses borrow money.  The less people and businesses borrow, the less they spend and *also* the less money gets created, thus reducing inflationary pressures.

{"title": "Daddy Pow Pow Just FUCKED us all and here is why", "selftext": "# Summary:\n\nThe .5bp rate hike, though high for what we have seen in recent years, isn't enough to effect that change that Daddy Pow Pow wants to occur. \n\n# Daddy Pow Pows plan:\n\nDaddy Pow Pow hopes that by giving a .5bp increase that it will slow down consumer demand by slightly increasing prices of consumer goods. For many who have surplus income this will have little to no impact on how they live, for others this may cause them to decrease the quality of product that they buy or simply to buy less. For most, this will negatively impact household savings. \n\nIn doing this, Daddy Pow Pow admits that he has no significant ability to impact supply chain issues. Most of the problems we are seeing with prices of consumer goods relate to supply chain issues so aside from potential decreasing supply chain demand, there will be little to no impact on that front. Supply chain issues will still fuck us. \n\nIn the end, Daddy Pow Pow hopes that this increase in prices will get persons who are currently not working to go back to work. These persons include: retired persons, teenagers, college students, persons collecting unemployment, persons living on government stipends / welfare, etc. If nothing else changed over the next 12 months except for what Daddy Pow Pow did, then this may likely cause more persons to work and thus increase our economic stability / growth. However, what Daddy Pow Pow didn't account for in this plan are the things that will happen which he knows he can't prevent. \n\n# Things to come that Daddy Pow Pow didn't bake into the .5bp hike:\n\n**There are so many things that Daddy Pow Pow didn't consider that I will list some out here:** \n\n* When costs go up, students can borrow more money for college. Universities will forecast expected costs of college and students will be able to borrow up to that amount. This may actually lead to less college students working part time jobs as it becomes easier for them to get more money and then spend it on booze, beans, and rice. \n* Legislators are already finding solutions to keep their indentured voters indentured to vote for their party and these solutions will completely debunk what Daddy Pow Pow is attempting to do. For example, if we were to see UBI even at a level of $200 / month it would completely override any changes Daddy Pow Pow was hoping to create. Just think of all the ways our government buys their voters by keeping people from being productive citizens - any legislation pushing such ideologies will negate the intended effect of what Daddy Pow Pow is trying to achieve. \n* Supply Chain Issues may be heightened with decreased demand. If I'm a vendor who ships dog food and it costs me $100 to ship the dog food regardless of if it's 20 bags or 50 bags then I would ideally want to ship in batches close to 50 bags. High demand supports cost savings for the supply chain. What happens though when my price per unit to ship goes up because my batch size decreases? Well someone has to swallow those costs which means I lose some money and I also pass some losses onto my consumers in the form of a higher price. Now businesses are slowing down and prices go up even more. we might suggest that this could be like pseudo inflation. \n* We're just barely starting to watch this whole war shit show. a .5bp rate hike with possibility of war suggests that Daddy Pow Pow thinks the whole war shindig is a complete joke and that there is no reason to address the inflation in an urgent manner. We can address it slowly over 2 - 4 years with his plan however if we see increase in war then his plan goes flying out the window. Basically Daddy is saying war is a joke and all the virtue signaling retards are exactly that: regards. What if though, we do see more war? What if China does indeed invade Taiwan? Weelll shiiiiit. We fucked good because at that point our efforts to address inflation wouldn't have been aggressive enough. \n* Daddy Pow Pow chose to implement a slow plan that takes several years but Daddy Pow Pow has no clue what the future holds. Do we? IDK maybe one of you apes does but I sure as frickles don't. That being said, I believe it would have been a stronger more effective move to go ahead and push out a .75bp or 1.0 bp rate hike as that would force more change now which would leave us in a better position the next time shit hits the fan. (Can you smell it? the shit blowing form the fan?)\n\n# What this means for us: \n\nThis actually means increased uncertainty. Daddy Pow Pow took a weak decision which leaves us vulnerable to new events, if Daddy Pow Pow had taken a strong fist stance at a higher rate then we would have less uncertainty about future events. \n\nUncertainty = Bad apes we all know. Green today - Red in some day coming soon. \n\nBasically Daddy Pow Pow just took those swinging arms he talks with and did the whole \"Pow Pow get fisted\" where we all walk away feeling relieved at first but then a few days later when our assholes are still bleeding we start to realize all the damage he did.", "id": "uig1j4", "created_utc": 1651696836.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|401|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/udekgq/okay_apes_i_have_the_plan_to_make_us_all_winners/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uig1j4)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uig1j4)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You led off with .5 bp, which is 0.005% then proceeded to write a 5,000 word essay and expect anyone to read it", "score": 116, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "That’s what I was thinking.

In other words, once you account for baby boomer retirements and mortality (again these numbers are against the 2020 census), which is where I actually originally stated most of this was coming from, the number of working age people who died of COVID is a significant factor.\n\nNot the majority.\n\nNot a total explanation. I never said that. Go back and read my posts. I never said what you're saying I said, now several times. If you have to setup strawmen, you've already lost the argument.\n\nLet's boil down your argument: You're basically saying that a pandemic which killed 250k people of working age did not have a significant impact on potential workforce participation.

My first plan to get out of this loss was to invest in $ROPE and a youtube search history of noose tying instructional videos but I think I found a better way and I'm looking for advise. Obviously you can see where I started trading options. Now, clearly I haven't done well with options overall, but I do understand them and their power and have had great success at times. So now say I had an exta 100k sitting in the bank just being brutally eroding by inflation. Instead of watching it do absolutely nothing for me, what if I were to transfer it to my broker and buy some 10-20dte SPY options and go for a 66% return? I have made numerous 100-1000% returns prior, in fact I had 2 contracts go over 100% today, so I don't think a 66% return is very far fetched and pretty achievable especially in this market environment.

It’s a car.).\nSo you spend 10 bucks on a Shark Card (It’s like a ticket to redeem for GTA dollars, you poor bastard) and you buy your Zentorno.\nThere’s a limit to how much money you’re gonna spend on a virtual car that you’ll never sell and that can be duplicated and gotten for free. In other words you’re not going to spend $100 on it…\nHowever, what if it literally couldn’t be duped. What if you COULD resell it and get some if not more money back than what you paid for it. What if you could export it from the game and store it elsewhere.\nThat is **true virtual merchandise.**\nThat’s the only difference between a digital good and a DC and I ASSURE you with 100% certainty, that all these video game digital goods will be DCs in the near future because they have literally every incentive to do so (Think about all the effort GTA goes through to patch duplication glitches. Making your virtual goods DCs negates any need for this.).\n\n*Time for some quick myth busting before we continue.\n- “You can screenshot a DC”\nYes, you can screenshot a dumb fucking monkey picture. But you can’t screenshot and drive a Zentorno.\n- “People will be able to create cheap Zentorno knockoffs and import them into the game.” \nRETARD. Every transaction history is stored. EVERYTHING. Do you seriously think the developers would allow your shitty Zentorno ripoff anywhere near their game? No, they won’t. And there’s absolutely 0 chance of you ever tricking them. They know with 100% certainty where the real Zentornos came from, where they are currently, how many there are, how many there ever will be. \nThus your ripoff is worthless.\n- “DCs have no utility and are therefore worthless”\nStupid monkey pictures are worthless.\nA Zentorno in a game that people play and care about is NOT worthless. And we know this because people spend money on them already with 0 chance of seeing that money again. There IS value in virtual goods and that is a fact.\n- “If they made the Zentorno and other cars into DCs, they would just be used as speculative investments”\nWrong. Stop associating DCs with JPEG moon-boi scams.\nThe cars will be the same as before, their value might fluctuate but nothing too crazy. There probably will be some super expensive super rare cars in the secondary market but it really isn’t such a bad thing. Anyone who’s played GTA knows that people love to show off their “rare modded” car collection in their garage.\nHaving actual real rarity and value only adds to that experience.\nBesides, the developers will never let that get in the way of the gaming experience, there will always be other more accessible, cheaper, just as good cars.*\n\n\nAlright back to the DD.\nSo we already covered how profitable the micro-transaction business model is thanks to their reoccurring sales (Just like merchandise).\nWe also covered where the video-games still fall short as you can only charge so much for a virtual toy.\nDCs will essentially allow for video-game companies to charge real merchandise prices for their virtual goods and people WILL pay it.\n\n\n\n**So… Recap!**\n\nRemember Pokemon.\nLicensed merchandise revenue: $82.8B\nVideo-game revenue: $27.1B (18% of which came from a single freemium game with little $1-$10 micro transactions, outperforming all 121 other video-games by a fucking landslide)\n  Just fucking imagine how much Pokemon GO would have made if instead of charging $1-$5 micro transactions, they charged real world merchandise prices of $10-$500. Yeah…\nTheir gaming division will match and **surpass** their merch division (which represents revenue growth of 300% at the very least) and so will every other IP. (I invite you to look at other IPs and compare their merch revenue and gaming revenue. The difference between the two is basically guaranteed growth)\nAdd to that the ease of instantaneous exchange of virtual merch versus the headaches and limitations of exchanging real world merch… very appealing.\nOh, and did I mention that the gaming industry boasts a clientele of nearly 3 billion people?\n\n**OH! And by the way, all of this isn’t even taking into account the perpetual royalties and fees the gaming companies will be making on literally every single transaction after their DC merchandise hits their secondary markets. Seriously, think about that for a good minute.**\n\nSo that right there is why DCs will cause the gaming industry to absolutely fucking boom\n\n\nAs for a stock pick.\nWon’t be talking much fundamentals here as I want to keep this part short.\nEveryone talked about Facebook Meta during the MetaV hype train.\nI’m looking at Microsoft though.\nI think MSFT is a no-brainer buy right now. \nThey want to focus more on the gaming industry.\nThere’s a reason why they bought Activision Blizzard at the time that they did. \nThey now own World of Warcraft which is basically a metaV in itself (MetaV and DCs go hand in hand).\nAs a company that already has a huge established presence in both hardware and software for gaming, I believe that they are the best positioned blue-chip to take advantage of this industry boom that’ll inevitably come.\n\nEdit: Credit to u/ic___fl21 , u/brickhouse1013 and u/silver7una all made a great points in the replies about advertising. Social media level ad revenue right there.\n(I’d copy and paste their replies here but my shit internet won’t allow it)\n\n\nTL/DR: The micro transactions business model beats the traditional game sale model by a landslide thanks to perpetual reoccurring sales. \nHowever you can only charge so much for a virtual toy or power-up.\n“Digital collectibles” (read the disclaimer at the top) will allow gaming companies to combine the power of reoccurring sales with the higher real world prices of merchandise which will enormously boost revenue.\nAdd the perpetual royalty fees on every single transaction.\nMSFT to the moon.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold fellow ape.

People play games because they are an escape from the reality of their shitty job and shitty life. It brings them into a world where skill brings status and not wealth. Pay to win games are constantly berated and regarded as garbage. (Gacha \"games\" are gambling, they aren't games in the same sense.)\n\nTake for example, Runescape party hats. They are a status symbol not because they are rare (thats why they are expensive, which partially plays into the real reason why they are status symbols), having one means you are either good at bossing, flipping on the GE, and/or a veteran who has done a massive grind playing consistently. Overall, having a party hat means you are good at the game, or for the very few rare cases, happened to hold onto it since the early days of the game and are thus an OG.\n\nThe hierarchy of games is not the same as the hierarchy of real life. Status in an online multiplayer game is based on being good at the game. A LoL player with an expensive skin in Bronze is seen as an even bigger loser for paying money for a free game they are bad at, whereas a player in Diamond is high status even with the ugliest cheapest skin. Looking cool in game is still valuable, but on its own it can never grant the status you are taking about which would warrant this increase in price. Games are an escape from reality, being poor in real life making you poor in the game defeats the purpose of games, and makes them unfun.\n\nThe games that make money this way will very likely have smaller playerbases as they will be microtransaction hell and most likely not fun. Having a crazy grind or insane luck from a drop is way better. If a person is walking around with a bunch of expensive stuff they bought, they won't gain any additional status in game than a person gains any additional status by wearing name-brand clothing in the street, people will look at these players and think \"what a douche\" or \"oh...a rich kid\" or \"looks like baby johnny got his momies credit card\".\n\nConsider this as well. What makes having these in game status symbols worth something. To whom do you show these things off. Two kinds of people; other people in the game and people in real life who play the game. To show off the things to people in game the game first needs to be good enough for people to play it, and for people to exist in real life that play the game for most people and not just a particular region, the game needs to be nearly unanimously regarded as fun to play. A car is a car and everyone knows what an expensive car is and which cars are expensive. But for a game in order to know that the specific item is expensive you need to play that specific game and be invested in it enough to know that and care about that. If someone shows up to my house I'm not going to show off a collection of expensive in-game items, they aren't going to care or even understand, but I can show them a collection of expensive cars, the probability that they think that is cool or at the very least understand the hobby will be much higher. Heck even a stamp collection is more comprehensible than a video game collection. The gaming comunity isn't concentrated enough in one area, nor is it a popular enough thing in general that these things are on an even playing field.\n\nIt could work in a very particular set of conditions, but I think you are off the mark on the popularity of these games, you also forget the gaming community is actively lashing out against these kinds of microtransaction games. The success of Elden Ring spits in the face of what you are saying. At the very least it won't be possible for another 40-50 years when most old people including the wealthiest are gamers.
