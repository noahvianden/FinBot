Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna’s CEO and co-founder, made the announcement to his employees in a pre-recorded video message Monday. The “vast majority” of Klarna employees won’t be affected by the measures, he said, however some “will be informed that we cannot offer you a role in the new organization.” “When we set our business plans for 2022 in the autumn of last year, it was a very different world than the one we are in today,” Siemiatkowski said. “Since then, we have seen a tragic and unnecessary war in Ukraine unfold, a shift in consumer sentiment, a steep increase in inflation, a highly volatile stock market and a likely recession.”\n\nStaff in Europe will be offered redundancy packages with “an associated compensation,” Klarna’s boss said, while the process for other employees “will look different” depending on where they work. Klarna will share more information with employees about the changes “very soon,” Siemiatkowski said. The Swedish payments giant currently has more than 6,500 employees globally. Buy now, pay later companies like Klarna’s, which allow shoppers to spread the cost of purchases over a series of interest-free installments, became wildly popular as online shopping accelerated during the Covid pandemic.\n\nBut investors are getting worried about the sustainability of the sector’s growth as consumers tighten their purse strings amid rising inflation and an increase in borrowing costs. Affirm, the biggest BNPL provider in the U.S., has lost nearly three quarters of its stock market value since the start of the year. The layoff announcement comes after media reports last week said Klarna is set to lose a third of its market value in a new round of funding. The privately held company was last valued at $46 billion in an investment led by SoftBank. Siemiatkowski said Klarna’s decision to reduce staffing numbers was one of the “hardest” decisions in the company’s history, but that it was necessary to stay “laser-focused on what really will make us successful going forward.” “While crucial to stay calm in stormy weather, it’s also crucial not to turn a blind eye to reality,” he said. “What we are seeing now in the world is not temporary or short-lived, and hence we need to act.” Many tech companies that flourished during the Covid pandemic are now taking steps to cut down on costs as investors sour on the sector due to concerns over rising interest rates and declining market liquidity.

But the Federal Reserve is now tightening monetary policy to cool the economy to rein in the soaring cost of living.\n\nThe “re-pricing of stocks was driven by a reset of inflation expectations, Fed rate hikes and balance sheet reductions,” she wrote. \"Profits and economic forecasts have to be adjusted, and forecasts based on the level of a V-shaped recovery in 2020-2021 are inaccurate because that level is unsustainable.\"\n\nThat \"revaluation\" has already begun, Shalett said.

Look at mortgage for example (earlier in the interview they talked about how home builder stocks were dropping).\n\n* Fed should definitely still do the 50 points, but in July they should take close look at money supply before making more drastic decisions.\n\n* To some extent Fed should accept inflation and aim to get to 2-3% long term. Don't overreact \n\nSomewhere in the middle the interviewer challenged him and asked \"Well aren't you the one who was asking for more drastic action?\"\n\nMy read on this is that Siegel is saying the two 50 point raises announced are good.

{"title": "Optics vs reality in Tesla", "selftext": "Disclosure: I am long Tesla stock.\n\nI think Tesla over the next several months is going to offer an absolute masterclass in how badly optics can become disassociated with reality. \n\nI’m not talking about the usual questions and debates people in the investing world have over valuation. What I’m talking about is the increasing mainstream attention to the company itself as a result of Elon being Elon.\n\nWhen I first started investing in Tesla (late 2019) nobody in my life or on my normal social media ever talked about it outside the context of a political push for EVs. Now, every single day I come across leftists on all my social medias who are not part of the investing world pushing very poorly thought out talking points about why they’re doomed.\n\nThe major new talking point is how Elon is alienating his consumer base by criticizing the Democratic Party. Republicans hate EVs, and now democrats won’t buy them, so who is going to buy his cars now?\n\nThis is a crazy oversimplification of the issue. There is no unified Republican opposition to EVs. Republicans tend to not believe in man-made climate change and therefore do not support government mandates to electrify the auto industry based on the rationale that we have to save the world by doing so. But that doesn’t mean they won’t buy EVs. If EVs can beat ICE vehicles in the market, that’s totally fine. It doesn’t take a genius to see that EVs are superior value propositions at comparable price points for most consumers. The idea that Republican consumers are going to make irrational value judgements and refuse to adopt EVs because they don’t believe in climate change is just absurd. Yes, there is a small subset of the population that will resist the transition to EVs, but these are usually the motor head “car guy” types whose rationale is “I like to feel the engine” which is a niche market in the first place and will in no way be a drag on the overall trend of mainstream adoption.\n\nThe second thing to point out is that the supposed alienation of Tesla’s consumer base is likely to be greatly exaggerated. Most democratic voters are not going to base their consumer purchase decisions on what the CEO thinks of their preferred political party. The extremely loud group who swear they will never buy a Tesla because Elon is a fascist is a very small slice even of Democratic voters. It reminds me a lot of how people on the right swore that the NFL was done for because of boycotts by middle aged white people over the national anthem stuff, or when every leftist I knew was adamant that they’d never eat at chick fil a again. \n\nAnd then there’s the issue that most of America doesn’t even identify strongly with either party. This talking point assumes that America is roughly 90% either Republican or Democrat but in reality most don’t even vote in the first place and most who do consider themselves moderates. \n\nFurther still, it’s worth noting that Tesla’s international market which will care even less about US politics is as big if not bigger than their US market. \n\nBut this idea is going to be given face-value credibility when Tesla’s Q2 numbers show a decrease in deliveries quarter over quarter and every angry leftist and every Tesla bear latches onto the headlines and says “SEE! Elon starts getting political and Tesla’s sales drop.” But they’ll fail to point out (and casual observers will fail to realize) that Q2 weakness will be entirely explained by the Shanghai shutdown. So for an entire quarter the people saying that Elon is sinking the ship will appear correct. And then Q3 will come around and Tesla will resume its crazy growth trajectory as Shanghai gets back to (relative) normal and Berlin and Austin continue to ramp. Then at the end of next year when Tesla delivers like 2 million vehicles we’ll look back at this and laugh at all the failed doomsday predictions.", "id": "ux1us4", "created_utc": 1653428534.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "Optics over reality is literally the Tesla business model.", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "What I was going to say lol.

Just about every major company is putting out solid BEVs now that go shoulder to shoulder with Tesla's offerings... and they're often priced lower than Teslas.  Tesla needs to rely on high margins and promises of disruptive tech to keep this share price up.... other mature OEMs don't expect to get $1 trillion valuations.  Most are fine persisting at $50-$100 billion valuations with low margins, and a well paid workforce.  They realize that once all of the competition is in BEVs... margins will necessarily come down through high competition... and they've lived with those margins for decades.\n\nFor customers, as long as the car moves them from point A to point B cheaply and smoothly, and it's a good value versus competitors, people will buy it.  As we can see since just about all other OEMs are selling out of their BEVs as well.  I don't see anything that makes Teslas stand far ahead of the crowd anymore outside of production volume and charger counts...\n\nUp until now, Tesla has existed in a sector of the vehicle market where others have yet to ramp production in.  Yet, as we know, those other OEMs are rapidly building out scale.  Sure, it takes time to get a battery factory running and ramped... but when like 20 of them are going up world wide... then there's certainly going to be some major competition arising over the next 1-3 years.\n\nInvestors know this... they know Tesla's production advantage won't last for much longer.  That's why Musk is constantly touting \"disruptive products\" like FSD / robotaxis... because that's the only thing that could possibly keep this stock price pumped up as much as it is...  Frankly, we have no realistic idea of when FSD will be done, robotaxis will be on the roads, or if competition will beat them there.  (See Cruise, Waymo, Zoox, asian competitors, and others)\n\nMusk realizes this, which is why he's suddenly pivoted to yet another \"disruptive technology\"... robots.  lol.  The fact that he went with robots should tell you everything you need to know. Musk realizes robotaxi are still quite aways away, and TSLA's bloated share price, propped up by Musk's leveraged stock buying, could be in some serious trouble in the future.\n\nAnd that's a good thing...we want strong competition in this sector.

Tesla's vehicle efficiency seems to be primarily a factor of aerodynamics and aluminum use to lower weight, and their suspension / tires.  Look at the BMW i4 40... with slightly wider tires than the model 3... it's not that big of a range difference.. even though the car weighs over 500 lbs more, has more surface contact for greater rolling resistance, and isn't as aerodynamic.  And BMW is using new non-PM motors... which should be a big efficiency hit.. but it's not, and yet they don't rely on toxic Neodymium mining.\n\nI mean how many vehicles with great ranges have to come out to make you believe they're seeing incredible efficiency just as good or better than Tesla's?

{"title": "Tesla going bellow $400 would margin call Elon and force him to sell 13 Million shares", "selftext": "By Senad Karaahmetovic:\n\nToni Sacconaghi, a Senior Analyst at Bernstein covering U.S. IT Hardware, has discussed implications for Tesla (TSLA) shares amid an ongoing saga concerning CEO Elon Musk and his deal to acquire Twitter (TWTR) for $44 billion.\n\nMusk may “ultimately elect or be forced to purchase Twitter going forward,” Sacconaghi told clients in a note today. The analyst took note of Musk’s deal to acquire Twitter which should be completed via debt, equity, and a margin loan.\n\nSacconaghi pays special attention to $12.5 billion that will come from a margin loan facility tied to Tesla stock.\n\n“Following the recent drop in TSLA's stock price, Musk appears to have just enough value in his unencumbered Tesla shares to fund the margin loan portion of his proposed Twitter financing. That said, at a TSLA share price of $621 or less, Musk would technically not be able to borrow the full $12.5B against his shares - in fact, if TSLA's stock price were to drop to $500/share, he would be ~$2.5B short. If the agreed upon deal price for Twitter is ultimately haircut by 10%, Musk could still borrow enough, even if Telsa shares dropped to ~$400,” the analyst wrote.\n\nHowever, the bigger - but also less probable - financial risk for Elon Musk is there is a deeper pullback in Tesla shares, in combination with him completing the deal.\n\n“If the TWTR deal were to close today and subsequently TSLA's stock price dropped to $350-400, Musk could be forced to sell ~13M Tesla shares.”\n\nIn other words, Elon Musk would get a margin call.\n\nSacconaghi rates Tesla with an Underperform rating and a $450.00 per share price target as he struggles to justify TSLA's valuation, “which appears to imply huge volume AND industry leading profitability going forward, which is historically unprecedented.”\n\nTesla stock price is indicated to open 2.5% lower today, or at $657.90.\n\n[Source](https://m.uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/margin-call-alert-tesla-stock-falling-below-400-would-force-elon-musk-to-sell-13-million-shares-of-ev-maker-to-fund-twitter-deal--bernsteins-sacconaghi-2655243?ampMode=1)", "id": "uwo1ti", "created_utc": 1653389647.0, "score": 3336, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 905, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|32|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|86|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n75ips/expanding_the_dd_on_ino_todr_it_went_down_because/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s9fkox/shorting_microstrategy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n75osi/expanding_the_dd_on_ino_tldr_it_went_down_because/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uwo1ti)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uwo1ti)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "‘The bigger but also less probable’ - adding spice to peddle the story 🙄", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The thing I don't get is how does anyone know that Elon plans to use TSLA shares for the purchase?\n\nHe has multiple private companies that aren't traded, Space X, StarLink, Boring Company, etc.  How do we know he won't use capital from one of his other companies?\n\nPrivate companies aren't required to release reports on profits etc etc, so no one really has any idea how much money these companies do or don't have right now.  \n\n\nI mean people are like, omg, he might not have enough money.

The analyst took note of Musk’s deal to acquire Twitter which should be completed via debt, equity, and a margin loan.\n\nSacconaghi pays special attention to $12.5 billion that will come from a margin loan facility tied to Tesla stock.\n\n“Following the recent drop in TSLA's stock price, Musk appears to have just enough value in his unencumbered Tesla shares to fund the margin loan portion of his proposed Twitter financing. That said, at a TSLA share price of $621 or less, Musk would technically not be able to borrow the full $12.5B against his shares - in fact, if TSLA's stock price were to drop to $500/share, he would be ~$2.5B short. If the agreed upon deal price for Twitter is ultimately haircut by 10%, Musk could still borrow enough, even if Telsa shares dropped to ~$400,” the analyst wrote.\n\nHowever, the bigger - but also less probable - financial risk for Elon Musk is there is a deeper pullback in Tesla shares, in combination with him completing the deal.\n\n“If the TWTR deal were to close today and subsequently TSLA's stock price dropped to $350-400, Musk could be forced to sell ~13M Tesla shares.”\n\nIn other words, Elon Musk would get a margin call.\n\nSacconaghi rates Tesla with an Underperform rating and a $450.00 per share price target as he struggles to justify TSLA's valuation, “which appears to imply huge volume AND industry leading profitability going forward, which is historically unprecedented.”\n\nTesla stock price is indicated to open 2.5% lower today, or at $657.90.\n\nSource (https://m.uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/margin-call-alert-tesla-stock-falling-below-400-would-force-elon-musk-to-sell-13-million-shares-of-ev-maker-to-fund-twitter-deal--bernsteins-sacconaghi-2655243?ampMode=1)\n\n!RemindMe 1 year", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bye bye 2008 toilet flushing.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "See this on Twitter, posted yesterday- https://youtu.be/S_-AHrf6vqs", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Loses money in Tesla, will lose money in Twitter, at least he can overcharge for internet... probably date Amber Heard again soon.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "🎊🎉🎊🎉", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Don't threaten me with a good time", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If he buys twitter…", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "That is if he didn’t funding", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I hope elon is the sacrificial lamb kevin was talking about", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "We should do the reverse of a short squeeze. \n\nA margin squeeze\n\nIf all the retards on here short Tesla, he'll hit his margin call, go to zero, and we all bank!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
