It's actually rather complicated.\n\nIf you want to get technical about it, \"naked\" is basically a slang term at this point. You don't find \"naked\" in any official document of the exchanges or FINRA or the OCC. The formal term is \"unsecured.\"\n\nHowever, from long usage, naked is taken to mean the same thing, as shown by these links:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_put\n\n\"A naked put (also called an uncovered put) is a put option contract where the option writer (i.e., the seller) does not hold the underlying position, in this case a short equity position, to cover the contract in case of assignment.\"\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedput.asp\n\n\"A naked put is an options strategy in which the investor writes, or sells, put options without holding a short position in the underlying security.\"\n\nhttps://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/naked-option/\n\n\"A naked option is an investing term that refers to an investor selling an option without holding a corresponding position in the option‚Äôs underlying security.\"\n\nhttps://wealthfit.com/articles/naked-options-vs-covered-options/\n\n\"When you own naked options, you hold an option without holding the underlying security (such as the stock the option is for).\"\n\nAnd the OIC itself calls a cash-secured put a *variation* on a naked put, not the opposite of naked:\n\nhttps://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/cash-secured-put\n\n\"A cash-secured put is a variation on the naked put strategy.\"\n\n**HOWEVER**, you can also find links that make it seem as if a cash-secured put *is* the opposite of a naked put, such as:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedoption.asp\n\n\"Naked options refer to an option sold without any previously set-aside shares *or cash* to fulfill the option obligation at expiration.\"\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/n/naked-put-or-call\n\n\"A naked or uncovered option is a call (or put) written without the offsetting shares (*or funds*) necessary to fulfill the terms of the contract should it be exercised by its buyer.\"\n\n--------------------------------\n\nSo at the end of the day, it's slang, and different people can interpret slang to mean different things. My interpretation is that all naked puts require cash collateral to open. What distinguishes a cash-secured put from other naked puts is that it requires 100% of the assignment value as collateral, while other naked puts do not.

Its possible to see this in a not-so-terrible light. Most people in US live paycheck to paycheck. they did before inflation and they do now. These people cannot go very deep into debt to pay extra for all items across the board, nor would they if they could. At some point they would buy fewer things. inflation is just as heavy on TVs and swimming pools as it is diapers and milk. so regular people are still buying non-essentials at a clip high enough to continue to push prices higher for *all* items.

Therefore regular people *must* have more spendable money than they did a couple of years ago. this *could* be due to technology that has rapidly made our lives better and more effortless. technology within these very supply chains to make many of the products we desire cheaper than ever. technology such as the iphone provides to everyday people empowers them also with knowledge to be more efficient.  An example: I play guitar casually. always have. been playing for fun for 20+ years. guitars were $300+ for el cheapo, poorly built versions when i started playing. it was $1500 for a good amp and hundreds of dollars for good pedals. now with manufacturing technology and the niche driven tendencies of things means i bought a guitar kit where i built the exact guitar i wanted for $180, i learned how to do it by watching youtube videos produced by this kit company. I bought cheap modelling pedals for $35-50 each and an incredibly modelling amp that sounds better than any tube amp ive ever owned for $300. Are the products the same? no. certainly not. for the nice products of 20 years ago it would be 5x more expensive now. But technology has given me exactly what i wanted and needed for a fraction of the price. So that frees up my budget, lets say even on staples like steak, to be a little higher. i think theres an efficiency and effectiveness to things we dont necessarily see or are aware of such as provided by modern technology that has beget some of this inflation. We have more money even above our wage increases to spend on things because we are much smarter now and more aware of what our specific needs are. we dont waste as many purchases, etc. just a theory.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}

{"title": "Shopify company analysis and valuation - 80% down and still expensive? ($SHOP)", "selftext": "Shopify had a crazy stock-price movement in the last 2 years, went from roughly $350 prior to the pandemic, to almost $1,800 (almost 5x) at its peak, and is now down to $364 (80% down).\n\nThe goal of this post is to share my fundamental analysis and valuation of this highly volatile company. Feel free to provide your feedback and disagree with me :)\n\nAt the peak, the market cap was over $220b, let's keep that number in mind. Today, it's around $46b. Let's get started!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is Shopify?**\n\nIn one sentence, it is an eCommerce website builder that takes care of the infrastructure and provides additional services/solutions (payment processing, marketing, analytics, inventory & fulfillment, etc.). It allows setting up and operating a business online easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How does Shopify make money?**\n\nThe revenue is split into two groups:\n\n1. Subscription revenue - This is self-explanatory, and refers to the monthly recurring revenue that Shopify gets from the individuals/businesses that use their platform. This stream of revenue doesn't depend on the success of the users. Regardless if a company sells 1 product or a million, the subscription revenue is fixed. In my view, this is the less-risky stream as they'd only lose customers if they switch to another platform (not that likely) or a business goes bankrupt. Historically, this stream grew 50% year-over-year, now almost $1.4b for the last twelve months (ending Q1/2022). This is also a high-margin business, with a gross margin of 80%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Merchant solutions - This is the segment that takes all of the other revenue and is highly dependent on the success of the individuals and businesses that use the platform. Payment processing fees, currency conversion, referrals, advertising, etc, all of that is included here. If there's a slowdown in the economy and the eCommerce business decreases, this stream of Shopify would be harmed. In the last years, it grew roughly 75% year-over-year to almost $3.5b in the last twelve months. The gross margin in this segment is lower (43%).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe overall gross margin has been decreasing and if we only look at that in isolation, the conclusion would be that something bad is going on and Shopify cannot keep its margins at the same level. This is not correct. The reason for the margin decline is only due to the fact that the lower-margin revenue stream (Merchant solutions) is growing faster than the higher-margin revenue stream (Subscription-based). Hence, the gross margin naturally moves closer to the stream that contributes more.\n\nSo, the total revenue is close to $5b. If we put this next to the market cap at its peak of $220b, it seems quite unreasonable for anyone to pay such a huge premium. Yes, the company has been growing at high rates, but the growth cannot continue at that pace forever. The moment the growth declines, that's where the problems start and a correction comes in, so it's always wise to incorporate this growth decline in the model and not assume growth of 50-60% for a very long period of time.\n\nThe overall gross margin is at 53% for the last 12 months and it is expected to drop even further. Let's keep it simple and assume that it will decrease to 50%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Operating expenses**\n\nWith the remaining 50%, Shopify needs to cover 3 main expenses to get to the operating result.\n\n1. Sales & marketing - Decreased from 34% of revenue (2017) to 21% in LTM.\n\n2. R&D - Remains stable at around 20% of revenue in the last 5 years\n\n3. G&A - Remains stable at around 10% of revenue in the last 5 years\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy subtracting these 3 costs, we get to an operating profit of 1%. So, a company with revenue below $5b and no operating profit, was selling for $220b. That sound quite irrational. Of course, there are a couple of other factors to consider.\n\nEvery growth company puts as much effort as possible into growing quickly. For Shopify, that's mainly in Sales & Marketing and R&D. The more potential customers they can reach, the faster they can grow. The more they can innovate, the more services they can provide. However, as the growth slows down, these costs as % of revenue decrease. The marketing won't yield the same returns as before, simply because the # of potential customers decreases. All of this will lead to margin expansion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Balance sheet**\n\nThere are a couple of main points to mention:\n\n1. Shopify is a capital-light business that doesn't need to invest in tangible assets in significant amounts.\n\n2. They have a strong cash position ($7.2b in cash & short term investments + $2.9b in long-term investments)\n\n3. The debt is at a very low level, roughly $1.2b (insignificant compared to their $10b cash/investments). It could be argued that they didn't use the low-interest rates to increase their financial leverage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, Shopify announced the acquisition of Deliverr for $2.1b, a company that will add value in their process of inventory inbounding and distribution. The aim is to offer delivery to the customer within 2 days of ordering (Competitive with Amazon Prime). This is not yet paid, so needs to be deducted when valuing Shopify as a company)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DCF model**\n\nKey assumptions:\n\n1. Revenue growth: 25% for the next 5 years, then slowly decrease to the risk-free rate of almost 3%.\n\n2. Operating profit: Slowly improve to 25% (Basically, the 3 types of expenses mentioned above, combined, should decrease to 25% of revenue over the next 10 years)\n\n3. Discount rate - 11.7% (Based on WACC)\n\nOutcome: **Value per share - $276/share (current market price - $364)**\n\nMy assumptions are based on what I think Shopify can deliver with high probability. Could be I be wrong? Absolutely!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What if I'm wrong?**\n\nBased on my assumptions, the revenue will grow by 426% in 10 years and the operating margin is estimated at 25%. However, I could be significantly wrong. Therefore, the table below provides a valuation of the company based on assumptions different than mine related to the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Revenue / Op. margin|20%|25%|30%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|300% ($19.0b)|$190.1|$229.3|$269.1|\n|426% ($24.4b)|$226.8|$275.8|$326.4|\n|1000% ($51.0b)|$400.3|$500.5|$601.0|\n|3350% (159.9b)|$1,089.9|$1,388.4|$1,687.0|\n\nBased on your assumptions about the revenue growth and margin expansion of Shopify, you can decide whether the company is expensive or not at this price.\n\nThe last row is only for illustration of how irrational the market was in the last year when the price went up to almost $1800. Basically, to justify that valuation, the company would need to grow the revenue by around 50% every year for the next decade and at the same time improve its operating margin to 30%. So, starting with the gross profit being around 50%, the Sales & Marketing, R&D, and G&A together, should be 20% of sales.\n\nFeel free to add your insights into Shopify and add value to the analysis.

Thanks for sharing.\n\nI guess what I'll add to the discussion is that over the years I've become less of a believer in using DCF models as a primary means to value companies. What you tend to find is that DCF models make trash look really attractive and quality companies look uninvestable. It's why you see all the value investors on YouTube, etc saying don't buy companies like AAPL and MSFT while recommending people invest in companies like INTC, FB or BABA.\n\nThese days I like to use DCF models just to sanity check an investment. So for example you have a price target of around $275 on SHOP which I think is a little low, but either way it's not a million miles away from the current valuation.\n\nAt the same time SHOP is one of the most innovative companies in the ecommerce space and they're building themselves a significant moat with an ecosystem of products and services. I think a good argument can be made that SHOP deserve some kind of a premium. At the same time I think the mistake some value investors make is not significantly discounting stocks like INTC for the risk that they will continue to disappoint.\n\nOn top of that valuations largely depend on sentiment and broader macro environment. In 2020/2021 SHOP benefited massively from the positive investor sentiment towards ecommerce and the easy money macro environment we were in. Then in 2022 that completely flipped. In my opinion the valuation rerating of stocks like SHOP has less to do with the market seeing sense in regards to SHOP specifically and more to do with broader market sentiment and macro shifts. Whether a company like SHOP is going to do well over the next few years probably depends far more on the risk appetite in the broader market than it looking 10% over or undervalued on a DFC analysis. If the market starts to believe inflation has peaked and the long-term growth narrative of pandemic winners like SHOP is mostly intact we'll probably see SHOP move higher regardless of valuation as investors feel more comfortable putting money back into those kinds of companies. Similarly if inflation remains persistently high and the Fed gets even more hawkish then stocks like SHOP will continue to fall regardless of their valuations.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Sure, but I guess my broader point is that a DCF (regardless of inputs) can't tell you if you're investing in Google or Yahoo, and in most cases it's avoiding the Yahoos and picking the Googles that is far more important in the long run.\n\nWhere DCFs don't give you highly subjective results is in cases of extreme overvaluation. For example, in 2021 a DCF analysis on SHOP might have helped you avoid a landmine because unless you believed SHOP was going to continue growing at pandemic rates and achieve 30%+ operating margins the valuation made no sense. But at this point a DCF on SHOP will be a lot less conclusive so therefore it's probably more important to consider the less tangible aspects of the business like its moat, its leadership, if people like the company and its products, etc.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I highly appreciate posts like this.

Also, interest rates were so high in the 70s and early 80s normal folks like most of us became forced sellers to fund our lives and definitely weren't buying stocks in 1980 when it was finally almost over seeing as bonds were yielding 14 - 20%... Also the 80s rally which really started the secular bull market which is now ending was highly manipulated thanks to Reagan tax cuts America could not afford which led to the now untenable debt levels and why the Fed will try to fight inflation but either fail or, absolutely destroy America's economy if they're successful because the government can't afford 7 - 10%+ interest rates without massive tax increases on everyone, and budget cuts too, and government spending makes up for like 20% of usa economy or something so them cutting spending whilst also taking more from workers will be a double whammy. \n\nNasdaq 2000 to 2015 - 80-90% drop, many companies went totally bankrupt, a few winners in the long run which everyone here pretends they'd probably have been invested in and held for 20 years like Amazon and gotten super rich off but more than likely Nortel woulda been the beloved stock on here over the Amazon book store... Also a fair bit of inflation in those 15 years but not terrible.. But house prices certainly went up and also many people lost everything in 2008 - 2011 so even if they did hold their Nasdaq stocks like Amazon til then, they were likely sellers in 2008 near the lows in order to keep their homes.\n\nSo ya, sure, stocks always seem to reach new highs but a lot of that is financial engineering, ignoring the fact that inflation exists especially a lot in things normal people need to buy like energy, food, housing and sone companies outright fail if you have any \"speculative growth stocks\" you hold, well they're the most likely failures...

It's going way lower eventually.. There will be big bounces along the way, 20%+, all designed to kerp y'all invested and suck in more suckers, whilst all it is is shorts covering making real money and then re-entering their shorts at the top of each rally whilst ppl on here will be most convinced that we've reached a permanent low and go all in, months or years before the real final low. \n\nAnd this time the Fed doesn't have investors backs, unlike the last 13 year (could really go back 30+ years...) fake as hell bull market with rates at 0% for 13 years and REAL RATES currently at negative 8%...

{"title": "A deep dive into who actually buys Teslas", "selftext": "It seems to be a common assumption around here that Musk‚Äôs latest political tweets could alienate Tesla‚Äôs main customer base: democrats. But instead of debating about whether or not that‚Äôs true, let‚Äôs first look at if it‚Äôs even accurate to assume that most Tesla buyers are democrats.\n\nLuckily, theres data for that and the results were disclosed in Feb ‚Äò22. [Leta take a look at the key findings of that survey.](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/cars/tesla-buyer-politics/index.html) Keep in mind, these results came out long before his latest claim to be voting Republican. \n\nFirst finding: ‚ÄúSurveys by research firm Morning Consult show that in January about 22% of Democrats were considering buying a Tesla, while 17% of Republicans were looking to purchase one‚Äù\n\nSecond: ‚ÄúAnd Republicans are slightly more likely to trust the Tesla brand, 27% compared to 25% among Democrats.‚Äù\n\nOkay so far it‚Äôs looking pretty equal today. But how about in the past?\n\nThird: ‚ÄúData from Strategic Vision, which has surveyed hundreds of thousands of car buyers, shows that since 2019, 38% of Tesla buyers have identified themselves as Democrats, and 30% have said they're Republicans. That's slightly less \"liberal\" than EV buyers overall, who skew 41% Democratic to 27% Republican.‚Äù\n\nSo definitely a higher percentage being democrat. But far from the majority. \n\nAnd I saved the best for last: ‚ÄúFigures from the Internal Revenue Service show that only 22% of those claiming the credit had adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less, while 32% earned between $100,000 and $200,000, and another 43% earned between $200,000 and $500,000. The remaining 4% earned more than $1 million.‚Äù\n\nSo Tesla buyers are rich. Though this data is only from people who were able to claim the $7,500 credit which as been long gone.\n\nAnd lastly: ‚ÄúThe primary motivator to buy a Tesla is not because customers want to reduce greenhouse gases, Edwards said. His data show performance and styling are the biggest draws for most buyers.‚Äù\n\nMy conclusion: It seems to me like whether someone is a democrat or not isn‚Äôt as much of a factor as Reddit assumes. Having enough money to buy one is. As is Tesla maintaining its ‚Äúcool factor‚Äù.\n\nEdit: since the income numbers are a little wonky and outdated, I‚Äôve found one that is more current [here](https://hedgescompany.com/blog/2019/03/tesla-model-3-demographics-income/).

The roadster had a tough time with that because batteries are very heavy, which made it difficult as a performance vehicle, but the application was niche enough and the acceleration good enough that it gained traction. Next market segment was luxury automobiles and this was a highly profitable market segment to penetrate (and apart from Elon's miscues surrounding his obstinance around the model X), because margins are still very high for luxury automobiles, but electric drivetrains offer a number of key differentiators along key criteria within the value proposition of a luxury car. First and foremost, they're quiet. Weight isn't as much of an issue because luxury car drivers typically don't desire the same number of lateral Gs as sports car drivers. Range isn't nearly as much of a concern in daily driving (especially for well heeled drivers who likely live near their place of employment) as it is for sports car drivers as well (who probably want to go balls out for 4-6 hours at a time around a track).\n\nElectric cars are more efficient from an engineering perspective if not for the pesky battery issue. I'm honestly kind of surprised there wasn't a \"tweener\" car with a gas motor powering a generator driving electric motors. Fisker had something along those lines but I think it was a complicated system where the engine could drive the wheels as well as the generator. I'm just talking here about replacing the battery with a small 1-cylinder gas or diesel engine. \n\nBut at any rate, as someone who doesn't align very well with either side of the political spectrum (pro weed/hamsterdam from the wire really, pro choice, pro guns, pro \"supply and demand\" economics insofar as we recognize that behavioral economics is literally like the missing piece of efficient markets hypothesis and we need to approach legislation generally with the assumption that we're governing a bunch of coked up chimpanzees, pro globalization, pro \\*obscene\\* competitiveness in education, anti private company subsidies, federal government should be like the 50 states starting a gofundme for nukes, testing standards to prevent tainted alcohol, and hypersonic fighter jets), I can tell you that I respect the inventiveness of elon musk in his brand alignment of tesla. \n\nWould I buy a prius?

Sounds legit. \n\nThere are a couple issues with the assumptions. Firstly, EV's are spectacularly heavy and to combat all that extra weight, \"aero\" or as it's also known as aerodynamics becomes a major function in the design. Therefore, styling becomes pretty universal and common between vehicles. Look at the similarities between the Tesla Model 3, the Porche Taycon, and the Toyota Miria. The hatchback models contain similarities. \n\nThere's also no legitimate \"Go Green!\" being aired constantly across any radio station. HOWEVER... there is a constant drowning against EVs on conservative talk radio. Their main message, \"Don't buy.\" Just turn on any FOX station to hear it.\n\nLastly, there's the explosion of new EVs coming to market: For F150 Lighting, Rivian, GM Hummer EV, Ram EV, Chevy Volt, Volkswagen, Porche, BMW. Polstar, China BYD, Li auto, NIO, Xpeng. Therefore there are more and more choices for the consumer. Of course with all these new competitors, comes demand for raw materials: Lithium, cobalt, magnesium, aluminum, and more. These raw materials have skyrocketed in price due to that. \n\nFortunately, advancements in battery technologies is under way. China, who seams to be cutting ties with Tesla in favor of their home grown companies (this is an interesting read btw) is developing sodium base batteries that are cheaper to make, recycle, and larger operation range. India is experimenting with Aluminum-Air batteries that you swap at \"EV-stations\" for a full charge in less than 3 minutes. Very interesting stuff really. Let's also not forget the Toyota Hydrogen Engines. \n\nWhen it comes to vehicles, the one to actually pay attention to is Toyota btw. Toyota is very conservative in terms of presenting reliable technology historically. Toyota is also constantly in contact with its consumers to engineer immediate improvements. Why? They do this from \"lessons learned.\" You don't become the world's largest vehicle manufacturer by sitting on your hands. You do it by listening, learning, and improving. That's something that Tesla is getting a reputation for not doing. Just watch YouTube.\n\nSo Elon Musk transition of his consumer base is an actual No-Brainer.

EV credits are going away. EV market share is decreasing.  \n\nI just want to share a simple model I use to communicate $TSLA future and how to deflect FUD. \n\nEvery manufacturer will sell every EV they make through 2030.  As the world goes toward 50% EVs (we know the world is going to 100% but we don‚Äôt want to scare the fish). So Tesla will likely make 3M, 5M, 7M, 10M cars in future years. \n\nWe know TSLA makes 19.2% Operating Margins today. So let‚Äôs use 20 and 25% margins.  \n\nLet‚Äôs use Average selling price of 50k to make math easy. Any other number is also reasonable. \n\nEPS based 20% and 25% below (1B shares outstanding)\n\n3M * 50k * 0.2 / 1B = $30\n\n3M : $30, $37.5\n\n5M : $50, $75\n\n7M : $70, $87.5\n\n10M : $100, $125\n\nNow we add a PE ratio. 20 PE historical SP500, 30PE still growing slowly, 50 Still growing fast. \n\nShare price based on PE: 20,30,50\n\n3M 20% Margin: $600, $900, $1500\n\n3M 25%: $750, $1125, $1875\n\n5M 20%: $1000, $1500, $2500\n\n5M 25%: $1500, $2250, $3750\n\n7M 20%: $1400, $2100, $3500\n\n7M 25%: $1750, $2625, $4375\n\n10M 20%: $2000, $3000, $5000\n\n10M 25%: $2500, $3750, $6250\n\nThe best part for us is this doesn‚Äôt include the free option call on FSD, robotaxis, Tesla Bot, and Tesla energy.

But generally speaking which every number you pick, it will be higher than todays values. \n\nSo my comments on the FUD. Most of it is just self defense mechanisms defending their favorite auto companies. \n\nSo every EV by every company will be sold!  I definitely hope they more. They will be sold.  I‚Äôve spent <$1000 on maintenance on my car and my car is 6 years, 120k miles. It‚Äôs glorious. And save on gas too. \n\nOver valued High PE. \nAbsolutely, TSLA is overvalued today. But is it cheap compared to the future. It looks that way. \n\nSells less cars than legacy autos. \nAbsolutely. But Tesla increased production by 80% last year.  Likely be 50% more per year until 5-10M cars. Legacy autos need to make more EVs and everyone wins. \n\nCompetition is coming. \nAbsolutely, the more the merrier. More EVs takes away from ICE sales. Tesla doesn‚Äôt have any ICE cars to compete with them. \n\n\nEV credits are going away. \nAbsolutely, it was about $500M vs their $3.5B in profits last quarter. It‚Äôs gonna suck, but Tesla hopefully gets more efficient with their new factories. \n\nTesla EV market share is decreasing.  \nAbsolutely. They were 80% at one time when car market was 1%.  And they sold <500k cars. \n\nAs the car market goes to 100% EV eventually TSLA will be 10% of the EV market and 10% car market.  \n\nTesla build quality sucks. \nIt‚Äôs not the best, but they have 1M+ model Y and 1M+ cybertruck orders waiting to be produced. So it just shows EVs are wanted over tradition lower Gas mileage ICE cars. So hopefully traditional auto can make more EVs to reduce this massive backlog. \n\nGood luck!

Your cybertruck number is optimistic to say the least.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I think there are a couple of factors to think about when considering future margins. I agree with the apple analogy in the sense that people are willing to pay more for certain brands they associate with a better experience. I believe Tesla is one of those. I also agree with you that affordability for a 1K cell phone is not the same as that of a 50K car. But that‚Äôs only a small part of the puzzle. \n\nFirst, I think looking at the current luxury car market is misleading. I have been able to afford any car I wanted for over a decade, as have been all of my friends. We all pragmatically chose Hondas or Subarus etc because there is no compelling difference between a Honda and an Acura for any of us. Materials slightly nicer, better acceleration, but really the experience of the car is the same.  But Tesla convinced several of us to break out of that mindset because a Tesla is a completely different beast. I don‚Äôt think this is a localized phenomenon, like one of the previous posters mentioned, trade-ins for teslas are often from more mid range brands, and this doesn‚Äôt even capture the people like me who sold their previous car privately. \n\nThat said, I don‚Äôt think this gets us anywhere near 10M 50k cars. But the question isn‚Äôt really whether they can sell that many 50k cars, it‚Äôs more to your point about margins. It‚Äôs looking like in a future steady state, EVs will be  significantly cheaper to manufacture than ICE cars. How much, we don‚Äôt know, but given that batteries are the highest cost part and Tesla showed a path at battery day to lower cost by 56%, there is still a lot of room. Plus the other manufacturing innovations like the gigs castings, paint free stainless steel cyber truck, and anything else they are working on in secret. \n\nIf you drop the cost to produce a 30k car by 25%, margins over an ice vehicle will double or more.  Since a significant chunk of the car market will be ICE for the next decade, there is a floor on car prices at the price where manufacturers can make a profit on ICE vehicles. Think of it this way; if EVs compete to drop the price below that of a comparable ICE, more buyers choose an EV, increasing demand beyond production, bringing the price back up. So the current ICE car price is the floor for cars for the next decade. At the point of 100% EV sales, the market will be free to compete prices down, but at that point we really do have to consider what the future of transportation looks like. A decade from now automation is likely solved to the point where transportation as a service is the cheapest option, and imo Tesla is best placed to scale into that market as well. \n\nSo in the end the question is how low can Tesla drive EV costs at scale?  They are working hard on this and we will just start to see the possibilities as the 4680 ramps in Austin then Berlin. I think within the next two years we will have a pretty good idea, but my belief is that the cost to manufacture an EV will be at least 25% cheaper than a comparable ICE, for Tesla anyway. I think other manufacturers will lag by at least 5 years until Tesla hits a practical bottom, then they will catch up over the following few years. If you buy this, I think those 20-25% margins across the fleet are a reasonable expectation. If you don‚Äôt, then I agree they are probably going to have to drop.\n\nEdited: looked up teslas actually battery cost prediction from battery day.\n\nPS: the efficiency of teslas capital expenditures comes in here. According to Herbert Deiss, Tesla Berlin can make a model y with a third of the time they needed to make a VW in their flagship factory.

On the contrary, margins on existing models are likely to *increase.*\n\nTesla have thoroughly explained *why* over the last couple of years: 4680 cell, structural battery pack, single piece front and rear casting, more efficient factories contributing larger % of deliveries (remember Fremont is the least efficient).\n\nThe current price inflation is due to cost inflation of materials which itself is a result of supply chain issues and COVID lockdowns. The price increases in materials is *more likely* than not to flatten and decrease (deflate) which will allow Tesla to bring prices for the M3 and Y back down while maintaining margins (if not increasing them because of the aforementioned improvements).\n\nSo the questions you should be really asking is what is the end demand for M3/Y before Tesla needs to make a smaller more affordable car in it's pursuit to 10m+ sales? This is hard to estimate, but you can look at total yearly \"luxury vehicle sales\" and get an idea of the theortical maximum Tesla could sell if it had 100% of the $50-100k car market. Of course that's unlikely, but the TAM is quite alot larger than 2-3m units. Furthermore you have to consider the fact that because of the lower operating costs (maintenance and fuel savings), Tesla is actually attracting buyer from a larger segment. This is supported by Tesla's own trade-in data which suggests they're attracting buyers from as low as $35k and up.\n\nAnd then, to support your argument, you need to make a case for why Tesla's margins will drop if/when they develop a more affordable $25-35K car. I would argue the fact that Tesla is currently able to acheive 20%+ margins in the luxury segment supports the idea that there is a good chance they can also do that while making a more affordable car. There is certainly more evidence that they can do it rather than they can't do it, in my opinion.\n\nThe only counter-argument i can think of is from people reasoning by analogy and pointing to the margins of legacy OEMs in that segment and claiming if they can't do it then Tesla can't. And to that i would respond, Tesla has proved them wrong everytime they made the same argument about EVs in general, and Tesla's margins in EVs today are way higher than legacy OEM margins in EVs.

But things are changing rapidly and will change. My next car would never be Tesla. I alone gave my car test drive to so many friends and convinced them to buy Tesla. But in the recent past, I have told to all my buddies to stay away from Tesla the car and the Tesla the stock as well. Here is my prediction.\n\n1. **Price Problem:** Tesla is raking money because it raised the price of all its cars by 30-40%!! Model 3 used to be around $45K (LR) Model S used to be $69K and Model X was $79K. I can't even keep track of the price these days. All the car prices are over the roof, gas prices are high, hence folks are wiling to pay any premium to Tesla. Once the auto market cools, Tesla has to  bring the price down. The current margin  is unsustainable!\n2. **Moat Problem**: There is no strong moat for Tesla. Like Netflix or Disney, customers can switch to another competitor just like that. That can't happen for Microsoft or Google or Amazon or Apple. If you buy iPhone you are married to it because of the ecosystem. That is the reason why these tech companies command such a P/E, because there is growth and the guarantee that thinks can't go south. But Tesla doesn't have a moat. Two moats that are good for short term are a) Charging network and b) Cheapest $/KWH battery cost. Charging network moat is going away slowly and I see so many new chargers coming into the market. Also Tesla started raking the price of chargers, this week it is $0.58/KWH in Bay Area, outrageous, whereas charge point charges  $0.20/KWH. Cheapest battery cost also will go away, which I will explain in the battery section.\n3. **Brand Problem:** Car is personal to everyone. People want to associate with the brand. Liberals are the one who were willing to pay premium to move towards to green energy solution. With Elon openly willing to piss of liberals is going to push away most of the liberals to  other car companies. I know none of them are at par with Tesla yet, but they are bridging the gap except in the profit margin, which will take time & scale to make it happen. Elon brand is toxic to Tesla and it is going to push aways the users.\n4. **Scaling issues:** Facebook or Google can simple predict if I make $100 / user, if I add another 1 billion users, I can add $100 billion to bottom line. Because it is simply scaling by adding more servers, that all. But cars are real world things, it is not simply as scaling. More cars, more recalls, more servicing issues will slowdown the progress. So production is scaling is one aspect, but supporting few million cars isn't easy.\n5. **Battery Tech**:  The biggest advantage Tesla has is, it is able to bring down the price batteries by building mega factories. Do you know why tesla went with the 18650 batteries originally? Because it was available at the cheapest price. As the advancement in battery tech comes, tesla won't be able to leverage at rapid pace, compared a new manufacturer or someone who has outsourced it. So if a new standard like 18650 arrives that gives best price performance ratio every manufacturer will be on the same level playing field. It would be in fact hard for Tesla to compete with standardized Industry.\n6. **Law Suits**: Tesla is a lawsuit mine. Tesla's auto pilot is very so-so. Don't sell me the cool aid, I have the car Tesla Model-3 and the autopilot on I-5 itself is pretty very average. I have zero confidence that Tesla can make autopilot can work on local roads, atleast not with the current hardware. So all the folks who paid $10K to $12K for autopilot would file for class action lawsuit that Tesla didn't deliver what it promised. It will happen just a matter of time.\n7. **Elon being Cocky**: Nobody is God, nobody can be right 100% of the time. So it is ok to try fall and learn and not repeat the mistakes. But Elon has this God's complex. Just like Steve Jobs was very persistant on 1 button mouse.  Tesla's automatic parking sucks, rain sensor using Neural network sucks big time. But he won't admit the mistakes and correct it. Tesla's original autopilot from MobileEye was light years better but he insisted his solution would be better, but it wasn't. Now he is pushing that cameras alone are good enough for auto pilot, but it may not. He is not willing to accept and change course, this can really take the company in wrong direction.\n8. **Transportation as Service**: Lastly the predictions of 10 million cars in future are vaporware. Cruise is already doing driverless driving in San franciso, Waymo is expanding more, Zoox is trying Transportation as service. In another 3-5 years, tech will good enough for the cars to drive by themselves atleast within a certain geographical area. If it happens, urban folks will drop the cars and may be keep just one for long drive. So the overall usage of cars are going to plummet. If Transportation as Service works, then we won't need cars, we will need moving hotels, moving homes. So we don't want to be constrained by tight space and start enjoying travel. If that happens, Tesla and other car companies are in real big trouble.\n\nOverall Tesla had a first mover advantage, but it didn't build enough moat or brand value. Elon started going in the wrong way pissing away the potential customers and spoiling the brand. Tesla can potentially go to P/E of 10 like other car companies which would put them at valuation around $200 range.

The 69k was a brief period on sale to sell the older cars when the line was being upgraded.  \n\nTesla has a 1 year wait list on the model Y and cybertruck. They have pricing power and they have future year inflation they have to price in today.  \n\nNot sure if you‚Äôve notice, inflation is at 10%. Generally everything prices have gone up.  their prices have gone up 20% and their demand is still strong. \n\n2) Efficiency, supercharger network, range, battery costs. \nIn 5 years these might go away.

He‚Äôs not perfect and neither is gates and bezos but most people still use a PC and Amazon. \n\n4) they are already supporting a few million cars. They have been scaling just fine.  They just built 2 factories. Double their charging network every 2-3 years.  They‚Äôve already said sourcing batteries is their biggest challenge.  But is that the next 5 years or after?\n\n5) battery scaling. Tesla moved the industry to 2170. Tesla then moved to 4680 and will drag the industry in that direction. Tesla is also the largest consumer of batteries. They buy up all the spare batteries for their energy packs.  Other companies can‚Äôt even source enough batteries. \n\n6) the lawsuits for autopilot have not succeeded because it tells you you are in complete control of the vehicles.

{"title": "if you missed the COVID-19 run up on PFE or BNTX in 2020, don't miss this Monkey Pox play", "selftext": "Monkey Pox outbreak is currently written off as:\n\n\"not contagious\"\n\"definitely won't be another COVID\"\n\"transmission is not airborne\"\n\"only transmitted sexually\" \n\"its only because a bunch of dudes had a sauna party in Spain\" \n\nBut that's what they said about COVID-19 in January 2020.\n\n------\n\nAnomalies of this current Monkey Pox outbreak of 2022:\n\nAlready identified in many countries as of today, latest ones including Australia, Israel and Switzerland. Last week, Spain, Portugal, Sweden and the US (Massachusetts) had its first cases. (totalling 100 cases) \n\nNever before had the outbreak been this viral. Even Nigeria, where this Monkey Pox is endemic, officially only had 558 cases with 8 deaths over 2017-2022. That's like 100 cases a year on average. Yet right now we are having 100 cases in 1 week, spread across Europe.\n\n__What I posit:__\n1. The strain might have mutated to become more viral (like COVID-19 did) \n2. Transmission is airborne (maybe due to a mutation) \n3. Incubation period of 2 weeks makes it hard to thwart and detect (like COVID-19) / countries don't know how to detect it yet\n4. Other unforeseen factors related to covid infections/vaccinations? idk. \n\n__Play:__\nI'm not saying that monkey pox will be another covid that will cripple the world. Maybe 1 in a million chance, it might. This would be the bull case. \n\nMy play is simply hope that the governments of the world will be afraid enough of the monkey pox that they'd start ordering vaccines from the producers. \n\nFact: some of the already has. \n1. __Bavarian Nordic (BAVA)__ shares shot up __almost 2x__ when they got some large orders of the monkey pox vaccines \n\n2. U.S. Patent holder and producer of the monkey pox vaccine, __Emergent BioSolutions (EBS)__ hasn't announced any orders yet, but their shares have gone up from $26 to $35. In its heyday in 2020 when people were buying up biotech stocks blindly, it went to as high as $130 -- this was just a FOMO run up because EBS has nothing to do with COVID-19nor were they developing any vaccines for COVID-19. But right now for the Monkey Pox outbreak, they are the ones that will be stepping up to be the main cast, the Iron Man superhero fighting against the monkey pox villain. Can you imagine how high this stock would run up to?\n\n3. There's a spike in options traded volume in EBS $60 strike, Dec 2022 expiry. 350 lots bought, spent __$70k__. If EBS went back to $130, that position will be worth at least __$2 million__. It might be someone in the CDC, or might just be speculators. \n\n4. EBS in itself is a very healthy company. Growing revenue year on year, currently at over a billion dollars. And gross profit margin of around 50% is above the industry watermark. Minimal debt and free cashflow is piling up every year. P/E ratio of 10 is a little high but you do pay a premium for a healthy company. Fun fact: They do own the patent to the vaccine of the anthrax virus as well. It's never bad to own a piece of a healthy company.", "id": "uv1kav", "created_utc": 1653186121.0, "score": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|16 seconds ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uv1kav)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uv1kav)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This article states that \"Nigeria reports about 3,000 monkeypox cases a year\", not 558 over a five year period. \n\nSource: [https://apnews.com/article/science-health-africa-france-56c405d91f650a41593a4a03c0ab9d79](https://apnews.com/article/science-health-africa-france-56c405d91f650a41593a4a03c0ab9d79)", "score": 25, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "You‚Äôre saying if I invested my whole life savings into vaccine companies, now I have to have sex with dudes just so I don‚Äôt get ruined?", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "You have to have sex with male monkeys", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "You say that like it's a bad thing", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Or have sex with a GME ape.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Or let the monkey have sex with him", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Even better, afterwards the monkey can throw shit at him.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Its almost ‚ÄûSchr√∂dingers Blowjob‚Äú ‚Ä¶ ‚Äûas long as you suck dick behind Wendy‚Äôs, you don‚Äôt end up sucking dick behind Wendy‚Äôs‚Äú", "score": 16, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "That‚Äôs your insurance policy to make sure your stock goes up", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It could well be, but the spread right now is too fast for anyone's liking.
