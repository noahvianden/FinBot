Therefore, you want to short an option that has high IV and is far enough out that theta works in your favor. How do you find these plays? Do people typically stick with the same tickers that they know well to run credit spreads on? I can't imagine that you are using a scanner to just look for stocks based off of their IV. \n\nFor debit spreads, since you maximize your profit on the long leg of the spread, are you looking stocks with low IV? \n\nFinally, how do people choose the width of their spread? Is there a certain risk ratio that people use?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> I understand that with credit spreads your max profit is with the short leg of the spread. \n\nA word of caution: max profit comes with max risk. There is no need to use the max profit number for anything, you can ignore it. Instead, *manage the spread to your desired profit and loss targets*. The most the max profit tells you is the upper limit of your potential profit targets.\n\nFor example, say you have a $3 wide spread paying $1, which is max profit, but you have to hold it for 30 days to get that max, since that's the expiration (max profit is only guaranteed at expiration). Instead, you could exit the trade at $.50 profit and get your capital back in, let's say, 10 days. Do that three times sequentially and your total gain over 30 days is $1.50. You make more money and get better utilization of your capital by going for a smaller profit that pays off sooner. Not to mention avoiding all the extra risks of expiration.\n\n> How do you find these plays? \n\nThere is no one right way and many people have written about their methods (check out Option Alpha and projectoption, as just two examples). Here's a quick summary of my method:\n\n* Due diligence and screen for quality stocks (good fundamentals, good options liquidity) You want mostly boring blue chips, but not so boring that their is no action in their options contracts.\n\n* Get that screen down to below 100 candidates. Put them in a watchlist.\n\n* Every day, look at the IV of the desired contract vs. IV Percentile or IV Rank. Look for high/low IV relative to the 52-week average. If there are none, no trades opened that day.\n\n> Do people typically stick with the same tickers that they know well to run credit spreads on?\n\nI do, as should be clear from the above, but others don't. They screen the entire market every day to find the best deal, regardless of the ticker. It's not a bad strat, since emotion and loyalty to a brand can cloud your judgment. Why should you care if it is ABC or XYZ that you trade today? As long as it offers an edge, that is all that should matter (after screening for quality, of course).\n\n> For debit spreads, since you maximize your profit on the long leg of the spread, are you looking stocks with low IV?\n\nSort of. It's not just high or low that matters, it's potential to move in a favorable direction and by how much. If a low IV call stays low, the vol you paid for didn't do anything for you. Actually, it's more accurate to say that are looking for mispricing of vol. If the market is paying more for vol than actually happens (IV > HV after the fact), you want to be a seller. If the market is paying less for vol than actually happens (IV < HV after the fact), you want to be a buyer.\n\n> Finally, how do people choose the width of their spread? Is there a certain risk ratio that people use?\n\nYes.\n\nFor credit spreads, 1/3rd the width is break-even for 33ish delta, so for a $1 spread, you want *at least* $.34 in credit. That gives you a break-even risk/reward of 2/1. As long as your probability of profit is greater than 67% (on your *managed* exit targets, not max profit/loss), you'll average out as a profitable trader.\n\nEDIT: But I just said not to shoot for max profit, didn't I? That's right, I did. The $.34 lower bound on a $1 spread is about max profit. But I also said that max profit is the upper limit on your exit targets. Even though you aren't shooting for $.34 on $1, having that additional headroom gives you more room to maneuver. For example, say you wanted to exit at $.18 gain or $.36 loss, for perfect 2/1 risk/reward. That is totally do-able on a $.34 max profit $1 spread, but a lot harder to do on a $.20 max profit on $1 spread.\n\nFor debit spreads, you basically enter ATM or a couple of strikes ITM, so that implies a 1/1 risk/reward or close to. So for a $1 spread ATM, you don't want to pay more than about $.50.\n\nI stated the ratios for $1 spread, but you just scale those up if you can tolerate more risk. I generally stay under $3 widths, but some people swear that $5 width is optimal.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the reply. This is a lot of great info. Thanks for taking the time to type it up.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Spreads are directional in that they profit if your analysis gets the direction correct.  A BULL put credit spread will profit if the stock moves up, or stays about the same due to theta decay.  A BEAR call credit spread will profit if the stock moves down, or stays the same.\n\nA debit spread will profit if the stock moves in the expected direction as well.  To trade these you want to find a stock where your analysis and the trend indicate it may move in a direction and then use a bullish or bearish spread strategy.  \n\nSelling credit spreads when the stock's IV is high can bring in more premium to help possibly make more profit.\n\nThe width of the spread is all about the max loss of the trade.  A $1 wide spread will have at most a $100 max loss amount, a $5 wide spread = $500, $10 wide = $1,000, and so on.  How much are you willing to risk on the trade?

{"title": "3x levered ETFs are horrible long-term investments.", "selftext": "There have been several posts about buying 3x levered ETF as long term investment. However that is not a great idea. Here is why:\n\nAssume we have an index at 100$ and a 3x levered ETF.\n\nIf the index gains 3%, they would close at 103 and the 3xETF at 109. Easy until now.\n\nLets then assume that the index declines for 5%. So it closes at 97.85. The 3xETF returns 3x the daily performance, so it would close at 87.55.\n\nThe next day, the index gains 2.2%, so it closes at 100. The 3x deliveres 3x the performance which is 6.6%, so it would close at $93.32.\n\nAs we can see, with a choppy markets we will lose a bunch of performance. The reason for it are simple margin requirements.\n\nThe company providing the 3x levered ETFs does not want to go bankrupt. So when the market goes up, in order to deliver the daily returns the company buys more shares. If it goes down, it sells the shares. That reduces the returns.\n\nThat is why the QQQ returned 119,05% , and the TQQQ the 3x levered ETF delivered 284,33% - which is 2.4x the return not 3x.\n\nThis 2.4x return is in a historic bull market. If the market is choppier - the 3x ETF returns would decline and might even close below the underlying index.\n\nAdd the risk that the 3x levered Index can go to 0 if the Nasaq closes down 33.3%. It is unlikely and we have never seen it, but the market is unpredictable.\n\n3x levered ETFs are a great for short term investments, but can be horrible for the long run. Please be cautious.\n\nEdit: 3x ETFs also tend to have much higher fees, so they loose out here as well.

And can also go further to the supply chain to get raw materials and potentially skip intermediate steps\n\nI think it's mostly just going to come down to the pace that they can ramp up factories, iterate, and then build new factories and repeat.\n\nThe global demand for batteries seems like it could easily be way beyond the total capacity all companies have planned. Tesla seems like they're making the biggest push for significantly more gWh of cell production, both in house and from suppliers. They've got the most ambitious goals, and the clearest plans to get there. It just comes down to executing on those plans.\n\nIf they can, they'll easily justify their existing valuation, with a healthy margin for growth. If they run in to some problem with scaling up cell production significantly, then that's a real risk to continued growth at the rates we've seen.\n\nRisks like \"competition\" or \"Musk\" don't even make my top 5 concerns.

Remember: this is based on a continuously running economic model since the 1970's which means it IGNORES climate change entirely. And, well, as the Magic 8-Ball would famously say: \"Outlook not so good.\" \n\nNote that the general predictions the model makes are eerily closely aligned with our current timeline for climate change: By 2030, we will have warmed the Earth by about 1.5C. Currently at around 1.2C today we are already seeing droughts that will never end in the American Southwest, annual firestorms in the American West and Australia, heat waves that are borderline unsurvivable by millions of humans in India, flooding in Europe that washes away entire towns, the gradual warming of desert nations like Iraq which are already forcing people to migrate away from the hottest regions, and unprecedented heat waves in places like Antarctica and Siberia which have never been seen before in recorded history.\n\nAssuming nothing changes, and so far it really is \"business as usual\" as nobody except the European Union are even pretending to meet their carbon emissions targets today, much less in 2030, 2040, or 2050, we will be seeing the Earth warming up to 2C in 2040. This is mostly likely enough to trigger the largest human migrations in history as large swathes of the planet are now uninhabitable year round. Large portions of India (population: 1.4 billion) will need to be abandoned. Rising seas will drown major cities of the world, including Jakarta (population: 33 million) and Miami (population: 6 million) as examples. Societal collapse will indeed become likely once billions of humans are facing famine, death by heat in the summer, no potable drinking water. After that, the collapse is inevitable once wars for remaining resources start. Humanity's long term survival may still be possible, but civilization as we know it will be gone as billions of humans starve, die of thirst, fail to survive migrations or never have a chance to migrate before dying, or are killed in global resource wars.\n\nWell, that was perfectly sunny and optimistic, I hope everyone has a good Monday! 😇", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Before end of this decade I want to have my own piece of land safe from floods and drought with solar, batteries, starlink, rain water filtering system, etc.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The dream.

Heres why.\n\nChina imminent collapse.\n\nWar in Russia.  Nato escalations. \n\nWorld wide shortages. \n\n Cryptocurreny collapse.\n\nLet me start with 🇨🇳 \n\nChinas economy has run rampant for the last 20 years.  The United States borrows trillions from China.  However, China is in a deeper bubble than we have ever seen.  \n\nChinas main source of economy is in real estate.   Do you know there are abaondoned sky scrapers in China right now?  Its like detroit had a baby with dubai.  They built a city for 10 million people and cant even get 100,000 to buy the properties. The banks print out real estate loans more than Jpow is printing out singles.\n\nThis happened in dubai as well, I'm not sure on current affairs but i remember all the sports cars like Ferrari and Mclarens left abandoned in parking lots and the desert after they defaulted and left country before they got their heads chopped off. (Serious arab law)\n\nToday you can explore abandoned high rises in china, some half constructed abandoned.\n\nIn 2021 Q4 484 chinese businesses defaulted on their major real estate payments. (This should be double digits)\n\nOn top of all of this, covid has run absolutely rampant to the point they are locking people in 🍎 factories and can't leave.  This may be what pops the bubble but I would not put a nickel of my burger king check into any China owned companies. Have you all tried to buy a car lately?  You cant.  China and all of the nafta companies aren't producing near enough goods.  If you can't sell you cant make tendies.\n\nIf and when the bubble burst it will shake up an already rattled global economy with the 🇺🇦 war.   I think this year possibly next the united states will enter into the war. \n\nAlready ships like the USS Kearsarge are in route to the Baltic Sea arrived 24hours ago\n\nI would guess a 5-10 trillion dollar loss on NASDAQ overnight is possible could be this year if announce of the war, I'm sure it will start with a russian attack that hits american troops, a plane or an embassy.  The moment this happens (it will) you need to start shorting before the boomers pull out of their 401k.  \n\nIf you already havent pulled out of your 401k consider it, transfer it to a roth ira or something like S&P500 on td ameriteade thats setup for retirement where you can pull out quickly. \n\nOn top of that the ticking time bomb of China we got a goold old great depression cooking.  \n\nAnyways boys\n\nPositions:\nLockheed\nRaytheon", "id": "uqlki1", "created_utc": 1652668081.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.51, "num_comments": 174, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uqlki1)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uqlki1)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Is this Bill Ackman's account?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Your 401K to a Roth makes no sense.

Oh btw not only that, the dip buyers have now acquired 25% compound interest if they held. Now comes the bear market...If I was the owner of Apple or I was the main strategist, id let the stock go to $1, just like Luna.

However, how the money was delivered wasn't terribly effective for reducing the risk of inflation and an eventual recession as it continued along the trend that if banks were provided capital they would seek to lend it out, however this has been shown for a long period of time as not true as they would rather seek less risky returns (investing in people/small companies who are struggling with a coming recession is generally a bad investment) and so sought out equity as a means (this also caused a rush into less and less viable equities as people chased returns over risk and it became frothy) to do this. \n\nInterest rates are still relatively low, there needs to be some pain (not just in the US but globally) as they are returned to optimal levels but it isn't necessarily worse due to the pumping of trillions into the economy and by some measures will be significantly less painful than having not done it (supply chains would have collapsed further as there would have been no capital to keep them afloat and would need to be almost completely rebuilt, housing prices would have further gone up as there would have been no means of building without supplies, and companies would have shrunk employment numbers further as there was no need when they couldn't produce a product due to no supplies).", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "A bit? sure.. but since not all of it was pumped as credit, I don't think it will worsen the recession much more..

As of April 30, 2022 that has gone up to 11.6%. It looks like they are becoming more aggressive. This is likely in response to their pension program being underfunded. This happened sometime around the great recession, and they have been working since then to catch up.\n\nBefore people rake the investment group and CEO across the coals, there is a lot of nuance to all this. First of all, CalPERs has been fighting to require public employees to increase their contributions into the program. They have not had much success with this, as employees do not want to take home less money. Further, California Taxpayers are not very receptive to helping fund the program (a minor tax increase could add significant new plan assets), but most voters do not like giving their money to help public employees. \n\nThe idea of reducing distributions to vested employees has been floated, but such a significant change is complicated and could be illegal without passing new laws. Even if they did this, there would be serious political ramifications as many of these employees carry a lot of influence with labor groups (even retirees can still have influence). Plus, sapping people of their retirement without warning could cause them serious financial harm and create a burden on society.\n\nCalPERs could also slow vesting, reduce distributions, and/or require more contributions from new employees. However, a defined benefits plan is one of the major perks of being a public employee. Guaranteed security for retirement is a valued benefit, and if you mess with this too much, it might be harder to recruit and maintain employees (which leads to future human resources costs down the line).\n\nIt should also be noted that the board of directors must approve significant changes. The CEO and investment team can only do so much. It's far easier to convince the board to adopt a different investment strategy than it is to make fundamental organizational changes. So don't be too hard on them for taking the path of least resistance. \n\nAs for the investment strategy itself, as of April 2022, only 11% of assets are invested in private equity. I imagine even fewer are invested in super risky stocks. Further, take a look at the 12/31/21 investment earnings report (link above). In 2021, private equity had a  one year return of 39.3%, and the annualized five year return was 16.5%.\n\nThose aren't bad numbers. The CEO joined 6 years ago, and CalPERs investment performance has been doing okay since she joined. Over the past five years, the investment returns have generally stayed above their benchmark targets (including private equity). They probably would have been better off putting the money in an S&P index fund, although I doubt it would have performed too much better than an annualized 16.5% five-year return. Retirement plans often try to diversify investments (including investing in more risky ventures). And again, only 11% of their assets are being allocated to this category.

The iPhone maker's stock price has roughly quadrupled since the start of 2019, but has slumped by 16% this quarter alone.\n\nScion held only six stocks at the end of December. The hedge fund exited all of those holdings except Bristol-Myers Squibb last quarter, but added the likes of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Discovery to its portfolio.\n\nThe slew of purchases helped to boost the total value of Scion's US stocks (excluding options) by 122% to $165 million. The fund's largest long positions as of March 31 were a $22 million stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb, roughly $19 million stakes in Booking Holdings and Discovery, and a $18 million stake in Alphabet.\n\nScion didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.\n\nIt's worth noting that Burry [trumpeted Apple](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-spotted-apple-warren-buffett-stock-investment-2021-3-1030186770?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) as a stock worthy of Warren Buffett in 1999 — about 17 years before the Berkshire Hathaway CEO invested in the company. Berkshire now counts Apple as the number-one holding in its stock portfolio, and Buffett [recently revealed](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-annual-shareholder-meeting-charlie-munger-stocks-2022-4?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) he added to his company's own position last quarter.\n\nBurry is [best known](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-gamestop-crypto-crash-2022-1?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) for calling and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, [paving the way](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-investor-michael-burry-scion-gamestop-stock-price-frenzy-2021-2-1030050393?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) for the meme-stock craze by investing in GameStop and penning letters to the video-game retailer's board, and [betting against](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-cathie-wood-ark-2021-8?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) Elon Musk's Tesla and Cathie Wood's flagship Ark Innovation fund last year.\n\nOver the past two years, Burry has singled out Tesla, GameStop, bitcoinn, dogecoinn, Robinhood, and the white-hot US housing market as examples of speculative excess in financial markets.\n\nLast June, the Scion chief [warned of](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-twitter-return-biggest-market-bubble-ever-2021-6?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) the \"greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things\" and [cautioned](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/big-short-michael-burry-warns-meme-stocks-crypto-crash-coming-2021-6?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) that retail investors were piling into meme stocks and cryptocurrencies before the \"mother of all crashes.\"\n\nBurry [slashed](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-stock-market-crash-q3-portfolio-2021-11?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) his US stock portfolio from more than 20 holdings to only six in the third quarter of 2021, reducing its total value (excluding options) from almost $140 million to $42 million.

There are far too many input variables. \n\nThose huge hedge funds everyone talks about and how they speak about them completely controlling everything or whatever is ridiculous. Have you ever ACTUALLY looked at their returns? Not some off hand bullshit. Go look at fund managers returns. They are almost, and I do truly mean almost as retarded as us here. The only difference is theoretically, sometimes, they have a retard line that exist that quite literally does the opposite of whatever dumb shit they are about to do so they don't lose money. \n\nThat's right. That stupid joke everyone makes here about inverting our ideas is literally how huge funds operate. They have extremely complicated and sophisticated mathematical models that all amount to them just trying not to blow up while making bad decisions. \n\nThe market is just as dumb as it's always been. There are random speculative assets, and said assets are getting fucked right now. All those \"great\" companies are just returning to earth in line with their actual earnings values instead of speculative values because of cheap cash. Cash itself is losing value because of Keynesian economics. The actual market of things is being threatened by humans fighting (happens all the time) \n\nThe only thing special, if I were to think of a special element of this particular time, is you are just bombarded with much more information than people in the past had, so it just makes things happen faster. And more public. You get more exposure to the idiots who run things, like Masayoshi Son or Elon Musk.

{"title": "Warren Buffet Buys More Than %10 of $PARA!!!", "selftext": "Over the weekend, I [wrote a DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uprewy/the_most_undervalued_stock_in_all_the_market_rn/) making my case as to why I thought Paramount Global was THE most undervalued stock in the markets. Well...looks like I wasn't the only value investor liking PARA.\n\nBerkshire 13F just revealed that Warren Buffet has taken an %11 stake in Paramount! The stock is up about %7 in after hours to almost $30. Looks like Warren was buying at much higher prices (around $37), so my gut tells me he's not done buying and will continue to buy down here. But why?\n\nEveryone knows Buffet/ Berkshire loves them some Apple and is one of the major shareholders there. I now am more positive than ever, that it will be Apple that buys PARA...and this is just a way for Warren to load up on more Apple shares. I will bet my left nut that Warren pushes Apple to do an all share deal and take out Paramount. \n\nI put my heart and soul into that DD, and some of you clowns said \"puts on PARA\". I told you put your money where your mouth is and show me. I really hope you weren't that foolish.\n\nThis reminds of a little story involving Warren that I'll share about the first time I ever bought a stock (Bank of America). Way back right after the Financial Crisis (around 2009), I had heard that it may be the best opportunity to buy stocks. I didn't know anything about stocks back then. But I did my research and felt banks were safe. So I bought Bank of America at $7. Turns out, I didn't nail the bottom and the stock dropped into the $6's. I panic sold. Not too long after, news came out that Warren bought BAC and the stock jumped to $11 within weeks. I felt like an ass...but that was what was needed to establish a bottom. I'm hoping the same thing happens here. This time, I didn't panic sell because of that lesson I learned way back. \n\nPosition: 15k shares at $28.50 (proof posted in the DD). I can sell rn and take my $20k and post some gain porn...but I'm holding on for the Apple buyout.  \n\nPrice Target is $65!! \n\nCheers!\n\n* Not financial advice.", "id": "ur8jsv", "created_utc": 1652742156.0, "score": 145, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 133, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|159|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ur8jsv)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ur8jsv)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "OP did you trim any of your position above 32?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Congrats on the position.
