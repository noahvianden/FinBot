Productivity is measured in terms of real output, and real output in this country is extremely consumption-driven.

Housing is one of the biggest components of inflation, low rates have contributed greatly to the housing market.

Lol you're making this too easy. All banks (the Fed is essentially a large bank) increase or decrease their rates to match inflation because that's how debt management works. If your bank offers loans with APR well below the rate of inflation, then that loan amount actually decreases without you having to pay for it. Essentially the bank winds up with less inflation adjusted dollars than it gave out. The same thing happens with savings accounts, if the rate of return is way below inflation you're better off just spending the money because your golden horse (or whatever object that will nominally hold value that you can buy, maybe a pile of diamonds?) will be worth more inflation adjusted dollars than the same amount left in a savings account earning 1/8th of what inflation is.\n\nSo this is a necessity of any entity that loans money. Otherwise it loses money by loaning it out.\n\nThe effect that this has is to encourage saving and discouraging getting loans to do more spending. Those are two mechanisms that... Decrease Demand. If we decrease demand in the US, while remaining nearly as productive as we currently are(unemployment is not a problem currently, although underemployment may be) and global productivity increases while other countries catch up to us in terms of covid effects and ultimately productivity then inflation will likely go back down. \n\nAnd that's how banks work. If you'd like any other concepts explained, I can give them a go.\n\nThe housing market is kinda an interesting one, because it's sometimes more supply side driven in certain places(suburban or rural) and sometimes more demand driven(urban areas or anywhere where building is hard). However, because most of our lumber isn't milled locally, the supply side of housing collapsed due to shortages in lumber and processed building products(not just an America thing). This combined with very little construction activity meant that supply went way below normal and there was an increase in demand both from foreign investment and upper middle class folks switching to a WFH situation. So, on average, that was another case of supply deceasing due to supply chain issues and a surprising demand increase.\n\nAnyway, I'm kinda tired of explaining fairly simple concepts.

For me, more than 10 are difficult to keep current.\n\nIt also taught me to have a **strategy** on both the **upside run** and to manage **downside risk** (if any drops by \\~15% I am out but will watch).

Did lower interest rates help with people being able to afford homes in a time when people were looking to move out from cities due work from home? Of course, but to put this all on the FED, I just don’t agree with it. Stocks reached record highs in large part due to record corporate profits that came as a result of the stimulus. Even if the FED raises to 2%, that’s still historically considered “expansionary,” and in fact if you look at the interest rate fallacy that Milton Friedman first spoke of, low interest rates are typically a sign of tight monetary conditions and higher rates indicate looser monetary conditions and this lines up with what’s happening. Government printed a bunch of money, rates are now going up. Also, check out this article if you think QE is so expansionary: https://www.ibtimes.com/banks-have-received-23-trillion-quantitative-easing-are-lending-less-small-businesses-1468848 it can even tighten credit due to the FED flooding banks with bank reserve assets due to regulatory leverage ratios.\n\nLet's see what Milton said about interest rates:\n“As an empirical matter, low interest rates are a sign that monetary policy has been tight — in the sense that the quantity of money has grown slowly; high interest rates are a sign that monetary policy has been easy — in the sense that the quantity of money has grown rapidly. The broadest facts of experience run in precisely the opposite direction from that which the financial community and academic economists have all generally taken for granted. \n“Paradoxically, the monetary authority could assure low nominal rates of interest — but to do so it would have to start out in what seems like the opposite direction, by engaging in a deflationary monetary policy.”\n–Milton Friedman, “The Role Of Monetary Policy,” 1968\n\nThe easy money has come from Federal Government spending and that's why rates are going up now ^\n\nAnd let's see here what a study found on QE: \n“Our results indicate that, at least for this stylized model, both intuitions are correct.  In the base case in which reserve balances increase, all interest rates decline and loans decline.  When reserves are excluded from the leverage ratio, both interest rates and loans decline by less. In another case in which loans increase when reserves are added, excluding reserves from the leverage ratio again results in a lesser decline in interest rates, but in this case, loans increase by more.  In general, excluding reserves from the leverage ratio lessens the tendency for QE to reduce credit availability, but it also dampens the interest rate reduction caused by QE.”\nhttps://bpi.com/does-excluding-reserves-from-the-leverage-ratio-make-quantitative-easing-more-effective-more-yes-than-no/\nhttps://bpi.com/does-excluding-reserves-from-the-leverage-ratio-make-quantitative-easing-more-effective-more-yes-than-no/\n\nBank reserves are not excluded from leverage ratios in the USA", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ya fair enough.
