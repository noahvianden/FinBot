You're talking entirely about growth of various metrics: assets, revenues etc\n\nI guess that's fine if the growth resumes AND the market continues to prefer growth and mostly ignore profitability, but what if it doesn't?\n\nBased on what's happening to other stocks, it seems that the market has become skeptical about growth, so multiples are shrinking. That's bad for growth stocks and especially bad for very large ones like AMZN. Big companies are harder to grow, eventually and the pandemic that goosed AMZN sales is now mostly over, making comps tougher.\n\nThe reason value investors focus on profitability is that growth is both hard to sustain and hard to predict. Some folks here and on Wall Street take comfort in the supposed rigour of DCF analysis, but those are inevitably just a big stack of assumptions about growth.\n\nAmazon is huge and dominant, but outside AWS, it's never been very profitable. CEO Bezos is famous for insisting that just getting bigger was the answer and for a long time, he looked right, because AMZN was taking over the world and anybody who balked about its profitability ratios missed the giant run up that made him the world's richest man.\n\nUltimately, making money should matter, as expressed by things like net earnings margin, ROE,  ROA etc. \n\nThe good news is that there isn't too much net debt relative to cash flow, but net profit margin is under 5%, slightly better than a grocery store. Without AWS, that would be much worse, so is spinning off AWS realistic?

I'm not saying AMZN should trade like a grocery stock, just that it's still super expensive.\n\nPeter Lynch would say five year earnings growth should be about equal to PE at fair value, yielding a PEG of 1, and recommends finding PEGs below 1.\n\n PEG is imperfect because, like DCF, it depends on estimated growth,  but AMZN's PEG is between 1.3 and 2.7, according to Yahoo Finance and Finviz, who obviously assume different growth rates. Again, not cheap.\n\nROE is decent at over 15% but not stellar.

So whether you hold or not depends on your conviction and what your time window is. \n\nAbout timing: While tech is likely to continue to drop more as the fed makes the next few rate hikes, you have to start looking at whether best of breed tech stocks are going to start bottoming out (which they will before the sector as a whole bottoms out). So one way to approach the decision might be to consider whether you think tech stocks as a whole are close/not close to bottoming. If you think they might be close to bottoming, consider whether you think best of breed stocks are starting to break out from the other stocks that are still falling, and if so, whether AMZN is one of those best of breed stocks.\n\nSo my answer is I personally would not sell unless you can’t afford for it to drop further, unless I wanted to sell for tax purposes.

Most businesses ran their own in-house infrastructure for the longest time.  This required significant upkeep of time and money.  For many reasons (e.g. increase in hardware capabilities), it became easier/smarter/cost-effective to host infrastructure in remote datacenters, thus businesses could offload their IT to third parties. Now, when we say everything is in the cloud, it means that data, applications, networking, etc. are partitioned all across the globe in various data centers.  There are many ways cloud services bring value to their customers, and each of the cloud services have tried to carve out target audiences.\n\nB2B (business-to-business) as opposed to B2C (business-to-customer) are transactions conducted strictly between businesses rather than directly with the customer.

{"title": "America is running out of baby formula because 3 companies (ABT, RBGLY, and NSRGY) control the market and babies aren’t that profitable", "selftext": "https://fortune.com/2022/05/14/baby-formula-shortage-milk-monopoly-fda/\n\nA baby formula shortage gripping the U.S. since March has parents in a panic over where and when they’ll be able to find the products they need to feed their kids. The out-of-stock rate, representing the amount of formula that’s not in stock compared to what’s typically available, was 43% for the week ending May 8, according to Datasembly, a provider of real-time product data for retailers and consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands.  With no easy end in sight, caregivers nationwide have been forced to devote their free time to driving between stores in search of formula, prompting retailers to limit the number of cans customers can buy. Others have turned to Facebook groups and informal support networks to acquire the nutritional products that work best for their kids.  “I've looked online, I have my mom in Boston looking, my mother-in-law in Florida looking,” Elyssa Schmier previously told Fortune about her trouble finding formula for her 8-month-old son. “Everyone we know is looking for us and no one can find it.”\n\nHow did a baby formula crisis spring up in one of the world’s richest countries? Experts say a recall by one of the industry’s largest manufacturers, persistent supply-chain issues, and a market dominated by only a few players have combined to form what one consumer goods expert calls a “perfect storm” affecting the supply of essential formula to millions of babies across the U.S. And the shortage could last for months. \n\nHere’s how we got here. The baby formula market exists as a shared monopoly, with only a few manufacturers controlling nearly all supply. Abbott had an approximately 43% market share a decade ago, according to a USDA report from 2011 — the most recent number available. Little has changed since then. The company still maintains exclusive provider contracts in many states with WIC, the USDA’s supplemental nutrition program for low-income families, which makes up nearly half of formula sales nationwide. A few other manufacturers, including Mead-Johnson and Nestlé, also have WIC contracts and control the rest of the market.  In addition to its highly concentrated structure, the baby formula market is difficult for another reason. Its demand is set by the nation’s birth rate, and the market has been shrinking for years. The number of births has declined every year since 2008, except for 2014, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. With only a few key players whose capacities are tied to a shrinking market, repercussions are inevitable when anything gets in the way of a certain product getting to store shelves. Other manufacturers are bound to struggle with an influx of new demand from consumers who can’t get what they’d typically buy. “The dilemma [manufacturers] have is that it's not a very lucrative market,” says Patrick Penfield, a professor of supply chain management at Syracuse University. “The only way you can grow your market share is if you’re aggressively going after competition.”  Because Abbott is one of the biggest players in the game already, significantly expanding its share is not really an option.  “If you can't grow your market share, then you look at how you can reduce costs,” says Penfield. “And sometimes when you reduce the costs, you may not have the right protocols or procedures in place to make sure that you're doing things properly.” “I’m not saying that's what Abbott Laboratories did,” he cautions. “But that would be an assumption of mine.”\n\nAbbott is not the only entity possibly at fault. “There's plenty of blame to go around here,” says Scott Faber, a professor at Georgetown University’s law center and vice president of government affairs at Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit aimed at empowering consumers. Faber sees the FDA itself as in part responsible for the shortage. The agency, he says, did not react fast enough to the whistleblower report and should have conducted a plant inspection sooner. “When a drunk driver causes a car crash, the drunk driver bears much of the blame, but so does the bartender who looked the other way while serving one too many drinks,” he says. When submitting the report for the record last month, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) wrote: “I am equally concerned that the FDA reacted far too slowly to this report. The report was submitted to the FDA on Oct. 20, 2021. The FDA did not interview the whistleblower until late December 2021. According to news reports, FDA did not inspect the plant in person until Jan. 31, 2022, and the recall was not issued until Feb. 17, 2022.” The agency did not finish its inspection and issue observations to Abbott until March 18. The company says that it has been working since then to update its education and training protocols as well as its cleaning and maintenance procedures. “The FDA would not have shut down that factory if they didn’t find anything. So there's definitely some type of noncompliance that's going on,” Penfield says.

{"title": "Zoom is fucked.", "selftext": " \n\nIntroduction: \n\nGreetings again fellow crayon munching friends. I have decided that I will be doing one due diligence at least every two weeks. That being said, feel free to follow me or whatever if you want to make sure to see my short due diligences that are founded upon sleep deprivation, amateur investing knowledge, and way too many energy drinks. In the prior weeks I did Coinbase and Occidental Petroleum so feel free to check those out if you have not seen them. This week I will be conducting due diligence on Zoom. I think Zoom is and has been playing on house money for a while and I hope to give a decent picture of why through many munched paint chips and crayons. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 1: Zoom Financials\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0gb773316kz81.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=c805b9389b1ba5db0d4a5aa6e080eb8df833ea84\n\nTruthfully, at first glance Zoom’s financials appear pretty solid. Revenues, Net income, operating income, and gross profit all appear healthy, with solid growth the last few years. Revenue’s YoY growth for zoom is 55% from 2021-2022. Gross Profit’s YoY growth for zoom is 66% from 2021-2022. Operating income’s YoY growth is 61% for the same years and net income’s YoY growth is 105%. This appears to be explosive growth on Zoom’s part but I believe these numbers are misleading.\n\nOne reason is that despite the explosive YoY growth for the above financials, Zoom’s Operating Expenses for sales, general, and administrative expenses, also grew at 61% YoY. Simply put, how good is that 61% YoY growth for operating income given that sales, general, and administrative expenses grew by the same percentage YoY. I could certainly be wrong here but in my opinion, a company like Zoom should be able to post lower YoY growth for sales, general, and administrative expenses. It is Zoom after all, their business model involves far fewer physical assets and variable costs. Therefore, I am skeptical of this massive growth in sales, general, and administrative expenses, I do not think it bodes well for their long (or short) term business prospects. \n\nHow does Zoom make money anyone may ask, after all I did not really know, so after a brief Google search using my hairy ape hands, I found out how. \n\nEssentially, all of Zoom’s cash flows come from subscription fees, hardware sales, advertising, and investments into other startups. This is important to note as I transition into my next point. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 2: Loss of market share\n\nZoom has made a killing financially by the stranglehold they had on the video conference market as the world was sent into a tailspin from COVID-19. However, this market dominance has dwindled as time has passed as Google Meets has taken over.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rdeyx4l46kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a3b1fb70c1ec4843cf61178331889d794a60129\n\nGoogle Meets currently has 2,747,358 total customers compared to Zoom’s 168,892. Google Meets has a market share of 84.82% of the total video conference market compared to Zoom’s paltry 5.21%. One thing that should be noted with these metrics (assuming they are accurate), is that they do not show the customer list themselves. For example, if Zoom manages to build strong customer relationships, and large companies with thousands of meetings a month choose Zoom over Google, it is okay for Zoom to have far less customers and therefore market share so long as they can keep them. However, I do not see why this would be the case. \n\nAfter all, pull out the orange crayon and take a bite, talk to your wife, your wife’s boyfriend, some random college kid on enough caffeine to kill a horse and ponder what could possibly cause such a thing. Nothing. The answer is nothing. Zoom’s success spawned from a video conference service that offered better ease of use, as well as high quality audio and video output. In the beginning this was lovely as everyone else, including Google, was late to the party. Unfortunately for Zoom though consumers have become more educated and are now flocking to the better products. On top of that more competitors have entered the market and Google Meets puts Zoom to shame. Zoom’s competitive advantage disappeared quicker than the fifth of whiskey in my hand watching the markets last week. Zoom will continue to lose market share to the superior product offered by Google as Google has more talent and money than Zoom. Google will continue to come out on top in this market and will crush Zoom’s share price in the process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ca3yju66kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbb9dfd571fb06e8f86be0a8008b6a8ffb42d662\n\nSource: \n\n[https://www.slintel.com/tech/video-conferencing/g-suite-market-share](https://www.slintel.com/tech/video-conferencing/g-suite-market-share)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 3: COVID Caused Conferences are becoming less frequent\n\nAs time goes on and the world continues to emerge from the pandemic, the need for the very service Zoom provides will continue to decline. This tends to be a big deal when the entirety of Zoom’s cash flows come from subscription fees, hardware sales, advertising, as well as investments into startups. Nearly all of Zoom’s cash flows are tied to people using their platform. Cash flows are going to continue to decrease and this will spell disaster for Zoom’s financials in the future thereby crushing the stock price in the process. Personally, I go to a university that went full red coat, commie, CCP, North Korea on all of us students and even at my university we are now completely transitioning back to in person courses next semester. While my personal experience is not statistically significant and is by no means an end all be all predictor for this stuff, I do believe it matters when speaking to friends from other colleges who also are completely back in person full time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 4: Earnings will be a disaster (May 23, after market close)\n\nFor all of the things listed above, I believe that earnings will be an abysmal shitshow. Like the first time we all were rejected by the girl of our dreams, Zoom shareholders are in for a ride on the pain train. The loss of market share from Google and the emergence of the global economies from the pandemic will cause earnings to miss by a wide margin, causing one of those glorious (for us gay bears) massive red dildos in after hours. Then we can sell our puts May 24th and make some easy money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwt47g796kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f0287cfb6eb2c8ad3da29c7dc4dd174c319901a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 5: ARKK is bullish on it\n\nThis is mostly a joke… mostly. Seriously though Cathie has 8.09% of ARKK in Zoom and that is good enough for me to dislike the stock. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6bvzpjva6kz81.png?width=299&format=png&auto=webp&s=336177a4bd5cc300f53bf5190627e8c80a6af1ea\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 6: Cramer likes the stock.\n\nI am going to repeat myself here. Cramer. Likes. The. Stock. This may be my strongest point. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5tvpr2c6kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=643ba70a64a1c66c09e61d64cd05c4ee13408a3f\n\nYes this article is from January 26, 2022, but as much of a joke as this is, Cramer really has been a solid leading indicator for what not to do. \n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/26/jim-cramer-these-hard-hit-stocks-now-look-cheap-enough-to-buy.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/26/jim-cramer-these-hard-hit-stocks-now-look-cheap-enough-to-buy.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 7: Jerome Powell grows a pair\n\nSeriously though, if Powell raises interest rates by 75 basis points (or more), the entirety of the stock market will take a massive shit. After all, look at what happened when the Fed announced a 50 bps increase that was already expected by the markets. We have been crushed in equity markets in the weeks since. Where does a high growth technology company like Zoom stand if this happens? I of course do not have the exact answer but I think it is worth noting that this is a possibility and a more likely one now given the horrid CPI data that still came in hotter than expected. Powell reiterated in a recent interview to Marketplace that half-point hikes are likely in June and July. This is not all that surprising but what is chilling to me is that he also stated “we’re prepared to do more if needed” in that same interview. That is ominous and clearly shows while it may be unlikely, higher than forecasted rate hikes are on the table. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wab087gd6kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=30750816d9f9cf501363b1ea3f40f42c50ed371f\n\nSource: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-12/powell-reiterates-half-point-hikes-are-likely-in-june-and-july](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-12/powell-reiterates-half-point-hikes-are-likely-in-june-and-july)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere I can be wrong:\n\n1. It is entirely possible that the Fed does not raise rates in June and July which would create some serious headwinds for my bearish position.\n2. Zoom creates or adapts their software in such a way that consumers transition back to it.\n3. I am flat out wrong about earnings. Conversely, I am correct but it does not matter and for some god forsaken reason Zoom rips harder than a college kid on their dab pen.\n4. The demand for Zoom conferences remains constant at its current place, or increases.\n5. Any other incredible occurrence occurs, \\*insert famous fuck here\\* buys a 10% stake in Zoom, Covid variant sigma causes a shutdown for much of the economy, etc…\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL; DR \n\nZoom makes money from people utilizing their platform. As we emerge from COVID that need declines which will crush cash flows leading to a massive earnings miss on May 23rd. Cathie and Cramer like the stock. Powell raises rates (more than expected) causing a recession that makes Volcker’s rate increases and subsequent recession look like peanuts. All of this considered, Zoom share price will be curb stomped harder than me when I am just trying to enjoy a casual match of Warzone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition: \n\n2 ZM $95 P 6/17", "id": "upx6v7", "created_utc": 1652585151.0, "score": 447, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 329, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|103|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ug4yda/coinbase_is_going_into_the_toilet/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/upx05n/zoom_is_fucked/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/upx6v7/zoom_is_fucked/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=upx6v7)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=upx6v7)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "as someone in saas sales from nvidia. zoom will never leave the business world / software & tech industry. partnered w/ some of them too… but hey, this is a bear market it’s prolly going down anyway😁", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I don’t buy that Google Meets has that much usage.
