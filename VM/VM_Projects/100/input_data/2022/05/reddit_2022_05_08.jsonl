But I honestly think that at the end of the day the Apple car project will be nothing but a giant waste of money that will probably never return any kind of profit. I mean, consider this:\n\n* There's a lot of new EV companies out there, but only 1 of them has ever achieved consistent profitability, Tesla, and it took them well over 10+ years to do that. \n\n* Apple is jumping into the EV market very late. They don't even have a single car factory, they haven't even announced a car model that they'll bring to the market in the distant future. The competition meanwhile that previously ignored EV's is collectively throwing in tens of billions of dollars into EV/battery research each year. Point being by the time Apple is finally ready to bring an EV to market there will be a ton more competition in the space then there is today.\n\n* Apple's brand is realistically not going to help them much at selling cars. Tesla's brand is already basically the Apple of the car space, in that they get a ton of free advertising in social media, and people see them as the #1 premium EV automaker. If the average person wants the best EV they'll probably look at Tesla, just as if someone wants the best smartphone they'll probably look at Apple because of their reputation in that space. This point goes back to the 2nd point somewhat, in that Apple's brand would have been a lot more helpful at selling cars if they hadn't given Tesla such a huge head start now that they're selling several hundred thousand cars a quarter.\n\nAbout the only way I can see the Apple car division ever returning a profit for investors in a reasonable time period is if Apple can solve level 5 self driving multiple years before anyone else.

I just think FSD is a long time away. What's more possible is if the external environment is modified to a standard for ML to recognize. \n\nfor example, roads were built to facilitate the modern car. now electronic signals or visual cues can be built on top of roads and in future cars to allow autonomous driving to happen, which also means autonomous driving can only happen in defined regions like cities and not in the wild.\n\nI think that's one way autonomous driving can happen.

{"title": "The fear is becoming overwhelming", "selftext": "\"Don't fight the Fed\".\n\nI'm sure we've all heard this multiple times in the past 10+ years. Whenever the market grinded higher, despite whatever had caused it to go down initially, people would say \"Don't fight the Fed.\"\n\nNow, the Fed is reversing its easy money policy, raising interest rates, and starting QT. So if the logic remains the same, should we not fight the Fed? Instead of buy the dips, it seems like we should sell the rips.\n\nThe market environment is completely different from the past decade+. For the first time in a long, long time, we have inflation that isn't going away.\n\n1. The war in Ukraine is exacerbating food and fuel inflation. Even if the war stops tomorrow, inflation won't just magically go down. It will take months to play out.\n2. Supply chains are still messed up. China has locked down major cities like Shanghai, and their 0 tolerance policy on Covid doesn't seem to be changing any time soon. This is also worsening the inflation issue.\n3. The Fed has no choice but to raise interest rates. The economy is still \"strong\" and unemployment is low, so they will keep raising until something changes.\n4. Beyond raising interest rates, they are also starting QT, effectively sucking money out of the system (the opposite of QE).\n\nWe haven't had a situation like this before. \"This time is different\". The fear is palpable, and I know many people don't know what to do right now. I'm not sure how this situation reverses itself any time soon. There's too much contagion in financial markets.\n\nIs this the start of a secular bear market like we saw from 1966 - 1982, or 2000 - 2009? How does this situation get better from here? I'm just not seeing it.\n\n**EDIT:** I would also like to add, I am a firm believer that the stock market has an intrinsic value, and it can go up without the Fed printing money or setting interest rates lower. The problem is, without Fed intervention, I don't see why P/E ratio's should be higher than 15x on the S&P (Assuming interest rates above 3% - which the 10Y is already at). This is the historical average. \n\nFor 2022, EPS estimates for the S&P this year are around 240. So 240 x 15 P/E = S&P 3600. This is assuming no recession. If we get a recession and EPS comes in at 200, then we could easily be looking at S&P 3000 or lower.", "id": "ul52k9", "created_utc": 1652026381.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "My portfolio is down ~10% but I’m glad that my portfolio, mainly GOOGL and MSFT, consists of my favorite companies.

This tendency is already ingrained in the US education system and it takes several months of training to shake it of on new recruits. This is particularly bad in R&D, my  secondary field, because of its intrinsic nature nobody can brake up an unknown solution in \"tasks\", nor really develop a solution in a vacuum without other aspects of the problem, outside the proper area of expertise,   the guys popping up in your office with random product related questions... \n\n2) Greatly reduces team cohesion, empathy and overall team efficiency, basically having a lot, a mean one order of magnitude more, integration issues. Everybody hides behind  \"I have done my task\" but nobody takes ownership of the product not working or not even progressing.\n\n3) Pro activity and leadership in the team has basically disappeared, the collective power of many minds working together has been replaced by a loosely define \"common direction\" with nobody really buying in a collective solution for the product.\n\n4) Mentoring is GONE! we specifically required all our more senior and brilliant people to engage in mentoring much younger, out of school, employees. Pretty much the answer from  teleworking has been the preparation of some standard package, once and for all, from the mentor and the same package been fed to any different trainee. This does not work for so many reasons, starting from imposing mentor bias on the new minds (we hire them because we bet on their own innovation capability not to curb or mold their innovation to the mentor one), to not recognizing very faint voices of brilliant solutions from , yes, introvert new hires.\n\n5)  Introvert excuse. I am sick and tired of association between being introvert and the advantage of working from remote. I have been dealing with introvert brilliant people for 40 years, to the point that we consider it as a clear sign of great potentials. We protect and nurse this IN THE OFFICE, with proper spaces and arrangements of the workspaces by \" attitude\" and gently encouraging the most introvert to recognize their own empowerment during meeting and discussions. We value power of ideas and solutions not laud voices or quirk jokes, establish that once and for all and introvert people will bloom.\n\n6) I know that my case may not be the standard for big corporate, but is surely the MOST common in all the R&D I have been exposed to or interacted with. After reading the title, my fist reaction was calling apple director of AI excuse for leaving BS\\^3. You do not get to that position without the capability of leading a team of brilliant introverts, without focusing on product instead of tasks, and without a good understanding of the need to interact with your team through multiple levels, including personal.  \n\nMost likely the Work-Life balance for the person went on a different direction after starting teleworking, and he/she recognized a shift in priorities. Fine and good but has nothing to do with the telework issue in general.  Just to be clear, telework is a TOOL a very good tool to balance a team and make it more efficient, BUT IS NOT, by a long shot the path to greater company productivity.

We use cloud based design notebooks with engineering mathematics plugins that let the whole team check the work and reference the results of a teammate's work in their own calculations.

We are doing the full stack, but the GUI is all in a mobile app, which is a different team, so our firmware subteam interfaces with the mechanical design through myself and the PCB designer, and follow a pretty traditional remote agile workflow.\n\nThe team has been through two product inception processes. In both cases the concept existed already and the question was \"what would it take to make something that can do X?\". Both products were step-change improvements on already existing solutions, so most of the functional requirements were well understood, but there was a clean sheet for architecture and design. \n\nAs for price point, costing is something that is baked into the product design from the beginning... Manufacturing cost estimates are pulled from the model and update my costing estimates in real time, and we do design competitions between various manufacturing methods for every component in the design that score on sustainability as well as manufacturing cost. With so much of the BOM cost being PCB components, there is also a strong emphasis on making the design around the PCB highly parametric, so that when we inevitably find a component is suddenly skyrocketing in price, we can quickly reevaluate the mechanical, thermal, and EMI design around a new power regulator, or capacitor form factor, or microprocessor. Currently, our physical design is pretty much done unless changes are needed, so  the mechanical engineers are spending time researching component datasheets for the PCB designer, with the goal of prequalifying drop-in replacement alternative components😂 \n\nAs for training, initial training is job shadowing over video call with screen sharing. All the tools we use have good tutorials, and most of the team has already run though them before they started. After that, it is realtime mentorship and coaching.  I think the most important aspect for us has been having everyone working in shared environments, where both the process and results of everyone's work is visible to the rest of the team... A poorly parametrized model that breaks as soon as the design around it changes is immediately obvious to everyone, but at the same time, a new team member trying to ensure their model doesn't break has lots of examples to look at for reference of how to do it right.

In my example the 1k shares after a reverse split COULD end up worth $30k, which is $30/share, meaning that the reverse split share price would have been 1/5 of $30 or $6. $6 x 5k shares = $30k. Reverse splitting at 1 share for every 5 shares currently in existence will get you 1k shares. 1k shares at $30 = $30k. 10 contracts are less than 50 contracts.

While some of you are free of this criticism, I do feel that the vast majority of comments are vile, gross, misogynistic, and ignorant. People hate her for the wrong reasons, and that’s more about your sad lot in life than about her being a bad money manager. \n\nShe’s an entitled suburban career finance professional who said she started ARK because the Holy Spirit told her to. She donates a ton of money to conservative causes. She’s arrogant, self aggrandizing, and apparently her #1 supporter is going to federal pound-him-in-the-ass prison for racketeering. None of that is cool with me. In many ways, Cathie is the opposite of who I want to be rooting for. \n\nBut this sub isn’t about politics or personality. It’s about motherfucking money. So let’s break this down. \n\nShe puts a lot of money down on speculative shit. \n\nShe doubles down on her choices when other people tell her that’s she’s nuts.\n\nShe either wins big or she loses big. \n\n…. So far, sounds a lot like this group of degenerates.\n\nListen, she can personally go fuck herself sideways with her anti-choice donor checks, but her concept is legit. ARK was and is innovative. It did and will make those with the risk tolerance and patience to stomach it very rich. \n\nThey publish buys and sells every day. You can buy into ARK funds or just cherry pick what you want. \n\nThe have an email every time anything goes up or down 15% or more, explaining what they think happened. \n\nThey have newsletters and a very interesting and informative podcast. \n\nTheir research teams are specialized. The people looking into genomics companies really know what the fuck they’re talking about. The people looking at AI really know what the fuck they’re taking about. \n\nThe only ones here who doesn’t know what the fuck they’re talking about is you. \n\nBitch and moan about how “her funds are 7,0000000% down from ATH”. True. Because her fund was up 150% when S&P was up 15%. The signature fund ARKK is up more in 5 years than VTI or SPY. And, this bear market has more to with how stupid the accelerated market growth was in the last several years, the logistics nightmare the COVID pandemic caused, and goddamned Putin’s war against Ukraine than it does Cathie being good or bad at her job. \n\nBut but but “she got lucky with Tesla! If it wasn’t for TSLA she wouldn’t have anything!” \n\nShut the fuck up already dude. We’re all looking for that one magic stock to pop. That’s why we have YOLO flair. She YOLO’d into Tesla and she was right. Good. P.S. You can’t bitch about Cathie AND Elon. Choose one. \n\nShe’s also said since day one that these were tech, growth companies. Both tech and growth are inherently highly volatile. That’s the deal. \n\nSo, I’m summary, you’re either an ignorant asshole who doesn’t know a goddamned thing about how this shit works, or you’re a sexist prick who never gets laid without your fleshlight, or you’re just a curmudgeonly misanthrope who will never be happy as long as someone is living the life you were too cowardly or dumb to live yourself.\n\nSo yeah, I don’t like her.

{"title": "The Current State of the Market", "selftext": "Three ingredients required for a bear market according to Marty Zweig- extreme overvaluation of equities, an inverted yield curve, and extreme deflation.\n\nClearly we had (and still to an extent have) 1, but this still looks like a valuation reset and not a precursor to a major recession. \n\nObviously this has been one hell of a correction but the idea that a correction is always 5-10% was always idiotic in the first place.\n\nPersonally I don’t subscribe to the standard “a bear market is any decline over 20%” thinking. A real bear market precedes a recession. A correction brings multiples inline with earnings and sentiment to a normalized level while the economy remains in tact. To me that’s the difference.\n\nBoth multiples and sentiment tend to overshoot to the downside in a correction. A major clue that we hadn’t bottomed in January on that initial 1,000 point down day on the Dow was that people were smugly saying things like “ this is what capitulation looks like.” No. True capitulation isn’t recognizable because it’s not just irrational people panicking, it’s you panicking.\n\nEvery correction is different. Given the insane run of the prior two years this one had to be much larger in magnitude to get people bearish and actually reset valuations.\n\nI’m still not convinced hiking rates from 0 to 1.5-2% is going to be enough to sink the economy at least in the near term and the bond market seems to agree.\n\nCould the correction continue? Sure. Like I said previously, stocks in some areas are still very expensive. As many have noted, the historic trailing P/E on the S&P is close to 15 and it currently stands at close to 23. There are no iron clad rules, though, and the fact that most of the megacap tech stocks still trade well above this level and comprise an outsized percentage of the S&P will distort that figure.\n\nBut whether you believe this is going to be an extended bear market a la 1929 or 1973-74 or just a giant, scary correction a la 1962 or 1987 depends entirely upon whether you think a major recession is imminent and I just don’t see compelling evidence that that’s the case.\n\nNo, simply saying the fed is hiking rates and inflation is going to continue to rage at 8%+ and we are definitely going into recession isn’t enough. That’s just speculation based on Zero Hedge articles. You’ve got to look at the short end of the yield curve which continues to track the fed perfectly and has not signaled any alarms yet.\n\nAs for the market and all of the volatility\nwe saw last week. That is sometimes what a bottom looks like after a major decline. Check a chart of October-December of 1987 as the market tested and retested the lows until it finally bounced. A very similar thing happened after the 1962 crash as well when the market crashed around June but didn’t bottom right around the June lows until October. That’s very likely where we are. A major crash from these levels seems highly improbable and some stocks look very cheap.\n\nAfter the covid crash all anybody talked about was the imminent “retest of the lows.” Rest assured when everyone is looking for the same technical level It’s not going to happen. Now? I haven’t heard a single person call this merely a retest of the lows. Most everyone I read buys into the runaway inflation/recession narrative hook, line and sinker and assumes we’re going a lot lower before we go back up. But if you pull back a chart of most indices a retest is exactly what this looks like.\n\nMake no mistake- despite what the S&P and Dow look like we’ve already experienced a crash far worse than most others in many areas. The way the bottom opened up for the most loved and most over inflated growth stocks over the past three months cannot be overstated. Facebook went from $320 to $180 in six weeks. Stop talking about the impending crash. If you didn’t already short these stocks, you missed it.\n\nGiven the underlying strength in the economy and the damage done to sentiment already which is likely to have a short term effect on inflation itself (by doing nothing more than talking, the fed has taken mortgage rates from 3% to 6% in four months), it seems more likely than people think that the fed pulls off a soft landing and some balance is restored between supply and demand.", "id": "ukv7d0", "created_utc": 1651988862.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|24|**First Seen In WSB**|4 years ago\n**Total Comments**|1542|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|11 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ukv7d0)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ukv7d0)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Time to buy.

As the largest purchaser of bonds starts to step out of the market (lowering demand for bonds), yields are bound to rise\n\nFurthermore, we’ve also seen something else rising: breakeven rates. Breakeven rates = normal treasury yields - inflation protected treasury yields. One of the principal goals of the fed is to have long term breakeven rates “anchored” at 2%. That’d be the market saying “if I’m not getting inflation-protected securities, I’d be cool with only 2% extra”. Implying that the fed’s curbing inflation to a healthy 2%.

Because the fed is under a microscope as the only thing people seem to follow, it’s lost its predictive power. The fed has been telegraphing its every move for the better part of four years which means now the markets move in advance of what they do. This selloff really began last November. Now that the fed has moved twice, markets are already down 20% and much more in many areas.

There’s an *underlying* relationship between position and momentum (nonzero commutator), and that *underlying* relationship gives rise to the uncertainty principle. Not observers\n\nWhich ties in well to this conversation. Yes, the current fed doesn’t surprise the market, so the market knows about hikes ahead of time. But there’s an *inherent* relationship between the fed funds rate and company performances. We can see this reflected in some of the ludicrously bad earnings reports we’ve seen.

Glad you took my advice and sold your profits and losses in exit liq rally, which i told you.  \n>  \n>Traders, I hate you because I am losing money guys. This environment is so hard for trading, hence i am \"jealous of you guys\" who are making money this way up and down.   \n>  \n>Long term investors or passive investors, there is nothing much to say, y’all. Keep “HoDLing” and “Buy the dip” as usual.  \n>  \n>Short term investors “ You’re screwed”.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreeting aside, today I am not here to discuss or brag about how I was right every single time in the past. Today we will discuss that one chart that is bothering me. It's not the first one, so take a chill pill and calm down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But first we shall discuss that one little mistake that I made this week.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mistake 1](https://preview.redd.it/hmroq1ann8y81.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaa358d9be6916df527303ccc0cc199aa223cbf8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mistake 2](https://preview.redd.it/nm8yog0rn8y81.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=89cb3b1cce08c1a0eabb5f80dc6d01c7ae449a77)\n\nI presumed that we would go up for 2-3 days after the 50bps hike, but to everyone's surprise the rally lasted for just one day.\n\nHere’s the explanation for why that happened over this week. So lets rewind a bit.\n\nJ Powell as usual, did what was best for everybody. He finally raised the 50bps, which, to be honest, everyone was expecting, but some guys on twitter and on cnbc had the balls to say no, he would not do that. Powell is still gonna go for 25bps and will U-turn soon. \n\nGuys don't trust these bunch of noobs who got into stocks just after the pandemic. Tbh, I did too, but at least I know my history and we always talk about things like how it all feels mix of “Stagflation of 1970s” and “1939 rate hike”. Also afterwards, 1 or 2 yrs we will witness “Forgotten Depression of 1921”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So what happened to Markets. Why did it go up and then come crashing down?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FED pump and dump scheme. We got what we expected hike.](https://preview.redd.it/uf9eidxgo8y81.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b99faa5f12603cd8716e141f37fbbf1068c0d3f)\n\nJust like the CPI, when some number comes to expectation, then we have a short lived rally and then we eventually fall because people take profits and reassess the upcoming data. That will be CPI on 11th May. \n\nAlso, don't forget the May 9 pain that is coming tomorrow. “Buy at the sound of cannons and sell at trumpets rally is almost over”. We are back to where we started in Feb-March 2022.\n\nKudos to everyone who rode the rally up and down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So what’s next?**\n\nTo be honest, I have just one idea in the short term for bulls and one long term idea for bears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>First, we shall talk about the short one.   \n>  \n>It’s called “Exp 75bps but actual 50bps” rally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Market expects 75bps but FED will go 50bps.](https://preview.redd.it/hjfea06fq8y81.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e000e20cc0133f0834759cd3a02ac0948c174d7)\n\nSo what is this rally. It says that before the FOMC of June the market will go down and bottom one day before the FOMC cause, it has started to price the 75bps as FED has lost all credibility. So if FED went with 50bps we will go up like “Exp 50bps but got 25bps” rally of March 16th FOMC. This rally, in my opinion, will be as strong as that rally of march. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The second idea is for the bears.  \n>  \n>It says “SPX 200wMA is coming by december 2022 or earlier” but careful of bounce from \"100wMA\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Target : FED 200wMA rate hike](https://preview.redd.it/pe1pp7fwp8y81.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ce8a3235a4f0f9013a315e8e1414d5894bb7e6)\n\nYes guys look at the past 2018 cycle. If FED funds future went 2% by EOY, we will be touching this 200wMA. So max pain is somewhere around that FED rate. And on the December FOMC we will see if the FED  U-turns or not. Before that, there is no U-turn. Get this through your thick heads and repeat with me. \"Powell wont Uturn before December FOMC\". Good job!\n\n We learned two great ideas today which were so simple and are easy to play with options. So have fun making tons of money and applying it with your technicals.\n\n.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finally, now lets discuss the thing that is bothering me. It's a theoretical idea. Man, this idea was so easy that no one saw it. Lets discuss!**\n\nReference chart : Dow Jones since its the oldest chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bonds and Stocks getting hammered together.](https://preview.redd.it/k7in11xyq8y81.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5973a8d9a77c64768cb82622f985412ae51fb7f)\n\nPt 1 : Whenever inflation is above 4% bonds and stocks get hammered together. So, from now we are going to be \"Risk off Risk off\" or \"Risk on Risk on\" environment. ( This we discussed technically in Credit Risk America in CC calculations.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPt 2 : The taylor rule. Let me explain this with an example from the last cycle. If inflation is running at 3.2% and we want the FED inflation target of 2%. We first subtract (3.2-2) i.e. 1.2% and then double it. That is the rate we have to increase to fight inflation, hence FED raised 2.4% FED funds rate last time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Dow Jones Chart : 1950-1990](https://preview.redd.it/x55jzqz9r8y81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=699538898bf95588e6b987af285e3cc05c37af89)\n\n    \n\n[Dow Jones Chart : 1990-2022](https://preview.redd.it/ateqauher8y81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3c14de5d4fb5266bcc212133746514bd6e02b09)\n\n    But what happens if inflation is running over 4% and not in a range b/w 1-4% like it has been the case post 2008. Well, for that we will study the history of Dow Jones Industrial market and compare it with rate cycle and inflation rate.\n\nTo formulate this I have constructed :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Two white horizontal lines called : 2% inflation rate and a blue line called : 4% inflation rate.\n* I have also divided the market with vertical lines of red, green and yellow color. Red means : Crash in rate liftoff cycle and Green means : Crash in rate cut cycle. Yellow means : Top of rate hike.\n* Numbers such as 1,2,3,4 etc, resemble the rate hike cycle, but its placement to the left or right of yellow line b/w two green or red line suggest the period where crash took place.\n* Blue line chart : Inflation Rate , Orange line chart : Federal Funds Rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult : What we got from this experiment was Rate liftoff cycle crash had inflation rate above 4% and Rate cut cycle crash had inflation rate below 4%. It was only during \"The Great Financial Crisis\" that when inflation rate was above 4% we got a crash of about -50% in the rate cut cycle. Hence why Dr. Michael Burry was early shorting the housing bubble. And we all know, just how much the SEC was sleeping in bed with banks and institutions.\n\nAlso, we can derive that when the FED rate cycle has to deal with inflation above 4% we tend to have crashes in the rate liftoff part, whereas when we need to deal with inflation lower than 4% we tend to have crashes in the rate cut part.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion : Generally the bottom is the 200MMA.  Yes, my friends, 200 monthly moving average in Dow jones Industrial. 4 out of 5 times if inflation was above 5% we visit this number. and the minimum number we get is 50MMA. I can't even imagine hell which is about to come on the SPX or Nasdaq indices. Dow Jones is currently down around -10% so -45% or more to go from the current level maximally (visiting 200MMA) and minimally -12% (visiting 50MMA).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5&#37; interest rate is coming.](https://preview.redd.it/ix1q0z1it8y81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c928419e26872e42a900db2b4ed458e2d2c9a5c)\n\nWhen i found this theory guys, floor began to crumble beneath my feet and hence i went to a bar to have a glass of wine to make myself calm down. Jamie Dimon is such an asshole. He came to Bloomberg's interview before the FED meeting and said “Market can change just like with a snap of my finger XD”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, as Mr Buffet said at the first in person Berkshire conference since 2019 \"Inflation is a swindler\"\n\nWith that in mind lets see how he is looking at charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WILL500\\/USGDP : Still Overvalued he says XD](https://preview.redd.it/m7oc0oumw8y81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=411ef3ca4b8948f4555bb2d73d01746c5ca135cf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo guys pack your bags time to call your family to live with you. Sell your house, you're currently living with your gf or wife now and shift with mom and dad or let mom and dad shift with you. But they won't right XD. The housing market will crumble in Q4. So fast.\n\nHeck, even Indian family live with their mom and dad after marriage. Why can't you guys temporarily to buy the -50% DJI dip later. But don't buy indices, then buy a good strong undervalued company that is too big to fail. Like Tesla ,Google ,Microsoft, Apple and Amazon at pennies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you guys. Love you all. Keep enjoying the time you have left both physically and mentally and stay safe. Do share this post with your friends and comment down below if you have something to say.

The music is going to end.\n\nI don't know how people can look at the stock market going down and think to themselves \"hey looks like the economy is going to go to the shitter.. let's buy a house near the property market peak and hope it will go up higher so we can sell it to a shrinking group of buyers when the recession hits\".", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "In most markets, buying is not cheaper than renting.

Things are quiet for a while then out of nowhere it's $5k for a plumbing project, $15k for a roof project.

This is the value of final investment minus the cost of rent.\n\n\\- Calculated rent cost for 14 years: $160,092.00\n\n\\- Total difference invested over buying for the 14 years: $57,355.38\n\n\\- Calculated final investment: $205,047.66\n\nHomeowner comes out with $32,172.62 profit.  This involves selling the home and is the cost of home at time of sale minus remaining mortgage and total cost paid thus far.\n\n\\- Cost of home: $300,000\n\n\\- Remainder of Mortgage: $50,480.00\n\n\\- Cost of owning: $217,347.38\n\nNow lets take a look at a scenario where the maintenance cost is more realistic.  I own two homes, and my maintenance cost is $165 per month for one, and the other is $185 per month.  This monthly contribution basically calculates the monthly cost of all appliances, floors, roofs, paint, etc. based on their life expectancy.  For example, a fridge cost $1,600, has a life expectancy of 12 years, so the monthly contribution to maintenance would be $11.  Dryer costs $1,000, has a life expectancy of 13 years, so the monthly contribution to maintenance would be $6.41.  I do a lot of the maintenance myself, like installing vinyl flooring, so my numbers are a bit cheaper than average.  To account for this, i'll double the $185 value and estimate a $370 maintenance cost per month.  Which is still overkill because it doesn't cost $1,600 to install a fridge.\n\n*Buying home vs renting single bedroom apartment ($370 maint fee):*\n\nRenter is now negative $26,488.46. This is the value of final investment minus the cost of rent.\n\n\\- Calculated rent cost for 14 years: $160,092.00  \n\\- Total difference invested over buying for the 14 years: $35,415.38  \n\\- Calculated final investment: $133,603.54\n\n  \nHomeowner comes out with $54,012.62 profit.  This involves selling the home and is the cost of home at time of sale minus remaining mortgage and total cost paid thus far.\n\n\\- Cost of home: $300,000  \n\\- Remainder of Mortgage: $50,480.00  \n\\- Cost of owning: $195,507.38\n\nA parametric evaluation of this scenario changing only the maintenance cost finds that the break even between owning and renting is a maintenance cost of $482.19 per month.  At that cost, both the homeowner and renter come out with $35,166.20 each.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nObviously, this is comparing two extreme examples. $70,000-$300,000 is not normal.  My parents bought their house in 1991 for $110,000, and it's now $340,000.  That's less of an increase over 31 years than this home saw in 14. But also, it is not always feasible to live in a one bedroom apartment.  Obviously there is a middle ground where renting is financially more responsible than buying, but there are too many variables to flat out state one is better than the other in all situations. It might just be the case that it's better for you right now.  \n\nLastly, I think your estimated maintenance of $500-$800 per month is not based off anything.  Using that value, I could buy all new appliances every five years, new floors and paint every ten years, a new roof every fifteen years, a yard crew every other weekend, repair my foundation every fifteen years, and rewire my whole house every fifteen years.

I don't think that's a reasonable way to estimate but labor costs vary widely across the country so it could be true in your area. Most homeowners don't have the expertise to be doing significant renovation or maintenance work but diy is one way to skew buying toward making more financial sense.
