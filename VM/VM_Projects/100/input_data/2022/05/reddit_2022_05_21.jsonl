The baby boomers were the biggest generation so far. Most people had 4-7 sibblings per family. In turn they had 2.6 kids or whatever the demographic is. The subsequent generations have been having fewer and fewer kids. This is in large part thanks to industrialization.  \n\nOn a farm every kid can help you make more money by helping out with the farm. Each child is an extra hand and will produce more than they consume.  In modern times children are nothing but an expense. There is nothing to produce for the most part in a household.  \n\nThe biggest generation in history is starting to retire and we simply don't have enough hands to go around.  Japan has been dealing with this problem for years and it's getting worse.  China's population is set to halve by 2030\n\nBecause of this problem you can easily understand why they won't close up the border with Mexico. They are importing extra hands to keep things running.  It makes sense that China is completely locking down their people with their zero covid policies.  Most of their workers are elderly. It's a big problem that will have more severe consequences soon. \n\n1 million mainly elderly and sickly people in a population of 350 million isn't even 1 percent.  It's negligible.  I'm not saying it didn't matter,  but overall they are a drop in the bucket and 1 percent absolutely would not drive wages up. Take one percent of workers out of any factory and it wouldn't drive wages up. If one percent of Tesla workers walked out no one would skip a beat. \n\nIt's a ridiculous argument.  Sight all the facts and figures you want.  When you stop and think about it,  1 percent is nothing.  Personally I believe they are going to tank the economy on purpose. Either way the bottom of the economy will drop out so you have a choice. \n\nChoice 1: tank the economy. If the baby boomers don't have investments they simply have to keep working. Keep them in the game until they simply can't hack it anymore.  This would prevent the economy from flipping on its head and would be a controlled demolition.  Control is better than no control.  \n\nChoice 2: let all the baby boomers retire.  The economy will awash in cash, chasing fewer and fewer resources and labor.  There simply isn't enough labor to go around.  This will not only inflate the dollar wrecklessly. It will drive wages to the moon further driving inflation.  This will spiral out of control as it goes. There are a lot of wealthy people in America and in charge that will do anything they can to keep the value of the dollar. If not they go back to work too. \n\n\nAgain there are bigger problems than covid. Like most you are thinking about the problem superficially.  It's a convenient excuse.  The real problem isn't being talked about. \n\nDo you honestly think the people in charge were too dumb to keep gas prices down? Do you think the fed really is dumb? Because they were very late to raise interest rates if you are paying attention to the economy. The fed has teams of extremely well educated people in charge of the economy.  Nothing happens unless it's meant to. It honestly wouldn't surprise me if covid, the virus that magically got released from a bio lab in China. That America was directly funding,  and had no history of past outbreaks. Was released on purpose to solve the problem of retirement.  \n\n\nWhat do you think?

But not at pre inflation level. These include:\n2.1 Gas prices. Moving forward Russia’s gas are considered toxic now so we’d lost a good chunk of supply there. Even when the Ukraine conflict is over - the world will still have to make an example of Russia as a deterrent for others.\n2.2 With everyone asking for $ 15 hour for blue collar jobs, restaurants have no choice but to raise prices. They are also screwed from the doordashes / ubereats where these guys make fake sites and numbers, run promotions without informing the restaurants, etc. High fees, staffs stretched, worse service to actual dine in customers while charging everyone higher prices.\n2.3 Rents will not go down. Although some now require hybrid, some companies will still support full remote to attract top talents. This means those that moved from HCOL can still stay in LCOL areas and keep the prices high.\n\n3) Supply side on hospitality industry workers are still misaligned with the demand. Airlines need more pilots and attendants to add more flights. Restaurants need to pay more or reduce shifts. Hotels and resorts are charging more but providing lower quality of service at the same time.\n\n4) The cost of capital will be higher, which means less startups will start and / or survive. Raising funds will be a lot tougher, and with potential customers tightening their belts - both in the B2B and B2C space - revenue will be harder to come by. This means layoffs - could be small scale, could be mid scale, could be just a chance to move the lower performers. \n\n5) Supply chain issues are not resolved until China is back close to pre COVID level. Even for items not made in China, they are still the primary contractor that sub contracts to those other countries (Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, etc).  \n\n6) If the market keeps going down, those that are already retired / semi-retired but with portfolio heavy on equities will take significant losses and be forced to go back to the workforce. This will spike the supply of workers while at the same time some companies are reducing headcounts. In this case, wages will stop going up and may even go down for some positions.\n\n7) One of the stocks that I have in my portfolio is WMT, because unless we live in a food desert where our closest accessible “grocery” or “convenience” stores are Dollar General or Dollar Store, we can’t go lower than Walmart. In bad economy, the Target customers will shop at Walmart and the upper end customers will downgrade to Target. Even Walmart and Target revenue and forecast are very somber - as we’ve seen in their double digit stock price drops. When people are tightening their belts to the point that they’re not even shopping at Walmart, that’s a sign things are not going well.\n\n8) If the US Dollar keeps getting stronger. So far this is the case in the last couple of months. This means imports will be cheaper and our exports will be more expensive for other countries. If they impose some sort of tariffs and / or reduce their consumptions on our products, then the companies making those products will see revenue declines - both from volume and currency exchange rate in their books. Again, this means lower numbers and can lead to hiring freezes / layoffs.\n\n9) Roe vs. Wade. I am an independent - I don’t care for either Democrats or Republicans since both are corrupt and bought off by corporate interests anyway here in the US. However, I do think there will be economic ramifications if it is reversed. \n\n10) Subprime borrowers stretched their loans to buy vehicles and pay for necessities as inflation rises. The share of subprime credit cards and loans that are at least 60 days late rose for the eighth successive month in March. Car loan and lease delinquencies have hit record highs, with nearly 9% of subprime borrowers behind on payments by at least 60 days.\n\n11) The unknown: if there’s another spike of powerful COVID variant this winter that requires some sort of restrictions impacting the economy.

You have to look at recessions through a prism of more than just their charts.\n\nWhat is the core problem for Western Europe and U.S.?  Why is there such inflation?\n\nAnd to me it's relatively simple:You cannot tackle greening the entire global power and manufacturing structure while not being willing to extract resources and make things yourself.If you have no will to address core issues they won't be resolved.There is far too much doomsday talk.  Far too much reliance on models.  Far too many people unwilling to work together to address the core issues and rebuild the true manufacturing bases of these countries.  They don't seem to understand that the central banks can't raise rates that much and raising rates have no effect on places that have PROVEN to be bad actors in China and Russia.  They don't care.\n\nWe all need to get real here and realize that rates, at most, will likely hit 2-2.5% basis rate and still the inflation will remain because China decides to lockdown Guangzhou.  Or Russia decides to nuke Ukraine.  These are issues you need to isolate yourself from.  And the security concerns that have been ignored are coming home to roost.\n\nMy personal opinion is that, like COVID, this is not the worst things will get.  It could be climate based.  It could be that China, which is in a pretty awful spot right now, decides that they need to get a bit more aggressive.\n\nAnd no matter what, the E.U. and U.S.A. (and the entire North American continent to be perfectly honest) need to get real about their goals.  The only way to achieve price stability that is lauded would be through the ability to rely on like-minded actors.  It would likely mean positively gigantic deficits.  Building out nuclear plants and solar and wind.  It would mean subsidizing and then phasing in price increases for labor and oversight costs, keeping the inflation train rolling.  But this is the downside of Globalization.  Which can get really, really ugly if food supply lines start failing.  \n\n\nUntil then, we are just waiting for the Fed to flip policy.  This bear market or recession depending on Q2 GDP guidance in June even if Q1 wasn't really negative, has two logical floors: S&P at 3278 (January 2020 pre-COVID), 2789 (2018), 2678 (2019) then it gets REALLY ugly: 1378 in 2008, 865 in 2009.  Which are notable due to the following years including Quantitative Easing's rollout.  \n\n\nSo how deep will this negative action go (because, again, I'm going to point out that we brushed a bear market, but closed Friday above a bear market) and that Q1 was a bit weird in how the GDP number ended up and will likely be revised higher?  \n\n\nMy guess is that the Fed takes a breather after 2 more .50% rate hikes.  That would probably be the bottom.  Remember, again, the Fed doesn't have much head room.  The government isn't cutting spending and alot of the \"surpluses\" are just printed slosh money from 2020 getting taxed back into the system.  I think the S&P ends up for 2022.  I think it hits 5000 at some point in 2023, but the macro remains bad without easy monetary policy as I point out above.

{"title": "Declines in physical adult entertainment discretionary spending as a leading indicator of recession", "selftext": ">When the economy expands or contracts, households re-allocate their budget across various categories of expenditures, which shows expenditure shares decrease for *positional* goods/services and increase for non-positional goods/services during recessions (Kamakura & Du, 2012) \n\nAmong the most sensitive, in my opinion, discretionary spending categories is *physical* adult entertainment services (ex: strip clubs \\[NAICS 581302\\]). A positional good/service is a good/service that conveys a high relative standing within society  (think Rolex, Superbowl tickets, status symbols, lap dances/bottle service, Veblen-pricing, etc.). With the advent of the internet, there are strong *virtual* substitute adult entertainment services, which tend to be cheaper than *physical*, that consumers can flee to when re-balancing their budgets in recessionary conditions. Basically, if a free visit to /r/boobs can fulfill a consumer's primal needs in a similar way to a $200 lap dance in a strip club, consumers will flee to /r/boobs when experiencing recessionary pressures on their budges. Therefore, monitoring changes in discretionary spending on physical adult entertainment services over time is a valuable gauge of recessionary conditions. \n\nMy [informal surve](https://twitter.com/Stephen_Geiger/status/1527740945994743811?s=20&t=t5ZO4FBVZ_pRhFdaTztbvQ)[y](https://twitter.com/Stephen_Geiger/status/1527740945994743811?s=20&t=t5ZO4FBVZ_pRhFdaTztbvQ) of the opinions of adult erotic dancers on Twitter indicates a general pessimism regarding market conditions, which mirrors the University of Michigan's overall [index of consumer sentiment](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/chicsh.pdf) (61.2 as of May 2022, testing the low of 59.7 set in Sept. 2011 and the March 2009 low of 58.3). \n\nFurther, $RICK (RCI Hospitality, owner of \\~50 strip clubs), reported in their 2022Q2 10-Q:\n\n>The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine could **have adverse effects on global macroeconomic conditions which could negatively impact our business**, financial condition, and results of operations.

Tesla is stuck on lithium ion and seems to have no real plans to change that. Their up and coming battery they've been hyping for years seems to have provided no real range or mass improvements and seems to have only in theory been better due to the square cube law almost completely. The main reason people think Tesla batteries are so great is because Tesla had about a decade headstart to EVs and then has continually misled people about the true range of their cars (which consistently perform under spec in real world tests whereas other companies tend to report much more accurately. Some Tesla models even scored 100+ miles under the listed range) and have also lied and mislead quite a bit about the capabilities and price points of near future vehicles, hence why they all keep getting delayed for year after year after year. The only reason Tesla has been ahead at all is because they got ahead by breaking into a completely unprofitable industry and relying on stock from hype and government subsidies to make up for massive losses.

They have the best operating profit of any manufacturer, the fastest growth since Henry Ford, absolutely dominate the EV market planet wide, and have essentially paid all their dept, making them one out of only two carmakers that aren't drowned in debt. A roadster like car was unsustainable when they started but they have been executing flawlessly. \n\nB: that remains too correct however really only coming from the freemont factory, being the converted factory rather than the purpose built ones. Freemont's quality was always dubious but it has greatly improved. The Shanghai vehicles have been extremely good and it is likely any vehicle coming form the purpose built factories will be the same. \n\nC: another one that is a head scratcher to me. Cause yeah, you have models and prototypes that beat the Teslas one characteristic at a time but none of them match neither their production number nor their price. As far present day is concerned, OEM still fail to deliver on numbers, efficiency, performance or cost and often on all 4 of them. It's not even me who is saying it. VW said it themselves in front of investors that they are getting trashed on every metric. \n\nD: that one is mostly correct on the delay and the price, however considering it's the only self driving software that is not geogated and working right now, it's in a league of its own really. I'll take an imperfect system working right now and seeing visible progress than a \"maybe\" system where one of its cornerstone is having detailed HD maps constantly updated and maintained for it to even function. A logistical and scaling impossibility. They chose to go for the hardest to make system and it is indeed showing... But as an engineer I can attest that it is the only system that has any chance of scaling to global use.\n\nTelsa sells products which while they still have a lot to improve on and a lot of new things to be made FSD side, is already a massively compelling product and the sales/demand more than proves it. The competition is slacking and that is where the problem is. Since it is the only product that can offer performance, utility, scalability, OTA updates, safety, efficiency, direct sales and (somewhat) luxury, people are going to pay for it regardless of how much or what minor defaults can be found. Tesla had been raising prices constantly and it hasn't deterred the one year order delays. FSD has exploded in price and yet people still buy it in spades because it's the only service of its kind available. Teslas aren't perfect, but it barely registers when their entire EV lines sell less than a quarter than the sales of a single one of your models. \n\nMusk is an ass that really need to reign himself on topics that aren't engineering or science focused because he is clearly not good at them, or at least sharing about them. But people have been calling their downfall for decades and if they didn't at their lowest (model 3 ramp and falcon 1 failures all at the same time) then they sure as fuck wont' stop now.

I'm not sure about this but what I do know is that pretty much everyone I know with a Tesla has panel gaps. know a guy who's panel gaps were so bad that water would actually leak into his car every time it rained. Last I heard he'd been in a months long battle with Tesla to get it fixed.\n\nC. Wow, really? A company that just entered the market doesn't match Tesla's production numbers? And I wonder how Tesla's raw car numbers fair in comparison to legacy auto companies? It's not a fair comparison either way. And in terms of price, Lucid does beat Tesla in price compared to specs. Right now they're targeting high end markets, no reason to think they're solution shouldn't scale to a lower end car. And again, Tesla's lead in the industry actually isn't very large at all if you take into account actual vehicle range vs reported vehicle range because, again, Tesla loves misleading people about the actual specs of their products to make themselves seem futuristic\nD. Well you say \"working right now\" but is it? It's still a level 2 system and not even a very good level two system at that. It was supposed to be level 5 over 5 years ago. Every year has been the same broken promise, the same scammed individuals, and the same lack of progress.  Go look at Tesla's original 2016 FSD video. If they were being honest in that video then their FSD software has made just about no improvements since then because just about every modern video you watch shows the cars performing much worse. Their approach doesn't even make sense, dumping mountains of data into a neural network thats already been trained on mountains of data and still isn't working isn't going to change things. ANN's don't work that way. There's a reason the only actual self driving companies in the world use a mix of geofencing, ANNs, and other solutions to deliver truly level 4 systems that you can actually ride in today in certain places, and for companies like google who already have such vast amounts of mapping data scaling shouldn't even be overly difficult, certainly it's much easier than solving general AI like Tesla would need to do. Btw I'm studying engineering too, and I don't agree with you that geofenced is the only practical solution. On its own maybe, but geofencing is simply used as a performance enhancer to an ANN. It's literally just Tesla's approach but with maps to help out where they can. If the only way to make self driving cars is to not rely on any mapping data at all, then we're not going to be making them for a long, long time.\n\nAnd it's very funny how they keep raising the price on this software that doesnt at all work and won't be for a long long time.

While Tesla was setting the chessboard, everyone else was out in the woods. They had to learn painful lessons like Nissan with the leaf battery degradation and GM with the bolt fires. VW damn near has had a mutiny over the switch to EVs and Diess's job as CEO was on the chopping block of the board within the last few months. \n\nTesla dragged the rest of the industry kicking and screaming into the EV direction and many of them still have not shown an ability to deliver. \n\nAn excellent counter to your claim is this - if GM (especially!) and Ford are so great at producing cars, where are they?

Why can't anyone else offer a better value proposition with regards to range and performance? Lucid has a car with more range, but it's more expensive than a model s plaid.

He went full \"regulatory capture\", and at the time was seen as a huge conspiracy theorist but he was basically right. His company WAS being naked shorted to death. And the lawsuits proved that the SEC and the underlying market plumbing was basically incapable of stopping it. Bryne eventually tried to trap all the short sellers by issuing a digital token dividend that the shorts would have absolutely no way to deliver. This was completely different from GameStop's new split via dividend because at least theoretically the shorts can still buy shares from the market and deliver them. Bryne tried to make a dividend that was actually impossible for shorts to deliver, and it ended up being a huge issue. Bryne eventually went on to have a relationship with Maria russian-spy Butina and became a huge trump supporter. \n\nIn a similar way, Tesla's rise was due directly to the company being shorted to all fuck. Almost every single spike in the share price was due to Elon's fanboy club continuously propping him up and trapping the shorts, over and over. This is true, not a theory. If Elon wasn't such a character, odds are his stock price would have remained low. The company pulled in a shit ton of cash by issuing secondary offerings at high prices when the shorts were trapped, most effectively after their split when the fanboy club went off the rails and mortgaged their houses. If this didn't happen, Tesla wouldn't have been able to issue those secondaries, the stock would have tanked, their cash position would have been fucked in the extreme, and they wouldn't have been able to actually expand as they needed to. It's no exaggeration to say that the character of Elon and his battle against the shorts saved Tesla from bankruptcy and made it the behometh it is today. \n\nBut a side effect of beating a real conspiracy to fuck you is that you begin to see everything as a conspiracy. And a real side effect of the fanboy club and the success  is this Teflon attitude where you begin to think your shit doesn't stink. \n\nI don't know for absolute certain that Elon was always like this. He might have been. Or it might have just been a business tactic from the beginning. But once you're in it, once you have your character, and that character made you rich, it's very very difficult to change it. It's even difficult just to remember you were playing a character or that you even have the ability to change it. You begin to tie your success to the character and probably also believe you wouldn't succeed without the character. \n\nThere's always an element of slipping Jimmy to begin with, but even Saul Goodman didn't know how to get off the train once it was rolling. \n\nIt is very very difficult to take the win, cash out for tens of billions in cash, and then slowly ease off the gas and take an exit ramp.

You’d need to find appropriate people, who cost more, and it may just not make a lot of sense to do that.\n\nSo, I don’t really think it makes sense for a massive corporation to have a full on handle everything in house litigation department.

Please tell me how a Volvo EV is better I beg you.\n\nI agree musk is a jerk but Tesla still makes great cars. I did a quick google search to make sure I wasn’t out of base with reality.\n\n“The EV market is heating up, and consumers have many options among new EVs. One such option is the 2021 Volvo XC40 Recharge electric crossover SUV. In fact, it’s one of the Swedish automaker’s first EVs. But unfortunately for Volvo, the Tesla Model Y is better in almost every way.\n\nThat said, the XC40 Recharge’s 75-kWh battery doesn’t provide much range. It can go 208 miles on a full charge, but C/D’s test drivers got only 180 miles during the 75-mph highway fuel economy test. Furthermore, the XC40 Recharge starts at a hefty $55,000. That price might justify the EV’s great safety rating and advanced interior features, but it doesn’t really justify this model compared to competitors\n\nAccording to Car and Driver, the Volvo XC40 Recharge is a good compact SUV, but it’s not a good EV. That’s in large part because of the Tesla Model Y, another compact electric SUV. C/D’s reviewer simply summed up the issue by saying the XC40 Recharge’s main problem is that the Model Y “costs less and goes farther.”\n\nWith a base price tag of about $51,000, the Tesla Model Y costs about $4,000 less than the Volvo XC40 Recharge. To be fair to the XC40, the standard Model Y is a bit slower, reaching 60 mph in about 4.8 seconds. However, the standard Model Y, traveling 326 miles on a full charge, has a much better range than the XC40 Recharge.\n\nBuyers can upgrade their Model Y by getting the Performance trim, pushing the price higher than the XC40 Recharge. The Model Y Performance starts at around $61,000, but this model is faster than the Volvo. The Model Y Performance can zip from 0 to 60 mph in about 3.6 seconds, yet it still has a nearly 300-mile range. So the XC40 Recharge can’t keep up with the Model Y no matter what.”\n\nSource: https://www.motorbiscuit.com/volvo-xc40-recharge-tesla-model-y-costs-less-goes-farther/", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">I agree musk is a jerk but Tesla still makes great cars.\n\nSpoken like a true fan boy.

Zambia wasn't an apartheid country though and the his father said he was part of the anti-apartheid progressive party in South Africa.\n\nWhen I first heard about the emerald mine story circulating on social media I looked into it myself and realised it's not at all how it's being painted. I'm sure you are capable of doing some research yourself, there isn't some magic source that clears everything up. These events happened decades ago and there isn't really any record so you have to make your own mind up on what you believe.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm sorry.

Come up with some links to back your claim w/ primary sources. \n\nNo one ever claimed Elon owned the mine, they claimed his father did. \n\nFrom the [BI article](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/how-elon-musks-family-came-to-own-an-emerald-mine-2018-2)\n\n>There, the two South Africans ran into a group of Italians who, as it happened, were in the market for an airplane. Errol named his price, and a deal was done.\n\n>\"So we went to this guy's prefab and he opened his safe and there was just stacks of money and he paid me out, £80,000, it was a huge amount of money,” he said.\n\n>Standing with the cash in his hand, Errol was made another offer he couldn’t refuse: Would he like to buy half an emerald mine for half of his new riches?\n\n>\"I said, ‘Oh, all right’. So I became a half owner of the mine, and we got emeralds for the next six years.”\n\n>It was a lucrative decision. Errol employed a cutter in Johannesburg and sold the stones wherever his travels as an engineer or family holidays took him.\n\n>And, on at least one occasion, his now famous son also took his hand at dealing in the gems, with peculiar results.\n\nAnd of course can't forget\n\n>They never made it to their destination. Instead Errol returned to South Africa with a half-share in a Zambian emerald mine, which would help to fund his family's lavish lifestyle of yachts, skiing holidays, and expensive computers.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">No one ever claimed Elon owned the mine, they claimed his father did.\n\nThe original comment was.\n\n>Mans was born owning an emerald mine, there's never been less pressure\n\nTo which someone replied.\n\n>That’s actually been proven to be a myth.\n\nThen you linked to the original business insider article I was talking about.

This current move down is a result of overall market sentiment changing and re-evaluating how to view the important parts of a balance sheet (which most retards here never look at anyway). \n\nAll of this sounds like conspiracy talk, but its literally backed by seeing which tech names and general companies sold off the most so far. You're even seeing hedge funds put out notes (really late btw) about how they're shifting focus to profitability and free cash flows. Tesla has always been viewed as a growth tech play. Growth isn't the be all and end all of stocks, and should have never been in the first place. The valuation didn't matter because the entire market was in \"risk-on\" mode. Literally nothing mattered as long as growth was the name of the game. Now there's a price to debt, and it hasn't even risen by much yet. VC funds are rethinking where they place their money, and I can't say this enough, sentiment overall has completely changed because the writing is on the wall.
