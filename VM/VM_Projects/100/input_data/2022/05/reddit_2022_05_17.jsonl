There can be no turnaround until it's controlled.", "selftext": "There have been a lot of opinions offered on when we might see the selling stop, but it really all comes down to one issue: inflation.  \n\nInflation is a blank check against the US economy.  It gives the Fed complete power to slow the economy until it can get inflation controlled.  Until investors know what that looks like, they can't possibly make any confident forecasts about the future earnings of companies.  \n\nLet me use an analogy.  You're about to click buy on a big fat engagement ring when your girlfriend texts you at 11 PM on a Monday night and says she wants to talk.  It sounds serious.  Do you buy the ring?  Of course not!  Maybe she wants to talk about something totally unrelated to you, but maybe she met someone else or maybe she has finally thought it over and realized you don't really look that much like Ryan Reynolds.  Who knows, but you can't possibly commit to a big purchase when you don't even know if the relationship is on solid ground.\n\nHow can investors possibly know how to discount future earnings if they don't know whether the terminal rate is going to be 2% or 5% or 8%?  Those three numbers would mean very, very different things for the US economy.  It's the difference between Powell's soft-ish landing and a full-on canned tuna and reusable toilet paper recession.  \n\nCompanies would make vastly different amounts of money in those three scenarios, and until investors have some idea about what will be needed in order to control inflation, things are very unlikely to turn around.  And from where I'm sitting, we have no clue whatsoever what kind of terminal rate will be needed.  Significant portions of inflation are driven by artifical forces, like oil disruption due to Ukraine or supply chain disruption due to Covid.  This makes predicting the effects of higher rates very hard.  \n\n\nMy less-convicted, armchair guess:   I think we see these 1-2% weekly bleeds until the market is given clarity one way or the other.  I don't think we see any huge one-day selloffs in the near-term unless some drastic comments from Powell drop.  The next CPI report isn't until June 10, so it's hard for me to see how we have much to make big moves on for a few weeks.  If the 1-2% bleeds continue long enough, we could end up in crash territory.  We're only several months of 1-2% weekly drops away from the S&P being down 40%.

Instead, we look at the tactical shots that we can apply by understanding macroeconomic events and looking for opportunities where we can grow our wealth during times of market volatility.\n\n\\*\\* Before starting i would like to apologize for the late post. I messed up my schedule because I partied a lot this Sunday. Also, there was a light cut off in my region on Monday and my laptop is a gaming one. No backup ff's. So I will make sure to add bonus content about Monday. \\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnough of my BS lets get started‚Ä¶!!!\n\n\\*\\* Edited like 2-3 times because of spacing. I have no clue why it happened. Apologies again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Good morning**\n\n**Respected Traders and Investors,**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoly shit, you're not doing well at all and are hanging by a thread at the mercy of Federal Reserve, or should i say, Joe F Biden.  XD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told you , I told you so. Victory day will be the end of ‚ÄúBuy at the sound of cannons and sell at the noise of trumpets rally‚Äù Meaning we will be making a lower low to the price which we did on Feb-march period of time. I also told you Institutions and HFs will be analyzing the CPI data and then decide if the market goes up or down. And that‚Äôs the gist of what happened this week, my friends. \n\nAnd you guys must be wondering, why is this guy right every single time. How does he do that. What metrics does he look at. Well, my friends let me clarify this beforehand. I am not an expert at literally anything. Every individual across this reddit group is a more intellectual person than I am and is probably making tons of money. I‚Äôm just a normal chess player who fell in love with every asset class across the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Others : White, Stock Market : Black](https://preview.redd.it/h4put00nztz81.jpg?width=5184&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b09d0f8fcf0cd73e7b9d80cf5a45969a8d22565)\n\nI look at the stock market as a player in black pieces and hedge funds, institutions, and me myself as playing with white. Sometimes the stock market plays so well that we think of it as someone using stock fish engines (hence many people simply DCA index), and sometimes he plays horribly like a 100 ELO rating player. And so we all have our own theories and different perspectives on how to beat the stock market. But there is only one game that wins quickly and precisely without a single mistake or inaccuracy, thereby giving max returns and hence beating the stock market, but that game is played by the composite man using the alpha-zero engine. So the people's job in this field is to think about how the composite man might be playing with his pieces and then play their own game. They can either choose to play offensive or sometimes play defense. Hence, sometimes they beat the stock market and sometimes they don‚Äôt. The movement of pieces of stock market (in black) can be analyzed by looking at technical chart.\n\nSo\n\nA) either come up with your own ideas to beat the beat the stock market by DCA index, day/swing trading, investing money in multiple value and growth stocks (lump sum/DCA)\n\nor just simply B) observe the pieces and what game is being played by other players on this field. Now this player could be your favorite YouTuber, Nancy Pelosi, some reddit guy YOLOing or any other hedge fund.\n\nIn this subreddit group, my friends, we come up with our own theories and ideas on where the USA stock market is going. By figuring out the direction where black pieces are moving beforehand, we look at the range, where it is headed and hence invest or trade money then. We also identify the risk on/off mood of the market where it could pump or dump.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hence FYI : This is not financial advice. It‚Äôs just my own unique style of play.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo currently my play, as you all know, is pretty simple : Build cash and DCA at key levels for the next cycle. ( when Dow Jones hits 50wMMA (min) - 200wMMA (max) or SPX hits 200wMA (min) ) But today, my friends, I'm gonna give you a short term idea for 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long intro guys.

Now 2019-2025. Are we in a 90yr recurring cycle? )\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nSymptoms :\n\nDownward trend with some reaction rally to upside which ultimately gets sold off.\n\nWorst performance of year since 1929 great depression.\n\nReacting to Oil prices, high inflation, Jobs/Wages data, FED interest rate talk no jutsu.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nProcedure :\n\nGod knows. All we know is that we have to avoid the max spread of the disease. The FED has to keep raising rates and expect that consumers will stop spending like crazy and bring demand inflation down. If they don't then expect a rug pull in September FOMC.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nMedical Cure :\n\n\\- FED put. (cannot work right now because we need inflation to come down first and not throw gasoline into the fire)\n\n\\- Peace b/w Ukraine and Russia or Putin needs to go.\n\n\\- China Economy opens (Cannot recommend this before peace talks because it will cause Oil shock)\n\n\\- Volcker Shock ( Should bring inflation down but bring Economic Depression )\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nSo we diagnosed the problem and the medical report says \"We are walking b/w min-mid spread of the disease\" This doesn't look good for investing purposes or HODL in 2022-2024 ( FED tightening will take 2yrs to come into effect ).\n\nSo we've got no choice other than to \"Swing trade\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Experiment : Swing trade 2022**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hypothesis :**\n\n\\- A sea of red looming in Q4 2022.

Target : 4.5% min. Max (as per history) : 8-10% which sounds ludicrous right now.\n\n\\- There is no reason to believe that yields go up, then stocks go down. It just means that bonds will become more lucrative to investors and stock indices could have their volatile moves up and down. (Taking into account inflation is under control)\n\n\\- If inflation is running hot over 5% then bonds and stocks get hammered together.\n\nAlso, rising interest rates are bad for bonds. But if they are already priced in by looking at terminal rates, then it's all good. A change in terminal rates to fight hot inflation will make bonds and stocks prices fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chart 2 : TLT](https://preview.redd.it/71qu7t4lozz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=972c47c0740347c4d5a09a9b7ac6d714a0811150)\n\nChart 2 :\n\n\\- I have explained this chart millions of times by now. It said to start buying TLT b/w 15 may - 15 june. Well, we are now past 15. But applying bar charts cannot simply predict days.\n\n\\- Let's look at some more technical stuff :\n\na) Fib retracement from 2008 : $118 ( 61.8% ) , $101 ( 78.6% )\n\nb) Fib trend ext currently : $107 ( 1 fib ), $78 ( 1.618 )\n\n\\- We are currently touching 200 MMA and have a weekly death cross of 50 and 200 which seems to have already made the price go down like 2008.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult : Low yield bonds with AAA safety will get bought before an economic uncertainty or financial crisis. Making stocks fall more. Hence, buy bonds in q2 and sell in q4 peak fear. Provided inflation comes down by August.\n\nIf inflation doesn‚Äôt come down by September, expect bonds to get destroyed with equities or whatever asset in Q4. Volcker shock will screw everything up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 4 :** Let's look at our cash. Some might say Tesla, but I say Apple because it has proven the test of time.\n\n[AAPL chart : White : 50MMA , Orange : 100MMA , Red : 200MMA. Will follow DJI](https://preview.redd.it/6dzgpq7jqzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eed1c152cde980b4092981921ab20e86f091372)\n\n4 things have been concerning me here :\n\n\\- Since the financial crisis of 2008 volume has been declining, but prices of the stock have been rising.\n\n\\- Apple is in a rising wedge and has broken a trendline. Technical target is $100 or 50 MMA. i.e., $95.\n\n\\- Apple tests 50wMMA every time stochastic RSI goes in the lower deep water region.\n\n\\- Apple's Q2 outlook wasn‚Äôt good. Meaning it could fall here before the crisis comes in Q4.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : Apple has never made it to 100w MA since the Dotcom bubble collapse, but we all know it was a joke at that time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 5 :** VIX & SKEW\n\n[VIX](https://preview.redd.it/vbaanvthrzz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3ae0aac537bf645a358707a94a902342a9a2aa6)\n\nThe VIX at 50, is coming this year.\n\nIf the VIX remains elevated for a longer period of time, it would only mean more uncertainty in the market.\n\n[SKEW](https://preview.redd.it/cpref4thrzz81.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=7063bf58904aa35fe515eb9ee70101f54b62a902)\n\nPuts are coming off the market, but prices are at decent lows.\n\nMeaning first an exit liquidity rally, then if people start buying more puts, you can only imagine the carnage to come later in Q4.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 6 :** Housing Collapse\n\n[Purple line : Housing Index, Orange : 30yr bond yields, Sky blue line : Interest rates.](https://preview.redd.it/tow6oo05szz81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f78228fc8fbf4a593e3caf0318df515183261b3d)\n\nMany people were asking why am I saying that the ‚ÄúHousing Market‚Äù will collapse in Q4. What I wanted to say was housing prices will start coming down in Q4 due to inventory build-up ( lumber prices are coming down ) , plus interest rates skyrocketing to 2% by the end of the year. The prices have rose enough and now the only way is down.\n\nThe absolute bottom of prices will be visible in 2024. But for a crash in Q4, we need a volcker shock on housing in 2022 itself. If it happens it will break the housing market. Powell promised us he wouldn't do that until August-September CPI data. So watch out for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 7 :** So we talked about money and housing. Well then let's talk about a sensitive topic called wheat. I‚Äôm not here to explain where wheat is used. You guys are smart and can figure it out yourself by observing day-to day life.\n\n[Wheat Futures \\/ Average US median income](https://preview.redd.it/pwsznbtpszz81.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1d702dc3a8e09313f98f5f1208d925a138e6270)\n\nWhat I can do is plot a graph of wheat futures and divide it by our median household income. What I found was that wheat prices have been on a dramatic rise. Now what does it mean when prices go up? It means either the demand is quite high or the supply has decreased. In this case, we all know it's the latter (Ukraine + India + Russia factors).\n\nSo what does it mean ? It means food shortages are real. If America doesn't start producing enough and people keep thinking that they can flip NFTs or trade options, then we are in trouble. We cannot just assume that the other person is gonna produce things. Who knows, maybe the other person is under the same impression. This topic is subject to dispute and everyone can come up with their own case. But I thought, just let's bring this up to raise awareness among people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\n1. Buying an index is a lot safer than picking stocks at the moment because you never know. (Just told you with apple stock. 50wMMA  becould come before Q4)\n2. In Index analysis (i.e. SPY , QQQ) expect 1/2 months of green (July, August) and more profitable to buy Nasdaq because its all beaten up, bad plus historical analysis.\n3. I do not know the exact bottom in May, June. Could be much lower from here. But what I know is a rally is about to start post-FOMC in June for NASDAQ and SPX post July FOMC. I have no idea why that is an inconsistency. I‚Äôm just telling you what my charts tell me.\n4. FED If - else statement\n\nIf\n\nThe FED controls inflation, then bonds buy date will be May-June period and pain for equities in Q4 where the low yield bond prices will be high as investors will turn on the safety notch to gear  (Second derivative rise in the prices of bonds could crash equity)\n\n(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2024)\n\nElse\n\nThe FED has no control over inflation and Volcker shocks us. Then bonds and equities get hammered together with other financial assets come Q4.\n\n(Hence, Housing market collapse by 2022-23)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Result :** \n\nEither way. A crisis is looming for the equities market in September - October 2022, period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Invalidation :**\n\nEvery theory and experiment has an invalidation case.\n\nMy theory has just 1.\n\nIf FED breaks something in a tightening cycle which hasn't even begun yet (starts June) then we could see indices and stocks plummet more like in 2018 after FED decided to shrink its balance sheet. On average it was a 7-8% drop.\n\nQE : FED buys treasuries in the open market.\n\nQT : FED sells treasuries in the open market. (Selling is of two types. Let treasuries mature or not)\n\nHence, June is so important. We will see then, if these balance sheets selling by the FED are priced in or not by the bond market. If the answer is no, then no fake exit liquidity rally in July-August. Bond prices will fall with equities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For this week ahead.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bloomberg Week](https://preview.redd.it/c9o3ble9yzz81.png?width=1771&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c97a919668de5a84ca0b5fa610c7566c090beb3)\n\nMonday (Bonus) Content :\n\n\\- We had construction worker data which is a leading indicator to recession and it has never been wrong which says recession in 2023 is 10000% guaranteed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Manufacturing data from China was so bad on Monday, but don't let this fool you.

This doesn't mean throwing all your money in. It just means having a % allocated to international funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Powell came in and said :\n\nPaul Volckering right now might be the right idea and could bring inflation down. But we dont know that yet and need more numbers (right now inflation is anchored and coming down in 5yr breakevens, but if it goes up sell everything and short or stay in cash)\n\nPowell Earlier : To fight inflation, we will avoid recession and high employment.\n\nPowell Now    : To fight inflation, we will avoid recession or high employment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- All-in Podcast is the greatest podcast ever created in the history of financial economics.

To answer your first question regarding having a W2, you CAN have a W2 and still qualify for ‚Äútrader status‚Äù and ‚Äúmark-to-market‚Äù election. Once you open a business think of your W2 and business as two separate entities. It‚Äôs important to distinguish the difference between your stocks/securities you are holding for the long term vs stocks/securities you trade to make a profit on short term market volatility. One brokerage account should have your stocks you‚Äôre holding for the long term and another brokerage account should be for short term trades. The following are steps to take in order to be seen as a trader in securities from the IRS eyes, have gains and losses treated as ordinary gains and losses instead of capital gains and losses, and allow yourself to take business deductions related to trading on your tax return.\n\nFirst, you need to start a business with the IRS and obtain an EIN number then register with your state department of revenue/secretary of state. My recommendation is open an LLC first then once your profits hit the $30k mark file an election to incorporate and be taxed as an S-Corporation. \n\nSecond, open a business checking account and only use this account for business expenses and income. In this case, revenue from trading and expenses related to trading aka your business.\n\nThird and one of the most important. Please for the love of god hire an accountant. And I don‚Äôt mean spend thousands of dollars on an accountant. Don‚Äôt let CPAs or accountants tell you your accounting or taxes are difficult and you need to pay thousands of dollars. And don‚Äôt let an accountant tell you that you can‚Äôt do something when you‚Äôve done your research and you know you can. When they say that they either don‚Äôt know what they are doing or don‚Äôt want to take the time to research it. \n\nIt‚Äôs important to have someone reconciling your business bank and credit card accounts, your brokerage account, and maintaining business financials. This all looks good for you in terms of the IRS and you would be shocked how many businesses don‚Äôt even have an accountant, maintain monthly bookkeeping, etc then at the end of the year throw everything at their accountant to file their taxes and items get missed for deductions, late filings, audit risk, etc. The reason to have a good accountant is because there are forms and elections to make plus report your gains and losses on different forms when filing your taxes to qualify you for trader status so you don‚Äôt pay self-employment tax, capital gains/losses, wash sales, etc. Instead of reporting gains and losses on Schedule D and Form 8949, you will report numbers on Schedule C and Form 4797.\n\nFourth, to be treated as a ‚Äútrader‚Äù the following must be met in the eyes of the IRS:\n- must seek profit from daily market movements and not from dividends, interest, or appreciation \n- your activity must be substantial\n- you must carry on the activity with continuity and regularity\n\n‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter whether you call yourself a trader or day trader, you‚Äôre an investor. A taxpayer may be a trader in some securities and may hold other securities for investment. The special rules for traders DO NOT apply to those securities held for investment. A trader must keep detailed records to distinguish the securities held for investment from the securities in the trading business. The securities held for investment must be identified as such in the traders records on the day he or she acquired them (for example, by holding them in a SEPARATE brokerage account).‚Äù\n\nThe last part will be the easiest for you, your accountant, and in the case of an audit or the IRS sends notices or communications to show proof of why you qualify for trader status.\n\nFifth, now you are in business and you need to treat it as such. Keep your personal expenses and W2 pay out of your business bank accounts. You can transfer money from your personal account to your business account then transfer money from your business bank account to your brokerage account. Also, any expenses related to your business needs recorded on your financial statements to qualify for a tax deduction. If you trade from your home you get a home office deduction, if you use or purchase a laptop you can write that off, if you pay for a trading course/group it‚Äôs a write off. Start up costs, internet expense, phone expense, vehicle mileage for business purposes, etc etc etc. \n\nYou open the door to many deductions if you do things the right way. BUT the IRS looks for special circumstances like trader status, real estate professionals status, etc to start asking questions and making sure you are doing the right things. If you aren‚Äôt doing the right things they are allowed to say you don‚Äôt qualify and your previous tax return needs amended and treat your gains/losses as capital gains/losses instead of ordinary. If you made a lot, then this is very bad news for you and you owe a ridiculous amount. \n\nSorry for the long message and I wish it were easy, but it‚Äôs not. Plus I see on a regular basis people starting businesses and not having a clue on proper steps then 3 years later the IRS comes knocking and they end up owing a lot more in taxes and they can‚Äôt even grow their business because they don‚Äôt have accounting procedures or financial statements. \n\nBesides all the nitty gritty, forms to file, meticulous details to remember, my recommendation to sum things up are:\n- get an accountant and have a FREE consultation and have a chat on your plans\n- file for an EIN # with the IRS and tax ID with state agencies\n- develop a plan like opening a separate brokerage and bank account (will need your EIN and articles of incorporation to open a business bank account)\n- then separate your personal items from your business, write a list of items you use for business and personal use (ie computer, phone, etc)\n\nOne last point, don‚Äôt let an accountant tell you it‚Äôs $1000 to file the paperwork for an EIN, sign up for tax ID with the state, and anything else to get started. Hell, you can do these yourself if you do your due diligence, read, and make sure you do it correctly. But filings fees vary depending on each state too. Still won‚Äôt be $1000. It could be in California because everything is ridiculously expensive in California, but I‚Äôd imagine anywhere from $100 to $500 will be filing fees to create a business name.

So what causes these prices to go up?\n\nPhysical materials come from commodities. If demand exceeds supply in that market then it is going to go up in price. They could probably expand a bit before jacking prices but things like the war in Ukraine would obviously have an effect on oil. Also lockdowns and coronavirus restrictions particularly travel restrictions would have an effect on these prices. Materials also includes intermediate goods, so like semiconductors.\n\nLabour costs go up when the labour market is tight but there's tonnes of demand. This could happen when spending is really high causing a need to hire more people, or it could happen if there are coronavirus restrictions, or people are afraid to leave due to a pandemic, even just like 5% of the workforce is a pretty big amount. Infrastructure could be a range of factors maybe social distancing, commercial rent costs.\n\nReally though all these prices normally have some slack in the market. You can normally expand about 25% in the shortterm before companies need to jack prices. Unless you're in the middle of a pandemic. These monkeys printed $5 trillion and spent it in 12 months. Like the government didn't directly print it. The government went to borrow $5 trillion from the market when it was tapped out knowing the fed would backstop the market at 0% interest rates by printing USD and blew it in 12 months during a global pandemic. Obviously all these fuckin prices were going up.\n\nYour fed was shocked when they realised that was an inflationary event. They are the one organisation tasked with preventing inflation from getting out of control and they didn't realize pumping $5 trillion, 33% of M2 money, directly into the bank accounts of corporations and people, during a fucking global pandemic with old people and people with underlying health conditions scared to go outside, and global restrictions on travel, social distancing and lockdowns, would be inflationary. It is basic maths that's like 25% of GDP, normally that's max, and that money remains there and gets spent multiple times.\n\nThe people in control of the USD don't know what they're doing and idk about you but I find that kind of alarming ey given they just printed and spent many trillions of dollars and were shocked by the consequences. Upvote if you read it and think more people need to realize this.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention. Profit margin is another component of costs. That depends more on competition and pricing strategy. It's difficult to predict, but overall we would expect businesses to try to offload some of the cost at least.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "so next months cpi numbers are going to be a face ripper rocket to our last great blow-off top. got it.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "markets solidly green\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthen this fckn monkey starts running his yap\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSTFU", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Summon the Volcker!
