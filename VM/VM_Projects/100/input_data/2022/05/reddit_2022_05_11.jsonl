But another great (and more recent) example to study is the dot-com crash.\n\n> First off, if you bought at the top, you wouldn’t see a new high on your investment for 16.5 years. And if you held on, you got to experience a -83% drop along the way.\n\n> (...)\n\n> Now, imagine you bought the dip! Maybe the market went down -20% into a classic bear market. You buy the dip and what’s the reward? Now you only have to wait 14.2 years and endure a -78% drawdown before seeing a return on your investment.\n\n> What if you bought the dip after a drop worse than what we had during the COVID crash at -40%? Then you wait 11.8 years to get your money back and have to suffer a further -71% drop.\n\n> And, if you are a super dip buyer and bought after things fell -70%, you would still have to wait 2.5 years to recover and stomach a -42% drop.\n\n> Think about that for a second.\n\n> You bought a -70% dip and you still have to deal with a further crash that is even worse than the COVID crash and lasts about five times as long.\n\n> See, I’m not trying to rain on the parade of everyone who wants to buy the dip. I think buying things on sale is smart! What I am saying though, is sometimes, a dip is not just a dip. It can be a small part of a much larger crash and those sales suddenly don’t return easy gains in a short period of time.", "id": "un3xko", "created_utc": 1652252917.0, "score": 504, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 231, "comments": [{"body": "Some 30% of Tech companies in the 1990’s were just money laundering shell companies.   \n\nFormer VP of Enron and head of the EPA’s own daughter started something similar in 2002 with Theranos.

Every time TSLA moves up, both the collateralized stock and the stock purchased with loan money goes up in value... allowing even more collateralization...\n\nIt's all a house of cards...

With the FOMO Musk's big share purchases at any price can cause, it leads to the market cap rapidly driving higher... thus obtaining the goal.  Sort of psychological trickery.\n* Revenue or EBITDA goals, which share price appreciation is giving TSLA an almost limitless pool of funds to pull from to drive up revenue.  Oddly this isn't on 'net income'.  As we know, Tesla buys up as many battery cells as they can.  If cars aren't sold out, then Tesla simply builds grid and home storage batteries with very low margins.    Doesn't matter what the margins are... what they do is drive up revenue.

We're only down 18% right now on the S&P.\n\nAnother problem for Musk is rising interest rates.  Since the time Tesla got the DoE loan and 'almost' free factory and subsidies to pay no taxes in CA for 10-20 years... interest rates have been almost zero.  I imagine Musk has been borrowing money with his collateralized shares at a miniscule interest rate.

Cruise and Waymo for example already have operating services.  Cruise is running its system in SFO during off hours as qualification testing.  I imagine they'll be opening it up to daylight hours as well in short order.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* But Tesla robotaxi cars will replace personal vehicle ownership!... riiigghhhttt.... Show of hands.. how many people are selling their cars and using robotaxis exclusively?\n* But Cybertruck is coming... after other OEMs are already producing EV trucks.\n* But Semi is coming... after other OEMs are already producing EV Semi trucks.\n* But Autonomous Semi + convoy = cheaper than trains...  after other OEMs are already producing Autonomous EV Semis that can work in Convoy ... and train makers are already making electric trains, which are cheaper than diesel trains... or trains that use electrical wires that may be cheaper than battery vehicles...\n\nWhat people don't seem to understand is that Tesla's large vehicle margins are... in large part.. coming from 3 things:\n\n* Cheap Chinese labor.  Fremont was originally supposed to be completely automated.  Failing that, Tesla did the next best thing... built their second factory in China where labor is 25% or less of Western labor.  Tesla's one of the first OEMs to mass manufacture cars in China and flood Western nations (Europe) with them.  Tesla Shanghai is now producing significantly more vehicles than Fremont.   I'm confused... is this an American company, or a Chinese company?  (FYI, I have no problem with Tesla producing cars in China **for the Chinese market.**)\n* LFP batteries.  They could be as little as half the price of Nickel cells, and there's no major raw material supply issues with Iron and Phosphorus.  Meanwhile, Ford, Rivian, VW, and others have announced they're planning to use LFP cells; partnering with CATL to build a plant in the US.  Tesla... meanwhile.. is importing LFP cells from China.  Again, this an American company, or a Chinese company?\n* Demand is outpacing supply, and OEMs are selling every BEV they can make.  The global vehicle supply shortage is definitely helping Tesla right now because they can demand more money for their limited supply.  Tesla has a leg up by ramping their production up before other OEMs... but the other OEMs have battery and vehicle factories under construction and coming online this year and in coming years.

{"title": "Investing is not like cheering for a sports team.", "selftext": "\nThis is a long read but 100% worth it and necessary for today’s investing climate.\n\n\nPeople become sports fans mainly to support the home team. Whether the team is good or bad they watch, go to games, buy memorabilia. And the majority of times they stick with one team their entire lives through ups and downs.\n\nInvesting is not like that at all whatsoever. This message is mainly for the newer younger investors, those that started during the meme stock craze. What I’ve been seeing is people treating stock investing the same way they treat sports teams. They pick a stock, stick with it no matter what, join echo chambers that promote the stock and then reconfigure their reality to see the stock in a positive light no matter what. I can’t even begin to explain how dangerous that is in the markets. It’s like that’s their team and damn anyone who will convince them otherwise.\n\nThings change with time. New information arises that can contradict what was once true. This is especially true in the markets. What was once a sure fire trade might no longer be in a few months. Pay attention to macro world wide events for clues of changing trends. For example Zoom: an obscure video conference service that no one heard of until the pandemic when it was propelled into the forefront of every household and became its own noun. But now it’s cratering hard because the pandemic is ending and less people are using it. Zoom doesn’t have its own stock specific subreddit (or does it ? Im not sure) but if it did you would be hearing about crime and hedgies creating synthetic shares to crash the stock on purpose and how a short squeeze is imminent…. Any day now. When in reality large scale macro events are causing the stock to crash.\n\nStay the fuck away from every single stock specific subreddit. They are ALL toxic, riddled with lies/misinformation/half truths/gas lighting/misdirection. They take information and exaggerate it if it’s positive and minimize it or just outright ignore it if it’s negative. This is not the place or mindset you want to be getting your data from. You want people who are going to tell you the truth, bad or good, no matter what it is. This allows you the investor to make choices on your own. These echo chamber hive minds are relying on the mob for information. You constantly see people saying things like: “tell me what to think of this” “I’m not sure what this means can you explain for a sm00th brain.” Imagine relying on random people you’ve never met to make personal decisions on how to invest your hard earned money. It absurd and just dangerous. But the worst part is how any dissenting opinion is absolutely smothered by the moderators and the mob. I’m seeing desperate people who need cash to pay for serious life altering things such as car repairs, medical appointments, their dogs treatment who are being ridiculed, attacked, insulted by the mob for wanting to sell their shares to pay for those things. Being called a sell out, a shill. The one of the dog was extra painful to watch as some dude let his dog die instead of selling his shares to pay for its medical treatment. And then the mob came and applauded him for “staying the course” don’t believe me? It’s there in that one stock specific subreddit that rhymes with duperbonk. \n\n\nSome of the most basic principles of investing have gone out of the window. For example never put all your eggs in one basket. Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose. Don’t take out loans on your 401k, max out your credit cards with cash advances, sell your only car (yes these things are actually happening in meme stock subreddits). This behavior is so irrational, so toxic. Everyday I am flabbergasted by what I am seeing and when I think it can’t get worse it does. \n\nTLDR stock trading is not a group activity.

A billion that was acquired through diluting their shares on the backs of GME investors.

Only a few stocks go on to make returns like AMZN or AAPL. It’s why the market as an aggregate only averages 6%-8% a year. Because for every AAPL there are multiple tickers in the red. So following your mindset people should just hold this forever and cheer on? No things change with time and rebalancing, dumping losers and upping winners is something you must do in your portfolio.

They are winners because they have a fanatical fanbase, the management sees where the puck is going and they do listen to customers.   This is one of my investment criteria for a heavy %portion of my portfolio.  Community + utility/story = value.  I've been an Apple user since Mac OS9 and the first titanium Macbook.  I've always been a sneaker-head, so I have a good idea where Nike/Adidas is heading without looking at financial reports.  Activision/Blizzard is a good example where people loved the products, but when the company seems to not listen to their community fanbase--- their stock takes a hit.  To me, engaging a company's investors and customers, and then looking at the unit economics is much more valuable than Financial writer article and even earnings report top-line numbers.\n\nFinancial analysts and writers; they are helpful but only to a limited scope.   I have a few good friends and writers (for Bloomberg, Forbes, Nikkei and others); so I don't want to devalue what they do.  But as somebody who has worked in Venture Capital and written investment memos; I would never put too much weight on what they say.   Their KPIs are based on click-throughs, page views, and articles per month.Their money is not on the line.   They are also not business operators.   \n\nIn regards to Superstonk.   They are a subset group of GME individual retail investors.  While they can get mobbish at times,  again in aggregate the best ideas do emerge and have been mostly correct (you may disagree with me on this point).   The principle idea that there is market manipulation  (though dark pools, total transfer swaps, long/short mismarking, etc) is correct.  The dates (wen squeeze) have been wrong; but that's okay if you understand and believe the market is manipulated.  The sentiment of buying options was mobbish and did flip-flop a few times.   The prediction of the NFT marketplace was correct.  So was the prediction of a stock dividend.   Whether a squeeze happens now or later; the squeeze is only part of story.  A good % of company are perfectly happy investing without a squeeze.  For myself, I'm very bullish that they are really the first publicly-traded company to implement zero-knowledge proofs technology and I believe online marketplace platforms tend to be winner takes all.  So GME is in the position to win it.

This makes it a short term play, and we're currently on the part of the rollercoaster where peoples breath gets taken away. FB had it's personal punch to its stock when it lost subscribers. Next punch is the entire economy around it. That's the time to buy, and dump it whenever you want for a variety of reasons. Macroeconomy does good? Maybe dump it then. Metaverse about to launch and you know its gonna be a hot load of garbage like the Kinect turned out to be? Sell all of it. VR tech costs suddenly got really cheap (unlikely - interest rates are gonna go sky high due to increasing real risks of hyperinflation)? Then maybe hold onto it as people get bored and look for something else to amuse themselves with as a fad. But dump it before the fad wears out. Tech companies aren't going to make a big push into expensive products when interest rates are high unless they're desperate and there's nowhere else to turn. Honestly, how many people game versus watch TV, movies, or just others playing games? Why do you think Twitch has exploded? People don't like interactive, personal involvement in their media.

If they're going to entertain themselves actively, they're either doing it in full fantasy mode (video game) or doing it for health (exercise).\n\nMetaverse is a pump and dump strategy as long as FB overleverages its entire business on that one product. They've run out of ideas on both Facebook and Insta. Smarter would be to pull back development on Metaverse, allow the tech to catch up for costs, and solidify their ad revenue on their core platforms.

However telling anyone they and everyone has no idea do your own research is disingenuous and begs the questions why are you even on this subreddit then?\n\nIMO, pumping billions into the Metaverse is potentially far more trivial when your ad revenue is multiple billions of dollars higher.  Google also spends enormous amounts of R&D on projects that have failed.  But within that some of those projects pivot and some are successful.  Metaverse may fail in the way you're labeling but it also may create something or discover other avenues you've never thought about or have given any thought to.  There are brilliant and creative people working on that project and to think nothing comes from it at all but a giant failed project to me doesn't add up.  I personally don't think spending $10B on the second life 2.0 is at all an accurate description of what's taking place but I hear it thrown around a lot.

Have averaged down since but am definitely well down on initial investment. Decently run company that have been there, done that. Know how to survive recession which is a major plus in the current environment. Little debt, the reported figures on their balance sheets are related to rentals and lease obligations rather than actual debt. Where my major contrarian point comes in: Last earnings they acknowledged Nike's increasing move to DTC and that the share of Nike products they would sell would decrease (target is no one brand consists of more than 50% of their sales). They had already begun that transition away from Nike, pivoting towards other brands to make up the loss and beat revenue as well as beating EPS estimates. Furthermore, they'd recently acquired two new retailers, WSS and Atmos (an Asian chain to begin expansion into Asian markets). They acknowledged coming headwinds, with further reducing their reliance on Nike, the inflationary environment and supply chain issues. Stock plummeted after earnings. I think what was missed here is they've already started a successful transition from Nike and while their forward, short term estimates look like contraction, it's contraction from their already estimate beating revenues. They'll keep making money, very little debt to service and in the last week have just announced a strategic partnership with Adidas. Also worth noting they hiked their dividend and are going on a share buyback spree (not that I discount these things, just when I'm looking at a business my two most immediately important criteria is are they making money and what are their liabilities). Overall I think the market has this one wrong but am willing to accept the risk, especially a discretionary retailer in a recession/cost of living crisis environment. Plan: Holding - Might reinvest dividends.\n2. Sibanye Stillwater. Boy these guys have had a rocky couple of months. From rocketing high on possible sanctions of Russian platinum and palladium to tanking on a combination of said sanctions not coming to pass (well, not to the level expected as of yet), decreasing prices of metals and a gold miner strike in South Africa. Again, I like this crew overall. Much like Foot Locker, I think the executives have some sense about them and see the wood for the trees. They're pivoting more and more into battery metals and \"green\" metals as well as exploring uranium mining while continuing their platinum group metal projects. Gold is a dying sector for them and I don't believe they'll look to acquire any further interest in same. Serviceable debt, consistent profits, all in sustaining costs for their PGM operations in both US and SA are well below the price these metals are fetching and have a lot of room to fall before they're not making money on them. Gold a different story. It's almost a goodwill project from them to continue employing people in SA because the actual income stream from it just isn't there. Which is where the miner strike gets tricky, because they want a wage increase of 1000 Rand a month and Sibanye have offered 850, which has been refused, as well as other options such as profit sharing that has also been refused. Not sure how much longer the gold mining side of things will be viable. They've also some Nickel mining operations in Europe and have a 50% stake in Ioneer's Lithium-Boron project in Nevada which could be very profitable. Overall, much of what they mine is in high demand, their executive team look like the understand the need to pivot more and more towards mining metals \"of the future\", with that they'll largely expand into other global territories reducing their reliance on SA and the geopolitical risks involved, not to mention they pay a big dividend. Goldman Sachs have just initiated a buy on them as well. Plan: Holding - Might reinvest dividends/add to position the further we fall.\n3. Kinross Gold. Another miner and I think one I'm less convinced of. They're Gold only and their all in sustaining costs for gold mining is good, enough that gold has a lot of room to fall before they stop making money on it, but I'm just not sure on them. A couple of good mines and recently acquired the Great Bear project in Canada which is supposedly very high quality, their revenues etc are okay, flat, and a slight bump in net profit this quarter but estimated EPS miss. Pay a small dividend which I'm not super fussed over. Don't like that they've taken on further debt recently. Will see, in fairness to them I probably am being unfair in that I'm getting uneasy having not had any production out of Great Bear yet. Plan: Holding - Don't think I'll add more as I honestly would prefer to go into Sibanye (and probably should've focused on same from the get go)\n4. GameStop. Flies in the face of my bearishness but it's been a hell of a lot of fun. Not going into a whole chat about a turnaround plan or NFT marketplace or any of that craic, because it's all speculative. Plan: Holding - Too much fun to sell out.\n\nThey're my lot. Feel better having typed it out.

Charles Dow and Edward Jones were really guys, and if U read up on them, you’ll see that they were not trying to create an Index.

And the DJIA was specifically created for Wall Street traders.\r  \n\r  \n**Dow Jones Industrial Average**\r  \nFirst created on May 26, 1896, the DJIA is the second oldest among U.S. market indices (after the Dow Jones Transportation Average). It was created by Charles Dow, the editor of The Wall Street Journal and the co-founder of Dow Jones & Company, and named after him and his business associate, statistician Edward Jones.\r  \nIn 1884, Charles Dow composed his first stock average, which contained nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the Customer's Afternoon Letter, a daily two-page financial news bulletin. The Customer's Afternoon Letter just contained brief news bulletins, nicknamed \"flimsies\", and were hand-delivered to traders on the floor of the stock exchange in the early 1880s.\r  \nCharles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted the Customer's Afternoon Letter into The Wall Street Journal on July 8, 1889. Prior to that, their main focus was on stocks in what is now the Dow Jones Transportation Average. Then the average comprising twelve industrial stocks would grow in status and eventually form Dow's most famous index.\r  \nThe DJIA includes only 30 large companies and is a price-weighted index, unlike later stock indices which use market capitalization. Furthermore, the DJIA does not use a weighted arithmetic mean.\\*\r  \n\\*A weighted arithmetic mean is similar to an ordinary arithmetic mean (the most common type of average), except that instead of each of the data points contributing equally to the final average, some data points contribute more than others.

His companies' positions listings generally (but not always, depending on the job) come with a comment that applicants should expect to sometimes work long hours and weekends. And yet millions of people apply for Tesla jobs, knowing what will be expected of them.\n\nElon's employees can be given stock options as an incentive to sign on, can later be rewarded or otherwise compensated with stock options, and have opportunities to buy stock at a discount, so many employees are shareholders and have a strong incentive to make the company succeed.\n\nMany of Elon's employees believe in the company mission, which further motivates them to work beyond a minimum.\n\nTesla workers in China get paid overtime - pretty sure Tesla's hourly workers in the US get paid overtime as well.\n\n> Elon used to be pro universal basic income which is about people not needing to work\n\nThat's not a correct assessment of what Elon has said. Elon foresees a time when machines (AI systems and robots) can do nearly all jobs better and cheaper than a human can. As that time approaches, Elon regards UBI as inevitable - but humans who want to work, be creative, contribute to society, etc. will still be able to, and they will be able to make more money to supplement their UBI. \n\nBut that time is not here yet - companies and countries still need human workers so they can produce and be competitive. Elon is right to praise people who want to work hard and take pride in working hard, and as he recently pointed out he drives himself far harder than he expects his employees to work.\n\n> for not wanting to work now\n\nElon said \"They won't even leave the factory type of thing, whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all\". Many people have misinterpreted that to be about hours worked, i.e. Americans want to work zero hours. But from the context, Elon is referring to people actually coming into the workplace. Tesla does have people who work from remote locations or from home, but in general people who work in a factory have to actually be in the factory. There have been many recent articles about Americans not wanting to go back to the workplace and to continue working from home. When Goldman Sachs instituted a strict return to the office policy on February 1, for example, only about half of the workers showed up. And the day before Elon's FT interview, it was reported that Apple's head of machine learning was resigning because he didn't like Apple's return to the office policy. Elon is certainly aware of these incidents, and that appears to be what he was referring to in the interview.\n\nSo Elon, who employs many tens of thousands of people who have to be physically present for the factories to operate, is reasonable to praise people who are willing to be physically present, even under the more severe conditions of Shanghai's closed loop system.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Those comments were stupid af", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Let’s see if we can stay above 790 today", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I liquidated my trading account yesterday at a small loss . . . will buy back in at 30 shares for $724 or 25 shares for $868, whichever comes first", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "you looking smart now", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Nope ☹️", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "https://imgur.com/a/NW8zoru  \nThis is what I was watching this AM.

At some points in the recent past, TSLA made up half or even more of the overall options market. \n\nWhen a trader buys a Put option on TSLA from a Market Maker (typically an Institutional Investor who stands by to provide market liquidity), that Market Maker will automatically sell some TSLA shares to raise cash in case that Put option is exercised. \n\nSuppose I bought a Put option to protect the value of my TSLA holdings, and that option gives me the right to sell my TSLA at 800/share.  If a Market Maker sold me that Put, they don't want to be in a situation where I exercise the option and they have to pay me 800/share for my TSLA, if the market valuation of TSLA before the option expires is lower, like 600/share.  So maybe that Market Maker sells some amount of TSLA to hedge, in order to have cash on hand if they become obligated to buy the shares I hedged. \n\nA large amount of puts sold to protect TSLA holdings will have the effect of boosting supply of shares for sale, which will drive TSLA share price artificially lower. \n\nThe reverse is true when market makers sell Call Options and buy TSLA shares so they have the stock in inventory if the options are exercised and the market valuation is higher.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "How many dips am I going to have to buy?\n\n![gif](giphy|14fX2WQuOIVHBC)", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|U2nN0ridM4lXy)", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "thats exactly how i look", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Anyone paperhand today?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Nah mate.

That said most of us hate china anyways but, a small minority of old boomers support/like/love china and accordingly, support russia. Received this from one of my boomer customers today:\n\nUkraine - The military genius in Putin\nSince the American engineered coup in 2014 that brought Zelensky to power, the American and NATO have been quietly setting up the command centre for NATO operation against the Russians under the Azovstal steel plant. 3 major goals were achieved in the last 8 years, a command centre, a major biochem weapon station and a regiment of neo Nazi soldiers. All these were done stealthily, top secret military stuff. And they executed these so successfully under the nose of the Russians...without the Russians knowing?\n\nWith so many top generals and scientists shuffling in and out of the secretive underground fortress, with so many soldiers, and with so many logistics, biochemical weapons in the facility, it was a very well kept secret!\n\nPutin was not appointed to head the KGB as a political appointee. He earned his spurs as an intelligent secret service officers. To be appointed as head of KGB, unlike the head of CIA, the latter a political appointment, meaning any idiot or clown could also be offered the job, it meant that Putin was the best of the best in KGB/Russia. Can't imagine how sleepy Joe is going to test his wits against the best of the KGB.\n\nPutin and the Russians did not know of the death machine under the Azovstal steel plant? His original plan was to take Kiev? All his tanks and heavy military vehicles were lined up on the roads to Kiev, clearly visible by satellite images. No need guessing. The Americans and Ukrainians knew exactly what Putin was going to do. He is going to attack Kiev. The people in the Azovtal stronghold too thought they were very safe, very secure, unknown and undetected by the Russians. And their daily activities continued unchanged. \n\nEverything was normal in Mariupol. In fact, the Americans and NATO must have felt very safe and no one left the fortress. If only they knew what Putin was up to. If only they knew that they have been exposed, all the big fish would have fled. Was it American and NATO arrogance, or was it Putin's brilliance, the attack on Kiev was expected but fizzled out quickly.  By then, the Russian troops have all encircled the Azovstal fortress. Too late to run. No one is going to escape the dragnet of Putin.\n\nDid any of the very clever American analysts and intelligence officers saw this coming? How could they missed the signs, the decoy, the diversionary strategy of Putin, look West and strike East? Putin's deception was as perfect as you can get from the point of military strategy. Of course the arrogance and stupidity of the Americans and NATO helped, making it so easy for Putin to round them up in one move. Now, as the Chinese strategists like to call it, Putin is hauling in the net, with all the big fish and crocodiles inside.\n\nPutin is as good a military genius as he is expected. And he did not fail his believers with this war of deception in Ukraine. Now the Americans is pulling every string they could find to get in touch with Putin to release the big fish and crocodiles in the Azovstal fortress. The UN Sec Gen Antonio Guterres, and the Pope Francis had to make personal trips to Moscow to see Putin. \n\nAfter all the hard work plotting to capture the Azovstal fortress, including the big fish and crocodiles and all the biochemical weapons inside, it would not be so easy to appease and persuade Putin to give up his prized catches so easily. Now the Americans and NATO are at the mercy of Putin.\n\nDo not be surprised if the desperate Americans and NATO would do a last ditch assault in Mariupol to free their valued generals and scientists. When Lt Trevor Cadieu is only in charge of a biochem weapon unit, one can easily imagine how many more generals would out rank him in the fortress. Then there would be the commanding officer of this top secret facility and his deputies. The Brits French, Germans and many other NATO top brass are likely to be in the same hole under the steel plant.\n\nThese are early Christmas presents for Putin, though they came with a lot of planning and effort. For the slightest indication that the fortress' existence had been exposed, or Putin's game plan was to capture the fortress and all the top brass and biochemical weapons in them, all the top brass would have scooted long before the war started, and all the biochemical weapons would have be transferred elsewhere. Now they would be top exhibits in Putin's case against the Americans and NATO, to be shown to the whole wide world.\n\nNever had the Americans and NATO been in such a dire strait, with their balls being squeezed by Putin and they could not do anything about it short of an outright military confrontation, an assault on the Azovstal steel plant with the full force of American and NATO forces.\n\nNo amount of propaganda can distract the success of Putin in his set up to capture the Azovstal fortress lock, stock and barrel. These would now become very expensive chips in the pocket of Putin, and the Americans and NATO would have to pay a very heavy price for their return. \n\nHow many generals or military strategists today could claim such a success against the American Empire and NATO? And to think of it, the Americans and NATO still did not have any clue what was Putin up to. Still guessing and spreading nonsense about the intent of Putin, and still claiming fake victories against Putin everyday.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "imagine fleeing communism to a capitalist Mecca only to simp for Winnie the Pooh and Vlad", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "🤡🤡🤡", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Who the fuck flagged this?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Someone probably thought that was my opinion lmao", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "twitter employee", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Tl;dr", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|FOUArYBVQCvmI8EHxp|downsized)", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I've been following both sides of the war closely and think that your analysis is spot on.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/05/11/asia-markets-china-us-inflation-data-currencies-oil.html\n\nChina CPI higher than expected.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Not too much of a surprise given they shut down their industrial heartland", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Algos pressed the sale button, jeez", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "8.3% Vs 8.1% expected", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It's basically the same surely lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "That's not too big of a miss tho right?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No..

The ability to use individual wafers to produce higher end products give AMD the ability to increase silicon yield, improving revenue and margins. They have just released their first true MCM enterprise GPU in the instinct lineup, there is a massive GPU shortage worldwide due to supply Constraints, labor shortages, and the fact that higher end GPUs have absolutely horrendous silicon yields, I believe AMD is going to take the same ryzen approach to improving silicon yields in GPUs allowing them to not only create more supply of higher end GPUs, but also to be able to price them more competitively without diminishing their profit margins. This will take time as system integrators and engineers validate AMD's new components for the next 2 or so years. \n\nTLDR: AMD has MCM GPUs and both my hands and my dick are diamonds right now.\n\nEdit: My red and green croton drawings traditional GPU on left MCM on right\n\nEdit 2: How does this increase yield? \n\nAnswer copy paste from my comment cause I'm lazy: \n\nHypothetically if you were making chips, you start with one gigantic wafer of silicon, and you \"cut\" pieces of it off , these pieces are then analyzed and tested to see how much of the circuitry inside the wafer is usable, if the whole wafer is usable this will be used to create one high end sku, if only half of it is usable then it might be used to make one mid range sku, and so on. This is the traditional monolithic way of doing things. Now with MCM design (multi chip module) let's say you need to fulfill inventory of a high end sku but you only have a bunch of pieces of silicon that can make mid range sku's, now all you have to do in an oversimplified nutshell is take 2 or 3 of those mid range wafers and connect them together, they'll act as one high end wafer. Which man's you didn't have to throw away silicon at a lower end and lower profit margin component.\n\nEdit: the process I describe here is called chip binning and the way AMD bins their chips they have far greater flexibility to create higher end components using multiple mid end components. Generally speaking the highest end components are exempt from this process as it usually requires the full silicon wafer to be functional but this opens the door to drastically increase yields for everything beneath the highest end sku's.\n\nI would like to point out that everything I called on this excerpt 6 months ago has come true AMD has never been stronger as a company.", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "You said “I will keep this short and sweet,” but then you proceeded to do the exact opposite", "score": 55, "replies": []}, {"body": "Semiconductors are being shorted even though they're doing great, and demand is still high.", "score": 26, "replies": []}, {"body": "each wafer is a circular slice of the pure silicon ingot, which is patterened then cut into chips of whatever size. \n\nEach wafer tends to have the same number of \"defects\", which will hurt the chip which contains that defect. Usually in a way where it is still usable with a section disabled (hence making a 4 or 6 core CPU out of the same die that is used to make the 8 core models). \n\nLarger chips can contain more cores, more circuitry for on-die memory cache, more circuitry for doing advanced computations in hardware, or whatever else makes them go faster. Like displacement in an engine. However, larger dies mean that the odds of getting a chip with no defects decreases. \n\nDue to the math of cutting rectilinear dies out of a circular wafer of some size, the effective yield (percent of chips without defects) is inversely proportional with the *square* of the area of the chip. In other words, double the chip size and you decrease yields by a factor of 4, making the top end chip 4x as expensive. If you can make an 8 core monolithic die for $200, and a 32-core monolithic die takes about 4x as much area to manufacture, it's going to cost about $3200. \n\nThis is why the multi-chip design is so huge. If you can make an 8-core chip for $200 and stich 4 of them together for another $200, well you've only spent $1k to get the same performance as the $3200 monolithic 32-core design. \n\nGetting those multi-chip modules to function as smoothly as an old fashioned monolithic die is complicated, imagine building a car with 4 small engines attached to each wheel instead of 1 big engine attached to a drivetrain. But now the technology is good enough that it basically works seamlessly from the customers perspective. \n\nIntel can do the exact same thing of course, but AMD has already spent years and probably at least 3-5B on developing the technology to the point that they can sell it to customers who effectively get 32- or 64-core CPUs, for a quarter the price of something equivalent from Intel (if they even have a competitive option).", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "This is actually spot-on information.

Inflation MoM increased by 1.23%. The only reason YoY inflation wasn’t as high as last month is because last year April came in up 1.6% MoM.\n\nAll Smoke & Mirrors. Inflation is up big month over month. I posted this before the numbers came out. \n\nApril YoY CPI is expected to come in at 8.1%. March was 8.5% YoY. The only reason this month is expected to come in lower YoY is simply because the increase in inflation from March to April this year is expected to be lower than the same period last year. Even so, an 8.1% increase YoY in April still represents quite a large unsustainable jump. Last years March to April jump was 1.6% leading to a CPI of 4.2%. The 8.1% estimate represents a YoY increase of 8.1% higher than prices were AFTER the 4.2% a year ago (That’s roughly 12.5% price increases over a 24 month period). In order to hit the Feds target rate of inflation of 2% YoY, we should expect an average jump of 0.17 month to month. So, in order for inflation to be increasing at sustainable rates, we should look for 8.5%+0.17%-1.6%= roughly 7.07% (I say “roughly” because when we’re talking about a rate of increase we should factor in the compounding nature of inflation) . Therefore the consensus of 8.1% actually represents a jump of 1.03% month to month higher than sustainable levels. What we want is inflation to be increasing at a rate lower on average than experienced in the trailing 12 months. Last months 8.5% increase in YoY inflation assumes an 0.71% increase on average month to month while this month is expected to be an increase of 1.03% month to month. So what I would like to see is the CPI coming in lower than 7.61% for April 2022, although current April consensus is 0.49% higher. So to get the true feel of how bad inflation is, look at the MoM numbers … not the YoY numbers. Now … I don’t know how the hell analyst came up with that 8.1% consensus. I was expecting much lower given the 1.6% month to month jump last year. But understanding these numbers is important.

Today, the DOW is at 32,000, so over the last 26 years, the market has grown by 5.8x, meaning an average annual return of around 7%.

But you could say that from the years 2000 - 2010 (the 10 years covering those two crashes), the DOW was basically flat overall - it was around 10,000 entering year 2000, and it stood again at around 10,000 entering the year 2010.

There are a number of ways to combat that. Two key ways this is being addressed is the **raising of interest rates** and **ceasing the practice of Quantitative Easing** (QE). Somewhat oversimplifying, but basically the Federal Reserve raised the rate on how much it costs to pay off debt (raising interest rates) making it more costly to take out new loans, as well as stopped the constant buying of American securities disguised as economic aid (QE).\n\nThese two forces have both direct and indirect effects. To try to keep it concise, companies that are considered \"growth stocks\" are often valued based on what they might be worth down the road, and so raising interest rates will make their debt more costly. And with QE eliminated, that generally negatively impacts the market.\n\nThe other effect inflation may have is that it creates the need for investors to **liquidate**, meaning to sell off their investments. Since basic consumer staples (everyday items) cost more money, more cash is needed to purchase the same items. So that could be an issue if your money is tied up in stocks. There also may be **psychological pressures to sell**, as hearing all of the doom and gloom about how fucked the economy will be freaks people out, and they look to hoard cash which ironically continues to lose value.\n\nFinally, there are always unseen or difficult to predict downstream effects. There could (more like there definitely is) some extremely sketchy shit going on behind the scenes that may be an effect of the outrageous amounts of margin people were leveraging prior to this - see the GameStop fallout for more info on that (which may have contributed to this current bear market in that regard).

The last couple years, the market went up because the federal reserve bank did Quantits Easy (QE), which eliminated interest rates and returns on bonds, forcing money into equities and real estate and internet moneys.\n\nNow the fed is stopping asset purchases, and going to sell some of the assets they bought. That drives down the prices of bonds and mortgage backed securities, bringing interest rates up because the returns on those assets rise. That means the \"safe\" investment class, bonds, is back on the table with some real returns, so a significant portion of funds will rotate in to those asset classes to mitigate risk. That means selling stocks to buy bonds as the yields rise, so stocks go down. Now, since bonds can guarantee a few percent, that means the risk of owning a stock needs to return more than it did before, which means the price / earnings must be lower. A p/e of 20 means a 5% return, if a bond can do that then the price has to be lower.\n\nRelated, we had record margins used to buy stonks. That borrowed money didn't have interest rates attached, so it didn't matter if they returned this year, or 4 years from now.

Sub Prime simply  means that the people who are borrowing money to buy the houses do not have the proper debt/income ratio to pay back the loans.  Since 08 everyone likes to say \"nothing changed\" but that's where they are wrong.  Banks are very thorough to make sure that you have enough income to support paying a mortgage.  Whether it is a primary residence, second home, or investment property (or all 3!) they do this evaluation to make sure that you can afford each new mortgage you are taking on.  Not only do they make sure you have the income but they make sure you have enough cash/assets on hand to cover payments for at least 3 months.  \n\nThe example about someone doing a cash out refinance - guess what happens when you do that?  The same process - they evaluate your debt to income to make sure you can afford the new payments.\n\nWhat if the housing prices tank???  So what?  If the value of your home goes down, then as long as you still have the same income you had you should still be able to make the payments.  This is VERY different than in 08 where people had mortgages that they couldn't make payments on.\n\nStock backed LOC and HELOC - what about these???  If you are buying a home, they do the same process to verify your debt to income and the amount of cash you have on hand does not matter.  So unless you are using the HELOC/SBLOC to buy a home all in cash the amount of your LOC does not allow you to circumvent the process of verifying your debt/income can support whatever new mortgage you are taking on. \n\nThe only way to \"get around\" the debt/income evaluation is if you can provide a lease agreement (NOT Airbnb income, this does not count for this) then they can apply 75% of the income from the lease agreement to your debt/income for a NEW property you are buying.  But even then you aren't \"getting around\" it, you are just providing another source of income which they are allowed to use in your debt/income ratio.\n\nTLDR:  Sub Prime lending does not equate to lending to people with \"bad credit\", it simply means lending to people who you know can't make the payments of the loan you are issueing/selling.  Banks are much more thorough now than before '08 in evaluating buyers debt/income to verify their ability to make mortgage payments for primary, secondary,  vacation rentals, or cash out refinances.

However, I'd really like to see what your data on second home lending is.  The most important item to consider is how the lender underwrote the loan and what LTV the transaction was executed at. Typically, lenders won't let you take out a mortgage on a second home unless you put down at least 20% - regardless of your wealth/income levels.  And in the case of cash-outs/HELOCs to pay for additional property, that LTV ratio shrinks further because you can only borrower up to 75-80% LTV on the preexisting home.  There are FDIC and NUCA regulations that lenders have to adhere to with this stuff.  And lending practices changed A LOT since 08'.
