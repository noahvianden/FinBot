So the interaction can be complex.\n\n> Or does it depend on volume as well?\n\nYes, though to be clear, volume is just the after-the-fact measurement of what is actually important, which is supply/demand of the contract and trading. It's like taking your temperature. Volume is equivalent to a thermometer reading of 102 degrees, but the *cause* of that temperature (a fever) is what is important.\n\nThe greeks don't matter as much if trading volume is 0 or low, as it often is for options.

Assuming you still mean put, you have a short put and you can't choose to exercise it.  You can get assigned, which is not your choice and which you have no control over.

You have a short position and thus you buy to close it, not sell.  If time has passed, and/or volatility has gone down, and/or the underlying has moved up making the put farther OTM, it will be cheaper than when you sold it, and thus you can buy it back for less than you sold it for, keeping the difference between your initial credit and the amount you pay to buy it back.\n\n>\\--Now here's the other part I don't get related to trading puts.

The contract is nearly worthless but still open in that scenario.  It may be a situation where the ask is $0.01 and there's no bid, meaning no buyer.  A buyer could appear, though--so, it's not exactly worthless.  In your scenario, you've bought the OTM contract, and you can let it expire worthless.  Had you sold the option, you'd want to try to close your position (by re-buying it) before expiration -- that ties it off just in case the unexpected happens.  \n2. Historical volatility is the annualized standard deviation of the historical stock price.  Many try to read the tea leaves by comparing that to IV, which is the market's implicit prediction, as reflected in options prices, of how volatile a stock price will be in future.  However, this analysis helps you only so far.  You can argue there's always good reason to believe volatility will be different from that which history portends.  Both macro- and firm-specific factors will have changed.  So, this exercise will still reduce to your projections for the future and how that compares to the market's view as reflected in options prices.  I suppose some prefer to start from historical variability and adjust from there.  \n3. Looking at both open interest and volume is good.  I learned this long long ago:   \n Investing, and perhaps even moreso trading, is a game of exclusion.  \"I'm not going to do this unless all of my conditions are met.\"  If there's anything you don't like / understand about a deal, let it go by.  And, if you find something you're interested in where the only drawback is some quirk like low open interest but high volume, you can ask about that specifically (include the details) on these boards, a great resource, before pulling the trigger.\n4. Thousands of books have been written on this.  You might want to review some of the basics (gross profit, btw, doesn't appear on the balance sheet) and then reflect on what you're investing style is, then choose a book from that school of thought.  For example, if you're a value investor, a la Warren Buffett, the major standard bearer in that school is Benjamin Graham's classic book The Intelligent Investor.  Continuing this example: When Graham studied a balance sheet, he'd weigh heavily the price to book ratio (book value excludes intangible assets; Graham's dream scenario was buying the stock of great, long-track-record companies when P-B ratio was well under 1).

So the probability of a sanctions-based energy shock hitting Europe has just escalated dramatically. Also, there is no feasible path to an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on account of the sanctions because they are so crippling. \n\nOvernight, headlines appeared that we plan to keep the sanctions in place until/unless Russia completely withdraws from Ukraine, including from Crimea. That will basically never happen because Crimea is strategically important land that can control access to the black sea, that was originally part of Russia until ~~Stalin~~ Khrushchev gifted it to Ukraine, and Russia will be very vulnerable if Ukraine joins NATO with possession of Crimea. So Russia actually had a pretty good claim to repossess Crimea when Ukraine started making moves to join NATO a few years ago and it would be very unlikely for Russia to agree to cede Crimea to end the sanctions.\n\nSo even if Ukraine wanted end the war with letting Russia withdraw to the January 2021 borders, it doesn't have the power to negotiate an end to the conflict because the US, UK, & Europe (which is NATO, basically) are calling the shots with their sanctions & NATO has staged the situation to be a long-running conflict that eats away at both Russia and Ukraine (which, if you recall, is not a member of NATO).\n\nSo now it looks as if the sanctions are going to turn the Russian invasion of Ukraine into (1) an unnegotiable quagmire that cannot be resolved by other diplomacy that doesn't include the end of sanctions, because the sanctions are too crippling, and (2) NATO's declaration that sanctions remain in place until Russia withdraws from Ukraine (including from Crimea) means the conflict will go on for basically forever until it winds down somehow, eating away at both Ukraine and Russia, and that (3) ongoing conflict means a likely include a European cutoff, if not a blockade, of Russian energy. \n\nThat suggests a European recession and possibly depression. Either way, money will likely flee from European assets and more safe haven investors will flood into US assets. Our stock market benefits from global turmoil so long as the economic problems abroad are worse than they are in the US. We're positioned to benefit from the Russian Ukraine war more than any other country, except maybe OPEC producers, because our stocks and bonds can act as a haven while Europe eats itself during a long-drawn out Russian-Ukraine conflict.\n\nNone of this makes any economic sense for Europe to engage in, but it does make strategic sense because the war in Ukraine is really a proxy war between NATO and Russia over strategic territory and Europe is okay with that.

But it's hard to see that NATO actually has Ukraine's interests as a priority and not its own strategic agenda, and Ukraine isn't just a bystander in negotiations to end the war. Ukraine has already stated for a while now that it would agree to a return to neutrality but US & others have continued to press sanctions, so NATO obviously wants more out of Russia than Ukraine does.

Do a lot of DD before I buy, browsing different subs and then digging deeper on what I read, and watch the stock a couple weeks to get a feel for what it is doing first.\n\n Bought SPRT at $4, sold at $8, bought back at $5ish, sold at $50ish. Got $500 of SHIB before it dropped a 0 and made a couple thousand there. Have made some bad calls, but overall getting into volatile stocks and selling calls at a far strike work best for me. Right now am in one with a lot of catalysts, over 1k shares and some leaps I got cheap. If it pays off will make $20-100k from $3k, if not, still playing with house money. Have cashed out about $8k off my initial $250 investment, so willing to take more risks. \n\nI only buy new stock mostly with premiums from covered calls. Basically I buy a stock. Lets say for $5. I sell a weekly for $10 strike, or whatever price I don't mind making a profit at. If volatile I can get $5-50 for the premium. Not much, but adds up if I sell 10 each week. Then I can buy another 100 shares if at $50, and next week sell 11. If it ends itm, I made $2,500 per contract. If not, I do it all over again. Usually will sell contracts on all my shares but about 10%, so if for some reason they sell at $10, but price shoots to $30, I can get that extra profit on remaining shares.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Wow!

The 4% rule is based on the Trinity study. The authors back tested portfolios with different stock/bond ratios and withdrawal rates over a period of up to 30 years from 1925 to 1995.

You withdraw 4% of the portfolio in the 1st year.

I said several things.\n\nPerhaps I should be more clear since you seem to be well-intentioned.\n\nCovid is a flu-like cold.  It was a novel virus, and thus was able to kill a shit-ton of people in the world.  That is precisely what colds do.  The flu also used to kill a shit-ton of people.  Vaccination has helped, but it still does.\n\nThe original covid strain primarily killed the morbidly obese and people with comorbidities.  This is partially due to their lung-function dynamics.  It also resulted in a coagulopathy which killed most of the people that died.\n\nThe world responded with Draconian measures to \"lock down.\"  Anyone that has a scientific education or medical degree can tell you that \"locking down\" will not stop an infectious disease from spreading.  It would be intellectually dishonest to say anything else.  \n\nOne country that did not lock down was Sweden.  They had a ton of deaths immediately in retirement homes, and changed their practice of how they cared for their sick.  They had much improved results thereafter.  Nevertheless, the rest of the world argued that they were doing the wrong thing by not locking down, masking up, etc.  This is despite the fact that Sweden did much better than many countries that did lock down.\n\nMy final point was that Covid was weaponized in the United States by the left to make sure that Trump was not re-elected.  There was 24 hour news coverage that has convinced people that covid was as dangerous as ebola.  It is not.  Additionally, the sites that control information sensor physicians like myself from actually commenting with facts about covid.  It doesn't fit the narrative.\n\nI'm sorry, my final final point was that Trump decided to run the printing press.  Completely disastrous.  He can own that.  However, he was pushed into that call (this is where it becomes my opinion instead of facts) by Democrats using covid as a weapon and treating the pandemic in an unbelievably draconian way.\n\n/ There done posting.
