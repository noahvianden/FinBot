Unless they're called away. But if they're called away my goal is to aggressively sell puts and get reassigned asap. For example, if I sell a 10 day call today when the market is down and has been trending down then come Monday we may be up (reversion to the mean) and a lot can happen in 10 days. I could get my shares called away and I could try selling a PUT at the same price I was forced to sell but that put may only be worth a couple dollars and I set by and watch as SPY goes high and higher leaving me in the dust. If I instead sell  put closer to the money instead of at the strike price I was called away at then I risk actually losing money if I'm assigned at that price. That's the risk with the wheel strategy. \n\nI look at the moving averages. I want the current price to be well above the moving average before I sell a call. I haven't been able to sell a call for months and I'm fine with that. I'll have to wait for a rally. When we are trending upwards I'll wait until a good green day of +2-3% and sell a weekly that's another 3-5% above that price. So SPY would essentially have to move 6-7% in a week for me to have my shares called away. And if they are called away at that price then I'm happy because I sold after a 7% jump in a week. That would be a huge jump and the price is likely to revert to the mean. I can sell a put at the same strike price and the odds are very strongly in my favor that the price will drop and I will be reassigned. \n\nSo I may not be able to sell calls as often as I would like with this strategy but if the goal is simply to beat the market all I have to do is sell a few a year to do that. \n\n\n>Or are you ok trading your shares when you need to instead of closing out a covered call position for a loss?\n\nI tend to always let the option holder of the call or put exercise his option.

Your ideology and mine are based on different stages in the decision; in my mind I am dealing with the trade as it is, meaning I've made the trade, but I see your points as exploration of the trade, things you have not actually done, or have not yet come to pass, so a non-commitment to the outcome and therefore a series of questions that can only be meaningful before the trade occurs as once baked into the plan you walk away from the trade and let it all happen.\n\n>Just because you dont make a decision at a time, doesnt mean you can discount any of the effect a decision or non-decision has on the ultimate result. single track thought processes just lead to single digit returns.\n\nWe've very different views on this as well. In my experience with others panic selling and exiting positions early to avoid negative consequences are the typical outcomes of emotions. Generally speaking double-digit returns occur through sticking to the plan, knowing your entry, your exits before entry, and understanding the nature of the path you expect without actually setting too little time for the theory to play out.\n\nGenerally speaking negative emotions cause double-digit losses rather than double-digit gains either from euphoria (sure-thing thinking) or anxiety (panic deals). Then you have a whole different class of behaviors which is chasing returns which naturally materialize anyway if you just give it time.\n\n>I understand where you are coming from but opportunity cost isnt just wishing you had done something else. it involves the thoughtful calculations of which decision could have been better in order to learn from **the next time** including the decision of switching at that time because there could still be more upside. nothing is so singular, but if you want to ignore the factors that you dont have control over, good luck to you buddy\n\nIf you're in continuous single-form time there is *no* next time. This is what I meant above by saying that you actually have no control; you are running mental backtesting, that is, attempting to learn from the past to garner a future result, which is fine and fair and I don't think is a bad idea but that does *not* impact your current outcomes so much as your future outcomes.\n\nFrom what you've said you're talking about the decision to enter the trade to begin with, which is fine, but I am not talking about that at all. Totally different places. We've missed one another and are not talking about the same thing at all; dynamic trading with the intention to dump positions for better positions with the argument that you can effectively guarantee a stronger outcome sounds, at least to me, dangerous and euphoric.\n\n*If that works for you then it does* but in my experience and watching hundreds of others this does not typically work out well.

Commissions, let's say $0.007 per contract, and $1.7k of margin.\n\nThat's 0.37% return per week, annualized to 21.2%. But wait, what if there is a crash? Even if the crash doesn't hit your strike, it certainly hits your margin. Let's say we lose 10% in a week (which, after seeing yesterday, is more than reasonable) -- in which case you'll first lose $0.39 M2M, and then margin grows to $1.8k.

First, I keep my trades to within 7 days (historical learning) and second,  I have a margin account which uses BPR for collateral. For this single SPY trade (currently 390), the BPR would be around $4K for a 5/25 expiration (6 days).\n\nI also use a homegrown model for finding a strike with a 99% probability of staying OTM. In this case, my model suggests a strike of 350 which has a 6 day premium of .14. That produces a return of $14/$4000 and annualized (365/6 days) = 21% return. That's better than the bank gives, however I personally look for minimum of 30% returns so I wouldn't entertain this trade.\n\nRegarding the risk if the 1% is ever breached (drops below 350), I would enter a contingency BTC order that is 1 point below the strike.

If they double their earnings from where they are today (which would be fantastic), that would still imply the stock price should be cut almost in half.  And that has nothing to do with Tesla, it is just because it will not make sense for the market to value companies with as high P/E ratios when interest rates are higher, since you will be able to earn decent returns investing in less risky assets.\n\nEdit: Rule #1 in investing is \"don't fight the Fed\" for a reason.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Analysts are currently averaging earnings estimates for Google of $111 per share in 2022 and $132 in 2023, a gain of ~19%.  \n\nFor Tesla, the average analyst estimate is earnings per share of $12.35 in 2022 and $15.88 in 2023, a gain of ~30%.  \n\nSo Tesla's earnings are expected to grow faster than Google, but not by all that much.  \n\nLooking further ahead, Tesla will likely see their margins shrink a bit when supply chain issues get ironed out across the industry and other OEMs are able to produce at their typical numbers again.  I bought a non-Tesla hybrid (can't charge at home) about a year ago that has increased in value by about 20% - that is not how things are supposed to work.  When global auto production kicks back up the prices all manufacturers are able to charge are going to shrink.  Tesla will be able to offset that with some economies of scale from greater production, but that won't be enough to fully offset.\n\nI don't want to sound too gloomy, TSLA may still be a good long term play.

Misinformation IS a thing, I'm not denying that. Facts SHOULD be upheld. But allowing facts to be discussed by people who know vs people who don't is paramount to evolution.\n\nHere's a gray area example: Trans people.

Everyone should accept everyone just they way they are. This is true.

You hit the nail on the head here.  *\"Fairly\"*. It's not fair for someone with a fringe, easily debunked minority view that does nothing but enhance division and extol hate towards one group or another, to have a proportional voice to those that represent the majority of society as a whole.  Furthermore, the people that voice these regressive, backwards opinions are still allowed to post their ideologies.  But when they are called out on it and ultimately de-platformed because they invariably double down on their hate, they can't cry that they weren't given an opportunity to express their views.  They absolutely were, and were introduced to the consequences of their own actions.  \n\nIf 5% of people don't understand LGBTQ issues/rights and can't wrap their heads around it, it's not the rest of society's job to continue to coddle them and try to educate them.  They have voluntarily ceased to be participants in intellectually honest debate.  They've had their opportunity and not longer deserve an equal seat at the table when discussing these issues.  \n\nFurthermore, literal bigots who call for restriction of a woman's bodily autonomy do not deserve the time of day to espouse their hate.  If men had to deal with pregnancy, there's no way history wouldn't have righted this problem long ago.  It's misogynistic and bigoted.  It's not up for debate anymore...and yet here we are.  With a fringe minority of religious idiots who don't understand their own scripture that want to legislate against a woman's fundamental right just to be a woman. \n\nThese are the hateful, restrictive, regressive views that have been given the time of day and have been summarily rejected by the majority.  Ergo, they do not deserve a continuous platform to continue to try to push backwards thinking.  Especially in an environment of private companies that have terms and conditions to their platform's use.  You don't like that you can't be a piece of shit online? Then you absolutely will be confined to your shitty corner of the internet that nobody takes seriously.\n\nEdit:  BTW, I'm not denying some hate will fall through the cracks here and there.

They are being given their platform and rightful criticism is being lobbed their way and countermeasures are being taken against foreign propaganda.  \n\nAt what point does the abundance of information and policy about LGBTQ rights issues supersede the mental gymnastics that the unconvinced will always try to perform to continue to believe their antiquated ideology?  Trans people couldn't serve their own country in the military for 4 years during the last administration.  Women couldn't serve on the front lines for decades and are now seen as invaluable members of the force.  Society changes its ideologies because equality is an evolving concept.  Do we need to continue to explain why a woman needn't be excluded from the military front lines?

Russia/ukraine, commodity shortages, a fucked up trade balance thanks to a rising dollar, chinese real estate bubble, insane us housing market shortages, and more. So after the next bear market rally, I think we’ll go down even more\n\nI don’t think the bear market will end until after the fed stops raising interest rates. See, in bonds, there’s this concept of duration. High duration —> high decline in the bond’s value once interest rates increase. \n\nThe same concept applies to stocks. Unprofitable growth stocks tend to have very high duration. Since their expected positive cash flows are far in the future, they get discounted much more when interest rates rise. Hence, high duration. This is a big reason why ARKK has gotten destroyed. Right after the fed started talking about hikes, ARKK fell off a cliff. ARKK’s duration is off the charts, meaning they’re extremely sensitive to interest rate rises\n\nAnd it’s not just ARKK. A massive chunk of the market is made up of growth stocks.

In the case of unprofitable growth stocks, that destiny is resorting to “non-GAAP accounting” to desperately hide their ridiculously high durations. But mommy market sees through that bs eventually. \n\nIn the longer term, we’ll recover. But I think the “bull market” in a few years will be very lackluster.

Do property values plummet when almost nothing is for sale on purpose?

Well, what if BlackRock buys all of those for 200%, 300%, or more of their actual value?  Because that's what they're doing now, BEFORE a crash.  Imagine how quickly they could gobble up property once it's been foreclosed upon.  And you don't get to buy it, even at an inflated price.  It's not going to be for sale.  It's going to be for rent.

Previously, when Biden was engaged in the new energy plan, he met with many auto giants, but Musk, the only person who did not see Tesla, and the U.S. government's various investigations into Tesla and Musk have never stopped, including His investment in Twitter. Of course, these measures against Tesla are also under the legal framework of the United States.\n\n**In the past 24 hours, Tesla has suffered two more shocks.**\n\nFirst, according to the Wall Street Journal, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) disclosed on Wednesday that it had launched a special investigation into a crash involving a Tesla vehicle that killed three people, The accident vehicle is confirmed to be a 2022 Tesla Model S. The NHTSA is investigating more than 30 suspected serious crashes involving Tesla vehicles using the Autopilot feature. A number of other Tesla crashes have also resulted in fatalities, NHTSA records show. Tesla (TSLA.O) did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSecond, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced on the 18th that it had removed Tesla from its S&P 500 ESG Index for reasons including racial discrimination and accidents related to Tesla’s autopilot system.\n\nAccording to reports, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that in addition to kicking Tesla, Delta Air Lines and Chevron out of the S&P 500 ESG Index, it will also add Twitter and Phillips 66 Holdings to the index.\n\nThe factors that led to Tesla’s removal from the index included Tesla’s failure to release details about its low-carbon strategy or code of business conduct, S&P Dow Jones Indices’ North America head of ESG indices, Donne, said in an interview. Dorn also said that while Tesla's products help reduce carbon emissions, Tesla's other issues and lack of disclosure relative to its peers should give hope to judge the company's performance through environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. Investors took notice.\n\nTesla has previously called the ESG measurement methodology \"fundamentally flawed.\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted back after hearing the news: \"Exxon Mobil is ranked in the S&P 500 Global Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Top 10, while Tesla is not listed. List! ESG is a hoax.

Fink, who is close to the WEF’s technocrat head, Klaus Schwab, of Great Reset notoriety, now stands positioned to use the huge weight of BlackRock to create what is potentially, if it doesn’t collapse before, the world’s largest Ponzi scam, ESG corporate investing. Fink with $9 trillion to leverage is pushing the greatest shift of capital in history into a scam known as ESG Investing. The UN “sustainable economy” agenda is being realized quietly by the very same global banks which have created the financial crises in 2008. This time they are preparing the Klaus Schwab WEF Great Reset by steering hundreds of billions and soon trillions in investment to their hand-picked “woke” companies, and away from the “not woke” such as oil and gas companies or coal. BlackRock since 2018 has been in the forefront to create a new investment infrastructure that picks “winners” or “losers” for investment according to how serious that company is about ESG—Environment, Social values and Governance.\n\nFor example a company gets positive ratings for the seriousness of its hiring gender diverse management and employees, or takes measures to eliminate their carbon “footprint” by making their energy sources green or sustainable to use the UN term. How corporations contribute to a global sustainable governance is the most vague of the ESG, and could include anything from corporate donations to Black Lives Matter to supporting UN agencies such as WHO. Oil companies like ExxonMobil or coal companies no matter how clear are doomed as Fink and friends now promote their financial Great Reset or Green New Deal. This is why he cut a deal with the Biden presidency in 2019.\n\nFollow the money. And we can expect that the New York Times will cheer BlackRock on as it destroys the world financial structures.

If you reviewed the holdings of many of these indexes you would probably scoff at some of the names in Top 10. Would you consider Facebook a sound company from a social aspect ? Is Exxon a company that promotes good for the environment ? These are two fairly easy examples that most average individuals couple point out. Now show me the whole list that I can’t Google. How much of this actually fits the bill of ESG. This leads to my point of ESG not being a scam. If there were an index that had stricter interpretations I think it would be great. Investors would gladly pay a premium to earn money in the markets guilt free. (People aren’t always rational investors after all.) And the index would probably perform well.

About 30 million Americans never came back to work and are not even looking for jobs. That’s why they don’t get counted as unemployed. That’s about 171,000,000 hrs of work not being done each day. \n\nWhy did Americans decide to stop working???  \n\nEasy, look at stock prices, crypto, and home prices. Why work when my assets literally go up faster than my boss can put me. \n\nThe AVERAGE home owner in the USA made more from sitting on their couch watching their home value increase than from working. It makes sense that some of these ppl would nope out of the labor force. \n\nOn top of this, going to work has become a shit deal the last 5 years. Look at the actually ppl who dropped out...boomers and very young workers(18-25).\n\nBoomers dropped out bc corporate culture is toxic as fuck. Why would I stay at a job where a blue haired land whale can call me racist if I don’t agree with the current thing Twitter decided was important.\n\nIf I’m 18-25, why would I work? Real tax rates are way higher than any generation before me, and I have to work 2x harder than my parents just to live a way lower standard of living. At my age, my parents worked one job in a restaurant and bought a house for $60k. That same house 30 years later??? $500,000!!!\n\nI can’t afford that even as an entry level software developer who has a side hustle. Why work if my money is worthless???\n\nLastly, the coastal elites really underestimated how poorly ppl would react to the vaccine mandates. A huge number of ppl were fired bc big daddy Brandon decided any colony with a headcount of 50+ would have to have a fully vaccinated staff. \n\nGuess what: boomers like trump and hate getting forced to take the vaccine. Why would they take the vaccine for a job they don’t need???\n\nSo, that’s the story. Young and old ppl don’t have to work Bc gov printed trillions and locked it away in assets. Old ppl have the knowledge to make things work and young ppl actually do the hard work. Both dropped out of the labor force leaving a work force that doesn’t have the experience or the will to get the job done.\n\nSince nothing is being made or done right, supply is constrained and prices go up.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

It does play a role, but people are vastly over-estimating that role because it conforms to their ideological understanding of the world.\n\nLet's dispense with some common myths you see in these comment threads a lot:\n\n**Myth #1: The Fed printed money and the government handed it out in stimulus**\n\nWhat the Fed did to expand the money supply is \\*not\\* the primary source of government stimulus funding. These are two completely different things, and while some of the funds the Fed put into the banking system may have leaked into government coffers because they bought bonds, the money in the rotational funds that are accessible by the government to payback bond maturity is intensely flush with capital since the bond market exploded after 2008. This is actually the majority of the accounting debt in the public debt.\n\nIf you add up all of the spending, you don't come anywhere close to the amount of money that filtered into bonds, and so the government has basically been sitting on a pile of cash they owe people when bonds mature. In other words, no Fed funding was necessary for COVID stimulus and recovery funding.\n\nBut aside from not understanding the basic public finance system, the people who believe this have another problem...\n\n**Myth #2: The Fed prints money and gives it to the people/businesses/the government.**\n\nThe Fed does not print money. The treasury prints money. The Fed distributes and sequesters money in circulation. This is kind of a technicality, because money in the Fed reserves (and in normal bank reserves) is not inflationary because it's not in circulation, but we'll get to that in another myth debunking.\n\nThe bigger problem here is that this belief rests on an even deeper misunderstanding of the banking system. What the Fed does is hydrate the reserve system. You see, savings and loan banks are prohibited from holding high risk assets, so they gain profit from holding credit, cash, loan debt, and safer instruments like government bonds. Aside from fees, the interest and yield from these holdings are where banks derive return from. Banks can since the 1990s ally with investment houses and comingle through lending to some extent, but the banks themselves are limited with what they can do with their capital reserves.\n\nThe problem is that during radical economic downturns (like a global pandemic, which is a stress on the economy whether you have government restrictions or not) many safe assets become unsafe, toxic assets... house foreclosures are a prime example, but in a financial meltdown credit and private loans become toxic, too.\n\nIf you get that meltdown, and toxic asset ratios fly up, then investors pull out of banks and the bank risk ratios get thrown off. That causes a liquidity crisis, then corporate payroll loans don't fund, then paychecks bounce, then payments and local economies stop, and now you're in a real capital liquidity downward spiral like began in 2008.\n\nThe answer, we learned in 2008, was to flood the bank reserve system with cash to fund these lower risk loans, buy up mortgage backed securities transferring the risk to the Fed, and keeping the banks flush with capital.\n\nThis floods the M2, and that money stays with the banks because their risk departments know that the money's going to get clawed back and they also know that they have high toxic asset ratio risk. Going into high risk lending with those funds works against their risk offset strategy.\n\nWhen this happens, the FDIC actually increases capitalization requirements... basically, what happened was that the banks got a margin call, and the Fed funded them... now the Fed is calling the margin back.\n\nThey introduced that money into the system by buying bank bonds and Mortgage Backed Securities. So many of the bonds the Fed bought were already paid for with money existing in the banking circulation system.\n\nSo basically, the Fed didn't put money into the economy... it put it into the bank reserve system, where most of it is just sitting there.\n\nBullard's using this fact as his primary argument for why aggressive rate hikes are fine... and this matters because...\n\n**Myth #3: M2 increases inflation.**\n\nM2 is the total bank reserve system. This is all money in the reserve system and circulation. M1 is closer to the actual circulation, but even that is overstating things.\n\nThis misunderstanding comes from a mistake that worked itself into libertarian monetary ideology, where this myth stems from a misunderstanding of the inflation and capital velocity equations in macroeconomics. Those equations include factors for the money supply, which means money competing for goods in Capitalist markets.\n\nThe problem: The operational definition that gets missed is that the capital in this equation MUST be competing for goods, I.e. in active circulation.\n\nM2 is not in active circulation. it's not competing for goods. It's not inflationary as a result. For it to become inflationary, banks have to lend that money out.\n\nSome of the M2 expansion went to expand the market through low-risk margin debt... so some did get out that way, but most large funds end their cycle green, so funds investing on margin aren't really putting capital into the economy, in fact over a long period of time they extract it and return it to banks in the form of margin interest.\n\nPeople cherry-pick data and try to overlay graphs of M2 and inflation, but this is a science 101 faux pas of confusing correlation with causation, and as others have pointed out this doesn't work so well when you stop just looking at the peaks and try to correlate M2 to inflation... it doesn't work as well. The reason the correlation exists is because the few cases of mass M2 expansion happening also correlate to market crises. Plus some of the money does get out, so you do get some inflation... but just being able to match the curve doesn't give you causation for why the inflation is there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(continued)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Most people think about the public finance system as raw debt, like our credit card debt, that comes from government spending.\n\nDoesn't work that way.\n\nMost of the nation's public debt is accounting for the bond market. If you buy a 10 year T-bill, the government gives you the bond and they get the money.\n\nThey don't just spend that money, though they can access it to spend if they need to. What they do is put it into an account to be owed at maturity date and that T-bill goes onto the debt ledger, because it's money that's owed.\n\nThe inflows into the bond market since 2008 have been significantly greater than government spending, so the government is flush with cash, but it shows on the balance sheet as accounted for as a debt offset. If I loan you $100 and you put it into a bank account, you have +100 - 100 = 0 in total commitment. But if you owe it to me in 10 years, you can easily spend that money and keep the debt knowing you can pay it through income (tax receipts) later.\n\nSo the government didn't need the Fed to come in and pay for stimulus, as people presume, and the government wasn't the primary beneficiary of Fed actions. Fed funded banks and financial institutions primarily, though you could argue that this probably promoted some bond buying from the government by institutions... but the bond market data definitely suggests that bond buying wasn't the first thing on banks minds, or we'd have a low yield and very high bond values right now.\n\nSo basically the model for what people think the Fed did and how it relates to COVID stimulus is wrong.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "**Myth #4: Spending increased significantly, driving up prices, mostly because lazy people on government stimulus spent tons of money.**\n\nThis is wrong. We have really solid data showing that aside from the spike in spending in late 2020 that cancels out the gap down in spending in early 2020, spending is largely at the 10 year expansion trendline.  The gap up in 2020, which was inflationary and created most of the inflation in mid-2021 (it takes about 6 months for inflationary forces to create inflation in the economy because of how corporate orders and budgeting and contracts work) and into early 2021 largely exhausted the consumer savings that were built up in the early days of the pandemic, and debt generation was also sitting at the 10 year trend.Basically, in order to get inflation from excess money in circulation, you need excess spending and excess debt generation (since credit and loans are how banks get money into circulation) and the data doesn't show that. It shows a gap-up in a short period of time which generates short term pressure, but that largely happened because the JIT economic distribution system failed to adapt quickly enough during COVID, and production gapped down and didn't gap up quickly enough to supply the market.\n\nThis is the REAL cause for most of the inflation we're seeing... not excess capital spending that doesn't really exist. People look at the gap up and don't account for the fact that it's spending that would have otherwise happened in the economy earlier in the year... and without excess capital spending, excess capital release can't be attributed as a cause since we're largely talking about capital that was already in circulation prior to March 2020 being the money that was spent.\n\nWe still have problems getting goods into stores and oil and nat gas are still under production compared to 2019 levels, and that's all exacerbated by geopolitical issues now.It doesn't help, as well, that we have a chip shortage and the JIT distribution system killed off livestock and cut farming production when the commercial market cratered in 2020 rather than reroute stock to the consumer market (this is also why you couldn't find toilet paper for 6 months in 2020). Oh and now we have a pork shortage, avian flu, and other food stresses due to other causes.\n\nSo we're mostly dealing with a supply issue, NOT an excess spending issue.There's one sector where excess capital likely had an impact, and that's real estate... so shelter costs are likely more heavily tied to M2 increase than other costs because REITs and other methods of packaging and investing in these properties likely benefitted more from investment pressure. Most other commodities require greater local market forces to maintain pricing (which is why oil collapsed down from $130/barrel... speculative commodity prices don't stick if volume can't move). The housing market is collateralized and big money bought up real estate through funds and direct investment return, so that can be tied somewhat to the M2, but is still largely a supply issue, but spending there has gapped up beyond the trend.\n\nNow as banks become more certain of how much of the excess capital they get to keep, and as the Fed becomes more dovish at some point in the future (when is a big question) then you can probably start to see more money entering the economy through lending. When that happens, we'll see spending increase beyond trend consistently, as well as debt generation.\n\nSo will the M2 expansion become a problem without balance sheet reduction? Most certainly.\n\nIs it the cause of our current inflation? The data mostly says no.\n\nEdit: You can tell the people who believe these myths do so ideologically because they always downvote or reject the reality without a good counterpoint.

After all, inflation has been extremely low since 2008, despite all the money we've printed. But it did (along with the extra money from covid aid to families and businesses) probably accelerate the inflation sparked by supply chain disruptions and the Ukraine War.  \n\nOver the past 50 years, we moved from stockpiling tons of spare parts in warehouses to cheaper and more cost effective just-in-time supply chains.  Why pay to build and man an extra warehouse when you can build a swiss-fucking-watch operation where everything is synchronized so the raw materials arrive just when you need them? These are masterpieces of organization that are much cheaper and more efficient in a very cost-competitive world, but also less resilient to supply chain shocks.\n\nCovid fucked up supply chains, which created shortages.  Factories shut down because of outbreaks or because of zero covid measures or because their suppliers shut down; people retired early or decided to stay home creating a labor shortage; ships hung out in Shanghai waiting to be loaded from shut down factories or sat in line in LA to be unloaded at undermanned ports. People started being willing to pay more (or commit to buy earlier) to get product that was in shortage (used cars, PS5s, whatever) and businesses started paying extra to get the limited stock (including raising wages for the limited group of good employees).  With interest rates low and an ample money supply, businesses had a lot of flexibility to spend more competing on products in shortage.\n\nSomething similar happened, especially in the oil/energy and food markets, because of the war in Ukraine.  Ukraine is a major agricultural producer and its ports were blockaded (and other countries didn't want to buy the Ukrainian grain the Russians started selling).  Supply of food goes down, price goes up.  Similarly, buyers start avoiding Russian hydrocarbons, which creates an effective shortage, price goes up. (Also, things were opening up and people were starting to drive more).\n\nDemand in some areas also went up. Consumers have more money-low rates, cheap credit, home value went up, child tax credit coming in-and they can't take a vacation, so they buy shit.  They buy a bigger house cause they're working from home and its driving them nuts. (And nobody wants to downsize and few people want to move, so prices hit the roof). They binge on Amazon. So businesses have even more incentive to bid higher for limited inputs because its selling.  \n\nEventually, businesses had to pass these rising costs onto consumers.

{"title": "It's playing out how we expected", "selftext": "A year ago Burry gave us everything we needed to know about inflation, so I [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr8h1v/why_father_burry_is_calling_the_big_short_20_i/) about how inflation is going to whack us so hard we’d have to rethink our money. Below is an excerpt from the post I wrote back then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Inflation Station 1](https://preview.redd.it/e0jsi2iffi091.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=eab4a50f95f44a68dea6ace1a75bed8c26e5094e)\n\n# Recapping our thoughts.\n\nWe expected some big moves in inflation, which we are getting now. The Fed has unequivocally stated that “We don’t care about your stocks, We need to kill inflation” (I’m paraphrasing) and so interest rates have begun to rise!\n\nI think the meme below provides an adequate solution to the problem we find ourselves in as investors. But we need a more nuanced look as well…obviously…\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Unfortunately most of us sit in the middle](https://preview.redd.it/zv297ahifi091.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad314d55b013eec4eb68d19fd9c62a8354fb02c6)\n\n# What happens next\n\nIt’s ***literally*** all dependent on the data we get from inflation. J-Powell said that they will be completely data-dependent on assessing where interest rates need to go. So all that matters now to the broader market is inflation data.\n\nYou can sort of get a read for inflation data before it comes out if you watch the right things, let’s take a look:\n\n* Commodity prices -high\n* Energy -high af\n* Food - high af\n* Rent - increasing\n* Wages - increasing (labor market is super tight - means lots of competition for labor).\n\nThese things are all increasing. A lot. Inflation “risks” are still tilted to the upside, the war, China lockdowns, and high energy prices- which make literally everything more expensive, are still looming.\n\nBut we are seeing healing in some corners of the market:\n\n* Housing prices are crashing (thanks to high mortgage rates)\n* Freight costs are getting lower (also thanks to demand destruction).\n* Shitcoins are bubble-bursting\n* Shitcos (shit companies) are bursting too. Once Tesla finally hits $60 per share nature will be healed.\n\nThere is also a psychological cycle to inflation. Businesses increase prices, employees fight for increases, and in a circular fashion, inflation can become “embedded” like a habit. This happens in lots of third-world “emerging markets” and is well documented throughout history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kophczdlfi091.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=3baf872a294258c5f39ca5d4f4baa385a906e7ac\n\nNot a good look. Households expect rent increases of 11.5% over the next 12 months…11.5%. From [NY FED Article](https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2022/20220418#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20households%20expect%20rent,from%204.4%25%20a%20year%20ago)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NY FED](https://preview.redd.it/zxq2zhrmfi091.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad478be8be3b491c5852c7e1413837638384a6c2)\n\nThis will lead to more demand destruction, as we have already seen with Target and the retailers. No more stimulus checks…especially not in the face of 8% inflation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kcsj3cyyfi091.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=64cab641cc42df0d77fdb608fbce15f79973799d\n\n# Jerome Powell\n\n***We need to see inflation coming down in a convincing way. That’s what we need to see. And until we see that, we’re going to keep going. We’re not going to assume that we’ve made it until we see that. - DJ Powell.*** [Full Transcript](https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-fed-chairman-jerome-powell-at-the-wsj-future-of-everything-festival-11652821738)\n\nThis is basically all you need to understand right now about the macro picture. And read it closely-\n\n*We need to see inflation coming down in a* ***CONVINCING*** *way. -* Pretty much all that matters now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dlcdyat1gi091.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6c6e95654694e9eeed17191b57608ad0243e35e\n\n# Watch for things breaking\n\nAs Fed hikes shit starts to break.\n\nLots of interest costs go up, consumers pay more on their mortgages, spending declines, and all costs go up. Shit breaks and the Fed needs to push the economy into a recession to dampen demand and kill inflation.\n\nCryptos are going to break.\n\nHigh growth unprofitable tech is going to break.\n\nWhen things start breaking the real panic sets in, and the real buying opportunities.\n\nBe safe out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's my [only fans](https://purplefloyd.substack.com/)", "id": "utf2s2", "created_utc": 1653000089.0, "score": 123, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|25|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|128|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvs9uv/uptick_in_onlyfans_registrations_good_news_for/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq6dcy/value_investing_isnt_dead_and_value_etfs_are_not/) [x](https://i.redd.it/xrn4dvp826w71.png) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qhmdu8/discovery_isnt_discovery_discovery_is_a_full_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ywzr/gme_could_just_be_the_first_of_many_to_squeeze/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qhjpif/discovery_is_no_longer_discovery_its_warner_media/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkdega/futu_holdings_is_going_to_continue_printing/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19gv8/im_a_dirty_raccoon_and_i_just_found_gold/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qhjzq4/discovery_is_no_longer_a_bet_on_discovery_its_a/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvsf03/uptick_in_onlyfans_registrations_good_news_for/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qbzmoc/discovery_inc_is_set_to_pop_maybe_3x_in_the_next/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9r7lj/oil_dd_ape_noises/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qbzog8/discovery_inc_is_set_to_pop_maybe_3x_in_the_next/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qc006v/discovery_inc_is_set_to_pop_maybe_3x_in_the_next/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg4oot/this_isnt_gme_its_sony_sne_dd_console_cycle/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkc0j4/futu_holdings_is_a_money_printing_machine_if_you/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkby4u/futu_is_literally_a_money_printing_machine_you/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr8h1v/why_father_burry_is_calling_the_big_short_20_i/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=utf2s2)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=utf2s2)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The verizon thing is scary.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "What verizon thing", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That Verizon thing.
