{"title": "Nvidia pays $5.5 million for allegedly hiding how many gaming GPUs were sold to crypto miners", "selftext": "Link to article from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/6/23059930/nvidia-sec-charges-fine-settlement-gaming-gpu-crypto-mining)\n\n\"Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to “gaming,” hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn’t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.\n\nThe charges stem from Nvidia’s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. “The company’s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,” the order says.\n\nGiven the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia’s sales numbers didn’t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. “NVIDIA’s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company’s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,” the SEC alleges.\n\nDespite this, Nvidia didn’t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division’s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors’ anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.\n\n“NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”\"", "id": "ukadoa", "created_utc": 1651918855.0, "score": 1199, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "Drop in the ocean.", "score": 398, "replies": [{"body": "cost of doing business", "score": 171, "replies": []}, {"body": "Barely even a drop lol", "score": 86, "replies": []}, {"body": "You say this, but the fine is not what matters here.

Most companies tend to be fairly conservative and only report what they absolutely have to, legally, in order to avoid giving competitors more information about their company than they have to.

When companies sell product to 3rd parties they really only know who the 3rd parties sell to or how they use the product if the original seller has some sort of reporting deal with them to get the sales data, and even then, how do you know what a consumer is using your product for?

{"title": "Forget gasoline. Diesel is even more important to the modern supply chain, and we have a crisis.", "selftext": "I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ufio32/how_long_will_insanity_in_the_oil_markets_last/) last week on insanity on the oil markets. There I summarized historic drawdowns in inventories, most pronounced in crude oil and distillates (including jet fuel, diesel). Gasoline was relatively okay.\n\nThis post will focus on developments in distillates, primarily diesel. The picture is getting much, much worse.\n\nFor a broad overview of diesel, [start with this CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/07/diesel-fuel-is-in-short-supply-as-prices-surge-heres-what-that-means-for-inflation.html). You can also check out this Bloomberg Opinion [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-04/u-s-east-coast-diesel-supply-is-running-on-fumes?), which writes \"The surging price of the fuel spells trouble for the global economy.\"\n\n> U.S. distillate inventory is now at the lowest level in more than decade. The move is even more extreme on the East Coast, where stockpiles are at the lowest since 1996. Diesel and jet fuel at New York harbor are now trading well above $200 per barrel, according to UBS.\n\nGraph 1: [Graphs of diesel inventories](https://i.imgur.com/yz84a9i.png) compared to past years.\n\nMeanwhile, refining closures have accelerated in the past 3 decades, ([Graph 2](https://i.imgur.com/LPFJ4Uc.png)).\n\nAs a consequence, the margin to produce diesel from crude oil is hitting all time highs, as [Graph 3](https://i.imgur.com/eba8f09.png) shows. This effect is global, as [Graph 4](https://i.imgur.com/QaluLDs.png) displays  the margins across regions. Simultaneously, the premium of diesel over gasoline is skyrocketing ([Graph 5](https://i.imgur.com/5dtlLMg.png)).\n\nHere is what diesel prices are looking like: [Graph 6](https://i.imgur.com/mPhnDaH.png), for the ultra-low sulphur variety (a type increasingly required by regulators for its lower carbon emissions). You can read more about these regulations [here](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/diesel-fuel/), where it states, \"Diesel fuel now sold in the United States for on-highway use is ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD).\" \n\nWhy is diesel so important in particular? From the same source,\n\n> Most freight and delivery trucks as well as trains, buses, boats, and farm, construction, and military vehicles, and some cars and light trucks have diesel engines. Diesel fuel is also used in diesel-engine generators to generate electricity, such as in remote villages in Alaska, among other locations around the world. Many industrial facilities, large buildings, institutional facilities, hospitals, and electric utilities have diesel generators for backup and emergency power supply.\n\nNow, I mentioned that the problem was across all distillates. What are distillates? \n\n>Technically, a distillate is a product obtained from the condensation of vapors during a distillation process. In this sense, most petroleum products – gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene and jet fuel–are, to some degree, distillates. The process by which they are produced involves heating crude oil and allowing it to rise in a tower-like chamber. Vapor thus created condenses at various levels in the tower, and the liquid is drawn off.\n\n> In petroleum marketing, however, the term distillate is reserved for products in the middle distillation range. These products include heating oils and diesel fuel. The main distillate classifications are Nos. 1, 2, and 4 fuel oils, and Nos. 1, 2, and 4 diesel fuels. Kerosene is also a distillate, similar to No. 1 oils, but is often listed separately for statistical purposes. \n\nHere is how jet fuel, an example of a distillate, is behaving relative to crude oil: [Graph 7](https://i.imgur.com/T4rUZeK.png).\n\nAre we seeing the effects yet? In the trucking industry, [it's not so clear](https://www.overdriveonline.com/equipment/article/15291509/truck-orders-other-metrics-suggest-market-strength-despite-strong-headwinds). There are more cancellations in truck orders, but it's really just orders being swapped for others.\n\nOn the other hand, we are seeing more of this: \"Local Nigerian airlines argue will stop flying their domestic routes indefinitely from Monday after spike in jet-fuel prices — emerging markets are getting priced out as refined oil product prices skyrocket.\" [Sourced from Guardian](https://twitter.com/MaleMosesSyza/status/1523019975165988864).\n\nWhat will happen to gasoline as a result? Yes, gasoline is doing a lot better as Graph 5 shows, but producers will switch to refining diesel over gasoline temporarily due to the margins. This will eventually overcorrect and there will be shortages of gasoline. \n\nThe full album of graphs are stored [here](https://imgur.com/a/k6ImJ3J).\n\nTL;DR: Diesel is entering crisis mode.\n\n**Question to you all**: What stocks does this have implications for?", "id": "uklg1n", "created_utc": 1651954631.0, "score": 544, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 180, "comments": [{"body": "Yep.

I’ll just use colloquial language that is common in op-ed writing to keep it short.\n\nWe could try to offset demand with more energy production, but the ESG investing movement has developed ways to block that. The ESG movement is an investor-side activism that seeks to starve socially unpopular companies of investment capital so that they basically stumble and die. Old energy companies are at the top of the ESG targeting agenda.  \n\nESG activism is a form of financial “canceling” in that old energy companies are put in an existentially compromised situation where they are too starved of capital to keep up energy production, as it’s very capital investment intensive to explore, drill for, extract & produce oil. In the past, when oil prices have risen, oil & gas companies have stepped up production only to lose money as soon as oil prices fall and they become the target of existential shutdown threats again. In the early part of the pandemic, when the price of oil contracts fell so low that they went negative, US Democrats refused to agree to take the opportunity to add to the strategic oil reserve to help support oil prices because they wanted US oil companies to suffer maximum financial setback from the pandemic’s market dislocation, to presumably promote opportunities for renewable energy. And even now there are Democrats in Congress trying to blame/punish oil companies for high prices, threatening to charge companies with price-gouging and/or levy a windfall prices tax on oil. Since oil companies are not the reason  why oil prices are rising, a windfall profits tax would only add to the inflationary pressure while making it impossible for companies to use their capital to increase production anyways. \n\nBecause of all of this ESG and political hostility from the left, oil companies have since learned to keep their capital investment costs under control and use surges in prices to reward their investors, which is to be fair what most other industries do. This is what they are doing now, issuing special dividends, etc. instead of plunging all the new cash coming in on new oil production projects. For the oil companies to reverse course and go back to increasing production every time oil prices surge, they would have to have reassurances that they will have long term support for the increased production from Democrats and not go right back to being targeted for termination by ESG activism. The Biden Administration has declined to provide assurances of support, claiming that there are no threats to the industry or undermining, in effect gaslighting the guys with the gas pumps. So leadership from the Biden Administration has not been helpful in easing the political uncertainty around oil production in the US this year.\n\nWhile I’ve been talking here mostly about US energy politics, similar political complications exist for global oil majors generally, outside the US, too.\n\nIn terms of geopolitical factors, the world outside of NATO are not as sympathetic toward Ukraine as we are. They see it as hypocritical that the world should galvanize to experience hardship and wartime economic dislocations when violence breaks out in a white country when we pretty much ignore the same violence in their countries. The US invasion of Iraq over false/exaggerated claims of weapons of mass destruction is frequently referred to in comparisons to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Afghanistan is suffering dreadfully in the wake of the US invasion, occupation, almost-randomly executed pullout and the subsequent harsh sanctions that are crippling and devastating its economy. We don’t hear about that much in the news. So other oil exporters, particularly ones in the middle east, are less inclined to suffer more direct losses and production cycle disruption over Ukraine than the world was willing to invest in the US invasion of Iraq or Afghanistan. \n\nIt’s against this geopolitical backdrop of some countries’ cynicism about expectations that they should knock themselves out over outrage over Ukraine, that the biggest factor in the global energy shock since March has been the NATO country-imposed sanctions, which, however much you might empathize with NATO’s feelings, are a voluntary, self-inflicted and arbitrary limitation on global commodity supply chains. The sanctions are also under the ongoing control of NATO, in that they can be withdrawn as quickly as they were imposed. If the price of oil is an existential crisis for the West, we always have the option of discontinuing its sanctions and no one else has that power, in fact. But Biden has made it clear with strategic slips that the endgame is to drive Putin from power, which isn’t a goal that a lot of nations outside of NATO share. All of these heated politics create an arbitrary, uncertain and sketchy business environment in which to expect oil & gas producers to suddenly invest billions into production increases because of an energy shortage that is partly artificial and self-imposed by sanctions and partly caused by ESG attempts to cancel the oil industry financially. \n\nSo for all of these geopolitical reasons regional to the US and globally outside the US, oil producers, under these circumstances, are almost forced by the political climate to hunker down under the loads of cash they are raking in, and use the money to pay off debt, pay dividends to shareholders as most companies in their position would do, and otherwise act like a regular company instead of taking on the risks & high costs of going out on a limb to compensate for the disastrous global impact of the ESG activists’ aggressive hobbling of investment into oil production infrastructure and NATO’s sanctions against Russia. \n\nAnd I personally feel that this is fair and rational. In many cases, the same companies being asked to go out on a limb to self-fund expensive increases in oil production during an arbitrary, easily reversed, and self-imposed sanctions-induced energy shock are the same oil majors who had to write down billions in losses due to the sanctions and demands to abandon their businesses in Russia. I was already invested in energy, heavily, well before the Russian invasion, and the stress and turmoil has been unbelievable, with energy companies taking a lot of the risk, losses and blame for things they didn’t do. And every rise in oil stock prices that companies might use to capitalize more self-investment into oil production has come under attack by ESG investors who claim we need to invest in renewables, instead. This is why Tesla, at one point, benefitted from high oil prices more than oil companies. And we cannot count on oil company stock prices reliably staying high to increase their market capitalization, because the attempts to drive the stocks down and deflect the investment into ESG-favored energy/tech companies occur regularly.\n\nThings may gradually improve or they may not. Production is rising slowly and that is to be expected. The releases from the US strategic oil reserve are a small, limited relief that only delays the inevitable because now there’s less oil in reserve and we will ultimately have to fill that back up so it only creates future oil demand.\n\nBut ultimately, the supply chain disruptions, shortages, labor shortages and inflation make it near impossible for a massive new infrastructure push to appear overnight and start building new oil production capacity to replace Russia in the near future, even if oil producers were all in to splurge recent gains in prices on that. In addition, this need for new energy production infrastructure (renewable or non-renewable) is yet another source of new construction demand for materials, labor and energy, driving up already tight supplies and inflation. It adds to short-term energy demand to build vast new energy production facilities to replace the energy that the sanctions take away. So even if oil companies were in a rush to spend billions to build out new production capacity, there’s a finite supply of stuff with which they might do that.\n\nThe answer to your question is also the explanation why, from a business environment perspective, energy companies are the best investments of 2022, if not 2023-2024 (depending on how the geopolitics work out). Because not only have they been punched down by aggressive ESG activist financial canceling tactics enough to be wary of believing that they won’t be eventually punished for trying to increase oil production right now, but they have little motivation to do so when the major factor in the shortages are NATO sanctions vs Russia that NATO can arbitrarily reverse at any time, leaving them hanging, and even if they did have the support and motivation to rapidly expand oil capacity, they don’t have the materials, supply chain & labor to do so among these shortages.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Oil companies don’t even need to invest in infrastructure to create more supply.

But Europe has trailed the US in willingness to add sanctions.  The US can stop importing Russian oil, but for Finland and Germany, that's much more difficult and takes more time to manage.\n\nYour (4) is an entire topic to itself.  I've become aware that some conservative news sites broke a story about Hunter Biden emails - which turned out to be real - but those websites were censored before that was determined.  So I might look at that.  As to corruption, when people leave Congress, half of them become lobbyists - it's a horrible systemic problem, and that problem is more important in my view.\n\nI also agree with Secretary Blinkin's idea Russia needs to be weakened to the point it can't attempt another invasion.  The best way to do that is by providing Ukranians with weapons systems to defeat Russia.  The U.S. government aided the U.S. economy to the rune of $19 trillion during the pandemic (including Fed bond buying).  So I think an amount 500x less, $30 billion military aid to Ukraine, will not be a factor in inflation.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I dont care about down votes.

And yet somehow he could not reach out to leaders of the Eu and tell them same sorry and come to a consensus agreement before he started to invade? Nope.

But I don't know if that opens people's eyes to the split worlds and censorship, but it's worth a try.\n\nI was stunned Russia invaded Ukraine - it looked like a stunt to me.  I don't blame world leaders for being surprised at the first big land war in Europe in 70 years.\n\nJust as I want to be fair about censorship of valid stories, I want to point out that Biden was practically jumping up and down yelling for people keep their eye on Russia.  President Biden struck me as more out in front of pressuring Russia than other countries, who didn't want things stirred up.  Biden was right on Russia.\n\nThe EU only now is discussing ending Russian oil imports.  I think the US wanted to sanction Russian oil at the same time as Europe, but got tired of waiting.  I again view this through the idea that EU + US sanctions are more impactful than each region doing it's own sanctions.\n\nThe EU acting slowly also means there's less pressure on China & India, both of whom are not sanctioning Russia, and are buying Russian oil.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I wasnt just bringing up hunter biden because of his laptop issues.

Pretty sure it's produced in Redmond, Washington; although we could discuss the monopolistic aspects of Microsoft which have caused big problems in the operating system industry.  Shoes and clothes are actually fairly easy to find produced outside of China and South East Asia.  They do cost a bit more though, but are typically well made with high quality materials.  It helps that I don't buy many clothes so can afford a more premium product when I do.  And clothes waste is a big problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I agree that it would be great if things changed, but people need to stop pointing fingers at corporations as if they're solely responsible for all the bad things in the world and aren't driven by their consumer base, which is you and I.\n\nBoth are responsible, and I'm pretty sure I stated that the only valid way for consumers to speak up about this is to stop buying the products.\n\nThat said, this wouldn't have been an issue at all had the US not opened free trade with China in the first place.  One of the few things I agree with Trump on was applying tariffs to Chinese imports.  Although, we should have definitely gone further and applied a general tariff based on the profit margins of the product sold that's universal for all nations.\n\nI don't care if we use cheap labor; Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, etc workers need to eat too.  I care that corporations are profiting massively from it, creating a transfer of wealth from customers to the richest people on the planet.  That's never a good thing.  Well paid labor is a great way to circulate money throughout all demographics in the economy; which is why it's critical for a strong and growing middle class.  If we use cheap labor from other nations, that certainly builds up that labor force and increases their pay... but while their pay is low, the only way this is reasonable is if prices come down by an equivalent amount.  Otherwise, consumer money circulates up to the corporations, their executives, and their shareholders.   The corporations should not be taking ALL or MOST of the profits for themselves.  That's the very definition of an upward wealth transfer and income inequality.\n\nIt's further adding a problem of major corporations trending towards monopolization of certain products, if they're not already there.  In those cases, there is no competition to force prices down.  If the corporation is using cheap labor, they can still charge a premium price in the target market, spiking their profits, and causing that huge wealth transfer.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'll be honest, I mostly skimmed this.\n\nMy overall point is that you can't draw a line in the sand and say \"this is good, and this is bad, and I'm clearly on the good side.\" The world just doesn't work like that anymore. \n\nie: you're using software developed in Washington, that's going into the corporate pocket of a company that is manufacturing their other products at the factory in the article.

I.e. an engineer might have a stock portfolio, but 80% of his income is still only his work.\n\nA landlord with 10 houses might do most things himself, but if he hired someone to do every single bit of work for him he'd still have 90% of his income through his property alone, only 10% stem from his actual work.\n\nSo the middle class engineer would very much prefer lower income taxes, while the landlord might be in favor of lower property taxes and taxes on effordless income.\n\nOf course the upper class has a say in most things, so unsurprisingly most \"official\" definitions you'd find try to rope engineers into the upper class, because without the votes of non upperclass people the upper class might have a really hard time to get a favourable outcome in democratic elections. \n\nIn other words: *one of us, one of us...*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn Germany upper class is defined the top 10% earners, in the US you say the top 20%, and you yourself state (in my definition correctly so) that the upper class is far less affected by recessions, which is very true for the landlord, but - unfortunately so - not for the engineer \\[source: am engineer and very much affected\\]", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If you're single and make over $80k a year, you're generally considered 'upper class'.\n\nThat figure might be higher in some cities, like 100-120k.

The delivery time (atleast in Norway and alot of EU countrys) are now 9-12months. With increase price on everything and people are not sure whats going to happend, I think people are not going to buy a new car 9 months ahead of time.  \n\n\n\\-The price of  a Tesla have gone up. And the USD have strenghten itself against many other currencys the last months. So that is going to be a double whammy and I think they will increase the price even more. (in Germany they increase the price on Model3 from 42990 to 49900 euro in april).  \n\n\n\\-Tesla is a premium care. But what you need to understand is that alot of countries (not US) subsides electrical cars. So basicly I can buy 1,5-2 Tesla model3 for the same price I can get a BMW 3 series (gas/diesel) 2022 model.  So alot of people have bought Tesla that dont realy afford it because electricity is cheaper and interest is low. But now interest is going up and electricity price in europe is high. A Tesla cost around 1-1,5x a \"normal\" yearly income in the areas Tesla sells there care. If the interest rates go to 7-10% you basicly end up paying 1,5x montly income just in interest rate on your car loan.  \n\n\n\\-Tesla had in 2019-2021 car loans subsides with interest as low as 0.9% in many countries. You dont see them anymore. And that not just Tesla, it was many car companies doing that. These loans usually had 2-4 years before going over to \"market rate\".  \n\n\n\\-We have all read whats going on in China.

I am definitely bearish but I play the market day by day.  A bear market rally is almost guaranteed now even with inflation data being released.  I bonds are currently yielding 9.62%, which is a record level.  It is not a huge surprise that inflation will be reported above 9.4% so the reported number is already going to be priced in.  Other countries are starting to see major issues with inflation and the global economy is starting to slow.  \n\nEven though the entire economy is coming to a halt this week will still be green 😂.  There will always be some bull traps before the big crash... that's what makes it a big crash.\n\nI believe we still have a few more weeks before this gets really bad.
