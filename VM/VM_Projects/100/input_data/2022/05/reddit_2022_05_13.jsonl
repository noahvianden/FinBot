Some of the material (mainly anecdotal) involved people cashing out crypto to buy more dip. And that was the basis for my comment.

The reason banks use this has to do with reserve ratios but much longer to explain why.\n\nQT is essentially possible because of QE. During QE the Fed buys instruments (mostly bonds) of varying maturities to drive yields down. All of these are generally \"long term\" securities, i.e ranging from 1Y to 30Y usually but generally concentrated around 10Y.\nOnce they want to go into QT they can sell these instruments to drive yields up.\n\nBy using both of these they are able to control the front (short) end of the curve by raising the daily rate and the rest of the curve through quantitative measures (QE and QT).\n\nAddendum to the TLDR: The yield curve is essentially a line plot of yield vs duration. Generally speaking longer durations offer higher yields.

So that suggests it's all about variance (since those prices track some kind of 'spread') and not volume? I'm not seeing a market volume term there.\n\nIn other words, since volume is irrelevant and today is spiking up huge, why is VIX not spiking?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This question has been on my mind as well. I don't see how nasdaq ripping 3% can make vix go down.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "As I look at the definition, I see there is no direct link between today's price and the VIX formula. I read it wrong initially (and thought there was some integral over time, not the strike price K).\n\nFocusing on the first integral in the equation:\n\nFor each strike price K, i.e., the price at which you can exercise a put option, there is an associated price of that put contract. For really high strike prices, you'd have the right to sell using a put option, so this would be an expensive contract [high P(K)]. If the strike price was really low, the contract would be worth less [low P(K)].\n\nSo for any strike price K less than F, the 30 day forward price on SPY, this is the right to sell SPY at a price K lower than F. If investors think SPY will crash lower (high VIX) in the next 30 days, than any reasonable value of K has a high price (I want to sell at a price much higher than what I think it will be). If investors don't think SPY will crash lower (low VIX), then the value of the contract isn't so great (my put option might not get exercised). So expectations of SPY will move the curve for P(K) on [0,F] up or down depending on expectations of whether the put options get exercised.\n\nSimilarly, a call option is the right to buy SPY at a price K. For any strike price K greater than F, if you think SPY is going to shoot upwards, then the value of that call option is huge! [I'm going to be able to exercise the contract] But if SPY will stay relatively flat, then that call option is not so great.\n\nThe reason the integrals are from [0,F] for the put and [F, infinity] for the call probably has to do something with the definition of the forward price.\n\nI don't know if you'll read this but I wrote this for myself too lol.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So if in understanding this Vix is based not on current price movement but options pricing on 30 day spy.

By now everyone have seen inverse cramer ETF and how well it performs compared to even the SP right now. Absolutely, we are in bad market, but it still proves the point that these financial advisors on national TV are WAY more dangerous and less spoken of than say Elon. Elon isn't far from being the uncle that can't stop talking about stocks and make you think \"eh, Ill toss a couple of moneys incase he is right.\" He is the worlds richest man and most people do listen extra much to people highest on that hiearchy. \n\nCramer might have been a good hedgefund manager once, but now he only peddles losing stocks and I'd say are as evil as to help in the destruction of Dendreon, a drug seeming promising against prostate cancer.

Really Billy? The philantropic kind man could donate that money to all the causes he talks about. How much does 0.5 billion do for research in a poor country without sanitation?

Because the medical market is far more regulated — thanks to the widespread perception that health care is a “right” — than the chair market.*\n\n\n*Does that sound soulless? True soullessness is depriving people of the choices they require because you’re more interested in patting yourself on the back by inventing rights than by incentivizing the creation of goods and services. In health care, we could use a lot less virtue signaling and a lot less government. Or we could just read Senator Sanders’s tweets while we wait in line for a government-sponsored surgery — dying, presumably, in a decrepit chair.*\n\n\n -Ben Shapiro\n\n\n*****\n\n^(I'm a bot.

Elon Musk has signed a binding contract requiring him to buy Twitter. Legions of bankers and lawyers and Twitter employees and special-purpose-vehicle promoters are working to fulfill his legal obligation to get the deal closed. “The parties hereto will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,” says the merger agreement. (Section 6.3(a).) He can’t just put that “on hold.”\n\n\nThat contract does not allow Musk to walk away if it turns out that “spam/fake accounts” represent more than 5% of Twitter users. We discussed this last month, when Twitter admitted in a securities filing that it had (slightly) overestimated its daily active users for years. The merger agreement contains a provision that allows Musk to walk away if Twitter’s securities filings are wrong — and this 5% number is in its securities filings — but only if the inaccuracy would have a “Material Adverse Effect” on the company. (See Sections 4.6(a) and 7.2(b).) That is an incredibly high standard: Delaware courts have almost never found an MAE. An MAE has to be something that would “substantially threaten the overall earnings potential of the target in a durationally-significant manner,” the courts have said; there is a rule of thumb that an MAE requires a 40% decrease in long-term profitability. If it turned out that 6% or 20% or 50% of Twitter accounts are bots, that will be embarrassing and might even reduce Twitter’s future advertising revenue, but will it be an MAE? No.\n\n“Pending details supporting calculation” is not how this works. This disclosure — that “the average of false or spam accounts ... represented fewer than 5% of” Twitter’s monetizable daily active users — has been in Twitter’s securities filings for many years, always with a caveat that “in making this determination, we applied significant judgment, so our estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated.” Musk had the opportunity to read these filings before offering to buy Twitter, and he had the opportunity to do due diligence on these numbers before signing the deal. (He declined.) He can’t now go to Twitter and say “actually now you need to prove that your user numbers are right.” If he wants to walk, he has to prove that they’re wrong, and also that they’re wrong in a way that has a material adverse effect on the business.

Tesla had global sales of more than 310,000 electric cars in the first quarter of this year, while G.M. is far behind unless it counts E.V.s made by its Chinese joint ventures. It sold fewer than 500 E.V.s in the United States in the quarter. Ford Motor has just started production of an electric F-150 pickup truck and has taken customer reservations for more than 200,000 of them.\n\nYet, G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, is unconcerned. In her view, the G.M. strategy should enable the company to make more affordable E.V.s than most competitors, and eventually to win over many of the tens of millions of mainstream car buyers who are not yet shopping for electric vehicles.\n\nLast year E.V.s accounted for about 3 percent of the 15 million cars and trucks sold in the United States. As that percentage grows, G.M. expects this cost advantage to allow it to overtake most of its rivals within a few years and to challenge Tesla for the lead in E.V. sales before the end of the decade.\n\nThat’s the long game we are playing,” Ms. Barra said in an interview at G.M.’s sprawling technical center in Warren, north of Detroit. “And I’m here to win.”\n\nThe heart of the strategy is a battery pack design that G.M. has engineered over the last five years. Its packs, marketed under the name Ultium, are made up of Lego-like battery modules that can be combined in different sizes and used in any G.M. vehicle, from a compact car to a full-size pickup. Since the modules all use the same parts, G.M. believes it will reap great economies of scale that will drive down its costs and give it an advantage over other automakers.\n\nWhile working on its Ultium design, G.M. also started building four factories with a partner, LG Electric, to churn out battery packs in mass quantities and at lower costs. It has also started retooling assembly plants to make vehicles with Ultium packs.\n\nMs. Barra noted that most E.V.s sold in the United States last year were luxury models purchased by people who owned at least two vehicles. G.M.’s current offerings are of that type. They include an electric GMC Hummer pickup that sells for about $110,000 and a luxury sport-utility vehicle, the Cadillac Lyriq.\n\n“If you want E.V.s to get to 100 percent or even 50 percent of the market, there have to be affordable E.V.s,” she said. “You’ve got to provide entry models in that space.”\n\nSam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights, said G.M.’s strategy should “in theory” yield cost advantages over time, but said it was unclear how significant they would be and how long G.M. would have an edge.\n\n“Right now seems to be the moment we customers are taking an interest in electric trucks,” he said. “By the time the Silverado is out in volume, Ford will probably have sold more than 100,000 Lightnings.”\n\nG.M. has a lot of ground to make up. Tesla has been assembling its own battery packs for years and has achieved significant economies of scale. Ford took a quicker route to get its electric truck, the F-150 Lightning, into production. It buys the truck’s battery packs from a supplier, SKI, and puts them into a modified version of the gasoline-powered F-150. By moving quickly, Ford essentially has the electric pickup market to itself for now.\n\nFord is also working on its own modular battery design, dedicated E.V.s (that is, not re-engineered internal-combustion vehicles) and battery plants, and is lagging G.M. on that front. Ford has made plans to build two battery plants in Kentucky and one in Tennessee, but it won’t start production for about two years. And before it can start making E.V.s with those batteries, it will have to retool assembly plants to produce them.\n\n“It gets expensive in terms of capital every time you retool plants,” said G.M.’s president, Mark Reuss.\n\nThe first of four battery plants that G.M. and LG are building together, in Lordstown, Ohio, is supposed to start producing Ultium packs later this year. Packs made there will be used in three Chevrolet E.V.s coming out next year that G.M. is counting on to become brisk sellers — a Silverado pickup, and the Equinox and Blazer sport-utility vehicles.\n\nG.M.’s three other battery plants are supposed to start production in 2023, 2024, and 2025. Those plants will help equip more than a dozen E.V.s that the company plans to add to the U.S. market. Its goal is to produce more than one million E.V.s. in North America annually by 2026.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "mary led, and that matters", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Is that a story or a company press release", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "https://twitter.com/anono_mon/status/1525097805986922497?s=20&t=jRTK7YfDzLuWyNF7AX59yw", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I’m still curious if they’re actual battery factories that will be producing cathodes or if they’re just assembly plants where they stuff LG batteries into Ultimatum packs.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "so GM’s strategy is to use modular battery packs to get economies of scale, drive down cost, and beat tesla’s manufacturing efficiencies to offer a cheaper entry level EV? it’s a fantasy.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Imagine you're in the middle of the French Revolution and this dude is writing about how awesome the monarchy is", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tired of winning", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Glad GM is using its dwindling funds to spend money on advertisements like this instead of investing in vehicles that don’t explode", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">**a bold plan to ramp** up sales of electric vehicles and said it would stop making gasoline-powered vehicles **by 2035.**\n\nDoes not compute.

{"title": "Market corrections are a fact of life. That can’t be controlled. What can be controlled, is how you deal with it.", "selftext": "I know this is the first correction for a lot of you. And even if it isn’t, it still fucking sucks. I’ve seen enough ‘I’m considering suicide’ posts yesterday and today to last a lifetime. So I felt compelled to write this. \n\nFirst, I Love each and everyone of you goddamn degenerates. \n\nSecond, I’ve lost life savings twice. Once in 2000 (tech stocks were my fucking weak spot). Second time in 2008 (this time in real estate). I’m not gonna tell you all the simple shit people try and say during this time. Shit like, ‘never gamble with more money that you aren’t willing to lose’. That shit isn’t helpful for where you are at this moment or while you will be if shit gets worse. \n\nI’m gonna give you a few mental / emotional lessons I have learned during times of financial ruin: \n\n1. If you think your whole life is defined by the money you make, or lose…get your head out of your ass. \n2. When you lose a shit ton of money, and I say this with all the respect and empathy in the whole word, don’t be a bitch. Don’t think you’ve done something unrepairable. Don’t allow yourself to go down that dark spiral. Don’t drink. Don’t engage in destructive behavior for a while. Rebalance your life by stepping away from this shit and mentally get to a good space. \n3. Regardless of how deep a hole you have dug for yourself, DONT FUCKING GIVE UP. Sack up and pull yourself (and whoever else you need to) out of the goddamn hole. \n4. If you need to come clean with some about the money you lost, do that shit immediately. It will eat at you and make things worse over time if you don’t. \n5. The people around you love you more than you think they do. But there will be some toxic people that will try and fuck with your mental recovery. If they don’t fight through this with you, and if they use the money you lost against you, then you need to take a break from them. I’m not saying never talk to them again, but they will not help you get back to a healthy place. \n6. A follow on to #5, if some of your relationships fall apart because of your losses, yeah that shit sucks. And it makes all this more difficult to deal with. But guess what, life tested that relationship and that relationship failed. Relationships are complicated. Don’t let a break up derail your mental health recovery. \n7. Be objective about your mistakes. We’re you a degenerate gambler and did you make stupid financial decisions to feed that gambling habit? If so, go get help. The Addiction Center has amazing programs. I went through them and it was life changing (it made me a much better investor as well!)\n\nWe are all in this together. Stay mentally healthy and stable my friends! If you need someone to chat with, DMs are open. \n\nMuch love!!", "id": "uogw6i", "created_utc": 1652406718.0, "score": 923, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 178, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|7|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uogw6i)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uogw6i)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "My dad once told me, “Son, at the end of the day a guy can always jerk off.

[US:TWTR] was on hold pending details on the amount of fake accounts on the social-media platform, prompting a sharp slide in the company’s shares in premarket trade.\n\n>“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” Mr. Musk said in a tweet early Friday. He linked to a May 2 Reuters report about a recent Twitter securities filing with those statistics.\n\n>Twitter shares fell nearly 20% in premarket trade.\n\n>Mr. Musk, who had a $44 billion offer to buy Twitter accepted last month, had said he plans to bring a more hands-off approach on speech moderation to a company that has struggled to reconcile freewheeling conversations with content that appeals to advertisers.\n\nAnd there were people actually wondering why it wasn't free money to buy at less than the offered price...\n\nEdit - article has been updated since originally posted. Text below in case of paywall (no changes above, just adding the full text below) -\n\n>Elon Musk said his deal to buy Twitter Inc. TWTR -2.19%▼ was on hold, raising questions about the takeover and sending shares of the messaging service lower, but he later added that he remains committed to the acquisition.\n\n>“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” Mr. Musk said early Friday morning from his verified Twitter account. The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.82%▼ chief executive linked to a May 2 Reuters report about a recent Twitter securities filing with those statistics.\n\n>About two hours later, he posted: “Still committed to acquisition.”\n\n>Twitter shares fell more than 20% after Mr. Musk’s first tweet but recovered somewhat after his update. Shares were recently trading at $40 in premarket trading, down 11% and well below the $54.20 a share, or $44 billion, that Mr. Musk agreed to pay for the company last month.\n\n>Twitter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>The tweets come as many big tech stocks have been falling on Wall Street, including shares of Tesla, which are down 29% over the past month. Mr. Musk is using his Tesla holdings to help fund the Twitter deal. Meanwhile, Twitter’s stock price had traded below Mr. Musk’s offer price as investors wondered if the deal might get reworked or not get done.\n\n>Mr. Musk might be using Twitter’s recent disclosure as a means to get out of or renegotiate the deal, said Daniel Ives, a technology analyst at Wedbush Securities. One reason is the impact on Tesla shares since the deal was announced. \n\n>“Leveraging his stock and potential sales of Tesla is a huge overhang on the stock,” Mr. Ives said. \n\n>Twitter said in its most recent quarterly report that by its estimates, false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5% of its daily active users in the first three months of the year. The company reported the same figure in its February quarterly update.\n\n>The social-media company warned that its estimate is based on a sampling of accounts and that “the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated.”\n\n>Mr. Musk had vowed to eradicate fake Twitter users and spam accounts as part of his bid to buy Twitter.\n\n>Susannah Streeter, an investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there will be skepticism whether the fake accounts are the real reason for the delaying tactic. “The $44 billion price tag is huge, and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform,” she said.\n\n>The tweeting Friday is the latest twist in the unorthodox attempt to take over the social-media giant by the world’s richest man. It began with Mr. Musk buying a large chunk of Twitter shares on the open market earlier this year as a passive investor, which soon turned into a full-fledged buyout offer, outlined in a four-paragraph letter and several text messages to Twitter’s chairman.\n\n>The per-share offer price of $54.20 contained a veiled reference to marijuana. The latest bombshell comes on a superstitious date: Friday the 13th. \n\n>In addition to financing from Wall Street, Mr. Musk has had to sell at least $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares to fund the deal. He has also assembled a cast of 19 investors, from a Saudi prince to Silicon Valley stalwarts, to put up another $7 billion. \n\n>Meanwhile, federal regulators are investigating Mr. Musk’s late disclosure last month of his sizable stake in Twitter, a lag that allowed him to buy more stock without alerting other shareholders to his ownership, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter, \n\n>Mr. Musk made his filing on April 4, at least 10 days after his stake surpassed the trigger point for disclosure. He hasn’t publicly explained why he didn’t file in a timely manner. An attorney for Mr. Musk didn’t respond to a message seeking comment.\n\n>Amid Mr. Musk’s takeover attempt, Twitter has been dealing with the disruptions in the digital advertising market from global economic turmoil and the war in Ukraine. The company said Thursday that it was pausing hiring and looking to cut costs. It also announced the departure of two senior executives.\n\n>“Effective this week, we are pausing most hiring and backfills, except for business critical roles,” Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal wrote in a memo, which was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Twitter’s move adds to broader upheaval in the tech industry in recent weeks in which several companies have been cutting staff and spending or slowing hiring.\n\nWonder how much he got from shorting it with derivatives before closing the position and tweeting 2 hours later, taking the upside too?

{"title": "The only thing up this year is your rent, and it's up a lot more than CPI inflation says it is!", "selftext": "CPI from the BLS says that rents are up 5% over the last 12 months, but that's not even close to reflecting the rents shown elsewhere.  We all know this though, ask anyone about their rent and you'll get some anecdotes saying 2-5%, but you'll get a lot more saying 15-30%.\n\nThe chart below shows how the Zillow rent index and the CPI rent index starting in January 2018.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k8cghlbiy9z81.png?width=1319&format=png&auto=webp&s=df59c2af4d8785e94c356925693b6d90aeb0b076\n\nNow you'll hear a lot of economists and \"transitorians\" saying this divergence is just due to delays in asking rents (zillow) becoming the realized rents (CPI) that people actually pay.  This is because rents get locked in for a year at a time so it takes time for leasing cycles to go through.\n\nI agree, so I've also produced a chart showing a lagged Zillow measure (the 12 month trailing average) vs CPI rents.  I've also included OER (owner's equivalent rent) for comparison.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqs5mq66z9z81.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=87253b551afe029fc070af854acf2ebee3ebeeca\n\nAs you can see, the 12 month trailing average tracked CPI very closely until 2021.  Since spring 2021 the real world rents have been surging while CPI isn't reflecting it.\n\nWhy would they do this though? Debt.\n\nThe federal government adjusts social security payments for CPI inflation, they adjust federal pension payments for inflation, they adjust your income tax brackets for inflation, and they adjust a ton of other programs for inflation too.\n\nThey know the deficit will blow out if they tell people how bad inflation really is.  Rents+OER comprise 1/3 of CPI, so showing 15% instead of 5% would add quite a bit to the headline number.\n\nThat's not very politically pleasing to tell people exactly how badly their being fucked, but it's reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook at the gap between the lagged zillow number and CPI.  It's blowing out in a historic way.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l6tz4wfsz9z81.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=d566a967efa36194660c81308849fd55fe48dd4f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only play here is residential rental real estate.  It's not exciting but it's at least helping investors keep up with the real world inflation people are actually facing.\n\nJust thought I'd add some more context for all the people in this sub working at Wendy's who are facing eviction due to rising rents.\n\nThough for most of you your parents may let you stay in the basement a bit longer without a rent increase, so that's good at least!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: of course rent isn't the ONLY thing that's up, I meant that in the context of investments, anything you would buy in the real world is up a ton.

A better rent inflation gauge would be to look at multifamily REITS like EQR if you live in a big city on the coast in the US or MAA if you live in the sunbelt...NMHC, industry group, might have some public info too.  Also, CPI for housing is taken infrequently (you need to look at how it's calculated & how often). Housing like a lot of other stuff has crazy price increases (property taxes are a giant one, which a lot of places are experiencing b/c of huge asset bubbles everywhere & unlike a lot of other bubbles the local gov't doesn't like to reassess lower when prices come down), labor to do things, paint got crazy expensive, timber prices are nuts...on the investment front right now something hugely relevant are rising interest rates, which will effect housing prices and bring them down. Your rent may go up but that does not mean the landlord is actually doing better (income +appreciation)....take a look at Residential REITS for example like EQR (one of the largest apartment reits): has been getting smoked lately largely b/c most people see interest rate rises....a $2.50 annual dividend is not helping a $15 stock price decline.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t know how EQR’s loans are structured but if they are floating rate it makes sense for the ETF to go down as their loan servicing costs go up.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I hear you. EQR is an apartment REIT (a single company) so not an etf. It's mainly fixed rate debt and is quite low leveraged compared to private real estate, which the private market accounts for a majority of the market. A semi-reasonably amount of apartment REITS or individual companies will use floating rate as they thought it was cheaper than fixed so that does apply to some other landlords out there. \n\nNonetheless, you are correct that as EQR's debt rolls over to new loans, each of those loans are going to have higher costs so their overall profitability will be worse: there is an asterix that a lot of larger companies have mutliple buildings and their debt will roll into a new loan across many years (some in shorter time periods than others)\n\nA really big thing that is happening now is that the spread of what a landlord makes on investing in a building and the borrowing rate may even be negative for an investor....that is a big deal and can very easily cause a huge crash in all real estate prices, as the vast majority of real estate is leveraged....weirdly enough, even if you are not a direct owner of real estate, there are many people out there that technically indirectly own it through a large market ETF, if you have a pension as a teacher/gov't employee, etc. you are likely invested in Real estate equity and debt as well in a semi-meaningful way; if you have insurance whether health,life, etc, your insurance policy eventually paying out will depend on the income from a building/landlord....things are definitely tied together, not trying to suggest the insurance companies are going to blow up, they tend to make loans on the newest properties at below market leverage, so the risk that they blow up gets a bit hard to imagine. \n\nBack to the original post about inflation though for apartments being higher than CPI says it is, I do agree with this but the manner in talking about it was way off. Housing Inflation (which for CPI is actually rent, not accounting for a homeowner)...and if you are thinking that there are a ton of homeowners out there, you'd be correct, so CPI for housing in that aspect is a semi-shit metric( you could think about massive single-family housing price increases in past year and even with a lag there was no reflection on this in CPI--as it is purposefully designed right now.) Housing CPI being a bit low for a longer period of time is partly because the rental market did have concessions during the height of COVID, did struggle with occupancy and landlords during this time could have very easily lost money compared to what was happening in single-family housing...as a whole group, they struggled but are now just coming off of a low and starting to raise prices....\n\nkind of having wasted my time writing probably too much about how CPI more accurately works and real estate, my own speculation, is that it feels a bit odd looking at the CPI housing number and reconciling this with what is likely happening in the rental market itself, even considering the lag that CPI has built into it...maybe their more specific sources of sampling and then weighting that data have been bad?

Like I said, Trump absolutely has his issues, but to be so blind to history to not see the issues that have festered in the economy due to Democrat policies and just say \"Republicans wreck economy because bad thing happens during presidency\" is so ahistorical it hurts. The current student loan crisis is a consequence of government backed student loans, pushed by democrats. Our deficit has accelerated massively due to the \"war on poverty\", a \"war\" that created a stagnant poverty rate where the poverty rate previously was declining at a more rapid pace than anywhere else in the world. This \"war\", by the way, was brought on by... wait for it... democrats. More recently, the American economy through 2019 had become the strongest it's been in most peoples' lifetimes, and it got bad when Trump caved to the lockdowns and pushed stimulus and bad monetary policy on us to make up for the lockdown stuff. At first, lockdowns were relatively universal. In a month, they were primarily if not exclusively democrat.

I'm not defending that in any capacity, I called the war on poverty a \"war\" because it was not a war in the traditional sense of the word. Obama had the slowest economic recovery in the last 50 years, and it accelerated under Trump, along with the revival of manufacturing in the US (a dead industry under Obama) and US energy independence, destroyed under Biden. The optimal tax rate is difficult to accurately determine, but economists on both sides have some compelling arguments. I tend to not only respect the Laffer Curve, but I also am of the mind that since the Government is the most inefficient capital dispensary of all, the lower the tax rate the better (within reason, allowing for infrastructure and defense to remain fully funded, but forcing these areas to deploy capital more efficiently). The market inflation situation was created under Trump in response to a situation primarily created by Democrat governors, mayors and members of Congress. The response was too large, but the situation that caused it requires at least equal blame for the current inflation crisis. I can't tell you for sure what Trump did behind closed doors, but before Covid he publicly wanted more restrictive monetary policy so that point is certainly debatable. I just don't have enough information to have a solid POV. If you buy into the identity politics bullshit, then tell me, why are an increasing number of black, hispanic, hmong, and other voters going red while the only group that has remained stagnant are white suburban women? The \"Republicans are all racist homophobes\" line of attack shows not only a lack of critical thought but pure vitriolic behavior. The appeal of the Republican Party is simple: they're not as batshit crazy as the Democrat Party. If I were being honest, I'd vote for Joe Manchin before Mitt Romney any day. I don't like political parties, but the Republican Party far more closely allies itself with my views than the Democrat Party because the official platform is shrinking Government (even tho establishment retards don't do that), lowering taxes, reducing red tape, maintaining a strong military, not tolerating laws being flagrantly disrespected whether at our borders or in our cities, not wanting children to be taught about sex in young grades, etc. Can you name a single positive thing Joe has done since 2021 began? I don't ask that to be obtuse, I just don't think there's much he really has fulfilled his campaign promises in any good way.

This is inflation basically.\n\nSome back-of-the-envelope calculations to give an idea what all this means.\n\nBack in 2000, there was about 10.5 T GDP and about 5 T in M2 money supply, so in a way, 1 \"dollar\" bought about 2 \"dollars\" of produced goods (10.5 / 5 = 2.1). \n\nIn 2020, there was about 21 T in GDP and about 16 T in M2 money supply, so in a way, 1 \"dollar\" bought about 1.3  \"dollars\" of goods (21 / 16 = 1.31) in 2020.\n\nTherefore, 1 \"dollar\" in 2000 is worth 2/1.3 = 1.54 \"dollars\" in 2020, and if you use an online calculator, this is roughly the value you'll get for inflation.\n\nIn 2022, there is (projected) 22.8 T in GDP and there is about 21.8 T in M2 money supply. 1 dollar is about 22.8/21.8 = 1.05 dollars of GDP. 1 dollar in 2020 is worth about 1.3/1.05 = 1.25 dollars now. That's about 25% inflation in 2 years, if the projection is to be believed. (Or about 100% inflation since 2000).\n\nSo dot-com bubble losing 4.6 T in 2000 in market value is kind of like losing 1.5 \\* 4.6 = 6.9 T in 2020 and losing about 1.25 \\* 6.9 = 8.6 T in 2022.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "People dont seem to get this.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Doesnt inflation already account for that for most extent.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah but the cpi is not an accurate inflation metric.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "thats one of the worst truncated graphs i've ever seen. like I know why they did it that way, but its just such a bad visualization.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "value lost doesnt really mean anything its all about %.
