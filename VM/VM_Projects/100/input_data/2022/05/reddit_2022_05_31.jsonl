I am sorry my story and questions where unclear. Below I've tried to clear things up and summarise your answers in my own words to check if I get it right. Sorry for the long story...\n\nFirstly, I should have written already invested in XSP \\*options\\*, because I haven’t invested in the XSP as such. Although I don’t know whether that’s even possible.\n\nGood to know there are options on SPX as well. At the moment however, I am looking into micro-options because I would like to experiment with a smaller budget.\n\nThen, concerning to my first question. I meant to ask if an option on an index is the same as an option on a future. From your answer I understand they are not. There are options based on indexes and there are options based on futures. And from the second, the options based on futures, some options are based on indexes. Correct?\n\nOn the risk I meant to ask what the maximum loss of a buying put option on a future is. I think it is the initial investment. Or can you lose more? I assume that buying put options can never lead to bigger losses than the investment. So buying ES puts or MES puts cannot lead to bigger losses than my investment or to margin calls. Right?\n\nThen about the expiration dates: good to know that options on futures have two expiration dates. But do all options on futures have two expiration dates? I mean, do options on a future of an index also have an expiration of the future, or do they just have the expiration of the option? If the latter is the case, can you give me an example of such an option on a future?\n\nI understand that futures can lead to losses bigger than your investment. However, I don't understand that long options on futures can actually lead to losses bigger than your initial investment. Is that what you are saying here?\n\n>If you are talking about the long option, no, unless you exercise or are exercised by exception at a index value that nets a loss.\n\nI mean, I understand that selling a call or a put option can lead to bigger losses than the initial investment. But how can my exercising lead to bigger losses than my investment? I mean, my exercising means I had bought a call or sold a put option. Why would I exercise in the case that it was out of the money?\n\nFinally, I remembered there are also SPY options. I’ll make a comparison of all these options based on the S&P500 (futures). I already found a nice reddit topic on it.\n\nThanks again!\n\nEdit: This is the topic I found. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpg0yr/spy\\_vs\\_spx\\_vs\\_es\\_vs\\_options\\_a\\_comparison\\_of\\_sp/", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Firstly, I should have written already invested in XSP *options*, because I haven’t invested in the XSP as such.

Right?\n\nRight.\n\n> If the latter is the case, can you give me an example of such an option on a future?\n\nFutures have expiration dates. The deliverable for an option contract on a future is 1 future contract instead of 100 shares of some stock. Therefore, if you receive a future contract by exercising or being assigned, you will have the expiration of the future to worry about. That's what I meant.\n\nExample already given above with the options on gold futures. On that page, can change the future on gold to be June, July, August, etc., expiration. Then each of those has an option chain associated with it.\n\n> But how can my exercising lead to bigger losses than my investment?\n\nForget about that part, I'm just confusing you.

You're buying it.\n\nIf TSLA goes up to $800 next week, all other things being equal, the option premium should go up.  But if there is enough time decay (you don't say what expiration date you're looking at) and/or volatility goes way down, the option premium might stay the same or even go down!\n\nThere's no central authority sitting at a computer going \"OK, TSLA's price has gone up, so I'm going to increase the premium of this option by a flat rate of $X or a percentage of Y%.\"  A percentage vs. flat rate increase is meaningless.  If you buy a share of TSLA at 700 and it goes up to 800, was that a flat rate increase or a percentage increase?\n\nIf you were looking at options that expire today, June 3rd, well, they expire today.

How are they not worth at least $40 lol. Why don't you use actual logic to tell me why Intel should be valued at less $40/share, use actual numbers and not wishy washy \"AMD good, Intel Bad\" logic. Because all their numbers have them at a reasonable ratio despite the huge spend.\n\n\nEDIT: Oh forgot to mention doesn't Intel have dibs on the newest Hi-NA EUV from ASML machines over TSMC?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I thought until an apple had bought all of TSMC's initial 3-nm capacity.

Yes, the question is whether or not Intel can turn things around.  Maybe they can, maybe they cannot.\n\nPersonally I have about 10% in Intel, was 15% at one point, which I reduced when it got a little to ahead of itself.  I also own 6% in AMD and a chunk of TSMC and ASML.  I bought AMD via Xilinx, since the 15% arbitrage looked like a reasonable risk to me.\n\nI like Intel because I think it's got good fundamentals, and it's in an industry I think I understand better than most.  I also think it's a good defensive stock, and it returns a dividend.  So that makes it a good long term play for a tax deferred retirement account.\n\nGenerally speaking over the past couple of decades there has been a back and forth with Intel and AMD.  Every 5 years or so they change places as each makes a mistep.  Intel made the last mistep with their approach to EUV for making chips.  However, it was exactly that a mistep, and not a fundament cut in R&D.  They have the cash flow and resources to recover, and likely will.  Right now they are first in line for ASML's next set of EUV machines, which means they'll be ahead of TSMC for a while on that front.  There have also been rumors of a TSMC mistep at 3 nm, which could be nothing, could be a delay.\n\nSo overtime I expect Intel to regain dominance in the field, and AMD to shift back again.  When that will happen is hard to say, AMD has been doing very well of late.  I also don't know when Intel will start to regain the ground.  What I do know is that Intel outspends AMD and Nvidia in R&D, even accounting for the inefficencies of a massive company like Intel.  They also have a oligarchy on fabs with only TSMC and Samsung being able to compete.  Further the number of fabs on the bleeding edge has been going down to the point that I expect that to provide Intel with a nice moat.  \n\nI also like some of the internal bits of Intel that don't get as much discussion.  I think MobilEye is most likely to win the autonomous car race, with their advantage in data.  Intel also has nice plays in AI, Internet of Things, photonics, and a wide range of other cutting edge tech.  They're more than just their processors, a lot more.\n\nSince I'm a retail trader I don't have access to a lot of insider info, nor which makes it difficult to know.  I'm assuming that whenever the transformation happens it will likely be pretty quick, likely afterhours when I cannot trade, with bots soaking up a lot of the sudden spike.

{"title": "Friend getting laid off, Shitposting heals: What Happens in a Recession", "selftext": "As interest rates go up and the Federal Reserve prepares to unload the lowest quality securities starting in June, one may start looking at a recession as a more likely scenario.\n\nRealistically, the above paragraph may look quite optimistic depending on when you read it.\n\nThe goal of this essay is to evaluate what happens during a recession, and if people are so inclined, to direct blame should it be necessary.\n\n## Daddy Powell\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5qjs9xi9mp291.png?width=399&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e9f6c9148dbbc2978e16d836f96bffac42c4b27\n\nWhile the most obvious place to start is the fed - specifically, the FED rising interest rates, I pose that this is attributing too much power to the institution on this particular economic lever.\n\nThe only rate the FED has power over is the overnight lending rate - a.k.a. the FED rate. This is a rate at which banks/large financial institutions are allowed to exchange money. This rate is associated with short-term borrowing rates, but has no major implication on the economy, **even though it may appear otherwise**.\n\nAll the rates that impact the economy are market rates, meaning that they are based on the supply and demand dynamics of participants.\n\nThe long term lending and mortgage rates are all based on what creditors demand vs what debtors can afford.\n\nThe basis for someone to lend money, is that they have to demand a return higher than what they think is the inflation rate + a premium for the risk of the investment.\n\nIf inflation is 3% and the risk of an investment is 2%, then lenders will ask for a 5% annual rate. Unless they are forced/subsidized (which has limited applicability because it would create inflation), a lender will refrain from giving credit below the inflation rate.\n\n>This means that NO MATTER what the FED says, when banks pick up that there is inflation in the economy, they WILL raise rates.\n\n*In some backwater regions (like the EU), banks can’t really raise rates, so they increase fees and settlement expenses etc… It’s interest, they just can’t call it that.*\n\nWe have already seen this unfold. The long term lending rates started going up irrespective of FED policy.\n\nThese are the rates at which credit is lent to corporations, and at which equity investors estimate the value of stocks.\n\n[US Market Rates for Inflation - FRED](https://preview.redd.it/0wp732zelp291.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a7cc1bd90a5370e72d0adece97b5035d83766ee)\n\nThese are the rates that matter!\n\n* You feel the 10-Year rate if you are an equity investor because that is (mostly) why stocks have been going down.\n* You feel a version of the corporate bond rate because refinancing your term loans just got twice as expensive.\n\nNow I have to make it personal, as this is one of the big WHYs in the essay:\n\nYou feel the 30-year fixed mortgage rate because now you have to pay more of your income towards financing your home. If you used a floating rate, your current payments will also increase.\n\nThis makes renting more expensive and affording a home even harder.\n\n**But here is where things get ugly for people:**\n\nImagine a CEO of some company, and you need to deliver on growth. Now, in order to grow, your company needs to spend:\n\n* It needs to hire sales people\n   * Most of these new words people have been using to describe themselves on LinkedIn are nothing but sales.\n* To hire developers and testers.\n* More HR because workers are hard to source.\n* More workers just to make sure the competition doesn’t get a leg up, etc.\n\nBasically, your company is (was) in spending mode.\n\n**So, how does a company/CEO decide how much to spend, and on the other side - Where does it get the money?**\n\nA company can raise money from credit (a loan) or equity (selling parts of the company to investors). That’s it - so the CEO negotiates with both debt and equity investors to get financing and grow as fast as possible. A CEO can’t really decide not to grow, else they risk being overtaken by the competition (there are exceptions, but this is the general approach).\n\n>But wait! Can’t a company just finance its own business? The short answer is NO. The tax law in most countries stimulates credit, and penalizes companies if they don’t get financing.\n\nThe investors, need to make a return on the investment, so they ask for a rate - now here is the problem. **Investors can’t ask for a rate that is reflecting the true risk of a business, unless that is close to the market rate.**\n\nFor example: if a company has 5% risk, but the market is willing to give them a loan or buy their shares at a 1% rate, then investors **have to** also offer a 1% rate, else their cash will be wasted. But what did we just witness? A business has 5% risk, but got a loan for 1%… Where did the other 4% go? Nowhere, they are still in the business, it is just as risky, even though investors cut down on the rates.\n\nYou say, so what? Well, now the CEO can be lazy or imprudent, and will be ok as long as he delivers a 1% return to investors. Which means, that he takes easier projects, can be laid back at work, hires off the cuff, work is portrayed as a fun activity etc… But then we arrive at our situation, where the over stimulation of money LED TO INFLATION, and suddenly, the script flips. Investors now have to demand a 5% return + the inflation of 3% = a nice fat 8%, and what once was a boom, now has to overcorrect.\n\nInstead of having small ups and downs around the true risk rate for companies, we now have a big cycle of an artificial boom (which is over), and a large tightening (the bust).\n\nEvery low return project has to suddenly make large returns or be cut. It’s that simple. CEOs will start firing whole departments, selling off divisions to the competition and reducing wages. Businesses that once thought they were “the bomb”, will go bust unless hard cash flows into the bank. Thus, there will be a lot of pain in markets and at home - everyone is going to be affected.\n\nIn a sense, what the FED claims to be part of their strategy, has nothing to do with raising rates - the market raises rates. As ~~Austrian~~ economists posit, the problem begins when the FED injects money into the economy, everything else is just a symptom.\n\n>Summary: Inflation is caused by the amount of wealth dilution by the central authority - or, the amount of printed money. In the easy times, companies had to produce a return of 1% to investors, so people got hired and rich. Now, those same companies have to overproduce to make up for all the bad decisions they made and make a return of 8% (figuratively) - people suffer.\n\n## The Labor Market ($WEN)\n\n[\\\\\"We are very sorry to let you go\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/jd6w92pylp291.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=72070a9299bd22730491ec1a7240f234b76a7f94)\n\nWhat happens to working people from here?\n\nAs mentioned, a lot of projects and whole companies will end up being cut. Anything that cannot deliver more than the inflation rate will need to go under. For those imagining alternatives, no, a pay cut won’t be enough - From a company’s point of view, a losing project is being cut, the layoffs are a consequence.\n\nSince most of the companies will find themselves operating on the brink, employees will be lucky if they are notified a few months in advance that they are getting fired, while their company scrambles to make the barely profitable segments into actually profitable.\n\n**What about professions?**\n\nHighly skilled and educated jobs are safe. The skilled workers will be safe (or easily rotated) because they can produce more, the educated workers will be kept at the expense of the skilled because HR has to cover their hiring decisions.\n\n*Let’s put it practically, if an MBA messes up, it’s their fault, but if a skilled worker messes up while working in an MBA’s position, well then HR messed up for making the hire.*\n\nSo, doctors, engineers, mathematicians, backend engineers, etc. are likely safe, or will find another job soon.\n\n**For the rest, there will be a rotation. Here is how that may look:**\n\nSales unashamedly becomes top priority (It always was). People will be induced to call friends, relatives, product shill etc. to make the extra close. Both good products and scams will be amplified.\n\nManagers will start calling back those people they once told to “take a walk” - and the phone will be answered, because the other guy needs a favor too.\n\nBusinesses will focus on surviving next month, meaning that “brave” CEOs suddenly look much less brave, and cut R&D and future growth/innovation projects.\n\nESG… What?\n\nMarketing spend will actually get a boost, and those aggressive commercials that we love oh so much will come right back on. *2 Ads on YouTube? Why not 5?*\n\nEmployee training and team-building will involve learning new skills on the bus, and practicing them with your work buddy on the weekend.\n\nOh, and side note, violence and revolt get amplified.\n\nAt the workplace, things will also change:\n\n* People start coming on time.\n* People start working (late) - this is sad, as most people are actually hardworking already… Now it’s about to affect family life.\n* A strict hierarchy will be naturally established, managers will be disciplined and treated with extra curtsy - not because they hold power, but because everyone depends on them to keep the operation afloat.\n* Cheating, backstabbing and looking for alternative ways to get ahead will become commonplace.\n\n>Summary: As the economy tightens, people must switch from pretending to be productive, to actually being productive. Laid off workers will only be offered jobs where they can actually be productive - which may involve more manual labor, or late nights.\n\nAt the start of the article, I mentioned that there is appropriate blame to levy at someone, here it is: Financiers can lend at the lowest bid rate, and excluding fraud, there is nothing they can do to change this. To the extent that politicians have short term horizons, they will make decisions to maximize that utility - which involves intervening in the fragile and dangerous dynamics of the market (subsidies and quantitative easing make credit/rates cheaper).\n\nBut ultimately, politics is downstream from culture and if people don’t want to be productive and skim from society, then this happens sooner or later.\n\nI don’t know anyone that has been able to solve this problem yet, while many have tried.\n\n*In fact… when I think about it, thus far, the most effective attempt to maximize the long term prosperity of people vs short term consumption has most likely been religion - the core tenets not the perversions and corruptions.*\n\n[What Happens When People SIMP](https://preview.redd.it/mx4q8iifmp291.jpg?width=2800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02720235d3df6d2854c7f854b2ea81c758004cae)\n\nHow the hell did I get here…", "id": "v1ed2x", "created_utc": 1653958688.0, "score": 387, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 227, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|14|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|37|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obkczk/psfe_paysafe_dd_a_payment_processor_alternative/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n7av4a/i_valued_msft_at_244_they_are_doing_surprisingly/) [x](https://datastudio.google.com/s/hTa2BVoNgus) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1sg7w/verbund_fundamental_analysis_dcf/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obk6ar/psfe_paysafe_dd_a_payment_processor_alternative/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgbihu/fisker_fsr_nysefsr_valued_at_78b_or_262_per_share/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v1ed2x)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v1ed2x)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'll buy you another drink and we can talk at length about how Irish monks preserved the Roman empire through the dark ages.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Recession/Depression Test: If your neighbor loses their job, it's a Recession.

Your own moral struggle with complicity in a system that has levied a heavy cost from men and women in our society is your battle.
