Obviously we can all see the shitshow in the markets today, which prompted me to post this.\n\nYTD the Nasdaq 100 is down >20%. Across the wider Nasdaq the situation is worse in that big tech is holding up the index, with numerous mid-size tech companies down well over 50-60%. I realize the Nasdaq is still massively up from a few years back - but that could also be an argument for a continued decline/tech staying flat for a long long time afterwards (think about the number of years post 2000 it took for tech to recover).\n\nAlso makes me wonder if we‚Äôll see a similar post-dotcom effect where tech ‚Äústops being cool‚Äù in terms of working there, given for the last decade junior software engineers have been easily earning $200k+ through stock options/RSUs. Will that now end? I realize the contraction of QE has hit the whole market but tech has been particularly hammered.\n\nOn the flip side, the companies in the Nasdaq 100 are nothing like the dotcom era. I was only a teenager back in 2000 but from reading up on it the majority of dotcoms were much more akin to Nikola, Lordstown, Contextlogic etc - ie companies in industries that would grow but the company itself had no realistic longterm future. Compare that to today when big tech companies are near monopolies and are endlessly churning out monster revenue and profits. Yet that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they won‚Äôt stagnate in terms of their valuations over the next few years given how much the Nasdaq has risen in the last decade.\n\nOr is this a fantastic buying opportunity, ie once the market adjusts to QE being withdrawn we‚Äôll see a strong recovery rally over the next few months or in 2023?

When you have stocks like GOOG trading just above a market multiple it's hard to really be worried about its valuation if you're looking beyond a year or two.

Under his (and Ballmer's) leadership, Microsoft was a hostile giant that used its vast resources to undercut and crush competition unethically- and even illegally in some cases. Netscape, Stac (Stacker disk compression), Ichitaro, AIM, IBM's OS/2 and Lotus 1-2-3- these were all innovative products that were killed by Microsoft's underhanded tactics and not simply because consumers preferred them- FUD, bundling, blatant copying, or in some cases adding in obfuscated hacks that would break compatibility or crash with DOS/Windows. They even helped fund SCO's infamous lawsuits against Linux *users*- not just Linux software vendors, but actual customers (and even nonprofits) using Linux. Microsoft had a [notoriously hostile relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish) with both open source and open standards back in its early days- they tried to kill Java's portability (J/Direct), open web (ActiveX, HTML and CSS extensions, plus Internet Explorer \"quirks\"), email protocols, office file format extensions that add little value to the end user but just break compatibility with 3rd party and older MS Office versions, etc.\n\nNeedless to say Microsoft of the 90s and 2000s was a very destructive company and competed primarily by using scorched earth tactics and poisoning the well- instead of providing the optimal choice for consumers. Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft rarely innovated or helped move the industry forward.

It's not even a conspiracy theory at this point to think that the media and government are in each others pockets.  You're just being na√Øve or dishonest now.

The same argument stands though. Certain services cost at least a certain amount of money. There is no way to offer those services to the citizens without the necessary funding.\n\nI assume you've never negotiated a government contract.  The first thing you do is inflate the costs by about 5 times because they are SO incompetent and eager to get it done they piss money into the wind to get it finished. Then their beurocracy usually takes about a year to get back to any confirmations or changes. \n\n> Okay, so let's say if 1 out of a million contracts happened through corruption, it's the same as all being done corrupt?!

Go look into any and all major contracts.  Someones always a brother/sister/long term friend of the company that got it.  It's really not even that hard to see. Where did I say anything about blocking progress?\n\n> Of the presumed corruption in Germany. It's not like you even tried to. You just said all are corrupt, without knowing squad shit about our country politics at all.\n\nBecause the way all governments are set up, it breeds that mindset. 3 seconds into research what do I find\n\n> Transparency International‚Äôs Global Corruption Barometer 2013 reveals that political parties and businesses are the most corrupt institutions in Germany.\n\n> The survey shows that 11% of the respondents claim to have been asked to pay a bribe at one point in their life and only few of those said that they had refused to pay the bribe.[2]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Germany#:~:text=Transparency%20International's%20Global%20Corruption,place%20out%20of%20180%20countries.\n\n\n> No, never said that. I am saying, that voting democrats would result in LESS corruption than voting for the obvious corrupt politicians. Especially, if the primaries result in shady politicians not even getting onto the ballot.\n\nand there it is again 'one part good, other bad'. They are both bad, they both take bribes, they both invade countries for oil and then reap the benefits, they both do insider trading, they both skim off the top.  \n\n> It's a process. The more people inform themselves and vote for the better politician, the less corruption there is.\n\nSo you have a list of every politician and how much they have taken in bribes and skimming off the top? Bull fucking shit. \n\n> Bht especially Americans don't do that, because the system is broken and people like you lost ever faith in the system. Which in turn makes the system not working properly anymore.\n\n'Anymore'\n\nLOL.  The system is in place in order to siphon money from the poor to the rich.  They make things like abortion and gay marriage the central talking point to distract from all the other shady shit they deal in.  The system was set up to do so from the start.  \n\nI'm done with this conversation.  You don't even seem to quite understand how skimming works. Neither of us will convince the other of anything.  I'm just not the one being so naive as to think in a government of hundreds of people who have many years before them of corruption, skimming and bribes going under the radar and a playbook handed to them that the politicians are there for the good of the country on their measly paycheques.  You really think someone will dedicate their life to that extent for the chance at $400k a year.  Nah, it's the bribes, the favours, the greasy handshakes all that attracts only the shrewdest of scammers. \n\nI can only imagine you are one of the younger lot because your faith in 'the system' seems impenetrable.  I don't think you quite understand how much is siphoned off.
