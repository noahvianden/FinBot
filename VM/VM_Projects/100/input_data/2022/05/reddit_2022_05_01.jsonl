{"title": "The stock market is the greatest tool to build wealth, if you're patient.", "selftext": "Look everyone's portfolio is likely looking red, so here's what you need to do: Likely doing nothing for now is the right move. Don't sell at a loss. Work more hours so you have more money to buy solid, economy defining stocks at a fraction of their price they once were and build your retirement portfolio. (PYPL for example, way oversold with a 26 RSI). Downward pressure (bear market) is not forever and doesn't last as long as upward momentum (bull market). In the end, stocks of financially healthy companies will continue to go up. They always have and will.\n\nAs long as you're patient and investing in solid companies with healthy balance sheets poised for future growth (even if growth slows in 2022), you'll be fine.\n\nThe market is forward looking. Once it gets a grip on where the Fed wants to take rates (likely around 2% by year-end with 50bps the first 2 rate hikes and 25bps thereafter). They will then continue to monitor if inflation is going down from CPI data before hiking more. \n\nInflation will go down. Odds are we are here at the peak of inflation currently as we sit. Used and new car prices are not as expensive as they once were and are starting to come down. In my opinion I feel the economy will slow down substantially simply as a result of high gas and food prices re-routing what people can or can't spend their money on. \n\nCovid for the majority of the world except China has pretty much subsided. People will go out and spend money, that's a given. However, they will be limited on how much they can go out and spend due to the increase in food and gas. Once consumer spending decreases, inflation will also decrease. \n\nPrices of goods only go up if people are willing to pay them. Once people stop paying sky high prices for assets and commodities, prices will come back down. I think this will happen relatively soon.\n\nA simple look at the stock market is a prime example. The market is forward looking like I said. People are not willing to pay high multiples of companies due to slower growth in the future. Any slowdown in future growth in a company's quarterly earnings will drive the stock price down. Why? People don't want to pay high prices for a company that's not growing as fast, and nor should they. \n\nThe Fed technically hasn't even done anything beside 'threaten' to raise rates so far. But a hawkish Fed (an aggressive rate hike minded Fed), is scary to the market. If they hike rates too aggressively and slow down the economy too much, then we'll have a recession (albeit a short one in my opinion, but inflation would cease to exist pretty much instantly going this route). \n\nSo far all we have endured is a 25bps hike. With the current Fed rate at 0.25%. Likely to go up to 0.75% on Tuesday, May 3rd. But if they say they want to tighten rates more aggressively than 50bps, the market will naturally have a huge negative reaction because a future priced market does not like slow growth. However this route will end inflation quicker, so the market can go back to normal once the dust settles.\n\nAgain, all the Fed has done so far is mostly talk. They haven't really taken much action yet as far as tightening goes. I'd say the market is currently pricing in Fed rates of around 3% which is taking us well into 2023. Which means by 2023 the market will start pricing in growth for 2024. This is when I think the growth will resume its bullish trajectory. Until then we are likely to remain volatile. \n\nTLDR: Long story short, be patient. Do not stress over what you cannot control. Let the Fed do their job and you do yours. Earn money. Control the budget and buy the dip if you have the means to do so. Real wealth is built during markets like this.

Then, by realizing the capital loss this year, you can deduct them from capital gains and (up to $3000) from taxable income. This doesn't mean you're getting out of the market, but it does mean you can reinvest in another stock that is a good/better buy on the dip. For example if REIT stocks have tumbled but you want to stay reinvested, you can switch from one REIT stock to another, realizing the capital loss on the one REIT stock and buy the other REIT stock on the dip.\n\nOf course, this requires that you screen your stocks and do research so that the stocks that you switch into are at least as good of an investment for the business environment going forward as the one you are selling.  \n\nTax loss harvesting is particularly effective as a strategy when the market has turned because of underlying market fundamentals changing. For example, with the reopening trade still on the table and mortgage rates rising, an REIT that holds casino and vacation hotel properties might be a better holding going forward than an REIT that deals with mortgages. You might want to seriously consider the switch going forward whether or not REIT one is in the red, but it's a much better move if REIT one is in the red, because then you switch to a more solid stock for the new business environment while also being able to deduct the losses from REIT one from your taxes and buy REIT two on the dip. \n\nIf, after you make the switch you decide that REIT one was really, truly the stock you should sit in, you can buy back in after 30 days of sitting out, and you're back in your stock and you still can claim the capital loss on your taxes. However, you have to sit out for 30 days, minimum.\n\nTax loss harvesting is a great way to limit losses and also gain tax deductions during a period of long slow decline like we are in right now. It's not the same thing as trying to time the market because you're switching into another stock that you have researched, so if the market is in a short, temporary dip, you're not actually sitting out of the market. \n\nPeople who sit around in their conviction stocks waiting for the rebound on a 5-10 year horizon are really not working their best tax or investment strategy, IMO. Of course, the amount of benefit that you get from this dynamic approach depends a lot on the quality of the research you do, both on the stocks that you sell to harvest the tax loss and the stocks you switch into.\n\nEdit: Of course, tax loss harvesting isn't a benefit if your stocks are all in the green and value you've lost is from their unrealized capital gains. But if you've been averaging in, the most recent lots of falling stocks you've bought should be red. You would have to set up your trading account to sell the lots with the highest cost basis first, to ensure you're selling stocks that offer tax loss harvesting benefits.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "This is great advice.

Your post mentions a severe negative reaction to 0.75%, which is true.  But actually having \"no rate hike\" would shock the market and cause far more chaos than anything else.  Bonds yields would collapse and volatility would spike, as the Fed could no longer be predicted.  This dynamic of the Fed making slow, deliberate moves that are telegraphed... that is how bond yields have reached 3%.

The partner has tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt and a not so well paying job either.  The one who is financially sound buys a home and is approved for it because everything checks out with his financial history.  They then marry and her debts now become his problem as well.  They are now over that DTI of 50%.  They skirted the rules and were able to purchase a home anyways.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Those are good points you bring up. Definitely worrisome that the mortgage payment to income ratio is so high again.\n\nPeople certainly can skirt the rules, but at least there are some kind of safeguards in place to try and reduce the amount of loans given out to those with too high of DTI. \n\nThere were also a lot of subprime adjustable rate loans back then, which had a very high default rate: https://imgur.com/a/CFjf2JH\n\nThe credit profiles of the mortgages were much lower pre-2008 as well: https://imgur.com/a/mbi4U6Z", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I mean I do agree that we have put in safeguards and I do agree that we have skirted a lot of the problems. I think the housing crash that we will experience will be more of a compounding issue than solely a housing problem in of itself.\n\nIn other words, I think that due to other economic issues that housing will be affected and it could be a significant crash as a result, but it won’t be because of problems necessarily tied to housing itself like it was in 2008. \n\nFor example, we have turned a blind eye for years to the ever increasing average loan length on vehicles. I think the most recent average is 72 months. That’s absolutely insane and it shows people are living well above their means.  And with the new and used car market going insane in the past year, you have people buying new and used vehicles for way more than their real worth. What happens when that comes crashing back down? Or what happens when the person who owes $50k on their car still and is forced to resell it in order to afford their living expenses and only gets $25k? And what about those loans too? Have we looked at them in the same light as the housing market? \n\nWe also paused student loan payments for (I believe) going on 2 years.  Also remember Biden changed the FHA loans for those with student loans to accept the actual monthly payments someone is making under IDR as the debt calculation instead of the actual student loan debt itself.\n\nThere’s also more people investing in the stock market than ever before due to platforms like Robinhood and cryptocurrencies. What happens when people gamble too much or lose due to a crash? Or start taking out credit they can’t pay back? \n\nI mean all of these things can be interconnected with the housing market without there being necessarily any problems with the housing market itself.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "> There were also a lot of subprime adjustable rate loans back then, which had a very high default rate: https://imgur.com/a/CFjf2JH\n> \n> \n\nYeah but now we are going the opposite way, Not variable APR, but fixed apr for houses that start off tens, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars underwater, and add to that in peoples desperation, they aren't even having inspections done in many cases and walking into money pits that they immediately have huge repair bills on.

Remember the housing crisis started in 2008 but did not end until 2012/2013. Add 7 years to 2012 and that brings you to 2019.\r  \nIn early 2020 the pandemic hits, you have all of the stimulus, super low interest rates and talk about housing sales going through the roof with the same 2006 FOMO people going into a frenzy of buying for FOMO again like they did from 2004 through 2007.  \n\r  \nBut back to my original and bigger point:\r  \nEveryone's credit now appears to be far better than it actually is. A few years ago the three credit reporting agencies (Experian, Equifax and Transunion) saw a slowdown in lending due to poor credit (average score was less than 690). So they changed how they calculated the scores, allowed people to buy their credit services to boost their credit scores\r  \n[https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/score-boost.html](https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/score-boost.html)\n\n\r  \nallowed for non traditional, non-credit but recurring purchases to increase ones credit score (such as paying your monthly Netflix bill).\r  \n[https://money.slickdeals.net/credit-score/netflix-can-improve-your-credit-score/#:\\~:text=If%20you're%20a%20long,payment%20on%20your%20credit%20report](https://money.slickdeals.net/credit-score/netflix-can-improve-your-credit-score/#:~:text=If%20you're%20a%20long,payment%20on%20your%20credit%20report)\n\n  \nLast time I checked, paying for a pre-paid service is NOT a form of credit.\r  \n\r  \nAnyhow, what this has effectively done is raise the average score to just under 720. When you look at how lenders differentiate between borrowers this is the difference between someone being labeled as a \"fair\" credit risk and a \"good\" credit risk, or .25% to .50% on a 30 year mortgage. IMO we will see many people get stuck in the same trap as 2008 because their credit scores have been adjusted/ inflated despite having a worse risk profile.\r  \n\r  \nSome other sources of info:\r  \n[https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate)\n\n  \n[https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-the-average-credit-score-in-the-u-s](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-the-average-credit-score-in-the-u-s)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

You are also making strange assumptions about where people borrow their money from. it just seems that you aren't really a serious individual , otherwise you might have taken some time to do the research before making simple vague statements that are not only meaningless, but worthless. Lets say I need 2 acres of land and a small 1930's cabin and I find one for $100K but the cabin must be purchased with cash obtained by the buyer with the equity of the home as collateral. what that required, the bank will not back , nor will any lender offering a conventional loan. They likely don't wish to go through further hassle by accepting land loans. Anyway, a buyer could in fact take the full amount of that money and roll it back into their own loan on their primary without changing monthly income whatsoever. thereby adding real estate to ones investments to assure a future for ones self and his or her children.  It means that person has now made an investment in his confidence. And god willing , if that primary residence appraises higher and higher and if he wasn't such a sore winner.

{"title": "Coinbase is going into the toilet.", "selftext": "How does Coinbase generate revenue?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Coinbase reported over $6.8 billion in transaction revenue for year-end 2021, up from just over $1 billion in 2020”\r\n“Coinbase charges fees of several percentage points to deposit funds and trade, which is one of the main ways the company makes money. Roughly 90% of the company's revenue, as of 2020, came from transaction fees from trading and services like storage”\r\n“Blockchain rewards, custodial fees, its Earn campaign program, interest income and other subscription and service fees contribute to Coinbase’s revenue. In 2021, Coinbase reported total revenue of $517.4 million for these services, an increase from just under $45 million in 2020.”\r\n“The final source of revenue is from the sale of crpto assets, corporate interest and other income. Coinbase reported over $484.6 million in revenue from these sources in 2021, up from just over $136.3 million in 2020.”\r\n\r\nWhere is Coinbase heading? \r\nIn my opinion, I believe that Coinbase will continue to decrease in share price within 2022. \r\n\r\nMarket Reasons:\r\n\r\n \r\nAbove is a graph showing the CPI inflation rate. Currently, for the month of March inflation sat at 8.5% which is well above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2-3%. This should lead to a further loss in discretionary income for Americans which is a big deal for Coinbase as much of their overall revenue comes from retail investors. Overall Coinbase made about 7.8 billion dollars in revenue, however 6.5 billion dollars of that total 2021 revenue came from retail investors alone. Therefore, of cash inflows retail investors make up for 83% of overall revenue. Personally, I think there will be a substantial decrease in Coinbase share price as a result when Coinbase earnings come out on May 10th. I am forecasting a massive earnings miss and as a result I believe the share price will plummet following earnings. Putting things simply, I believe that Coinbase’s business model is sound, especially in a more bullish environment like the one we had since the Federal Reserve began printing money in 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic, but now things are changing. Growth stocks are getting hit the hardest right now and Coinbase will be no exception. Add that in with the expectation of a much more hawkish fed, and I believe investors will begin to flee from tech stocks even despite tech stocks recent drops. On March 23, 2020, the NASDAQ dropped to the lowest level since mid 2018, sitting at 7,502. The NASDAQ peaked on November 15th 2021 sitting at 16,057. Presently the NASDAQ has fallen substantially since that high and is currently at 12,334. The issue I have with this, is a simple look at the NASDAQ shows how much correlation there was between the Feds unbelievable expansionary monetary policy, coupled with our Federal Government’s stimulus and other fiscal packages. As this money begins to be removed from the economy again I believe there will be a liquidity crisis. Credit has never been easier to get since COVID and interest rates had been set artificially low by the Fed for too long. A recession is inbound and many major financial institutions are even forecasting one. Investors will likely move from riskier investments such as Coinbase into less risky investments with steady cash flows such as bonds. With rates finally set to increase by 50 BPS (or more) in the next Fed meeting, bond yields should continue to rise as investors anticipate higher future interest rates. *also watch the 2 year note 10 year bond yields for a prolonged inversion* “Also, the GDP declined an annualized 1.4% on huge rise in trade deficit”. Additionally, while Coinbase could not have had better earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021 I do not believe such growth is sustainable. I believe this because I think much of this growth was driven by money that was artificially pumped into the economy. Much of the money Coinbase has gathered from retail investors as revenue came from government stimulus and other forms of easy credit. While this is a gross oversimplification, and I do believe Coinbase will be solid, especially in the long term, Coinbase still has a rough road ahead with regards to its share price in my opinion. \r\n\r\nWhere I could be incorrect? (Bullish scenario)\r\n•\tThe fed takes a more dovish stance, only hiking rates 25 bps in the next meeting\r\n•\tCoinbase beats expectations and/ or an earnings miss was already priced into the stock as they are at all time lows since they have been public currently\r\n•\tRetail investors continue to pile funds into crptocurrency at a high enough rate for Coinbase to continue their explosive growth\r\n•\tThe crptomarket is more resilient than I believe it to be in the coming market downturn and recession resulting in a more resilient Coinbase share price. \r\n\nPosition: COIN $110 Put 6/17\n\nEdit: Pardon the very simplistic nature of my post, this is my first real options position, and I’ve got finals next week lol. I really am open to all opinions though! The more crayons you eat per sitting, the more valuable your opinion is to me though. I personally think the orange one is the best.\n\nTL:DR - The majority of Coinbase’s cash flows come from transaction trade volume, the macroeconomic pressures such as the Fed increasing interest rates and inflation will lead to a loss in retail discretionary income. Coinbase will have an earnings miss and continue to fall like a stone.\n\nEdit: 5/2/22 Market Close: Down 24% overall.\n\nEdit 2: 5/6/22 Closed Position: Up 35% at time of sale.\n\nEdit 3: Will be opening a COIN $110 P 6/24 on Monday should $COIN rebound above $110 a share before earnings. \n\nAdditionally, for anyone who sees this I made a new DD post on OXY if you’re interested!", "id": "ug4yda", "created_utc": 1651426506.0, "score": 282, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 267, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ug4yda)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ug4yda)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "“Above is a graph\"\n\n/narrator: above there was no graph", "score": 173, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao he belongs here", "score": 31, "replies": []}, {"body": "Haha my bad!
