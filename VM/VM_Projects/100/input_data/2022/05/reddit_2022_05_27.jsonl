Most people that day trade lose money, like 90%. Even most active money managers never out perform the SP500.\n\nThe arguement about time in markets vs timing the markets is more about the concept of long term investing, even more so about index funds/etfs than individual stocks. Not always the case, but usually.\n\nThe idea is that know one can predict the future or when the bottom of the market is and over the long term you make money. It's not a get rich quick thing, but on average you get about 10% return on the SPY. In the past, most the time, inflation sits around 2-3%, so your money is making money. Keep in mind, this is average, so some years are done and some years are up. That's the idea of just keeping your money in the market. The idea of doing DCA, dollar cost average, is just buy some index funds/ETF's every month, regardless of price.\n\nPeople are talking about declines because one of the biggest factors is interest rates. One of the easiest ways to think of investing is so think you are buying a piece of a company and you are buying their future cash flow. When interest rates go up, it's makes it more expensive for companies to borrow money. It also lowers demand from consumers, which means less people buying things. Then you factor in the war, which is being up costs. Those costs need to get passed to the consumer or eat into profit margins.\n\nThere are terms like headwinds and tailwinds. Right now the market has a few big headwinds. Stuff like the war, china lockdowns, possible recession, etc.\n\nAlso, boom and bust cycles happen in the markets. Pull backs and bear markets are part of the cycle. You actually make the most money investing in a bear market, since in theory, those headwinds will clear up at some point.\n\nDay to day, unless it's company news or a huge macro events, the market will just do it's thing.

There was the biggest bullrun in history, money was being printed at an insane rate, memes were big and everything went up. Everyone and their mom were throwing money into the markets, and especially into the C market.\n\nAnalysts consider the halving, but it's a lot harder to consider overall monetary policy or sentiment years down the line. So looking at their estimates, effects of the halving are likely included. And yet expectations have been revised down so much that right now COIN is expected to still lose money throughout 2024 (consenus says EPS -0.09). \n\nI talked above about how hard it is to estimate where this company is going, and because of that you also see an incredibly wide range in analyst estimates which most certainly depends on if they're C bulls or bears. But even the most optimistic, most bullish estimate for 2024 sees COIN fall far short of their 2021 performance.\n\nAnother thing to consider. People who really are into C are often supporters of DeFi rather than centralized exchanges like COIN. Another thing is that it will not be difficult for established banks to establish the services COIN offers once we're at a point where C is expected to stay relevant in everyday life/for the majority of the people. So there will eventually be more pressure and competition from multiple sides.\n\nNow sure, if you believe the uber bulls estimates, COINs fair price for the end of 2024 might very well be somewhere between 150 and 200 bucks, which would obviously make it a great buy right now.\n\nBut looking at the consensus average and it's development, we might well look at a point where the fair value after 2025 or 2026 is closer to 100 bucks or less, which wouldn't make this a stellar investment.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Crypto is now a dead man walking.

Sure, if they posted results like they did in 2021 and were expected to grow as much as they were expected to back then, you'd absolutely wanna load the boat at current prices. But that's not what's happening. Even before their recent acquisitions the expectations for this year were between EPS of -1 and 1. That's down from like 14.5 or so. And they aren't expected to get anywhere their 2021 results for years and years to come. Both the C markets as it's base and COIN itself are also heavily affected by high inflation, rising rates, elevated cost of living and fear. \n\nSo, yeah.

Merely being worth \"more\" doesn't cut it. If you invest in individual stocks, you're gonna have to beat the market significantly. Over those 5 years, the benchmark is expected to return 40-60% in total. Since we're taking on significantly more risk by buying individual companies, we do of course want returns that make both the work we put into it and the additional risk we took on worth it, so an expected return of 61% vs 62% would not cut it. So let's say we shoot for 70%.\n\nFor NVDA, that would mean trading around $322. With a P/E that will likely have moderated a lot by then - let's say to 25, which still assumes that NVDA will have significant growth ahead by then - that would mean an EPS of almost $13.\n\nIs that possible? Oh, entirely. Absolutely possible, no question. Is it likely? Eh. I don't think it's too unlikely, but estimates see it nowhere near. Looking at analyst estimates for the next years and assuming growth doesn't slow down, NVDA is expected to record an EPS approaching $10 in 5 years time. That with a P/E at a 25 multiple, which would be a reasonable multiple if growth doesn't slow down by then, would mean a share price of $250. This would represent an upside of around 32% over the next 5 years or a CAGR of 5.7%, which is below the expected return of the benchmark. So is it a sure thing? Absolutely fucking not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAAPL would need to trade at a share price of $255 (meaning a market cap of more than 4.1 Trillion assuming outstanding shares stay the same) in 5 years. Assuming they stay at the the current, historically high P/E multiple (which is also high for the expected growth), expect EPS slightly above $10 for them as well. Expected EPS by extrapolation sits between $8 and $8.4, and that's assuming that growth doesn't just not slow down further after 2023, but that it rises to current levels again. 25x8.4 would mean a share price of $210, which would represent an upside of 40% over the next 5 years or a CAGR of around 7% and be roughly in line with expectations for the benchmark. That is, however, assuming that the multiple stays as historically high as it is right now. Multiple moderation could well eat up most of these gains.\n\nNow of course, assumptions regarding earnings this far into the future get more inaccurate the further out you go. But I did not make any conservative assumptions here, and as you can see, the possibility of these companies underperforming the expected return of the benchmark is very real.

Even if they manage to scale, how long will it take before they catch up with that? How much debt will they have to take on? How much will they have to dilute the shareholder?

I'm talking 30, 50, 100% dilution\n\nAnd all that for what will be a luxury ev car company if they succeed, which just isn't something particularly special.\n\nLet's look at their Fisker Ocean, which is supposed to roll out this year. Now even if they managed to produce enough of them to deliver them to everyone who has reserved one, and if every single cent from the sell price got to their top-line, and if they miraculously did it without cost of revenue rising (which is obviously entirely utopic), their operating income would probably still sit around -200 to -250 million.\n\nMight as well bet on Magna if you think Fisker is gonna be successful. Because if they are, Magna Austria will be producing up to 150.000 cars per year from 2024 onwards. (At least that's what they hope - they're expected to produce 50.000 cars in 2023)\n\nWhat's your thesis?

Vehicle prices will come down as battery power improves and all of the 17M vehicles sold annually will be electric powered.

Tesla ($12.45), Rivian (-$3.25), Lordstown (-$0.05), Lucid (-$0.25), Canoo (-$0.75) or Fisker ($0.75).

Volkswagen, Toyota, you name them, are transitioning to EVs. Porsche is putting capital into researching and developing \"climate-neutral\" e-fuels (which as of now are way too expensive to be considered an alternative to EV). There's also some research in regards to hydrogen-powered cars. Point is, most of the existing giants are gonna stay in one way or another. Then there's TSLA, to many the company synonymous with EV transition. A company that's already profitable, that's big and scaling. And a company that could secure a place where it's just out of reach if it was executing a bit better. Stock-wise the valuation is obviously silly, but looking at the \"real world\" they are performing.\n\nAnd the next layer, is this: New companies who want to secure a place in the changing market. And there are plenty of them. And they're similar for the most part. They are losing money and are valued rich to ridiculously rich, and they're more or less selling the same story. Do you have reason to believe that FSR will make it in this competitive space, and that they will make it before those?\n\nNow, regarding estimates and valuations: May I ask where you got the $0.75 estimate for FSR in 2024 from? I've found estimates putting them on -$0.48 on average. And how can you say that FSR is not overvalued when it's just barely even getting money on the top line and is therefore trading at a P/S of around 35.000 and a P/B worse than Rivian or Lordstown? How did you determine the value of FSR and how did you determine that it's not overvalued when it was pre-revenue until 2020, then had just barely 100k revenue in 2021 and is expected to need YEARS until profitability. At this point we don't even know if they'll be able to hold schedule or deliver. Do you have an idea about cost and margins on the cars they'll produce?  \n\n\nAs mentioned above, production will be by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria. Now, I'm Austrian, and luckily, we do have for the most part good, employee-friendly labor laws. Now while that's good for the population, it most certainly also means higher cost to produce than they'd have in Bangladesh, meaning we probably shouldn't expect exceptional margins on their cars.\n\nNow I agree that the prospect of what they're trying to do is exciting, it gets my blood boiling, especially because they're not on many people's radar.

(Gotta start somewhere. Of the analysts I follow:  1 hold ($10) and 1 neutral ($17)\n\nWith that said, I always try to make investments in companies with strong leadership/industry experience, and leaner operating models, which is why I considered FSR over F, for example.\n\nFord, and all the other incumbents, have all the large cap bags to carry: real estate, aging and idle plants, a spagetti mishmash of software/technology, international sprawl, unfunded pension obligations, entrenched organizational inertia, and executive compensation based on retention vs relative performance.

I don't believe they are valuable. In fact I think they can be harmful.\n\nWhen you talk about a leaner operating model, what exactly are you referring to? Just the \"legacy\" that some existing companies may have, which is basically what you described above? I guess that may come into play, although I believe having the infrastructure, the brand and the name more than just weighs this up. Do you expect Toyota or Volkswagen to just go away or shrink to 200k cars a year? I don't. Now that's just talking about the future market, I would be reluctant to invest (well, I'd love to invest in Volkswagen, but the price hasn't been right recently).\n\nThere will be winners and losers, I absolutely agree with you on that. And there most definitely will be at least a couple of new players coming up.

That increase in the core personal consumption expenditures price index was in line with expectations and reflected a slowing pace from the 5.2% reported in March. The number excludes volatile food and energy prices that have been a major contributor to inflation running around a 40-year peak. The 0.3% increase on a monthly basis was the same as March and in line with Dow Jones estimates. Including food and energy, headline PCE increased 6.3% in April from a year ago. That also was a deceleration from the 6.6% pace in the previous month. However, the monthly change showed a more marked pullback, with an increase of just 0.2% compared with the 0.9% surge in March.\n\nThe data showed that consumers continued to spend but were tapping into their savings to do so. ‚ÄúConsumers remained undaunted by inflation last month, strongly increasing spending and changing their mix to more services such as at bars and restaurants, and travel and recreation as the weather warms,‚Äù said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. ‚ÄúThe spending was fueled in part by higher wages, and also by Americans drawing more money out of savings, which is a giant stockpile of at least $2 trillion.‚Äù Inflation for the past several months has been moving at a pace not seen since the early 1980s. The inability of supply to keep up with demand has pushed prices higher, fed by unprecedented fiscal stimulus during the Covid pandemic, clogged global supply chains and the war in Ukraine that has sent energy prices soaring and led to fears of food shortages. Responding to the price pressures, the Fed has implemented two interest rate increases totaling 75 basis points and has indicated that a series of hikes are likely ahead until inflation comes closer to the central bank‚Äôs 2% goal.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/27/the-feds-preferred-gauge-shows-inflation-rose-4point9percent-in-april-in-a-sign-that-price-increases-could-be-slowing.html", "id": "uyyf4x", "created_utc": 1653658659.0, "score": 399, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 177, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Or if he was taking a poop he would host an emergency meeting and he would tell them to come over and pop their head over the stall to talk it out.\n\nEveryone just went along with it because it was either YOLO SILICON VALLEY LMAO or they were just too intimidated.\n\nThat all stopped when Michael Moritz, legendary silicon valley investor, and one of Facebook biggest early investors and shareholders, was at the campus doing research for leading a 2nd round of funding. He was doing diligence all day and at one point had to poop and that's when Zuckerburg popped his head over with a smile to ask how's the diligence coming along.\n\nMichael Moritz, not one to mince words, was apoplectic. 'GET THE FUCK OUT HERE YOU IDiiOT LIZARD LOOKING FUCKER.' Mark Zuckerburg nervously tried to laugh it off and persisted, because he really loved intimate poop conversations 'Aw c'mon Michael, it's silicon valley'. Zuckerburg finally withdrew when Moritz flung his cellphone at him.\n\n30 minutes later, Mark was in a very import meeting when Moritz walked into the conference room. 'Everyone except Mark Zuckerburg, OUT'. As intimidated as they were of Zuckerburg, at the time Moritz was the bigger deal, and they all scurried out of the room.\n\nZuckerburg, however, is not one to be intimated by anyone. Not the Winkewoz twins, not Eduardo Savarn, not Peter Thiel, and not one of his biggest shareholder Michael Moritz. Zuckerburg passionately defended his practice, but Michael Moritz was having none of that. Moritz told him that it was a ticking PR and HR nightmare, and threatened to pull out of leading the 2nd round of funding if Mark continued, which would have been a catastrophe for the company.\n\nZuckerburg pretended to arbitrate 'Ok fine, but you need to give me a good reason, because if it were normal, there would be no problem'.\n\nMoritz was flabberghasted at this response. Was this a serious question? He answered with the most obvious answer 'Because.... it's not FUCKING NORMAL'.\n\nUnknown to Moritz, Zuckerburg had guessed a conversation like this would happen as soon as he was kicked out of the toilet stall, and began formulating a strategy to counter Moritz demands. Zuckerburg knew that Moritz would have all the leverage, but Zuckerburg was a master strategist.\n\nZuckerburg went for the pounce. 'Okay, I'll lets write out an agreement, in writing I'll rescind the policy because it's not normal'. Moritz was dumbfounded, but he was used to being dumbfounded by eccentric tech founders, afterall he was also an early investor in Apple, and he still found Zuckerburg tame compared to Steve Jobs. Moritz had a long day of work so they signed the agreement so that he could go back to doing his due diligence.\n\nWhen Moritz left, a broad grin spread across Zuckerburg's face. \" 'Not Normal' eh? \" Zuckerburg said with a menacing laugh. Ever since then, Mark Zuckerburg has been on a life-long crusade to normalize poop conversations.\n\nHe had a checklist of what he needed to accomplish in order to realize this. His advisors would tell him it's impossible, but one by one Zuckerburg checked off the list. From normalizing smart phone use on the toilet (actually a collaboration between Mark Zuckerburg and Steve Jobs), to trusting Mark with their private photos, to normalizing people giving up their internet browsing privacy.\n\nIn 2015, Zuckerburg knew he would hit a wall, having people watch you while you poop was still too much of a leap. That's when Zuckerburg decided to buy Occulus, and eventually shift his company towards virtual reality. If he could coax people into having life-like conversations while they were pooping in a virtual reality, then doing it in the real world wouldn't be too big of a leap.\n\nDo you read facebook or instagram while you're pooping? Ever consider what urges you to do that? It's not your personal preference, it's by Mark Zuckerburg's design.\n\nZuckerburg only has 3 more boxes to check off before poop conversations are normalized.\n\nMark Zuckerburg wants to watch you poop.\n\nAre you going to let him?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KVq4mMF.jpg\n\nEDIT, UPDATE\n\nI just got this in my DM. \n\n>I am a ex Facebook worker.

You talk to a virtual reality therapist who responds with what is described as the greatest AI (though whatever you tell it, it only responds with 'wow, tell me more'). The thing is, the virtual reality assistant has a striking resemblance to Mark Zuckerburg himself. But the most damning aspect is that it's supposed to used only when you're pooping. This feature is described as optional, though uses the most advanced AI for your phone camera to check if you're actually on a toilet, and if not, says 'It looks like you're not pooping.

The fund went on to become of the largest investors in Asian financial markets.\n\nHe preceded to operate **Archagoes Capital Management** based in New York City, New York, U.S.A.\n\nThis lasted **8 years**. This went from **2013 - 2021.**\n\nOn March 26, 2021, Archegos defaulted on margin calls from several global investment banks, including Credit Suisse and Nomura Holdings, as well as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\n\nAnd on April 27, 2022,  Hwang was indicted and arrested on federal charges of fraud and racketeering.\n\n[Bill Hwang - CEO Of Archegos Capital Management](https://preview.redd.it/q9vfox929x191.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f8c74dee35442079f8338165893a6e35898126a)\n\n# Four Charged in Connection with Multibillion-Dollar Collapse of Archegos Capital Management\n\nDepartment of Justice charged him with conspiracy, racketeering, securities fraud, and wire fraud offenses.\n\n**Source Link:** [**https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-charged-connection-multibillion-dollar-collapse-archegos-capital-management**](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-charged-connection-multibillion-dollar-collapse-archegos-capital-management)\n\n# March 2021 Losses\n\nOn March 26, 2021, banks offering prime brokerage services to Archegos started to liquidate billions of dollars' worth of various stocks after it had failed to meet a margin call. The stocks were reportedly tied to the total return swaps held by Archegos. This sale was reported to be the cause of a 27% plunge in share price of Viacom, CBS and a similar fall in the price of Discovery, Inc.\n\nOn March 29, the share price of Credit Suisse was down by 14%, while Nomura Holdings shares declined by 16%. A press release from Credit Suisse said that \"the loss resulting from this exit could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results.\"\n\nAccording to *The* *Wall Street Journal*, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were able to limit their losses relating to Archegos by acting more quickly than Credit Suisse and Nomura Holdings.

Those fired are chief risk officer Lara Warner and its investment banking chief Brian Chin. The bank also cut executive bonuses after suffering major losses.\n\nCredit Suisse, Switzerland's No. 2 bank, was among the last to take action before Archegos, a family-owned hedge fund, imploded following a billion-dollar margin call. Credit Suisse was forced to dump more than $2 billion worth of stock to seal its exposure to the investment fund controlled by Bill Hwang.\n\n# Credit Suisse Launches Probe\n\nCredit Suisse also launched an investigation into the Archegos losses. Credit Suisse shares rose 1.26 percent after the news of the drastic actions broke.\n\n**\"The significant loss in our prime services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable.\"**\n\nIn combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognize that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders,\" Credit Suisse's chief executive Thomas Gottstein said in a statement.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the folding up of Archegos, analysts had assessed that Credit Suisse would suffer total losses around **$5 billion**.\n\nOn Tuesday, the investment banking giant said it is facing up to a **$5,500,000,000** loss from Archegos.\n\nThe crisis unfolded last week when Archegos engaged in the fire sale of about $20 billion of assets after it defaulted on a margin call by Credit Suisse and others. With the value of securities in the margin account of Archegos dropping substantially due to bets that failed, the fund was forced to sell assets in a fire sale, which then created a wave of panic that resembled the Lehman Brothers crisis in 2008. The fire sale saw assets worth about $20 billion, mainly US and Chinese stocks, being sold.\n\nMajor investment banks like Deutsche Bank, UBS, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs etc have been hit by the liquidation of Archegos but they avoided or limited the losses by cutting the exposure to Archegos assets in time.\n\nCredit Suisse, which said it was expecting a $960 million loss for the first quarter, said it has cancelled a proposal for both short and long-term bonus awards for executives.\n\n# Investment Banks' Losses\n\nUBS reported an unexpected $774 million loss on Tuesday from the collapse of U.S. investment fund Archegos, taking the total hit to global banks from the stricken family office beyond $10 billion.\n\nThe charge taken by Switzerland‚Äôs biggest bank comes as the fallout from Archegos continues to ripple across the banking industry, with Nomura posting on Tuesday its biggest quarterly loss in over a decade as a result of its dealings with the stricken fund. The Japanese bank said it will book losses of around $2.9 billion this year on Archegos.\n\nMorgan Stanley lost nearly $1 billion on the family office‚Äôs implosion while UBS‚Äô cross-town rival Credit Suisse has been hit the hardest with a more than $5 billion charge after Archegos defaulted on margin calls in late March, triggering a fire sale of stocks.\n\nUBS, the world‚Äôs biggest wealth manager, said it was now reviewing all of its client relationships both within its prime brokerage unit, which caters to hedge funds, and within its family office business, which manages very large pools of money for wealthy individuals and families. It is also reviewing its risk management systems.\n\n**‚ÄúI understand you‚Äôre disappointed. We are disappointed as well,‚Äù** UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers told analysts on a call fielding queries over the loss, the extent of which had surprised investors.\n\nUBS shares fell 3.0% in morning trade.\n\n‚Ä≥(The Archegos loss) highlights the inherent risk in its capital markets activities and presents a setback against its (UBS‚Äôs) otherwise risk-averse culture,‚Äù Moody‚Äôs analyst Michael Rohr said in a note. ‚ÄúThe bank‚Äôs strong capital and liquidity remain key credit strengths safeguarding its financial profile and ratings.‚Äù\n\nUBS, which had previously declined to comment on any fallout from Archegos, said on Tuesday the revenue hit to its prime brokerage business had reduced net profit by $434 million in the first quarter.\n\nStill, net profit of $1.82 billion for the first three months of 2021 beat the $1.59 billion median forecast from 20 analysts polled by the bank amid a bumper quarter for debt and stock deals.\n\nHamers, who took over from long-time boss Sergio Ermotti in November, was hired to help boost the bank‚Äôs digitalization efforts after a successful stint doing so at ING.\n\nBut his start at UBS, widely lauded as an opportunity to prime the bank for a more tech-centered future, has been complicated by a Dutch criminal investigation into his role in money laundering failings at ING.\n\nHamers announced several strategic initiatives when he spoke to analysts on Tuesday, centered around making UBS a faster and more client-driven ‚Äúdigital native‚Äù firm focused on sustainable investing.\n\nA simplification of its setup and new digitalization efforts should help generate approximately $1 billion in gross savings per year by 2023, the bank said.\n\nUBS has taken a back seat in financial headlines over recent months, after a slew of painful missteps at its nearest rival Credit Suisse prompted losses, sackings and probes at Switzerland‚Äôs No. 2 bank.\n\nHamers on Tuesday said the bank did not feel the need to disclose the loss on Archegos earlier due to the strong first-quarter results, and had no plans to ditch its prime brokerage business following the debacle.\n\nIt had exited all remaining positions in April, leading to a further $87 million trading loss in the second quarter, Hamers said.\n\nTaking a cautious approach towards the second quarter, the bank said it expected client activity levels to come down from the highs seen in the first three months of the year, partially offset by a boost in recurring fees it generates off managing client investments due to higher asset prices.\n\n## Record client activity\n\nUBS derives the biggest chunk of its profits from advising and managing money for the world‚Äôs rich, while also maintaining smaller global investment banking and asset management operations.\n\nIt conducts retail and corporate banking only in its home market.\n\nThat business model paid off in 2020, as its low-risk lending book ‚Äî comprised primarily of mortgages and loans to the wealthy, as well as a smaller portion of corporate and retail credits in its prosperous Swiss home market ‚Äî suffered fewer losses than many high street peers.\n\nNow, in the first three months of 2021, the bank once again overshot financial targets on the back of record activity across its client franchises.\n\nU.S. banks posted forecast-beating results for the first quarter, with Goldman Sachs boosting profits six-fold and Morgan Stanley raising profits **150%** despite disclosing a nearly **$1 billion** loss on Archegos.\n\nUBS, however, saw investment banking pre-tax profit fall

Pre covid I would spend $100K+ a year on Facebook ads for clients (which isn‚Äôt a lot among agencies). Most of my clients are retail (e.g. shopping malls, stores, restaurants, car dealerships, etc). During that time, Facebook ad support was almost non existent. You had to really try and pin someone down and wait in a queue just for a live chat that wouldn't even be helpful. I would problem solve through Google, Youtube or message boards (like this one lol). Due to covid, budgets got paused. Then Apple introduced their privacy manager, not allowing Meta ads on their apps/platform unless people opted in. Fast forward to a month ago, I still manage about $10-20K annually (that‚Äôs a measly $1-2k per month) for clients and now I have an assigned ad support rep named Gloria, she's really nice. We've talked for about an hour total in the last month about various stuff. She calls me every week. She sends me her calendly link to book an hour here and there. She calls me every Monday/Tuesday to make sure I'm good. She emails me every Thursday or Friday as well. This is wildly unusual. This week, she called me 6 times (image). I barely spend $1K a month on ads now and it‚Äôs been 2 years since I was peak ad spend. I think they're down bad.\n\nYes, they got rekt two earnings ago, but they're going to miss again.
