I wouldn't agree to anything he or she proposes to you in this session, but have them look over your situation and try to politely get them to give you some free advice (\"how much cash do I HAVE to have for emergencies at my age?\"), then go home and think about what they said. Use their advice to develop your own plan or call back when you are ready to proceed with theirs.\n\nAt the very least, I will say again that dollar cost averaging is always a good place to start. You have got 30-40 years before you HAVE to think about retirement so there's no need to go dumping in mad stacks right now, the important thing is to start allowing coupounding interest to begin working for you.\n\nEdit: also, i-bonds might be something worth looking into, but you should understand how they work and make sure that they are right for you.

Now that rates are increasing, you can buy less house with the same amount of money. This will likely lead to the demand for houses(especially expensive ones) dropping and large amounts of people being underwater on their mortgages. \n\nSo while still serious, I think it will lead to more of a fizzle than a pop.", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "There is quite a bit more to it than that.\n\nOne of the major problems in 2008 were creative financial products that people weren’t paying attention to. Specifically mortgage backed security derivatives that were packaged up subprime mortgages. They were rated low risk, despite being junk. When interest rates started rising, people could afford less home for their money, and variable rate loans could no longer be afforded. Add to that many of the people given loans couldn’t afford them to begin with and huge swaths of these securities became losses. Then, these securities became toxic, so even the ones backed by good mortgages became worthless and banks couldn’t offload them from their books. This is what caused several large banks to fail and started the crisis. The housing bubble popping was just a major catalyst. On it’s own, a housing bubble popping isn’t a crises. \n\nThis time around, many of those problematic securities are regulated more strongly, credit rating agencies are not being as naive as last time, when they rated junk as 5 star products, and we have much stricter rules about lending to people who can’t afford it. Ish.\n\nBut that just means wall street and the housing lenders just need to find another way to topple the entire world economy and make out like bandits while they do it. And they have! Now we have a popular lending avenue called “margin based lending!” This is where you buy a home, not with a mortgage, but by borrowing the money using your securities, like stocks and bonds, as collateral. If your securities all loose a bunch of value, you get margin called and lose the house! But wait, there’s more. The interest rate of margin loans is based on the prime rate. It’s variable. So when the rate goes up, your mortgage payments get a lot more expensive. Is any of this sounding familiar yet? Now imagine the Fed has been pumping up markets with 13 trillion dollars of asset purchases and they are going to pull most of that money out and raise interest rates at the same time. Now they are creating a large “correction” in the market, lowering your available collateral, causing a margin call, and raising your mortgage payment at the same time. Sounds like trouble. \n\nNow imagine that these lenders don’t actually care if you can’t afford the loan, because they are just packaging them up in asset backed securities and selling them to wall street banks, who view them as very low risk because they are secured by collateral. Oh, wait, this is, in fact, EXACTLY THE SAME THING ALL OVER AGAIN. \n\nBut Loophole64, you say, if this is happening, why aren’t people talking about it? \n\nBecause greedy people are intentionally obfuscating it so they can get away with fleecing the american people again and people are fucking morons who don’t believe ANYTHING is true unless it punches them in the god damned face. We live in a world filled with anti-vaxxers and people who believe the earth is flat. The moon landing was fake, measles never existed, and their loan is good because it’s “secured.” \n\nBut Loophole64, at least the Wall Street banks aren’t leveraged to the tits on these because we passed reforms after the last one, right?\n\nWell, turns out the Dodd-Frank regulations were rolled back for banks who hold up to $250 Billion by a bunch of Wall Street beholden traitors on both sides of the aisle. That leaves LESS THAN 10 banks beholden to the regulations designed to prevent that catastrophe from happening. LOL?\n\nSo banks can own 40 billion dollars of this crap and only have 1 billion dollars to cover when it shits the bed. Just like last time. Everything is leveraged from the bottom to the top creating a lane of dominoes where each one is bigger than the previous one, just like that cool video you’ve seen on reddit, until the last domino is the worldwide economy.

Leveraged ETFs are ETFs that are designed to magnify gains or losses compared to an index.

Tech was hit a little harder, but no where near as significantly as we see today. I've seen a lot of people act like the crash we've seen in growth stocks was obvious, but in my opinion it wasn't. I think what was different about what happened this time around compared to 2018 was that anticipation of rate increases and reopening trends caused everything that was loved and did well in 2020/2021 to suddenly become what was most at risk. The relative change in sentiment towards high valuation growth stocks was enormous and this turned into a panic in late Jan / early Feb.\n\nAt that point the broader market was basically doing fine. It was a little off the highs, but we had a few rate hikes coming so as expected valuations had come down a little. The panic at this point was almost entirely contained within the high valuation / high growth stocks.\n\nBut when Russia invaded Ukraine everything changed. Suddenly the market had to deal with sanctions, higher oil prices, higher inflation and geopolitical risks. This caused the already cratering sentiment in growth stocks to worsen and for the market to start worrying about the economy more broadly.\n\nMore recently I think the selling has been driven primary by a fear of recession which is why we're seeing bank stocks and stocks more sensitive to a macro economic slowdown begin to drop. Basically anything with credit risk or consumer facing without pricing power is now starting to be taken out.\n\nI know a lot of people disagree with me, but I think it was basically a combination of everything. First it was rates. Then it was RU/UA. And now it's inflation and recession fears.\n\nGoing forward I think some tech stocks like MSFT/NET/SNOW might begin to recover because although their valuations are high they're better positioned for a recessionary environment. And if we enter a recession the Fed is unlikely to continue hiking and will likely turn more accommodative.\n\nI strongly disagree with this being entirely rates driven or in anyway obvious. I'm seeing a lot of perma-bears saying \"I told you so\" at the moment and in my opinion they just got lucky. If Russia didn't invade Ukraine inflation probably wouldn't have been anywhere near as much of a problem and Europe almost certainly wouldn't be so close to recession.

{"title": "I've made a couple million, here's my thoughts.", "selftext": "This is for anybody in a panic or worried.\n\nI started off with cashing out my mutual fund for about $1500 back when I was 18, which was 25 years ago. I traded it on eTrade and made $600. I used to spend a lot time of watching stocks, consumed by it all. I was definitely making less in returns than the value of my time.\n\nI made more money in stocks when I didn't focus on the details, as strange as that may sound. I made the less or even lost money the more I felt I was an expert. When I knew the lingo, terms, and things I don't even remember now.\n\nHere is my takeaway. \n\nBy the time it is an actionable concern, it is almost always too late, start looking for the opportunity and hope you can get a piece. Otherwise, riding it out is likely the best thing you can do in most cases.\n\nBut, usually by the time people start to get worried, anybody more seasoned has already been out a while and made their next buys.\n\nPeople log into their trading accounts 7 times more often when the market is down than when the market is stable or rising. Think about that for a moment. It's no wonder the bottom falls out, people scare themselves and sell.\n\nThat's why you sell near the peak, ideally, before the peak. They're easy to see, as long as you know there is a delay in the average investor. \n\nNobody can predict the market, they've never been able to do that. A million people try a million things and some of them happen to get it right that time. Then everybody follows them. \n\nThe only way to be consistent is to follow just a few stocks until you can predict everything they'll do. But stay a bird, look at the entire landscape. When you become a frog and can only see your immediate surroundings, you won't see what's coming.\n\nMost investor-tainers are frogs. Like Jim Cramer.\n\nWhen a husband who has stocks passes away, the widow tends to not touch the investments and leaves them alone. As it turns out, women has a slightly better ROI in the stock market largely driven by this. And it's because they just leave it alone. So, do you really want to consume yourself and your time with something that is more likely to do better if you do nothing?\n\nThink long-term and human nature.\n\nMy current focus is the coming ripple effect. My wife needs a new car. I anticipate there will be ripples and it will finally be a good time to buy a new car later this summer. \n\nWhy late summer?\n\nIf a family is going to move, they move after school is out. Then they'll be busy with their new home and all of those expenses. If money is tight, car sales will finally dip.\n\nWe will still have a housing shortage.\n\nMore people working from home use more electricity. We continue to move to electric.\n\nElectric is still a crapshoot. Things will keep going electric, but who will prevail? Well, the government has a heavy hand in that one, so keep that in mind.\n\nSomebody has to make the electricity. I personally think Nuclear will make a come back since there are some very safe reactors that have been around a long time. So I buy up the companies that make the parts.\n\nWhen COVID hit, I didn't just buy the tech stocks, I bought the suppliers to the equipment that make everything. While everybody was talking about Zoom, I would buying the companies that make Zoom possible.  \n\n\nI watch people. More people are growing gardens now. What impact will that have?  \n\n\nAll the toys people bought in the last 2 years, the seado's, boats, airplanes (huge shortage there), all need to be insured. How are the insurance companies doing?  \n\n\nHow will the used car companies be doing when the market slows down? They have higher margins but lower volume right now. The margins are not making up for the volume.  \n\n\nWhat happens when companies tight their belts when spending gets cut? Wages are really high right now.\n\nI own a company. It's well known that the square root of the number of employees a company has do over 50% of the work that makes the company good. There's room for cuts!  \n\n\nWhen marketing companies start focusing on what companies need to market, that's a warning sign to me. I only market when I know there are customers to market too. But if I know my customers aren't buying, I'm not going to spend as much on marketing. What would I spent money if it is less likely to convert to a sale? Hint. I'm not.  \n\n\nSo I won't be buying marketing companies. However, I will buy companies that are clever and skilled with their own social media marketing.\n\nI have already bought the counter cyclic stocks. I've been through this twice now in my life. When the market is high, I get out and I buy Kroger, Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, etc. I do this before the investortainers start talking about them. Why? Remember, by the time it's news, it's too late. Well, it's not too late to get in on the hedge, but they've already made some good moves by then.  \n\n\nHow many commercial trucks do you see on the road? Assume most of them are B2B shipments. Pay attention to where you see them going. It's even better if you have more detailed data.  \n\n\nLook at Intel. The biggest manufacturing investment even, and it's being done in Ohio. Why Ohio? What can we learn from them? There are investments to be made here. Is it a good blend of technology and the industry for labor?  \n\n\nIs it because it's automotive alley and they anticipate the need for chips for the automotive industry? I bet that's a large part of it right there.  \n\n\nDefense stocks? We were talking about those in November when many of my friends believed Putin was going to invade Ukraine. We knew Stingers would be heavily needed.\n\nCheap drones will be needed too. And if drones see a huge military investment, then we can expect to see a huge investment in anti-drone technology too. What companies are doing that?  \n\n\nThere's a housing shortage. How many firms are building \"working wage\" multi-family housing? A lot of those are not publicly traded. But you can find companies doing it and approach them about investment opportunities. It's not liquid like the market, but it's the long-term outlook there.\n\nSo, I just sit up in a perch and watch anymore. If you get emotional, you just have to recognize there is a reason for it. And what you should learn from it is how it happens and that it becomes an echo chamber for most retail investors. \n\nI used to look for quick money. I used to day trade, and I did very well. What happens is once you have earned enough money, you become less interested in the risk you are much happier with a 10-20% return being consistent than a grand slam.\n\nLearn from your emotions and your losses, and hopefully you'll hit some grand slams and then get to perch as a bird.\n\nI can't speak for everybody, but I don't need to be a billionaire, I just need more than enough to have it not just grow but outgrow inflation as well. Remember, inflation is also exponential in growth.\n\nAlso, I do expect a return to office in a lot of places too. My youngest and most green employees are doing terrible compared to when we were in office. They're learning less, missing opportunities, missing a ton of stuff. I can here it now, instead of OK Boomer, it will be the name for Gen X or Millennials, and they'll say we were lucky because we worked in person and could learn from each other. \n\nGive that one 3-5 years. It takes about 2 years for the idea to really spread, and we'll need about 2 years for recent grads to start hearing about how their friends who work in offices or on-site have more opportunities.  \n\n\n...And that means in 3 years it might be good to invest in the things that make a dense city run well. Which will have to be efficient with the tax base loss they have suffered.   \n\n\nIf this was too long for you, well, you probably lack the patience needed to win. :P", "id": "umqnki", "created_utc": 1652211022.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.49, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 170, "replies": [{"body": "But also \"Nobody can predict the market\"", "score": 45, "replies": []}, {"body": "I love these threads", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yet I bet you've held a stock riding it down into the abyss waiting for it to recover.

Anybody who has a short story isn't benefiting anybody. I could just say I worked 2 jobs and kept putting my money into the stock market and trading. But, unless you're a hedge fund manager or own a financial advising firm, it's unlikely to only increase wealth with stocks alone.  \n\n\nI started small. I was 19 and living on my own. I quit my job because my boss who was married slept with my roommate's girlfriend and his wife caught him. So my job began to suck. I ran out of money to pay rent so I moved home. I went to get my final paycheck and some 18 year old kid with no car insurance ran a light and totaled my car. I had no money and needed a car, so all I could afford was this crappy rusty used green car. (I won't give more info because being to specific people would be able to Google and figure out who I am).  \n\n\nMy dad was an alcoholic and later died from alcoholism. He had no money, he lost it all in the stock market ironically. He trusted his investment advisor and it was death by 1000 cuts in commission and trading fees.  \n\n\nAnyway, I ran out of money. I only had a mutual fund my dad started for me as a kid. I think it had about $1100-1500 in it, so I cashed it out and put it into e-trade and started trading stocks. I don't remember what I was trading, but I remember being excited to make $20-40 a week.  \n\n\nWhat I am saying is be a bird, look at everything going on and ignore the frogs who think they have the answers. You can look at a lot of the comments to my post and they're clearly frogs. Just using common sense, about 1 in 88 people in the US are millionaires. Now, how many people posting comments are? Well, most people aren't, so look for the gems. Just like with stocks. I keep a bird's eye view on them and if I see something interesting, well, go down and talk to THOSE frogs. So, you do need the frogs, but it's better to be a bird.\n\nOk, so how did I make my money. Both stocks and business. \n\nI was able to grow my money from the mutual fund I cashed out. I got it up to around $3,000ish if I recall. I took 2 jobs and moved back out. One job paid really well, the other job paid 1/3rd.   \n\n\nThe night job, everybody asked me why I worked there because they knew I had this other job that was turning into a career. But my goal was to make as much as I could. I did that job for about 9 months. That job became my play money and I'd put it in the market.  \n\n\nMy first big stock purchase was Sunoco. I did pretty good with that one.  \n\n\nI cashed out some of my earnings and I opened a business. The business didn't make any money, I was keeping it going with my income from my career. But I stumbled onto some products and I made an ecommerce site for them. This is like 2001/2002ish. They went gang busters. \n\nI found the product the same way I found stocks. I keep a birds eye view of everything, then if I see something interesting, I go down and talk to the frogs.  \n\n\nSo that did good. I put the earnings into the market. I was in my 20's and driving a POS rusty green car, like, entirely green inside and out. It was ugly. Most people would buy a better car. No, I just kept investing and looking for opportunities.  \n\n\nSo, I was making some money with business, working a career, and trading stocks.  \n\n\nEventually, I started day trading. I built my account up to $25k over a 3 year period. Then they gave me a margin to trade with, so I had $50k buying power. I would have to pull my tax records to see what I was buying, but I was NOT being very complex in my trading. Some stocks I would only own for 6 seconds. With $50k in margin, if I saw a stock in \"compression\" going up and down moving horizontal, it's set limits orders. If a stock moved a nickel I could make a lot.   \n\n\nThere is some luck though. Later, Hurricane Katrina hit and oil stocks shot up. So I did really awesome on Sunoco. I already knew energy stocks generally do well, we all need energy. \n\nI like to watch Time and Sales. Several years later I was watching T&S and I kept seeing this ticker just in green, going like crazy. I did not even know what it was, but it kept going up. So I bought a ton of it. BAIDU. I Google'd it AFTER I bought it. For some reason the historical charts on that miss that it went well over $100 that day. I bought it around $60 and sold at $128 not much later than after I bought it.  \n\n\nWhen the housing market crashed, I started short-selling stocks. I short sold Dana and General Motors. It was common sense if the economy was crashing car sales would drop. They did. I made a TON on General Motors. When it was around $7 I bought to cover. It dropped pretty low. I went long on it at like $3. I mean, it's GM! It jumped to like $14 so I sold for some quick cash.   \n\n\nAgain. I was paying attention to 1 stock. I knew GM. It was obvious to me the government would step in.  \n\n\nSo anyway, sometime around then I was coming up to about $700k in stocks. I had a couple big wins after that. One was Blackberry (Reach in Motion). They were getting dumped on because the iPhone and Android were taking over, so the stock was under valued. So I dug into it and learned most of their market was in South Africa and they were making a new phone. So I bought a ton of it. Everybody I told thought I was an idiot. (Kind of like the comments here). So now I'm around $700k.  \n\n\nThe went to CES and people got excited and the stock jumped (They leaked the phone 3 days before CES). Then their earnings came out. I made a TON! This put me over $1M.  \n\n\nI kept growing my business and I would take my distributions each year and toss them into Scottrade (Now TDAmeritrade). Eventually, with just average investments I got to about $1M. Money grows faster the more there is, obviously.  \n\n\nWhen COVID hit I went heavy on all the needed to support tech stocks. When Zoom was blowing up, I looked at what data centers they use and what hardware that data center had. Then I bought the suppliers for that hardware, so the RAM, hard drives, etc. Like Seagate and Western Digital, AMD.   \n\n\nI figured people would be staying home and I knew Disney+ was coming out, so I bought Disney. I knew grocery stores would stay open and Target, having a grocery store, was a retail store that could stay open. I looked at their numbers and in their most recent earnings call they reported only 3% of their business was e-commerce. I figure their stores would stay open and their ecommerce would grow.  \n\n\nThe first 4 months of the pandemic put almost another million in my account. I cashed out of everything while it was STILL going up. It's really hard to sell a stock that is still going up, but at least for me, I had to be able to do that. I sell it when I think it's peak. And I sold Target and Disney too early, they went up a lot higher than I sold them for. But, I got out ahead.  \n\n\nSo that's basically it, 25 years of history on going from $1100-1500 to north of $2M.

You can pretty well price in future profit expectations, which makes sudden high growth unlikely. The price of a Honda civic has been relatively similar for the past 15 years compared to rising costs and the added tech they get, for example. Profit on these vehicles is very low at basic trim levels. Higher input costs generally mean higher consumer price, but not higher profits. Competition is extreme in this industry, and any edge is quickly copied. From a rates stand point, most manufactures service their own loans and are increasing rates alongside mkt rates, but I see this as  a lost litre do to a habit of matching mkt rates and adding for defaults. Repossessed vehicles suffer a large depreciation (except right now, as used vehicle prices are high). Toyota, as an example, is bumping rates up to 4-5% for most loans, from 1-3% the past few years and consumers are already acting very negative in response, expecting continued low rates. In reality this is where rates should always be and all the 0-1% stuff is manufactures buying down rates either via their cap sources or just taking a hit on the TVM, so I don't see them profiting much from these rate rises, they just don't need to pretend with lower rates when vehicles are scarce. Major near term concerns would be potential for greater defaults if things get tight + delay on realizing profits given that cars are being ordered 4-6months out. Hybrids and electric vehicles are already experiencing major delays, across the board. The Rav4 Prime is likely a year delayed, with minimal supply when it comes. Demand for everything is high.

Yet, here we are, the most out of shape we have ever been.  \n\n\nYou're the fat guy who complains about the fit guy explaining to people it's about eating healthy. You're the fat guy saying working out is nonsense and this stuff is all a cliché.  You'd say \"Wait a minute, if eating is so important then why did you have a slice of pizza and a beer, you're contradicting yourself\".  \n\n\nWell, part of that is you don't understand what you're reading. You might need something more granular than my generalized approach. My approach works well for people who can fill in the missing pieces.   \n\n\nI'm the guy who says \"It's quarter til\" when somebody asks me the time. You're the guy who gets pissed off and pedantic, who corrects me by insulting my lack of specifics, and you say \"It's not quarter til, it's 2:46 and 12 seconds. You're a clown, you don't even know the time\".  \n\n\nBut for most people, my answer is good enough. Because if they need more info, they can ask for specifics.  \n\n\nClearly, people keep confusing the term \"market\" with \"stock\" and somehow think I'm contradicting myself.

My main weakness is what I don't know, rather than what I know. I stick to AMD, and one day when AMD has grown too large / stops growing, I will be simply investing in index funds, unless I develop enough insight into something else.\n\nMy counter thought to your thoughts is the cruise industry. Back when the pandemic happened and the lockdowns/quarantine occurred, the cruise industry took a huge hit and Carnival Cruise (CCL) fell from high 40s to a low of $15. \n\nMy first thought was the cruise industry will eventually recover and $15 dollar is great price, since it had been at 50+ before. But I didn't buy, because I had no clue what CCL's balance sheet looked like, how long the pandemic will last, nor any clue about the cruise industry in general. \n\nI didn't short it either, because I've been burned from dead cat bounces before (thankfully didn't participate in GME / AMC short either.) It later issued tons of debt to stay afloat.\n\nEven when the lockdowns were lifted and everybody got vaccinated, I still didn't buy CCL even though the CEOs say there is pent-up demand from people being holed up the past year. Because I only know superficially about cruises and cruise line and I can't distinguish between CCL and Royal Carribean and Norweigian, I still didn't buy CCL since it's possible as a company, CCL could be poorly run compared to the other two. At this point CCL is back in the high 20s. \n\nA rising tide doesn't lift all boats. Let me go on a tangent here, before getting back to cruise lines.\n\nThree examples from my past - I bought Ford a decade ago, when GM was doing well after their exit from bankruptcy, thinking that GM and Ford are both in the motor business and that if GM's doing well Ford will do well. What happened was Ford other than its F150 was heavily selling sedans while GM was focusing on trucks and SUVs. At that point, consumer preference has shifted to larger vehicles. My Ford shares went from 13 to 8 dollars before I sold out. In contrast GM rose.\n\nI'll keep the second and third examples short - Furniture Brands International versus La Z Boyz. FBI was losing sales and doing poorly while LA Z Boyz was killing it. Toll Brothers was making upscale housing and raking profits while DR Horton was unable to turnaround their flagging company. Those were also 10+ years ago.\n\nSo back to my cruise lines. There was no way I could tell the difference between those 3 cruise companies. I don't trade short-term. I am not good at identifying short-term trends. I am better at identifying long-term trends. And there was no way I would buy the cruise companies even though I thought travel is going to come back because I wouldn't not be able to hold any of the companies' stock for long. \n\nCCL is back to 14-15 as of today. So from March 2020 low of $15, up to high 20s in 2021, back to $14 in mid-2022. I don't have the confidence to hold through all of that.\n\nAs for all the examples you brought up, it seems like they are for short-term trading, or trend trading, trading on the short-term trends you believe will develop. You really need to be able to jump around different industries for that and have a keen eye / sense. \n\nI don't have that ability. And your experience may help people who can trade like you, but mine's a counter example how this may not work. Ultimately, everybody should try new things out and see if things work--temperament, mode of thought, critical insights--these are all particular to an individual and makes different trading/investing styles more appropriate to different persons.\n\nHopefully you were patient enough to read thru this wall of text =)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You scared me for a minute, I thought you knew me because a lot of this is what I've done. \n\nI'm holding CCL right now. But it's down from where I bought it. Their balance sheet showed $8B cash on hand when the pandemic started. If we don't go into a recession, it's a steal. I hear a lot of people talking about finally taking some vacations. I'm comparing this with the wedding industry. Talk to some wedding photographers (easy to find) and they'll all tell you how they've never been more booked. So, this shows sentiment. People are moving forward with life. Will CCL take off?  \n\n\nI'm long on one stock that is way up, I'll likely hold it until there is a reason not to.  \n\n\nI've always short-term traded. Mainly because life gets busy and I don't like holding something I cannot monitor unless it is a stock I'm holding long. But things happen.

This is a common suspension repair on Model 3's of this generation, unfortunately. I guess the upside is that this is also the only significant repair work that I've needed done on the car outside of the warranty, which has already ended on my car because I've exceeded 50k miles driven.\r  \n\r  \nAnyways, that's not what this is about. I was given a rental car during my service, and it turns out Enterprise is now renting out EV's. I drove home in a 2022 Kia Niro EV. This is a compact crossover SUV with a rated range of about 240 miles. It includes Kia's Smart Driver Assist features. So I guess I can talk about the competition for awhile, since I'm temporarily driving a competing EV.\r  \n\r  \nThe little Niro is a nice driving SUV, though the higher center of gravity causes it to wallow a bit when changing lanes too fast compared to my 3. In Sport mode, it has a nice little kick when I'm trying to accelerate fast. I haven't bothered to look at what the claimed 0-60 is on this guy but it's enough for me to overtake and pass drivers who block my path similarly to what my 3 can do on the freeway. When I set it to Regen Level 3, it has a similar amount of regenerative braking feeling. If I want to make the car stay stopped at lights, I need to manually engage the Auto Hold mode which is a button on the center island below the circular gear shifter.\r  \n\r  \nIn general, the car is fundamentally competent as any ICE Kia, it has a similar instrumentation layout and a similar center screen. The center screen is a touch screen and the UI isn't terrible, I was able to navigate around and find the options for controlling charge level and such fairly easily. It has some sort of nav system which can automatically search for nearby charging stations but I had no desire to actually try any 3rd party charging on such a short rental period.\r  \n\r  \nThe Niro has a decent sized trunk, though relatively short as this is a compact car footprint. There is no frunk, as with the Ford Mustang Mach-E, there's a bunch of stuff under the hood instead. Storage space doesn't seem great for an SUV comparatively speaking but at least the rear trunk area can be piled high with stuff if you want to carry more stuff.\r  \n\r  \nAll right, so it's a car and it's not terrible. That's a good start, so let's talk about the Smart Driver Assist features.\r  \n\r  \nI was unable to figure out how to engage the \"Smart Cruise Control\" on the freeway, no matter what I did, it said the conditions were unable to be met. So let's skip that and talk about the Automatic Lane Keeping. Push the button on the steering wheel and the light comes on on the driver instrument panel. The car stays in the lane while you drive. On a straight freeway, it works fine as far as I could tell. There is no audible indicator when it engages and disengages as far as I could see, much like the Blue Cruise on the Mustang Mach-E, this seems really unsafe to me but what do I know.\r  \n\r  \nThe car has all the usual driver safety features, beeping and letting you know when you are leaving the lane, when someone is in the lane next you and you're trying to change lanes into them, when a car in front of you is braking, and most helpfully, it beeps at you when the car in front of you starts leaving from the stop light and you haven't moved yet. \r  \n\r  \n\"Leading car is moving\" indicator and noise is helpful and I think Tesla should add this, especially when it's not properly seeing the light turn green or the camera's view of the light is blocked and not sounding the chime it does when it sees that. Also Tesla really should add an audible noise for when you're trying to change lanes and someone is in your blind spot, the side camera video feed is nice but if you're looking at the road and not the center screen you will never see it.\r  \n\r  \nIn general, driving the Kia Niro EV was pleasant. If I didn't have a Tesla, I would have been happy with the Niro. Unfortunately on the way home I got stuck in some rush hour traffic and then I was very unhappy because I actually had to drive the car myself instead of just putting it in Autopilot like I normally would and letting the car deal with the stop-and-go traffic. Then I realized why I like my 3 even though there isn't anything fundamentally wrong with the Niro.

A decade ago, society was mostly unaware of the need to electrify almost all the machines that civilization depends on, in order to make the jump from combustion energy to renewables.\n\nI do get frustrated when I read folks on r/PLTR bashing the company for making products that many customers don't yet know they need.

{"title": "I think my daughter belongs here.", "selftext": "    My daughter came to my wife an I a week ago asking how she could earn  $1,000 usd to convert to Robux. Naturally we asked her why and she was prepared to answer. \n\nApparently there was an item on the Roblox market place she had been tracking the value of. It is called “Super super happy face”. Trust me you can’t make this shit up. It was trading for 118,898 Robux. Don’t ask me for usd conversion rate but she had it figured out. Probably roughly $1,000. \n\nAnyhow she did a DD on it. And the person selling it posted on their profile it’s price was definitely going up in value. That’s some solid guidance but she didn’t stop there. My kid charted it out. She tracked the last few sales. Sure enough the line went almost straight up. It was even better than Jan 2021 meme stonks. No dips. None. Just up. By this time she had me on board. To my wife’s dismay I reached for my credit card. I couldn’t believe it. My own kid had found the fool proof plan. Our ticket to tendies. \n\nShe had an EOY target price of $1 million. I’m not sure if this was usd or Robux. It didn’t matter for her strategy. I asked her how we could convert it back to usd to cash it out. And she looked confused. “Why would we ever need to do that? After I sell it I have 5 other items I’m going to trade for that also will only go up in value”\n\nIt was at this moment I realized she might have a problem. To me this is no different than making a $1,000 deposit on Draft Kings and hitting a multi leg first basket parlay for $1 million and never intending to make a withdrawal. Her entire well thought out plan has zero intentions of EVER converting any of the profits back into $USD. Her generation believes they can purchase anything and everything they would ever need using Robux so why convert back to inflation prone usd?\n\nThankfully she hasn’t discovered futures or options yet but it’s only a matter of time.\n\nEdit I wrote this a few months back near the beginning of the year and have no clue what the current value of the “super super happy face” is. It would be interesting if someone could find out to see how the trade would be doing so far. Lol. If not I’ll ask her to look later on and report back.", "id": "umt8fn", "created_utc": 1652218008.0, "score": 2307, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 367, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|685|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=umt8fn)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=umt8fn)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I would be so proud, younger people don't believe in Fiat, it's all kind of numbers they can exchange for other things they want", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "WTF why on earth would you think she would belong here?   \n\n\nWay too smart for us GTFO", "score": 1732, "replies": [{"body": "I didn’t realize the asset value went up until after I posted.
