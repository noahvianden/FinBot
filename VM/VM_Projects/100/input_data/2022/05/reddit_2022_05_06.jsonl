It's just dumb to think that the initial configuration of the building matters in the long term.

One natural disaster, bridge outage, power disruption, etc... could cripple their entire supply chain and manufacturing capacity.

That would be 1,460,906 deliveries.  \n\nOk, but Shanghai was closed for nearly the whole of April -  and the estimates did not change from Wall Street. I doubt that they get to 1,4m cars delivered. \n\n> Elon states that they will be able to comfortably surpass 50% delivery increase YoY for the next several years even with current supply chain bottlenecks. This is not a pie-in-the-sky Full Self Driving promise, this is the expectation that he has laid out in the past that Tesla has delivered on consistently, despite Covid issues and supply chain issues. This would be 2,191,359 deliveries in 2023 and 3,287,039 deliveries in 2024. This is likely conservative, given that Tesla has been supply chain constrained for the past year and still achieved 69% YoY growth, they have two new huge factories in Berlin and Austin ramping up, and Shanghai is going to add 450,000 cars/year capacity (announced yesterday).  \n\nI think that Tesla will grow, but the problem is the law of large numbers here. Once they get to around 2-3m cars, they need to add a new giga factory each year. Gigafactory Berlin was announced in 2019 and Austin in 2020. Given that those are not producing at full capacity yet, I don't see how Tesla can sustain the 50% growth. \n\n\n\n\n> For purposes of this DD, we will assume that (EPS/car delivered) will remain at Q1 2022 level despite Tesla's strong uptrend in margin. Beginning in Q2, we will see the Average Sale Price of a Tesla increase dramatically as the price increases that were introduced months ago finally start to have their cars delivered. But let's keep it conservative. Based on Q1 2022, the ratio was 3.22 EPS / 310,048 cars = 0.00001039.  \n\nIf the Average Sale Price of Tesla increases, the demand is automatically reduced. But even if we take EPS/car delivered (which is a strange metric), at least take the proper one. First you need to take the diluted shares. Share Based Compensation might not be a direct expense for the company, but it is one for the investor. We will also remove automotive credits, as this is not from the operating side of Tesla. So we have EPS of 2.28 EPS.\n2.28/310,048 = 0,000007353700072.\n\n\n> If we use the above EPS/Car ratio on the conservative 50% YoY delivery estimates for 2023 and 2024, we get:  \n2023 EPS 22.76 (45% above current Wall Street Consensus of 15.62)  \n2024 EPS 34.14 (75% above current Wall Street Consensus 19.43)  \n\\*Consensus # source: Bloomberg\\*  \n(Note that it is normal for Wall Street to underestimate Tesla earnings like this. EPS estimates for 2022 and 2023 have gone up 50% since 12/31/2021--as share price dropped 18% along with the rest of the market)  \n\nGiven the rising inflation and that Tesla itself said that rising costs will impact them, and given that 50% growth is not conservative in any way -  I think that the Wall Street Consensus is actually too optimistic. \n\n\n\n> The next question is: What is an appropriate P/E for Tesla in 2024 when they deliver nearly 3.3 million cars per year?  \nSome will argue that Tesla will be ending their hyper growth stage and should see an appropriate P/E compression. Perhaps that's fair, but everything points to growth remaining strong throughout the decade. Elon has stated that Tesla's goal is 20 million cars produced by 2030, which would mean sustained 35% growth from 2025 to 2030 after growing 50% per year in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThere is no way that they will deliver 20 millions cars, that is just a pipe dream. Toyota produces 10m cars and is far ahead in front of VW, who does around 8. To get mass market adoption, Tesla would need to have models that are around or lower the ASP from Toyota so 27k. Cheaper cars would no doubt reduce the gross margins.  \n  \n> Based on my EPS estimate above, at TSLA's current price, at the end of year in 2024 share price would be:  \n$1024.20 at 30 P/E  \n$1,707 at 50 P/E  \n$3,414 at 100 P/E  \n$4,028 at current P/E of 118  \n\n\nIt is still a car company. Most of Tesla's competitors trade at 5-10x earnings. If Tesla does not hit their 50% target, their PE will likely trend down a lot lower than 30. \n\n\n> Remember, this is all based purely on EV deliveries, and Tesla has a proven track record of consistently hitting goals and the company is developing into an agile EV manufacturing monster.  \n\nAlright, now you are just messing with me. The Cybertruck was announced years ago, and the electric F150 is delivered first (despite being announced much later). FSD or Robotaxis does not exist, the Tesla Roadster 2 was announced in 2017 and the semi-truck is not there as well. The 35k Tesla Model 3 is not a reality either. \nTesla's growth is remarkable, but saying that they consistently hit their goals is not correct. \n\n\n> Here's where it gets nutty...  \nElon has repeatedly stated that he believes Full Self Driving (100K full self driving beta testers on road today ... goal of no-steering-wheel and no-pedal Robotaxi in production in 2024 as stated in Q1 2022 earnings call) will be worth more than the EV production business discussed at length above. Think: chauffeur service at a cost per mile of travel that is less than the cost/mile of owning a car-- and eventually less cost per mile of a subsidized bus ticket.  \n\nFirst, he said that FSD will be finished next year since 2015, and Robotaxis should be on the road since 2019. Also 1/3 of the taxi costs are from the driver. Given that development of FSD is expensive, it is not good for the probability of Tesla that they promise a cheaper way to travel. It is also impossible for them to be cheaper than a bus, as in a Tesla 5 people can sit, and in most buses 50. The Unit economic does not work out. \n\n> Elon also believes that the Optimus project they have in development (with the goal of replacing jobs with menial tasks--similar to how FSD replaces driving) will be larger than both the car business and the Robotaxi business. How much would a company be willing to pay for a Robot that can replace 3-4 $35K+benefit salaries per year? How much would a transport company be willing to pay for a Semi that dramatically reduces gas cost and can replace the cost of paying two $100K/year semi truck driver salaries each year?  \n\nAnd I believe in lasting world piece. We are far away from Robotaxis, not only from a technical standpoint but from an ethic one as well. \nAlso please do the math for a Semi with batteries. The weight and charging time makes it unlikely that one will ever see mass production.\nFor the robots, Tesla is not leading in robotics or automation. \n\n> I understand that a belief that Full Self Driving and Optimus will come to fruition requires a lot of faith in Elon Musk's ability to get things done that have never been done before. And I agree it's probably unreasonable to think that the potential numbers for these projects should be thrown into the current valuation. But as a shareholder, you should appreciate the fact that Tesla is making progress on projects that could double or triple its EV-maker valuation, and these projects are being pursued under the leadership of \\*arguably\\* the greatest visionary of our time with nearly unlimited capital and first pick of Engineering and AI talent.  \n\nBut there is nothing there? Should be add a 4x to Toyota's valuation because they have the best engineers in Japan and are working to make hydrogen viable? \nThe thing is, that he does not have nearly unlimited capital (in fact the legacy car makers have more access to capital, due to their financing devisions). \n\n\n> You can do the math on what will happen if Tesla develops 1 (or 2) businesses that eclipse the profitability of their car production. But the purpose of this was to show that it is well worth being invested in Tesla even for the car business alone. And by investing for the cars, you gain exposure to the moon shot possibility of either FSD or Optimus.  \n\nTesla currently is valued as though they would sell 10m cars in 5 years with double the ASP from Toyota (at 50k vs 27k), double the margins and double the PE. \nInvesting is mostly a risk/reward play. How likely is a current outcome and how likely is it, that I can make money of it? \nGiven Tesla's current sky high valuation, the risk is just too high compared to the reward. \n\nAlso for anyone coming with insurance - they don't underwrite their own and insurance has regulated low margins.

{"title": "Is SPY Ravaging Your Calls AND Puts? Mine Too, Here's Why.", "selftext": "**This is Gonna Be a Long One. First Things First.**\n\nWe are all, myself included, very dumb. I'm not gonna come on here spouting doom and gloom DD with the guarantee that I am correct about any of my convictions. I have been a member of this subreddit for a couple of years at this point, and anyone who has been here long enough to rub their remaining two brain cells together and miraculously conjure up an original thought should be able to come to the conclusion that any DD on this subreddit that somehow contains an accurate market prediction is almost always the product of sheer luck mixed with a dash of plagiarism and confirmation bias.\n\nNow that we got that out of the way, I have some shit to show you. This might not be new information to some of you, and I know a few of you have noticed this shit already. This post is for the people who blindly trade SPY FDs based on the daily discussion in this subreddit and can barely read a chart. Hopefully, this information inspires you to learn how to read candlesticks.\n\nWho am I kidding, none of us can read candlesticks. None of us can even read. That's why I included lots of charts with colors and shit because most of you gave up reading after the first two sentences.\n\n**Things You Need to Understand Before You Read Further:**\n\n*Elliott Wave Theory -* This theory just basically says that people buy and sell in a predictable 5 wave pattern due to the concept of herd mentality among investors. Waves 1, 3, and 5 are long and predictable uptrends (new investors enter bullish positions because everyone else is bullish). Waves 2 and 4 are short and unpredictable countertrends (investors are now getting cold feet because the price has been moving up for a while and there is uncertainty as to whether the current price accurately represents the value of a share, so people sell). Wave 5 is always followed by a relatively large countertrend correction.\n\n*Trends and Countertrends -* A trend (in this context) usually just means a bull market. Price is moving upwards, followed by a small correction, followed by another period of bullish price movement. This is when you should be trading because **trends are predictable.** Countertrends are the bearish price corrections that occur after a bullish trend in order to confirm support levels. Countertrends can take many different forms and are therefore very unpredictable. **You should not trade during countertrends because, again, price movement is not predictable.**\n\nI was going to go on to explain some bearish patterns and other basic jargon but I know you're not gonna read it. If you aren't familiar with the triple top, head and shoulders, Fibonacci retracement, or support and resistance lines please stop reading and run a quick Google search on those terms.\n\n\\-----------\n\n**Okay. Here's the Deal.**\n\nIn 2018, the S&P 500 experienced a terrible sell-off in December due to fears of the Fed tightening monetary policy, a slowing economy, and deteriorating trade relations with China. It dropped almost 10 percent. Check out this chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2018 $SPY Price Correction](https://preview.redd.it/x9wwrkajyrx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b84cc1a815ee7afc830cfd85fbbef6de0e1cbd1)\n\nIf you ever looked up images relating to the \"Triple Top\" pattern, you've seen this chart.\n\nOh hey, while we're at it, let's check out a chart showing $SPY directly before the 2008 recession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2008 $SPY Before Crash](https://preview.redd.it/0inqohwdzrx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba8af3246832915e21d4fe652c805bd0f83894ba)\n\nAnd last but not least, here's a current SPY chart. Trust me, this will all come together soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Current SPY Chart. Ruh-Roh Raggy. ](https://preview.redd.it/1fm3s7vwzrx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=0912c7f7d6052e29d0c7dcc7498d26d81a06fbe9)\n\nLooking at these three charts, we could easily circle-jerk talking about a recession until our balls fall off just like every other post in this subreddit that contains these images and is drawing those conclusions. Instead, I'll just show you my analysis and let you draw your own, very intelligent conclusions that I am sure are not based on fear or greed whatsoever.\n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen, I Present the \"oh fuck\" Zone**\n\nStock drops after an aggressive push upwards, forming a new resistance line at the peak. Following this, new support will form at a level that I have deemed the \"oh fuck\" zone, or a zone in which the price will breach critical support and plummet to a new low. You'll notice that there are recurring patterns and sequences that present themselves in every chart that I will show you after this brief breakdown of the \"oh fuck\" pattern.\n\nIt usually goes like this:\n\n1. Stock drops after an aggressive push upwards, forming a new resistance line at the peak.\n2. SPY fights back above that resistance line but is unable to produce a trend upwards. It then tumbles down below this resistance.\n3. After that, you'll see bearish price action as SPY gasps for air but is unable to successfully recover above resistance.\n4. The \"oh fuck\" zone is breached and SPY dumps. Hard.\n\nHere's the 2018 chart. It's easy to analyze because it's very cut and dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The \\\\\"Oh Fuck\\\\\" Zone \\(2018\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qwmnkelj1sx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ba591bed177665f6e560e3ba1df29028bc3c972)\n\nHere's the crash of 2008.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The 2008 Crash, Charted](https://preview.redd.it/rt5qxkfw1sx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=f81919bea43ad7aa8e6c4ec18fde0dfcc4debb78)\n\nAnd here's where we are now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Current Chart, With \\\\\"oh fuck\\\\\" Zone](https://preview.redd.it/qrywz4rd2sx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e0ef1e93641693d5092d3c2e702a9b38fdc54e)\n\nNow, you might be thinking \"but how do you know this isn't a trendy move and we're not just gonna shoot up from here? Don't stocks only go up? It's easy to draw lines on a chart for price moves that have already happened\", and honestly, you'd be correct. I don't know for a fact that this is a guaranteed recession signal. For example, here's a chart showing where SPY recovered from a similar pattern in 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[An example of SPY recovering from the \\\\\"oh fuck\\\\\" pattern, 2019](https://preview.redd.it/xtvewx2e4sx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ec073c233e4611271f0a265ba4492dfe3fba270)\n\n**Now, how do we know when to expect these patterns?**\n\nI'm glad you asked. This is where the Elliott Waves come into play. We can predict the severity of bearish price movement by determining where we are on the Elliott Wave pattern. If we are on waves 1 or 3, we can expect the countertrends of waves 2 or 4 to be relatively short and mild. If we are on wave 5, we can expect a shitshow as soon as the 5th wave trend ends.\n\nAnd guess where we are now. That's right. We are in the middle of a massive countertrend following the previous 5th wave trend. This happens every couple of years, but we are overdue for the big one. Here's a chart showing our current position on the Elliott Waves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Our Current Position Along the Elliott Wave](https://preview.redd.it/a1wt5nxuktx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=7abc8d8176cb58394459c250c0a6b811899428a1)\n\nIn all honesty, there's no telling where we go from here. But one thing is for certain, this is a massive countertrend. Keep in mind that the term \"countertrend\" doesn't mean that the price only goes down. It might go up and down over a period of time. Being in a countertrend really just means that we are in the middle of price movement that is not trendy, or goes against the previous trend. We can't accurately predict the price movement of a countertrend, which is why we are all getting fucked on moves that we thought we had all figured out. If you still don't understand, here's a couple charts showing you what a countertrend really looks like and the unpredictability that lies within.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2018 Countertrend](https://preview.redd.it/3av5v3a1mtx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f4a80b25b0a5958a49d43073086e9b1cf4cfc87)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2008 Countertrend](https://preview.redd.it/0rncil04mtx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c6fb5c91b43880c57aac13db87b7098cb37ff02)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Current Countertrend](https://preview.redd.it/pbfg2uj8mtx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=83e85505ebcdb20f2788db056599a100f0af6c85)\n\nAs you can see, there is money to be made on both Call and Put options within these trends at certain points. If you still want to participate in the market during this absolute shit circus, here's a couple methods I would suggest using before entering any positions.\n\n**Yet Another Post Comparing 2022 to 2008**\n\nI know that this has been done before. A lot. But it's almost obligatory that I include a hypothetical scenario regarding our current SPY price to the 2008 chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Here's a side-by-side without drawings or markers.](https://preview.redd.it/ff3tkaointx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba835731f29dcd5c1aa4f60b25ecadda55cda6b8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[And Here's a Chart With a Super Shitty Price Correlation Map](https://preview.redd.it/whqsbyenntx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=43c00a18b90f775a8d916740d5dcc2594e7a158f)\n\n\"It's not identical! some of the price moves are way longer or shorter\", yes I know. You are right about this as well. This map is mainly here to highlight the similarities in price action and how the market responded to those movements. And those reactions mimic each other very well. This kind of price action doesn't happen every day. But of course, formulate your own opions based on your own research. Don't let me stop you from buying those weekly calls.\n\nIf I were to guess, I'd say we hit 450 again before we dump. We might dump before then, I can't guarantee anything. Fuck it, we might not even dump at all. But I know for certain that if SPY cannot break the resistance above 450 and produce a bullish trend, we will dump harder than you ever thought was possible. With JPOW's speech at the FOMC basically saying \"fuck it we ball\", there is no real solution being presented in order to fix this massive looming economic correction. In fact, this potential recession is key to recovering the health of the economy. It might be the only thing that can fix this shit. I mean, you gotta remember that recessions are necessary for a healthy economy and they are inevitable. Of course, better monetary policy could have been enacted to soften the blow, but it's a bit too late for that.\n\n**So...**\n\nHere's a Fib trend retracement of SPY currently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Current Chart - Fibonaci Retracement ](https://preview.redd.it/9i2fjvobqtx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=d567c5913439ae194b3ed232895b68e3094dce31)\n\nThe grey line is very near our current \"oh fuck\" zone. If it is breached, we're fucked. To support this, here's a chart of 2008 with a Fibonaci Trend retracement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2008 Fibonaci Retracement](https://preview.redd.it/sfnx4qynqtx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=3614ec340d09137cc67d5b1564ad8cd6dd8a67a1)\n\nAs you can see, that grey line is a very critical price level.\n\n**In Conclusion, Here's a Shitty Chart Showing You My Personal Prediction**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Official Prediction](https://preview.redd.it/lapv07ryqtx81.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=a24fe171e901798321b120da0ff5bdf7328148e8)\n\nSo yeah.\n\nGet ready for a possible fakeout to 450-460 followed by a sell-off and then a dump to the depths of hell if price moves below 405-400 for longer than a couple of days.\n\n...Maybe.\n\nDraw your own conclusions for once, dingus.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nWe might actually be super fucked this time. Buy weekly calls up to $450 on red days. If it actually gets up there, buy Puts at $350 expiring in August.\n\nPositions:\n\nIf SPY hits 450-460 going into June I will spend all of my life savings on long dated OTM Puts so that I can feed myself during the recession.

{"title": "RIVN about to poo the bed...", "selftext": "I know they are down 80% from their ATH ($172 on 11-16-21) just after IPO...and have lost 50% over the past 3 months.  So much FOMO from people that feel like they missed out on TSLA.  Insanity.\n\n  \nAnyways, can they really keep falling?  The answer is Yes.  About 30 more dollars to go.  The hits are about to really start landing.  \n\nThe biggest catalysts for a short term drop: \n\n1) end of lockup period on 05-09-22.  Ford alone owns 100M shares (about 11% of RIVN) and has already scrapped their plans to build an EV with them thinking they can go it alone.  I'm not sure why they would keep their investment in what is now the only real truck EV competitor around.  They want to see Rivian fail.  The only way they stay involved is if they stage a takeover.  But I don't think they have deep enough pockets to pull it off (not to mention F's mountain of debt and their own ambitious EV plans that are very capital intensive)\n\n2) earnings report next week.  They are going to show horrible delivery numbers for Q1 and the forecast will also be terrible.  Supply chain, competition, yadda yadda, macro environment, covid, war, whatever.  The worst part is that they have also committed to honoring initial reservation prices for all the people that have pre-ordered...at their very modest run rate, this effectively guarantees they will be selling EVs at a loss for at least the next 3 years of production.  AT LEAST.  Like they said previously, they may never be profitable.  Amen brother.\n\n3) I'm just waiting for Cramer to be giddy about them and then the nail is really in the coffin.  \n\n\nThe only thing that will save them in my not so humble opinion is if AMZN decides to buy them.  That's the only thing that keeps me from not going balls deep\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: 20 x $30p Exp 12-16-22  \n\n\nYes, yes, I know it's not a weekly YOLO.
