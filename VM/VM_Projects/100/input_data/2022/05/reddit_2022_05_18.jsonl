Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance aka ESG. Three prongs taken at equal weights. Most companies can get an easy score on the Social aspect but not always, same with Governance. Environment is different because the way it’s calculated is kind of antiquated. \n\nThere’s really two main parts to a company’s score, the company’s own response to S&P to about 100 or so questions and 500-1000 data points collected. Then take into account that S&P regularly changes the methodology for calculation as well. \n\n\nSome companies know how to answer the questions better than some, which is why they stay on the list. I’m not saying that’s Tesla’s issues, just pointing it out. We all know the oil and gas industry has some powerhouse PR as proven every time the have an oil spill. \n\n\nThe data points include things like social and environmental campaigns run by the companies. Like when Exxon says they’re developing cleaner technologies to drill oil, we all know that it can never be clean but it’s “cleaner” (take that with a big grain of salt) so they get good marks for it. We all know it’s BS but we turn a blind eye because we need gas. \n\n\nI read Tesla had racial bias and sexual harassment claims, all companies do, but being a tech company in the Bay Area will generally lead to more than one in Houston.

The S&P 500 traded 4.3% lower, the biggest drop since June 2020. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 4.9%, the largest fall in the tech-heavy index since May 5. The selling was broad and intense on Wall Street with just 13 members of the S&P 500 in the green.\n\nMarkets returned to heavy selling after two back-to-back quarterly reports from Target and Walmart stoked investor fears of rising inflation.

The retailer also saw lower-than-expected sales for discretionary merchandise like TVs.\n\nThe retailer’s report comes right after Walmart on Tuesday posted earnings that fell short of expectations as it too cited higher fuel and labor costs. Walmart shares ended Tuesday lower by 11%. They were down another 7% on Wednesday.\n\n“The consumer is challenged,” said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. “We started to see at the end of the year that consumers were turning to credit cards to pay for the rise in food prices, rise in energy prices, and that’s actually gotten much worse. ...

By and large the right was able to correctly answer as if they were Lefties, but the left struggled to give accurate right wing answers. All they knew were the strawman arguments that other leftists had told them the right believes.

I believe we are actually getting closer to a bottom. \n\nI think for TSLA specifically 500-680 is the bottom.

A more realistic range (if you don't count us overshooting to the downside) is going to be somewhere in the middle like 550-650. \n\nReasoning:\n\nVix is back above 30, Analysts really want to see VIX at about 40 which means we just need some super volatile down days to flush that out. It'll also flush out the final lot of panic sellers / capitulation. Unfortunately it'll also flush out a few people here being very close to margin calls or not knowing what to do with ITM Puts. \n\nAnalysts are starting to lower price targets, they are also giving up and think it's time to lower them. \n\nThe big dogs are falling more and more. AAPL has had 2 -5% days now.

The World Cup is a benchmarking analysis covering over 230 pure battery electric vehicles \"designed to identify the leaders of the EV world today and tomorrow.\" Tesla, last year's winner, failed to win in any of its key battles, leaving Volkswagen (VWAGY) to win the World Cup, Pearson tells investors in a research note. VW had a consistent showing across all segments and categories, says the analyst. Pearson adds that while Tesla \"remains a strong competitor,\" its products are \"no longer stand head and shoulder over its peers.\" Notably, Tesla does not win in any segments or categories with products on sale today, writes Pearson. In his analysis, General Motors (GM) made the biggest year-over-year gains \"thanks to its highly competitive Ultium platform,\" which gave it top quartile range and charging speed in multiple segments. Lucid (LCID) retains its status as the \"undisputed tech leader,\" but Mercedes (DDAIF) is \"chasing hard\" and pulled ahead of BMW (BMWYY), notes Pearson.\n\nThis is another one that reads, \"you win if you give us stuff!

Thus the \"policy\" has inherent value of $45,900.  (The actual value of the \"policy\" is a bit higher, as there is a bit of additional value from the fact that TGT could go down even more before Friday).\n\nNote OP doesn't actually need to have $277,100 lying around to \"cash in\" the \"policy.\"  OP can just sell the \"policy.\"", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the further explanation.

It did. (TGT reported quarterly earnings and made much less money than analysts were expecting.)\n\nYesterday, when TGT was trading for like $215, he bought the right to sell 1,700 shares at $190 before end-of-day Friday.  He paid $0.65 per share for this right, or $1,105 (OP called it $1,200).  Cheap because the market believed it was unlikely that this right would be worth anything. (The right to sell a share for $190 has no inherent value when one can sell a share for $215 on the open market.  It can became valuable if the market price per share drops below $190 before expiration.)\n\nWith TGT having dropped to $163, the right to sell a share for $190 is worth (at least) $27 (one can buy a share for $163 on the open market and immediately exercise their right to sell it for $190.)  And OP has this right for 1,700 shares.  So 27 times $1,700 is about $46k.  (It'll fluctuate as TGT moves and also as it gets closer to Friday expiration).\n\nThe contracts OP bought are called \"puts.\"  Each contract gives the buyer of the contract the right to sell 100 shares at a specified price (called \"strike\" price) at anytime until a specified expiration date.  They obligate the seller of the contract to buy these shares if the buyer chooses to exercise their right.  Each one is for 100 shares and he bought 17 of them.\n\nPutting it another way..... Yesterday with TGT trading at $215, note that 1,700 shares was worth $365,500.  OP purchased from another party, let's call them MM for MarketMaker, a legally-binding piece of paper that reads...\n\n\"The holder of this piece of paper is entitled to sell MM 1,700 shares of TGT for $190 per share, or $323,000.  This piece of paper expires at 4:00 PM on Friday May 20, 2022.\"\n\nOP paid MM $1,105 for that piece of paper ($0.65 x 1,700).  (Note this is the most that OP can lose, assuming the paper expires worthless.  This is also the most MM can gain, again assuming the paper expires worthless.) \n\nWith TGT having tanked, and now trading at $163, this piece of paper is worth around $46,000.  This is because the holder of the piece of paper can buy 1,700 TGT shares on the open market for $277,100 (1,700 x $163) and immediately sell them to MM for $323,000 (1,700 x $190).

That is to say, the car knows all the rules of the road, and can identify all the objects it might encounter, but has minimal *specific* knowledge about the area where it's driving. If their approach is successful, you could build a new city, drop the car in there, and it would work immediately.\n\nCruise (and perhaps the others) has routes in specific areas that have been heavily tested. The software has specific knowledge about the area where it's driving, or at least has been verified and tweaked to react correctly to each obstacle in that area. It's likely they will try to scale this up to many specific areas, so that it approximates a general solution, but isn't actually general (reminiscent of how google maps was built).\n\nBecause of the different approaches, the cars in the early stages are good at different things. Cruise can actually have a car in SF that drives around with no person inside. Tesla FSD would perform worse in these areas. If you took a Cruise car and dropped it in Minneapolis, it would do terribly. But a Tesla in Minneapolis would do decently (with some interventions, for sure).\n\nSo as it stands, Tesla's are able to drive decently, but not very well, in every area (thus requiring human supervision).

The approaches that Cruise and Waymo are taking are prohibitively expensive to establish and maintain from a hardware, personnel, infrastructure and software point of view. The hardware Waymo and Cruise use makes each car cost about half a million dollars. The hardware is heavy and expensive to maintain.  \n  \nMaking it even more expensive, Tesla's competitors will always need specialized software engineers ready to update the map when anything on the road changes. They also will need occasional safety drivers to do tons of testing after changes are made, either in-person or remotely. Due to hardware limitations, their vehicles will never be able to handle construction scenarios, moderate-to-heavy rain, snow or fog because lidar is effectively blinded in these scenarios. They will need a sufficient amount of remote safety drivers to connect to the cars in operation and safely pull them over wherever it does start raining (scary). Also, you can forget significant detours, unmarked rural roads and light off-roading, making the technology inaccessible to some of the people that need it the most. \n\nTesla's approach is a 'work hard once and it will maintain itself' approach. The general approach they are going for will enable the vehicle to handle all scenarios mentioned above in their worst forms. Their goal is not only to be able to read and understand signs and signals dynamically but to understand context and apply a sort of common sense. They will be able to understand but not be limited to pedestrian body language, other vehicles intentions, road conditions, unpredictable construction scenarios, animal hazards, foreign object debris, standing water, gates, railroad crossings, etc. Their vehicles will also be able to nimbly avoid collisions with other moving cars and objects, drive in heavy precipitation and dangerous road conditions like icy roads, mud and gravel.\n\nThe coolest part about Tesla's general approach is how scalable it is. It requires a fraction of their competitors processing power. It will program itself and constantly only get better/safer with experience. The safety driver will be permanently removed from the equation meaning they won't need hidden safety drivers working in call-center-like pods ready to take over their cars remotely (Waymo and Cruise's approach). Their hardware fits behind their gloveboxes weighing less than some laptops. The sensor suite is cheap, minimal and easily fixable and upgradable. They can easily licence their technology to other vehicle manufacturers, needing minimal changes to their current vehicles to implement the system.\n\nThe biggest reason I'd say Tesla is far ahead of their competitors is this: the technology, in its current form, makes tens of thousands of Tesla owners drive a little over 8 times safer than any other car/driver currently on the road. As a FSD Beta tester, the way current FSD drives, even though it still makes some mistakes, it has intuition that surpasses most human drivers' and avoids most dangerous scenarios. Despite delays, Tesla has not changed their general autonomy Level 5 goal and is steadily making significant progress towards it. For some owners, like me at times, it's hard to understand the significance of Tesla's undertaking.

But despite being first with touch screen, internet connectivity and apps on that phone the manufacturer stopped making phones in 2012, obviously outcompeted by Apple & Android.\n\nThe reason Tesla is (far) ahead of the competition in FSD can be compressed down to data lead and scalability.\n\nThe data lead is enormous thanks to all the real world driving data they can and have grabbed from millions of cars on real roads. They also have far superior processing of this data thanks to in-house designed inference computers AND neural net training hardware. This is like Google search, they won and keep on winning thanks to the data lead.\n\nBut even if the competitors had the data lead, their ability to scale is quite limited. While scaling Tesla FSD to other areas or countries is far from trivial (different road signs layouts, different driving habits and unwritten rules), scaling a HD-mapped LIDAR system is a fuck-ton of work and will also need to be constantly updated as new roads are being constructed. It's like needing a completely new driving license for every new area of a town you visit, and any time it changes. In addition to this there is a hardware problem with scalability as it's not uncommon for Waymo/Cruise cars hardware to cost as much as the car they're mounted on. These sensors could get cheaper with economies of scale, but the Tesla cameras are essentially free as they are already a part of the car paid for by the customer.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2thGm06VMJE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2thGm06VMJE)", "score": -1, "replies": []}, {"body": "My leap Tesla puts bought when they hit $1100 are still looking really good.

Enjoy every fucking morsel of a word.\n\nI'm typing all this shit for your benefit. I'm not going to distill it into a haiku or some pictures for you to read because I just don't think you're worth the time.\n\nYou don't want help because reading is hard? Cool. Fuck off. This post isn't for you.\n\nOk, listen up. You all have a massive blindspot and you need to fix it. You're losing because you're behaving like a loser.\n\nLiterally, you're sitting there holding on for dear life losing. Every day.\n\nStop doing that. Fix it.\n\n\"But but but how?\"\n\nThree things. Learn them.\n\n1) Clichés aren't a substitution for thinking. \n\n\"Stocks always go up.\" \"Time in the market beats timing the market.\"\n\nWell, clearly, fuck all that. \n\nOf course it was good advice when J-Pow and his buds kept fondling the bull's balls, making him run that market for a decade and a half.\n\nDuh.\n\nWell, how does that shit sit with you now while wsb is choked with suicide hotline posts? \n\nAnd, I swear on your mother's vagina, if someone says \"zoom out\" on a stock chart again, I'm going to murder an elephant.\n\nIf you zoom out enough, everything looks pretty. That's why you look good in a crowd but don't have anyone hitting you up on Grindr.\n\nSo, before you reply with that dumb as shit, ZOOM AROUND. Go to that fucking chart and really look at it. \n\n\"Oh my pearls. If I invested in 1929 I wouldn't break even until the 1950's. If I was a dot com investor it would be a decade and a half before I recovered. Mercy on a muffin cake. I didn't know that!\"\n\nYes, those are two examples. No, you fuckwit, I am not saying this is 1929. I'm saying there are periods of time where the equity market returned neutral or negative. For decades.\n\n[So think about that when you're buying the dip](https://endlessmetrics.substack.com/p/when-buying-the-dip-doesnt-work-an?s=r) (the crash isn't here yet). Be realistic about your timeline and $$$. You aren't holding in theory anymore. Clearly, this shit is very real.\n\nYou can't bring a stock chart to your bank and tell them to \"zoom out\" when they're trying to repo your virginal Pokemon collection because you can't pay your mortgage.\n\n2) Do you who says those dumb clichés and has everyone believe them?\n\nInvestment firms. They constantly parrot that shit.\n\nWhy? They need you to stay invested. They need your fucking money. They knew the market was going to crash. They SAID it was going to crash.\n\nDid they pull your money out? Fuck no. Because you aren't about to pay them a commission to hold a bag of your cash. They can protect you. They don't. Because they need to make money.\n\nDo those institutions stay invested the same way you do? Fuck no. \n\nWhy? Because they aren't stupid. They do what I mention in #3 and they hedge into cash in a big way. \n\nHow big? \n\nBig market players have now gone to cash hedges at a level that hasn't been seen since 9/11. [Here's one article about it. Just Google it if you aren't going to call me out. You're wrong.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stocks-cash-global-growth-stocks-bear-market-fund-managers-survey-2022-3)\n\n9/11.\n\nYou still think this fucking crash is over?\n\nSo, my little unicorn bunny of goodness - if you think you should sell, SELL. If you don't, DON'T.\n\nBut have a fucking reason. \"I'm going to hold this for 20 years because that's my investment window and I believe in the company, its balance sheet and in the fact that it will recover.\" is a reason.\n\n\"I don't know what to do.\" \"I guess I'm fucked and I should hold.\" \"My wife's boyfriend is going to be pissed if I sell at a loss.\" \n\nAren't reasons. They're reactions.\n\n3) Stop playing the stock market like a loser.\n\nThe \"zoom out\" crowd likes to say the market always goes up.\n\nYou know what? The NASDAQ goes down more often than your mom when I take her out to Denny's.\n\n\"But but but what? That's impossible.\"\n\nYour mom likes pancakes. What can I say?\n\nOh, you meant the stock market thing.\n\nGuess what. In its history, the NASDAQ has had more days of negative trading than positive. \n\n\"Really? How do you know?\" \n\nBecause I got jacked up on coffee and pills one night and ran a spreadsheet with every day of its history.\n\nIt's almost 50/50 but there have been more negative days than positive.\n\n\"But it Go Ups tho. Look at lines on the charty-boop! I make monies\" \n\nYes, because the gains were bigger than the losses overall. That's not the point. So shut the fuck up and learn.\n\nIf the market goes down on 1/2 of all the days and all you're doing is buying and holding your AMZN shares like your mom holds my balls, then you're guaranteed to lose 1/2 of the days.\n\nWill you still be ahead? Maybe. Welcome to THAT'S NOT THE FUCKING POINT.\n\nPoint ---> You can trade, profitably, on losing days. So use them.\n\nPuts, shorts, inverse etfs for the indicies and specific sectors all exist. \n\nThose are tools you can use.\n\nInstead, you just sit on the sidelines wringing your hands, selling off or whining.\n\nYou know who uses all those things I mentioned above. Every institutional investor. \n\nThey hold your money and fuck you with shorts. And I don't mean just hedgies.\n\nGo pull up the list of institutional holders of SQQQ. You know who's on it? Every fucking body.\n\nYou're putting yourself at a massive disadvantage because you've been told horror stories about these investment products. Who told you those stories? The institutions.\n\n\"But but but unlimited downside. Short squeezies!\"\n\nDo you really think APPL is going to go up 400% overnight when your stop can't be triggered. You short a stock without seeing it has 17% short interest? Smarten the fuck up. You're better than that.\n\nI'm not saying to do one thing or another. I'm saying check these things out. Learn what the ACTUAL, PRACTICAL risks are. Figure out how to minimize your risk exposure to a level you're cool with if you want to invest.\n\nYou're trying to win a game of chess with half your pieces. Or you're using only half the moves the other guy is. Or lemonade and ketchup - I dunno - pick your own analogy.\n\nAt least take your money off the table when the table is so tilted like this.\n\nNow I don't want to see another fucking post like \"How do I lose money everyday when it's red in the market?\"\n\nYou lose because you're playing like it's going to be a green day. Play like it's going to be red and you'll find the results are different.\n\nAlright, that's it. Feel free to go through my post history for suggestions of if you want to say I'm full of shit about something or other.\n\nYou're wrong. I'm right.\n\nNow stop getting hurt out there.

And it's a good point - your point that my assumption about your time makes me an (accidental) asshole.\n\nYour strategy is without fault. With that strategy, I worry about estimations on how long the market will take to recover. Dot com crash took 14 years to turn a profit in the market after the crash was done.\n\nI don't day trade except when there is a big edge. It's a losing game for almost everyone and I'm not smart or talented enough to win, I don't think. It's got like an 80% fail rate.\n\nI prefer to swing trade. That would be possible but not ideal if you have time constraints. I understand that takes time to get it right.\n\nI will say that you can hold shorts like you hold long positions. Doesn't take much time to figure out a sector that is about to get hammered and make a play based on that. Set tops, walk away. Check everyday if you want.\n\nThere are also reverse ETFs for certain sectors. I have one targeting retail sales decline, for example. They do not carry the same issue of unlimited losses as shorts and are not as volatile as trading specific companies (less risk/less reward).\n\nFor what it's worth, here's my take on things. I share it not because I'm brilliant or right but because I get where you're at and can give my perspective which is based on fucking obsessive research.\n\nYou can also check out the economic calendar of events (google Marketwatch economic calendar) which is a great way to get a clear view of what's going on in the economy. Takes a few minutes to look at. Tells you what is going to affect the market.\n\nAnyway, here are my thoughts to do whatever you want with:\n\nI'm pretty sure SPY and DOW have further left to fall than QQQ. All three have room to fall. A lot seems likely.\n\nI'm also betting on retail food and goods (in particular those geared towards the middle class) failing. \n\nA lot of money flowed into travel stocks, restaurants, hotels, casinos with the expectation that we'd all go nuts for them when Covid chilled the fuck out. No one planned on discretionary income going to shit when the recession hits.\n\nWe are already in a recession. It just hasn't been defined as one yet. Generally, they are defined as two quarters of decreased GDP. We had one. We don't get the report on the next one until July. So we're in a fake-recession-can't-exist-world.\n\nIt will continue for the rest of this year and possibly into the next. It will be severe. Nothing in this market has been gentle. It's always all time highs and all time lows.\n\nThe housing market will shit its pants by the end of the year. Pretty sure Lowes and Home Depot will post really bad earnings for Q2 which is in August, I think.\n\nThe Fed will continue to raise interest rates until inflation comes down. It's at 8%. 2% is the goal and a long way off. Once unemployment is rampant, the Fed will have to deal with that (its other mandate after inflation - it only has two).\n\nThe dollar is at 20 years high and will drop as countries lose faith in the US economy (i.e. the recession). Now may be a good time to buy foreign currency or ETFs based on foreign currencies.\n\nThe global economy is fucked. Everyone. China's economy is a mess and insolvency could break the world's financial system (like how America's did back in the day).\n\nBonds will do better once people freak out about the market tanking and the recession. \n\nBottom of the market will be hard to find. I have some thoughts on how to determine it but nothing that is researched enough.\n\nWhen the market recovers - won't be until next year at the earliest - emerging markets will do well.

They haven't fully tanked yet. I ascribe their okness to the fact that people were still in full on reno mode in Q1. I do not believe they are now - in part because of the softening housing market and mostly because of a lack of discretionary income.\n\nSo pretty sure their earnings will suck next quarter.\n\nTSLA has yet to fall as far as it should. Nothing against the company but it's way overvalued, the last few earnings have been a little suss, car loan rates are going up, and everybody who wanted a car bought the shit out of them during the pandemic.\n\nTravel stocks are still overvalued in a market that has a discretionary income problem. They're artificially inflated because of the hope that we would all return to normal. That will be disproven in Q2 and Q3 Hotels. Cruise lines, etc.\n\nRetail sales and food retail will continue to suck. Find a company that's overvalued, has a shit balance sheet with no cash, is in a competitive market and caters to middle classed people.\n\nHousing is going to get prison raped. Not sure if it'll be in Q2 or Q3. The numbers that came out today sucked. They might suck tomorrow. But they aren't so bad that people are onto them.\n\nCommodities have to fall. Time frame for this is uncertain. Oil always falls in a recession but Russia is fucking with that. Something to keep an eye on.\n\nThe dollar should fall at some point. It's at 20 year highs. Not sure when that will be. Could provide a good trade in forex. Find a stable currency. Use inflated USD to buy it, wait for it to crash (that can take a while), then buy deflated USD. There are currency ETF if you don't want to forex trade. You could also buy puts on UUP.\n\nHiring companies (recruiters) will get wrecked in Q2, I think. Maybe Q3. They've staffed up for a hot labor market that is about to go off a cliff with the recession.\n\nMortgage applications are down, refinancing is incredibly low. Banks and mortgage lenders are laying people off already. Mortgages are the bread and butter of a bank. That problem will show up in Q2 or Q3.\n\nREITS are going to get hit at some point. In particular office REITS. People want to work from home now. Employees are about to get laid off. Companies are going to need to cut costs. Not sure if this will come to bear in Q2 or Q3.\n \nYou can target companies in states that historically suffer higher unemployment than others when a recession hits.\n\nYou can also look for companies that are engaged in heavy layoffs. Odds are they aren't going to do great.\n\nLookout for whenever a recession is officially declared. We're in one now but no one has made it official to curb panic. If the GDP prints a contraction number again (in July), that will confirm it. Although, with the state of shit, it seems like people might not wait for an official declaration.\n\n[Follow this.
