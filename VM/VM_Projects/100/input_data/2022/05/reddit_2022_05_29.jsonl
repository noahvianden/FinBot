Don't expect your broker to do it for you or do whats best for you. For future reference, you could have fixed this after close on Friday. I assume you sold the 2310C and bought the 2300C. Without further instructions your broker is obligated to exercise if its ITM, even if you don't have the funds to so. BUT! You had until 90 minutes after close to call your broker and tell em to not exercise your 2300C. That would technically mean you're out the few hundies it was above 3300, but you would not carry the risk of a 230k position over the 3 day weekend. Tiny problem was that your strike are so narrow and since the counter party also has 90 minutes to decide on the 2310C you kinda need to wait until shortly before time is up to not accidentally carry a fuckin 230k short over the weekend. So maybe don't do fuckin narrow strikes again.\n\nNow the saving grace is AMZN went up even further in AH, after the option exercise cut off. Last trade is about $2314.

If you look at the cash reserves, its still really high, meaning that most of the money in the FED balance sheet is still sitting in the banks. This is another way of calling it, \"liquidity trap\".

This happened in 2008-2016, which is easily checked by the savings rate. \n\nIn order for that money to flow in the economy, Keynes (which i dont really like), said that the government should increase expenditure, create inflation, and incentivize consumers to spend money instead of saving it. \n\nSo yes, that \"only 900 billion\" was one of the main causes of inflation.

{"title": "Why the Fed wants corporate America to have a hiring freeze: Morning Brief", "selftext": "The chorus of those wanting a weaker labor market is getting louder and louder.\n\nAfter the recent job numbers were released last week, Bank of America analysts said in a note they are essentially \"rooting against the home team\" and hope the numbers stop being so strong. As higher wages contribute to inflation, the Federal Reserve appears to agree.\n\n“Chair Powell keeps mentioning the relationship between the high level of job openings and wage/price inflation,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, wrote in a newsletter on Tuesday. “He’s not talking to investors. He’s talking to corporate America, and his goal is to have companies essentially institute a hiring freeze and end the cycle of paying up for new hires.”\n\nWednesday's economic release of consumer prices (CPI) showed inflation rose more slowly in April (8.3%) compared to March (8.5%). While the report was expected to have shown a March peak, there wasn't much good news.\n\n\"[Substantial] declines in the annual rate of inflation are unlikely to materialize until there are significant improvements in geopolitical tensions (that would get energy prices lower), supply chain strains and labour market shortages,\" wrote ING's James Knightley in a note after the release. \"Unfortunately, there is little sign of any of this happening anytime soon.\"\n\nTD Securities analysts agreed, noting the \"report should be of concern for the Fed given price gains in the core segment appear to be spreading.\"\n\nAccording to the consensus view of economists and analysts, shocks to commodities, supply chain issues, and the red hot (and very tight) labor market are all keeping inflation high and unpleasant. But it's the labor market that appears hardest to vanquish.\n\nWhile supply-chain problems and big price shocks have been easing, \"we see no such let-up when it comes to labor cost pressure,\" Bank of America's global economist Ethan S. Harris pointed out. Employers can't find people to fill open positions, tons of people are changing jobs, and \"looking ahead there is no sign of stabilization.\"\n\nIn Colas's view, the only way to get stabilize inflation is to use the monetary policy hammer to hit stock prices.\n\n“The Fed’s goal is to convince corporate America to enact a short-term hiring freeze, and it will keep raising rates and talking about aggressive monetary policy until that happens,” Colas wrote. “Lower stock prices are his way of convincing C-suites and boards to do that.”\nThe Fed's 'blunt force tool of rate policy'\n\nPowell has been focused on the ratio between job openings versus unemployed workers and the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which measures inflation.\n\n“Chair Powell mentioned the ratio several times at last Wednesday’s press conference,” said Colas, who said job postings need to drop from 11.5 million to around 8 million to get to normalcy.\n\nThe only way to get there would be some sort of freeze from companies.\n“[Freezes] typically [happen] when C-suites and boards decide that business conditions have become very uncertain. The Fed doesn’t have a seat at those discussions, but it does have the blunt force tool of rate policy and its effect on stock prices,” Colas said. “Chair Powell has made it clear that he wants to see openings decline.”\n\nThe big question is by how much — and whether it will be enough to whip out the “R” word?\n\nHarris wrote if the strength stays at the 200,000 openings per month pace we’ve seen, “the Fed will need to push job growth down to ~25k per month.”\n\nBut, Harris added, “If the labor force has slowed to a more trend-like 100k then they will need to push job growth to negative 70k. That is, they would need to trigger a mild recession.”\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-fed-wants-corporate-america-to-have-a-hiring-freeze-morning-brief-100055174.html", "id": "v068nm", "created_utc": 1653810118.0, "score": 212, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 285, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|51|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|768|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v068nm)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v068nm)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Okay there daddy Powell.

For the reasons I said above in my prior comment.\n\nSo maybe 1-2 years out, earnings are flat, fed interest rate pause at 3-4%, and then we start to see a serious rebound in stocks, as earnings begin to pick up, and eventually the fed announces its intention to begin cutting rates again and we start all over with QE. \n\nAgain, disclaimer, this is heady stuff so I dunno.

From 1995 to 2007, GDP fell from $5.33 trillion to $4.36 trillion in nominal terms,[7] real wages fell around 5%.”  - wiki\n\nBut, US GDP has grown, on average, well more than 2-3x the GDP growth of Japan since 1990. \n\nHere’s an interesting chart, from 1990 to 2018, US median hourly wage of all civilian prime-age workers (25-54) (in 2018 dollars), has risen 7%. \n\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/10/are-wages-rising-falling-or-stagnating/\n\nAnother thing that I rarely see discussed when people bring up Japan (or really China, or Russia, or other similar nations), is the massive demographic differences between the USA and Japan.\n\nJapan had / has an aging population, their actually seeing a decrease in population right now and has seen a relatively flat or downward sloping population growth since really the 1990s, or earlier.\n\nThat’s just not the case here. The USA has a growing population, will continue to see that, and that means more younger age workers, whereas Japan has a bloated older-aged population.\n\nOlder people don’t spend money, as much, older people don’t work, therefore don’t contribute to GDP. Indeed, your prime earning years are from like 23-55, which is a growing area for the USA, but a decreasing group for Japan.\n\nI think it’s massively important to consider this. China and Russia are struggling with this issue now, and will continue to do so into the future.\n\nMy point being, there’s no real reason to conclude we’re likely to see anything like what happened in Japan, USA has seen stable GDP growth for decades, seen real wages increase, and has a growing population with favorable demographics as compared to other similar nations, including specifically Japan.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "reGard is code for re t ard, reddit doesnt like the use of it so people go around it. in japan bubble blew up in 1989 at same time for both stocks and RE.

But, otoh, the numbers speak for themselves… and the demographic realities are rarely appreciated in these conversations\n\nAlso, and this is sort of unrelated but related, the us saw minimal inflation (prior to Covid) for easily a decade plus:\n\nFrom 1990-2019, USA inflation was about 2.3% on average. During that time frame, federal funds rate has decreased, massively.\n\nShit if we just talk 2010 to 2019, the fed funds rate stayed below 2% nearly the entire time, basically near 0% for most of that time, during that time, USA saw about 1.78% inflation rate.\n\nSo, I am wondering whether some of the traditional economic notions of the past 60 years, are perhaps, outdated notions. As in, the “QE” regime, which many seem to rally against, appears to coincide with low inflation, and strong GDP growth, \n\nMany have opined that this in part correlates with the fact that technology, in general, is highly deflationary. As in, the massive increase in technological innovation is itself a deflationary factor. I.e. it just costs less to produce things.\n\nSo, I put all this together to mean, all these comparisons to 1970, and with the idea that we’re going to see runaway inflation unless we raise rates, that’s just wrong and it’s never going to happen because it’s simply an outdated economic theory.\n\nMoreover, comparisons to other nations, while some are reasonable, many are not, because the USA has great demographics, and will continue to see GDP growth.\n\nFinally, and this relates back to the stock consideration, but, how do notions of asset allocations from say… 1960-80, as compared to today, affect equities?\n\nAs in, and again we’re at the limits of my understanding, but… in higher interest rate environments, it made more sense to by fixed income … bonds… no?\n\nThat means money NOT going into equities. Traditional asset allocation models from that era would, presumably, be wayyyyyy heavier into us treasuries than we’d ever see today. That means stock prices are depressed, because that’s money that’s not going into stocks.\n\nBut, for the reasons I allude for above, that’s not the case today. It just doesn’t make enough sense to significantly allocate capital into us treasuries, because we’re never gonna see interest rates like we saw in the 70s or 80s, and we’ve seen strong earnings growth in equities for quite awhile now.\n\nAll of this is to say, does it even make sense to compare our current situation to the 70s or the 90s, or similarly to Japan?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "problem with bonds is that their valuation in market is pretty BS ... the moment rates go up, suddenly your bonds lose value because there will be other bonds with higher rates ...\n\nthus i would stay away from bond funds, and not buy into bonds, as long as i am not 99% sure i am keeping them to full maturity. hell certificates of deposit are probably better to use than bonds, because of fees, but then again us citizens can use treasury direct to buy treasuries\n\nwe are not going to be in 70s/80s situation because thanks to outsourcing and immigration required wage growth will not happen for majority of population ...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Right, I agree.\n\nAnd so, since bonds are just not a serious factor in terms of asset allocations, where will the money go?\n\nFunds can stay in cash, I guess, for a time… but because bonds are basically not a real option, don’t they have to invest in equities, which necessarily results in increased stock prices?\n\nJust on that factor alone, doesn’t that suggest that a prolonged depression in stock prices isn’t likely?\n\nSetting aside all the other reasons we’ve discussed above?\n\nAnd I’ve enjoyed this discussion, thanks", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "i would have said, Kathy should have gotten 2 year treasuries, then reevaluate if another set of 2 year treasuries is okay or buy in market again full on :)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, 100%\n\nYa know, I have mixed feelings on her.\n\nThe negative?\n\nShe never really sold stocks that had run, up, a ton.

When rates are high, transactions happen less often. When rates are low, transactions happen more often.\n\nThis is, of course, counterintuitive to how it should work. Deals should be much more common during high rates when asset prices are very low, and not as common as they are now at low rates because asset prices are very expensive (and can only go down in value because rates physically could not decrease anymore).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Which rates  in particular…", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR: \"Rates\" refers to the fed funds rate.\n\n\"Rates\" is a general market term. It means the market rate for loans. \"Rates\" are generally guided by the fed funds rate, but have different base characteristics depending on the type of loan i.e mortgage rates are inherently higher than the overnight borrowing rates from bank to bank. Mortgages are risky, therefore the rate is higher, and overnight borrowing is very low risk, therefore the rate is only slightly higher than the fed funds rate.\n\nWhen someone says \"rates\" they are referring directly to the fed funds rate but indirectly referring to the market rates because the fed funds rate plays a large part in determining the market rates.\n\nRealistically the best rates you could ever get on a loan are the U.S Treasury rates, as that is the rate that the U.S government is borrowing at and it naturally has the highest credit rating because it is so economically strong and if worse comes to worst, it could print money to fulfill obligations.\n\nThe \"rates\" explanation ends here but I want to write down what rates mean to the market.\n\nSo, like I said, all types of borrowing are now cheaper because the fed funds rate is low compared to normal. Low rates mean that the cost of financing business is much lower because companies will start borrowing \"cheaper\" money instead of \"more expensive\" money. When a business finances expansion or operations, they do so through a mixture of 3 money channels. \n\n1) Debt\n2) Equity\n3) Cash\n\nEquity financing can be expensive. You're selling tranches of your stock to people, and if your investors are expecting to gain, for example, at least 15% in the next year, then you are selling a piece of stock for $100 today when it's supposed to be worth $115 in a year, which would be good for you if you weren't selling it right now. This means that the company is paying a 15% rate on their equity. Nobody wants to lose out on a 15% gain, but sometimes it is necessary because debt is MORE expensive than 15%. So look at it like this, equity financing has no real direct costs besides paying an investment bank to help get the deal done, it only has opportunity cost.\n\nWhen rates are low, companies look to debt to finance whatever they're financing. Why pay 15% on equity when you could pay 6% on debt? At this point, investors still want in on the action, but they have to expect lower future gains otherwise the equity rate stays too high and the business will prefer debt over equity. The way investors adjust for decreased future gains is by paying more for the stock. If the company is properly priced at $100 a share with an expectation of $110 in the future, it means that the rate is 10%. Rates drop and debt is 5%. Investors now have to lower their expectations to around 5% gain for the upcoming year, and therefore they purchase the stock at $104 because the expected stock price does not change, only the price you pay for it.\n\nSimply by lowering the rate, this company's equity value instantly increases by 4% and will only technically grow 5% in the next year from the point in time the issued equities are sold.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you but I don’t get the debt approach with those figures vs equity", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Jamie Dimon is the finest human being that god ever created.
