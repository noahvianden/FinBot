{"title": "Leaps options for TSLA", "selftext": "Wrote about this in a comment on another thread. \n\nBuying some TSLA $550 calls this week with a Nov 18th expiration and selling calls against them until the share price recovers or corrects for the long term. In my estimation the current share price is not necessarily the floor, especially considering the Twitter deal, and [Elon’s margin loan linked to TSLA](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/musk-looks-scrap-tesla-margin-loan-with-new-twitter-funding-bloomberg-law-2022-05-12/). However, now that he’s reduced the margin loan by 50% (6.5B) there should be less downside speculation. \n\nConsidering that whenever TSLA breaks out it happens relatively quickly, long term ITM calls have a higher potential upside than puts and premium prices are still quite good.\n\nI saw some analysis here about taking quick puts and going in and out, but not much about long term leaps or puts. I’m still bullish on TSLA long term even though it was severely overbought and see this recent fiasco with Twitter and Elon as a solid profit opportunity.\n\nIf anyone is going bearish long term I’d love to hear your thoughts on why and vice versa.\n\nEDIT 1: I listed this in a comment below but I’ll put it here as well. After assessing my plan again and zooming out to look at the broader market, I decided to change plans. Below I’ll list how and why.\n\n“However after running potential scenarios using IV vs HV, evaluating the current financial climate around Tesla, and creating a cost benefit analysis using the Greeks, I’ve decided to use this same strategy with a different stock. I’d be able to make the same profit in the short term (1-3 months) while giving up some potential upside in the long term. \n\nThe reason for this was as somebody else mentioned in this thread, Twitter is a very big unknown and I don’t feel secure risking so much money on something as volatile as Tesla when I could be making similar profit with significantly less risk on multiple contracts in a stock like AMD or AAPL.

You hold.\n\nI have 100 shares at $100. I sell and get $10,000\n\nShares fall to $50. I buy and get 200 shares.\n\nWhen the share price returns to $100, you have a portfolio worth $10,000. Sweet.

For context, the circuit breaker is almost like the Hail Mary of damage control in the stock market; a circuit breaker pauses stocks for 15-minute intervals. The circuit breaker was created in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash where the Dow dropped over 20% and since then has only been used five times. Once in 1997, and FOUR TIMES in March 2020. **Sooooooo... what would have happened if we didn't use a circuit breaker back in March 2020?**\n\nEdit: Some of you are confused and Im sorry for using grammar that caused this confusion. Im asking directly about the effects the circuit breaker had on the stock market. I understand the economy and stock market are not the same\n\nEdit 2: So basically the answer is it is hard to tell how much the market would have dipped if not for the circuit breaker. This does not mean a market collapse/crash would have happened if the circuit breakers never went off, but instead kept people from losing money due to market algorithms \"panicking\" and \"driving stock price down\" (also people from getting margin called)", "id": "ux82gj", "created_utc": 1653448302.0, "score": 350, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "The circuit breakers are mostly for brokers to catch up to prevent arbitrage and slippage from getting out of hand.

Ultimately, Cohen was able to secure 3 Board seats on the company for his hand-picked associates, and now has quite a bit of sway regarding the company's future:\n\n* [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/bed-bath-beyond-strikes-deal-with-activist-investor-ryan-cohen.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/bed-bath-beyond-strikes-deal-with-activist-investor-ryan-cohen.html)\n\nBBBY is now trading at about a **0.11x** price-to-sales ratio, and Ryan Cohen has announced that he thinks the profitable **BuybuyBaby** chain should be sold off (for several times more than the company's current market cap) in order to erase BBBY's debt and narrow the parent company's scope. This idea has some merit to it, and has been discussed before:\n\n* [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/buybuy-baby-may-be-worth-more-than-all-of-bed-bath-beyond-bank-of-america-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/buybuy-baby-may-be-worth-more-than-all-of-bed-bath-beyond-bank-of-america-says.html)\n* [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyonds-baby-business-isnt-worth-multiple-billions-analysts-say-contradicting-ryan-cohen-letter-11646676679](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyonds-baby-business-isnt-worth-multiple-billions-analysts-say-contradicting-ryan-cohen-letter-11646676679)\n\nCurrently, BBBY is trading at around $8, with a paltry $650M market cap, against annual revenues of approx. $8bn in 2021. It historically has traded as high as $80 (2013-2015) and even $44 in 2021 (June 2, 2021). BBBY has also bought back $1bn worth of its shares in recent years, and clearly considers its own share price to be very undervalued:\n\n* [https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bed-bath-beyond-inc-advances-1-billion-three-year-share](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bed-bath-beyond-inc-advances-1-billion-three-year-share)\n\nIn addition to buying 9.5M shares between $13-17 (\\~$150,000,000), Cohen also purchased a ton of Jan 2023 Calls (16,701 contracts) with $60-$80 strike prices:\n\n* [https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/other-memes/bbby-stock-ryan-cohen-steps-in-short-sellers-scramble](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/other-memes/bbby-stock-ryan-cohen-steps-in-short-sellers-scramble)\n\nRyan Cohen has been very vocal on his Twitter account since the New Year regarding inflation, monetary policy, and the Fed.

Of course, no mention of BBBY and Ryan Cohen would be complete without mentioning the short interest in the ticker ([20M shares publicly reported short, or 25% of total shares outstanding. But somehow 84% of the float according to Yahoo Finance??!](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/key-statistics?p=BBBY)) and the stock's weird trading correlation with other so-called \"meme stocks\" like GME, AMC.

However, I will leave aside speculation as to what that correlation might be caused by, or what it imply for the future of the share price.\n\nI keep struggling to think of any reason why a successful activist investor like Ryan Cohen would drop that kind of dough without a very serious plan to turn the company around, even in this difficult economic climate.\n\nIs anyone else fascinated with this stock's future and curious to see how it all shakes out?

{"title": "Fed minutes show strong commitment to 0.50% rate hikes in June, July", "selftext": "The Federal Reserve made a strong commitment to 0.50% moves in June and July, according to minutes from the central bank’s May meeting released Wednesday afternoon.\n\nOn May 4, policymakers [r](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-may-2022-142723148.html)aised short-term interest rates by 0.50% to a target range between 0.75% and 1.00% in a bid to lower inflation. Higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, which should in theory depress the consumption that is enabling companies to raise prices.\n\nBut the meeting minutes outline a strong agreement among Fed officials for further 0.50% moves after at least the next two meetings, which are scheduled for June 14-15 and July 26-27.\n\n“Most participants judged that 50 basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings,” read the minutes from the May 3-4 meeting.\n\nThe Fed is not often so direct about what it will do in future meetings, as the institution often prioritizes flexibility to alter the course of its policy as data changes. But with inflation currently at levels not seen since the early 1980s, the Fed has been more willing to offer public guidance on its intentions to further raise rates.\n\nFollowing the May 4 rate hike, Fed Chairman Jay Powell told the press that there was a “broad sense” on the committee that further 0.50% moves “should be on the table” for the next two meetings.\n\nFed presidents that spoke to Yahoo Finance earlier this month appeared to be part of that “broad” support.\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Yahoo Finance on May 10 she would be \"comfortable\" with that strategy, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the same day he could  see 0.50% moves for the “next two, or perhaps three, meetings.”\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard — who once entertained the possibility of a 0.75% move — told Yahoo Finance May 11 that his colleagues had \"coalesced\" around that plan for two 0.50% moves.\n\nThe Fed minutes note that Fed officials would have to continue raising rates beyond estimates for the neutral rate of interest, defined as the level of interest rates economists feel is neither stimulative nor restrictive to economic growth. This estimate implies rates will rise above 2.5% at some point during this cycle.\n\n“Participants agreed that the economic outlook was highly uncertain and that policy decisions should be data dependent,” the Fed minutes added as a caveat.\n\nInflation remained the pressing concern for Fed officials, which was complicated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related shutdowns in China. Both events are leading to disruptions in the global supply chain that have, in part, boosted prices. Fed officials said that those pressures could ease at some point, but the timing and magnitude would be “uncertain.”\n\nThe minutes note that all policymakers on the committee supported the 0.50% move in May, in addition to the plan to begin shrinking the Fed’s $9 trillion balance sheet beginning June 1.\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-minutes-show-strong-commitment-to-rate-hikes-june-july-182429216.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-minutes-show-strong-commitment-to-rate-hikes-june-july-182429216.html)", "id": "uxo44z", "created_utc": 1653504330.0, "score": 316, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "The market seems to be responding reasonably well 1 hour later...", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "There’ll be blood in the streets tomorrow", "score": 135, "replies": [{"body": "as usual", "score": 23, "replies": []}, {"body": "“Blood in the streets” LMFAO", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "!RemindMe 1 day", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 1 day on [**2022-05-27 05:12:07 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2022-05-27%2005:12:07%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uxo44z/fed_minutes_show_strong_commitment_to_050_rate/ia14qfu/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fstocks%2Fcomments%2Fuxo44z%2Ffed_minutes_show_strong_commitment_to_050_rate%2Fia14qfu%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202022-05-27%2005%3A12%3A07%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20uxo44z)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The upside to you being wrong is that maybe its the proof of concept of something *actually being priced in.* Like, for real this time.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hopefully you didn’t buy any short term puts yesterday", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I would never lol.

The Shanghai ramp had very little immediate impact on margins and actually sharply increased them as it started to hit full rate. There is reason to believe that Berlin and Austin will grow margins further as the economics of these plants are more about tech and automation than labour costs - giga presses, structural packs, 4680s, front and rear castings, the list goes on... If you're going to slag the youtubers, better watch them first.\n\n2) Yes, but not enough to matter. If the waitlist shrinks from 9 months to 4 months Tesla will still be selling every car they make and carry ultra low inventory. It will also be a better customer experience and have less inflation risk retained for the company. Tesla has many demand levers they can pull before they have to accumulate inventory or cut pricing even - free supercharger miles, etc are good examples.\n\n3) Projected EV sales in 2030 are laughably low and this is why many here don't respect analysts that rely on them. As EV pricing drops and ICE economics deteriorate we are more likely to see S-curve adoption constrained only by supply. Given how slow other OEMs are ramping Tesla could sell ~20 M  in 2030 and maybe *still* be supply constrained. That said, targets >5 years out are hard to predict, and almost nobody is valuing the stock on them, so it's better to focus on what will happen in the next 5 years that we can reasonably foresee.\n\n4) Very possible. Analysts always want the easy way out and focus on sticker price. There are many smart consumers that realize TCO (total cost of ownership) is the important metric. All EVs have lower TCO than an equivalent ICE due to cheaper fuel and less maintenance. Tesla is going further by addressing insurance too, which is a huge component of TCO. As battery supply matures and costs decline further Tesla may even be in a position to cut prices while maintaining profit margins. Saying that the company has to deliver a $25-30k vehicle to sustain growth (they probably will eventually) doesn't disprove that Tesla can sell 10 million vehicles with very healthy profit margins.\n\n5) Yes. Your argument here is entirely opinions, so I'm inclined to just leave this as an opinion too, even though I do have thoughts.\n\n6) Yes. Whether Tesla can 'afford' to finance it's customers? This is laughable when the company has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And basically, you just made my point about TCO that negates your concerns higher up. Obviously FSD would change the game entirely.\n\nTSLA remains my highest-conviction holding.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "Hey Man, I read your posts in full and take the time to write back here because I *do* care. I think the questions you posed are good ones and worth engaging in a debate; realistically all Tesla investors should be considering them in the current environment.\n\nI notice you were downvoted to -1, probably because of tone and ad-hominem attacks; have my upvote as a token of trying to debate in good faith.\n\nI'll respond to a couple of your points here:\n\n3/4/5) I think the global auto market can grow, and that Tesla can capture maybe as much as 1/5th. I think EV's could be 70-80% by 2030; and if they fall short it will be because of raw material supply, not demand, which will in turn support EV pricing. As I mentioned, I worry less about the post 2027 projections as they're really really hard to predict, and small uncertainties in exponential growth make the project range really wide. I do think Tesla can sell 6 million high priced/high margin cars, based just on reducing TCO vs ICE - extension of the analysis that a TM3 is cost competitive with a Camry on a TCO basis. The world doesn't need to get way more affluent for that business to win. For 10 million vehicles/yr, other product segments will be needed, including probably a lower cost, lower range \"city car\". That is 2-3 years away though; and while I have no doubt that the hardware margins on a cheaper vehicle will be slimmer, I think that Tesla has enough manufacturing advantage for them still to be very healthy (>15%). Even without FSD, there is also potential to supplement this margin with software revenues from App store and Tesla ecosystem type stuff.\n\n6) Tesla had $17.5 B on the balance sheet by end Q1 and will be yielding >$10B in FCF next year and growing. Obviously FCF will always lag the capital requirement to finance a large portion of the fleet, but a healthy business and long term demand for the vehicles is what capital markets will need to see to help securitize vehicles. Yeah the days of 0% financing are likely over, but Tesla can still put together very compelling TCO cases with financing at 5% even.\n\nFinally, you will note that I didn't condemn analysts - I was merely pointing out why some here don't respect them. Personally I listen to and read them all - as you point out they have access/insight that is hard to get anywhere else. But I have to say I only glean real insight from a very few. Alex Potter and Pierre Ferragu are great, Gary Black has some useful takes too. But usually when I listen to Gerber, Ives, Rush, Chowdhry, and Jonas I just get talking points and superficial analysis of the industry or company that misses the deep important differences that makes Tesla unique and exceptional.\n\nI guess to end this off I have a real question for you: You've pointed out some of the biggest challenges to Tesla's valuation, but still own 1000 shares and \"believe it is the best company in the world\". What is driving your conclusions and how do you reconcile the two? Are you betting mostly on FSD/AI/Optimus or Energy? If not, what drives your model to such a good place?

According to Research and Markets in 2030 40 million cars will be delivered annually. That means Tesla will need to have a 50% market share in order to have just 1 trillion $ in the top line. At this moment they own a 14% market share and they've been losing market share since 2019. Europe is the biggest market for EV ATM and Volkswagen has surpassed Tesla in sales there.\n\nSo I'd say that Tesla will be pushing for 10 million cars delivered by 2035 and with the other segments they will be around 1 trillion revenue by that time.

People are coming to understand that EVs are inherently superior.  So if Tesla grows its production by 50% per year, its sales will match that across that timeframe.   And if the car-sales market shrinks due to the higher utilization rates of robotaxis, Tesla is set up to profit off that side too.  Also don’t forget that they expect Energy to be as large a line of business as the vehicles.\n\nThe further 50% growth beyond that is highly speculative, mainly resting on a presumed success of the Bot: that Tesla would again be selling all they can produce, that they again grow it at the 50% rate, and that the production levels are already high by 2030.   That is optimistic, but then again a pure 50% growth rate shoots way past $100T if the PE remains similar to today, and such a Pe might be possible due to Bot production growth rate still being high.

Buy your calls now", "selftext": "[If you can read click this](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-inflation-rates-mortgage-bonds-51653424336)\n\n\nHey guys it’s me again. The only person and, I mean ONLY FUCKING PERSON, that actually posts their trade ideas. Everything else is garbage recycled memes, people shilling bs squeeze plays (looking at you weber), or (the most infuriating) gains porn screenshots. Post that shit and your positions BEFORE you do it so I can make money or die trying too. That’s how this forum is supposed to work you stupid fucks.\n\nBut I digress\n\nI’m back with another hot hot play. This one is easy and one of my old favorites. Its SPY calls, this week, preferably 0DTE. \n\nWhy? I’ll list my reasons below in order of most important to least.\n\n1. Fed is about to drop the minutes from its latest meeting today. When JPOW speaks, the market listens and lately it MOVES, hard. Which direction? I’m guessing up.\n\n\n\n2. Fed is under a lot of pressure to show something, anything good. The market is pretty beat down. Investors are looking for some stability. I feel like they will most likely try to be painting the rosiest picture of the shitstain that is our monetary policy, and announce a half percent rate hike.\n\n\n3. That announcement alone might make the market pop up. Any slightly good news from that meeting will be twisted and morphed into buy signals. Hell even negative news may get twisted by the talking heads.\n\n\n4. We’ve had nothing but red days for weeks. It’s time for a couple of green days. Gambler’s fallacy sure, but even during a bear market there are some nice upward spikes. Its all about identifying days where it could happen and then pouncing on the opportunity.\n\n\n5. SPY calls for today and Friday are extremely cheap. You can snap off a couple hundred of the 405 or 410 for less than 10k. \n\n\n6. I’m feeling it. And I’m rarely wrong 😎\n\n200 5/25 SPY 405c\n200 5/27 SPY 400c\n200 5/27 SPY 410c\n200 5/27 SPY 415c", "id": "uxcjpf", "created_utc": 1653466183.0, "score": 311, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 239, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|21|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|41|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sjowri/amzn_earnings_call_is_free_money/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ti74az/spy_and_tsla_callapalooza/) [x](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-inflation-rates-mortgage-bonds-51653424336) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxcjpf/bottom_calling_bitch_here_the_minutes_from_the/) \n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uxcjpf)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uxcjpf)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I also hate the posts with gain screenshots that you didn't announce an entry.
