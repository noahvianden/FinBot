The reality is a lot of tech companies in their growth stage don't want free cash flow and have historically been punished for prioritising it (for good reason) by investors.\n\nThe nuance being missed right now is that it's sometimes its smart for tech companies in their growth stage to operate unprofitability because that's what allows them to build their moat and capture the largest share of TAM. By doing this they can reach maximum profitability for their investors later on.\n\nIf Uber decided they needed be profitable when they first launched in San Francisco they would have almost certainly have been outcompeted by a cheaper alternative service which was operating and expanding at a loss. You might have thought you were being smart betting on the profitable company in this scenario, but in the long-run you probably want to bet on the unprofitable company growing rapidly at a loss.\n\nThat's not to say all growth companies should be expected to be unprofitable or that there isn't risks investing in companies utilising this strategy. It's important to try to identify companies with legitimate businesses models which have the potential to operate profitably in the future. For example there are a lot of crappy direct to consumer companies out there right now which investors have been giving a free pass for operating unprofitability for years which I'm sceptical of, but high-quality software companies like NET or SNOW shouldn't be criticised simply for having negative free cash flow.\n\nJust some thoughts anyway. I think for most investors it's best to stay away from these kinds of companies honestly, but there's probably an over-reaction happening at the moment.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I wouldn't call it overreaction, people are just pricing in a possible recession. Unless those highly unprofitable high-growth companies have a lot of cash on hand (which they usually don't) and debt-free (which they usually are not) then most of them will go bust. Also, in a recession there are no cheap loans to keep them afloat. I have companies that dropped 80% plus and I'd say that most of them are down that much because of real reasons, not overreaction. Sure, if a recession doesn't happen they might shoot up into the same levels, but the possibility still have to be priced in.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's an overreaction in the sense that growth stocks are indiscriminately sold.\n\nThe difference between today and when the dotcom bubble burst is that for the most part these are legit businesses with large revenues.\n\nFirstly, growth companies today are unprofitable because of sales and marketing spend, not because of flawed business models or because they're pre-revenue. For the most part these are huge companies with massive gross profits, they're only unprofitable because they spend a massive amount on sales and marketing for growth. That spend can be cut if needed, but as I explained it typically wouldn't make sense for a growth company to do that.\n\nBut secondly companies and consumers actually use and rely on these companies today. In the dotcom bubble revenues for dotcoms tanked when the bubble burst. The dotcom bubble was full of PTON type companies with deeply flawed business models that basically just survived on easy capital fuelled by dotcom investment hype.\n\nCompare that with today. Do you see companies cancelling their relationship with U, NET, or CRWD if a recession were to happen? No obviously not. If anything the technology provided by companies like this will become more important as companies seek innovation as solution to the economic challenges they face.\n\nWhat might happen is that as the cost of capital increases growth companies will see slightly slower growth as it becomes more expensive to buy growth. It's possible some companies with exposure to the consumer will also see revenues hit, so companies like SHOP and SQ, but companies like PLTR or SNOW should be fine.\n\nFinally the cost of capital hasn't meaningfully increased. The 10y yield is sitting around 3% which isn't even the highest it's been over the last decade.\n\nThe risk lies in the very early stage tech startups which are pre-revenue or those which don't have self-sustainable business models. This is where I'm seeing some panic in tech right now. Delivery companies for example have questionable business models and I suspect a lot of these will go bust. Most larger growth companies that are publicly listed will be fine.

The blood-sucking vampire squid rides again!\n\n**Is Goldman Sachs a blood-sucking vampire squid?**\r  \nThe Goldman money-making machine just keeps on running. \"The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its omnipresent blood-sucking funnel into anything that smells like money,\" writes journalist Matt Taibbi.\r  \nThe New York Times has joined in, in typically more restrained fashion. It reported that Goldman's traders were known in the Big Apple as the Bandits of Broad Street. The former New York governor Eliot Spitzer hit the nail on the head during a Bloomberg television interview. Observing that, after an infusion of billions of taxpayer dollars to keep Wall Street banks afloat, Goldman has gone on to make a \"bloody fortune.\"\r  \nIndeed, the idea of Goldman Sachs as the blood-sucking vampire squid of the investment banking world, was created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Leading Bloomberg to claim: ‘People hate Goldman Sachs more than oil spills.’ But it’s much worse than that. The ‘level of animosity’ directed at Goldman is much higher than its peers. So where to start? Well, eyebrows were certainly raised in 2008 when the US treasury secretary Henry ‘Hank’ Paulson, and former CEO of Goldman Sachs, signed off on the $85 billion bailout of the insurance giant AIG.\r  \nAIG immediately repaid Goldman $13 billion, which AIG owed to them. Then, flush with a cash windfall, Goldman now met the cash holdings criterion to become a bank holding company at the height of the crisis (and thus able to access liquidity support directly from the Federal Reserve).\r  \nDan Awrey, professor of financial regulation at Oxford University, notes that the Paulson-Goldman connection ‘aggravated the public’s sense that the game was rigged’. Then there have been the plain PR blunders, like when Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, claimed that Goldman was ‘doing God’s work’, says Awrey.\r  \nThen there was the time that the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud suit against Goldman in 2010, accusing it of defrauding investors in a sale of securities tied to $1 billion worth of subprime mortgages, termed toxic debt. The New York Times called it ‘one of the darkest chapters in the company’s 150-year history’. The company settled, agreeing to pay $550 million without admitting or denying guilt.\r  \nThe lawsuit alleged that, “Goldman structured portfolios for their investors that were designed to lose money.”\r  \nThe lawsuit put Goldman CEO Blankfein further on the defensive, after he told the federal Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that the bank packaged complex debt, while also betting against this same debt, which was purchased by its clients, “because our clients had the appetite for this debt. We are not a fiduciary,” he said.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If you truly believe in the company/their products and if you are investing for long term - buying the dip is actually a smart strategy.

Let's add some items to the list to balance out the story of the great American hope that is Tesla, and all the amazing things they've done for American labor:\n\n\\- They initially attempted to build the model 3 line as a fully automated assembly line... requiring almost no workers.  Workers = bad... for profits.\n\n\\- Failing the autonomous assembly line, instead of building a second plant using expensive workers like they did in Fremont, they chose China for their SECOND vehicle assembly plant, using Chinese government loans and getting favorable treatment over all other foreign companies in the nation.  No requirement of a Chinese partner.  Huge beneficial land deals.  Massive tax credits...  Chinese labor is not well treated, they have weak worker protections, and they're paid less than 25% of what US workers make.   Meanwhile, instead of exporting cars to Europe from the US, Tesla moved their European export hub to China.  So they got the cheap Chinese labor, lacking worker protections (also cheaper), weaker environmental regulations (also cheaper), while still maintaining high sale prices.  Thus their profit margins increased.  Tesla, a real hero of well paid and well treated labor.\n\n\\- Was clearly planning to import cars from China into the US.. but Trump put the Kibosh on that with a new tariff on all Chinese vehicle and battery imports.  Soon after, Tesla decided to build the Texas plant.  I wonder what would have happened without the tariff.  Would Texas have been built?  But I guess we don't know 100% for sure that's the reason...  🙄🤣\n\n\\- After Trump cut the battery tariff in half, Tesla instantly started making plans to import Chinese made LFP battery packs, the single most expensive part of a model 3 SR+, into the US.  😂😂😂😂  If you can't bring the entire car... bring the most expensive part.\n\n\\- During the pandemic, Tesla refused to adhere to shutdown requests from their county for public safety; clearly failing to do so because it would undermine their ability to report a profitable quarter, which they absolutely needed in order to hit 4 straight profitable quarters and gain entry into the S&P 500.  Oh, and they started the plant back up before permission was given for the same reason.  Why is getting into the S&P 500 so important?  So index funds will have to buy their stock... thus creating a huge windfall potential for the company.  It means they can sell shares and raise cash.  How much cash did they raise in 2020 after getting into the S&P 500?  $20 billion.  Like half the entire value of Ford at the time.  Didn't even slow the stock price appreciation down.\n\n\\- They withheld employee bonuses and performance reviews (aka raises) because they claimed they weren't sure they had enough money to brave the pandemic... when in fact it became pretty clear they were in no danger of running out of cash... but they were extra close to not seeing a profitable quarter.  Bonuses + raises may have kept them slightly below the profitable mark, thus keeping them out of the S&P 500.\n\n\\- The were found guilty for union busting... nevermind this one, let's just forget about it... it's not important.  🐶\n\n\\- Rampant racism throughout their Fremont plant.... but it's those specific employees fault.  Not the fact that Tesla has been underfunding their HR department.  That doesn't matter.. .it's not their fault.  They don't  have the money for it. \\*cough\\* Ignore the $18 billion in cash they have on hand. \\*cough\\*\n\n\\- I could add a bunch more about all the product launch timelines that Elon Musk got on stage and lied through his teeth about, to sell overpriced unfinished FSD packages, to pump up the stock price, and to starve competition of investment.... but why bother.  🤷‍♂️\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean dude... c'mon.

Tesla would have just needed to build their second plant in a different country.  They didn't; they chose China.  Likely for the same reason many major corporations choose China.  Because of cheap labor who they can exploit by having two 12 hour line shifts, instead of three 8 hour shifts, while paying them as little as 25% as much Western workers.  I imagine Tesla pays very little out in benefits.  There's the weak environmental regulation, allowing Tesla to get the plant up and running within a single year, no questions asked.  There's the access to raw material supply that China is hoarding.  There's all that cheap coal energy.  And of course, China gave Tesla access to up to $2 billion in government loans; Tesla didn't even have to use their cash to build the plant.  All of this adds up to huge margins by using this low cost vehicle production to sell cars to a much wealthier region like Europe where the workers are paid far more.\n\nChinese manufacturing has always been used by corporations to generate larger profits, thus spiking share value.  Auto is one of the last remaining manufacturing bastions of the Western world, where one of our largest purchases (our car) has a good chunk of the revenue going to the labor.

That doesn't mean spreading only the positive news in what can only be described as propaganda is a good thing.

Why, because of money.  Anyone who actually believes this wasn't the plan all along... oh boy... I've got an investment fund... it only costs you a million to get involved in and it'll quadruple your money in a month.  See I can lie too.\n\nThe silly part about quoting Musk over and over again as if everything that's ever come out of his mouth is the ultimate truth, is that we have case after case after case of the man either being wrong or of blatantly lying to investors and customers.\n\nI mean, my favorite example is FSD.  The man is CEO of the company, with in-depth knowledge of the FSD program.. who if fans are to believed is one of the greatest geniuses of our time... and yet this man had the nerve to go on stage in April 2019 and claim FSD would be feature complete and ready for autonomous driving by the end of THAT year.  How could he think that was true?  Turns out he's been making that claim for years.. just another year away.\n\nBut not just that, he tripled down.  He said there'd be a million robotaxis on the road the following year... and that each owner of an FSD robotaxis Tesla would earn $30k per year, and that a person buying a car would have to be financially insane to buy anything other than a Tesla... (w/ $7k+ FSD... of course).  I'm sure many gullible people rushed out to buy 1, 2, maybe even more Teslas, knowing they'd be appreciating assets in the future.\n\nC'mon man, I used to be a new  trader too.

CEOs are not your friend, they're often exaggerating or blatantly lying to their investors to keep them invested and to keep them investing more.\n\nIn the end, I like to invest.  That doesn't mean I'm going to give companies and CEOs a free pass when they do wrong.  A lot of people make money on oil companies.  Should they celebrate the CEOs and the companies for destroying the planet just because they're \"part of the team\"?  Some do.  Some justify everything they do.

It's been awhile, but I want to say that it was early Q3 2020 that they announced they'd begin exporting cars out of China.  It was pretty big news at the time they announced it.  They initially withheld where they'd be exporting too... but at the time I was already writing comments that it was almost guaranteed they'd begin shipping them to Europe, who has no major import tariffs from China.\n\nI believe it was only 2-4 months later after their announcement when the first MiC Teslas started landing in Europe in Q4 2020.\n\nAs to building supply chain outside of China... it seems to me that every other OEM is working on large scale battery supply chains outside of China.  There are something like 25+ battery plants currently being built or in the planning stages across Europe and the US.   It's funny that no other company has needed to rely so heavily on Chinese production.  If Europe wanted to restrict China's power, they'd levy tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports.  Then like the US, who has those large tariffs on Chinese imports, those Chinese companies wouldn't have much of a choice but to build plants in western nations.  As CATL is currently doing in the US.\n\nTesla certainly got a lead in production expansion by going to China.  Afterall, nearly the last 2.5 years of Tesla's production growth have come from their Chinese factory.  Their Fremont factory production has seen minimal growth in comparison.  Yes, they just opened Germany and Texas... which as I proposed, Texas was only built because of US tariffs on Chinese imports.  Germany may have been a simple mistake; maybe they wanted to hedge against a European tariff (which may eventually come) and wanted to endear Europeans to the company.  However, it didn't take long for Tesla to continue expanding their Chinese operation; and why wouldn't they.
