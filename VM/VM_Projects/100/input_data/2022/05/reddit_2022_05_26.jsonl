The Fed \"news\" today was bad news.", "selftext": "A few weeks ago (May 4), we had our best day in two years because Powell said the Fed wasn't actively considering hikes bigger than half a point.  The next day, we had our worst loss of the year because investors realized the news wasn't really that good.  At a minimum, it was an overreaction.  I believe we'll see something similar over the coming days.\n\nThe Fed is doing the right thing here.  They need to take inflation seriously, and they need to be willing to possibly even move to a restrictive rate.  I am not criticizing the message.  But the market got the interpretation wrong.  **If the Fed has to hike to a restrictive rate, or even if they have to hike more than has been presumed, we will have a more profound recession.**  This is indisputable.\n\nThe market is cheering the Fed doing what it needs to do, but the harsh reality is that correct action will result in much lower corporate earnings, layoffs and generally slower economic growth.  Stocks will be worth less in this environment.\n\nThe Fed wouldn't be discussing the possibility of more hikes or a higher, possibly even restrictive, terminal rate if they didn't feel inflation might be harder to tame than many believe.  I'm personally glad the Fed is willing to do what needs to be done, but this isn't good news for stocks.\n\nThis is sort of like going to a doctor for a skinned up knee and him telling you that he's willing to amputate if there's significant infection that spreads.  Great, doc, glad you're willing to do what's necessary, but relative to my expectations before coming to the hospital, this is suddenly pretty scary.\n\nI don't make daily market predictions, but I think we'll see this rally fade.

The leaders just take credit and extract a salary from union dues. \n\nAnd the salary is the tiniest part of the benefit. The real value is in corruption.

They just covered it up to the point where all the pro-union folks on Reddit don't even know what happened. The heads of the National Rifle Association, Black Lives Matter, and many other extreme ideological organizations similarly were able to steal from their members by claiming any criticism of them was an attack on their movement overall. \n\nUltimately, union leaders are no different from fund managers that charge you a 2% expense ratio to invest in the S&P 500. If they could give you great returns when the market plunges like a hedge fund, maybe it's worth it (but I'm still skeptical).

Lastly, if it was a one time 2% payment off one check, that's not a bad deal. But if you're paying 2% out of every single check in perpetuity in the form of union dues, that's the best scam I've ever heard. The union leader just has to do a little upfront negotiating about something the employer was planning to do anyways, and provide a feel good narrative/social circle for members.

It basically means owning stock in the company where you work. A company like Tesla where everyone is paid primarily in stock options is highly threatening to union leaders because it aligns the interests of owners and employees (by turning employees into owners), thereby cutting the union leaders out.\n\nOne corollary is corporate executives and corporate board members that get high cash salaries, but own comparatively little stock in the companies. The goal is to extract safe cash in the short term, rather than bear the risk and return of the company in the long term.\n\n* If you get a cash salary, you're only invested in your own labor. You're fine with the company crashing as long as you continue to benefit. \n* If you own stock a single company, you're both literally and figuratively invested in the outcome of that single company. You're fine with dirty tricks (e.g., creating a monopoly, bribing politicians) to take out better competitors though. \n* If you own the S&P 500, you're invested in the outcome of all large American businesses. But you're fine with using unfair policies (e.g., protectionism, tariffs) to screw over non-American businesses as well as small American businesses. \n* If you own the total global stock market, you're invested in the outcome of all businesses on Earth. You don't care if one business does better than another since you own all of them.

Everyone on Earth would be tied to the fate of a basket of securities that represent the global economy. Everyone's incentive would be to compete in a win-win way that creates value and makes the pie bigger, rather than compete in a win-lose way that simply involves taking a bigger slice.\n\nThe catch to owning stock in a company rather than getting a cash wage is that you can choose to slack off knowing others are there to handle the workload. When this happens, the market shifts back towards higher cash wages/salaries for individuals. Ultimately, the best place is where everyone's investments are aligned with their roles as individual workers, owners of a business, citizens of a country, and humans on Earth.

{"title": "Recession with low interest rates and high inflation? How are we not fucked?", "selftext": "So you're telling me that we are about to enter a double recession with interest rates, or \"cost of capital\" near zero %? Do people realize how fucked we are?\n\nWhat determines a recessionary period is if REAL GDP is negative for a prolonged period of time. Generally that means that real demand goes negative. However, what we starting to see is nominal retail sales are up, while real retail sales are negative! See chart below (not adjusted to date).\n\nSo, correct me if im wrong. A consumer spends on meat and chicken. both of them are 10 usd. Now, after a period of time, that same consumer only spends on meat, but the price is 20 usd for it. On the first time, GDP was 20, and on the second, still 20. However, the real GDP was 20, and now its 10. So the consumer is worse off at the end.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, if nominal sales are up, and real sales are down, real GDP is negative, but the consumer is spending more money.\n\nThe biggest problem is that if we do enter a recessionary period, with interest rates close to zero, the FED cant do anything without falling into a liquidity trap or destroying the US dollar. What i mean is, lowering the interest rate with an already extreme level of M2 wont help the future economy as nominal sales will explode, and if inflation slows down, the increase in M2 wont cause real demand to increase because it will stay as cash, or bank reserves like 2008. So the FED will have to increase government budget with fake money, in an already overblown gov debt, to recover real demand and support the economy.\n\nWe already know what happens next. 18 months later, 40 year high inflation. And imagine real wages after getting hit with 5-10 year long high inflation. How can real demand ever recover if wages cant increase faster than inflation?\n\nWe can also think at it like this. If cost of debt is zero, and demand goes negative, than nobody wants it, and we are fucked.\n\nThe US economy is extremely tight and it already looks like the bubble wants to burst. But it wont, cause every country in the world will follow the Dollar.\n\nAnd for the stock market, if you check the real value of sp500 by dividing it with M2, you will see how the bubble is still not done. The creation of money will always continue, and the value of the market will always go up. Traders will be burned, hedge funds will always win.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dorc76sq2s191.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3b42dd9bac411ab17f6cda60e3e80dcb0b0ce3f", "id": "uy2uly", "created_utc": 1653553475.0, "score": 5331, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 2262, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|144|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uy2uly)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uy2uly)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's Miller time.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "What does this do to my HELOC rates??", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So, in this climate, who is making money?\n\nSomebody always makes money.

Solid 8-9 months of the year you trying to compete with subsidized renewables which at times drives the pricing negative. Also we have a lot of cogen units at the refinery and chemical plants that have to run for steam production which also put power on the grid they stay pretty much loaded up at 100% capacity. So you have Nuclear running at full capacity , CoGen units running at 100% capacity, now you have renewables which comes on and off when it wants too and then what’s left is your baseload gas and coal. Your baseload plants has to run in those prices because they can’t cycle those plants off. Nuclear pretty much has to stay fully loaded up. They have made it where coal/gas plants can lower there loads during those times but they are still operating in loss during those times and there heat rate efficiency goes to shit.

Business model are pretty much run to failure type of models now seem like. As the whole Texas fleet is getting older and no incentive to build newer baseload units Ercot is struggling during the cold and hot months.

This will effectuate a wealth transfer from those who hold assets to those who provide labor (or from those who control resources to those who control production, and consequently to those who provide labor).

It will not be a good time for assets like stocks, as the labor share of production will have to increase, and assets will be sold off in the process. Probably many companies will reduce their debt load in the next 10 years and shrink their total caps as they buy back shares to release funds to the consumer market. That seems inevitable. I believe P/E ratios will come back down to realistic levels, which will set up the next super-cycle, as the generation earning today will see massive growth in asset prices in 20-30 years. \n\nI would predict falling or stagnant asset prices for a decade or more, relatively high rates and high cost of labor.

BUT with crypto, sanctions, and a degradation of the petro-dollar inflation is coming back with a vicious bite for the US. \n\nIn the end this will go down in history as an 'I told you so' moment for economics again.

{"title": "INCREDIBLE GRAPHIC OF WEIGHT OF INTEREST RATES", "selftext": "Interest rates are going to continue to rise for the foreseeable future.  Historically, interest rates have had to rise above the rate of inflation to lower said inflation.  This would imply a Fed Funds Rate of about 10% today, not the 0.75% we have currently.  The Fed and others will insist that inflation is going to subside, just as they already have with their \"inflation is transitory\" argument.\n\nThe reason the market hit all time peak valuations is that money was cheaper than ever up until the last few months.  The cost to borrow with interest rates so low allowed investors, corporations, consumers, and governments to borrow an unfathomable amount of money, \"promoting\" economic growth.  The issue now is that with rates rising, expansion is over.  Businesses are already slashing forecasts and projecting slowdowns. \n\nBut what is the real weight of the interest rates increasing?  Let's take a look at what a house buyer would have paid 1.5 years ago, and what one would pay today.  \n\nA key issue here is that rates are much more elastic than housing prices.  Housing prices will only drop once there is mass foreclosure such as the Financial Crisis.  The issue today is that, with significant inflation pressures, the prices are unlikely to come down.\n\nSo if you are in the market for a new house, I suggest you get moving quickly.  It will only get worse.\n\nOh I forgot, you apes have all your money tied up in $GME and $AMC.

{"title": "WHY STOCKS WILL CONTINUE TO TANK LONG TERM", "selftext": "First, I would like to say I am more of a bull than a bear, just with a realistic perspective.\n\nThe Federal Reserve historically has had to raise the Fed Funds Rate above the inflation rate to lower inflation.  The reason is consumers need to be able to put their money in money market accounts that return more than the inflation rate to keep purchasing power.\n\nThe Fed has blown this epic bubble and now is dealing with inflation that will be higher than in the 1970s, which is the last time we saw inflation similar to today.  The issue is that we went through 30 years of globalization, making China a superpower, which now controls the front end of a significant portion of the world's supply chains.  By outsourcing most of our manufacturing, we put the leverage in our opposition's hands.  \n\nFor forty years, the Fed was able to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.  By making debt cheaper, consumers and corporations spent more.  Rates next to 0 was the highest value stocks and bonds were going to get - it was when money was the cheapest.  It is only getting more expensive now.  The Fed now is faced with the dilemma of a lifetime: raise rates quickly, crash the market in a way that would make the Great Depression look like a good time, and slow inflation, or raise rates slowly, submit to hyperinflation that can be blamed on geopolitical challenges for a few years, until consumers revolt.  \n\nThe issue is that it is easier to do the second option, and the Fed has historically taken the path of least resistance.  Their dual mandate is price stability and moderate inflation, and they are dropping the ball significantly on both, and would rather sweep the issue under the rug than actually handle it.  This is why base case is extreme inflation that lasts a decade (inflationary periods typically last this long), while rates move up and down in an upwards trend, slowly destroying everything and everyone aside from people who hold hard assets.\n\nWhen I say hard assets, I am mainly referring to housing, as house prices are much more inelastic than interest rates.  This will not be a Financial Crisis type of crash where house prices come down significantly because we are in such a high inflationary period.  I also suspect the government launches forbearance programs similar to during Covid, prolonging these economic issues.  The path to hell is paved with good intentions, and the government thrives on the path to hell.\n\n**What that means for you crazy apes out there is that this is the opportunity of a lifetime.**  First, we will be able to buy high tech stocks for next to nothing in a few years, and second, we can short the hell out of the market on the way down, as institutions will be in a position where they cannot: its against their business model for the most part to do so.\n\nDon't fight the trend; indices are heading down.  That does not mean individual stocks will all follow, some will thrive during this time.  When you short the market and make money, you are making money when everyone else is losing money.  It's a glorious thing as your net worth goes up two times as fast compared to the rest.  Tough times ahead for a lot of people - make sure you are not one of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s371uyt2zu191.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e1afaed67c28a3a0a08333020ccc8ea19913ab", "id": "uydapc", "created_utc": 1653587499.0, "score": 78, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|3 days ago\n**Total Comments**|23|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 days|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uydapc)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uydapc)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Comparing oranges and apples.\n\nWe have been hit by many unlucky inflation causing events in a row.
