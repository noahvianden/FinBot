My view is that CCs aren't ideal in a bull trend unless your goal is income. If your goal is to profit off AMD rising, just hold on to it. You can sell CSPs but that's an opportunity cost but they are unlikely to be assigned in a bull trend.  If the bear trend resumes, you can start selling CCs again.  \n\nThat said, are you saying you're unable to roll your 85 CC  to 86 CC (say 4 weeks) for a premium credit?  I've been able to do this thusfar, increase my strike while getting more premium. Not by a lot - the share price is climbing faster but it is still mitigating the damage. I plan to do this perpetually if I can. Eventually AMD (in this case) will come back to $85 or whatever my strike is. Keep increasing the strike even if it just by a $1 or even 50 cents but focus on getting a credit (this is what I'm doing). So the credits add up and then the movement in strike price adds up - so in one year, you may be at $95 and then AMD may dip back and then you can let the call expire.  IF not, in five years, you should be around $145. \n\nI'm new to options, so I'm wondering if what I'm proposing above won't work for some reason.  Your idea of selling puts makes sense too to offset the CCs, but it is tying up your cash. Still if you don't want the asset sold off, I don't see how selling puts solves that problem. You could still be liable for taxes for $25K gains if your CCs get assigned, so it seems your goal should be to prevent assignment first and foremost. IF to do this you need to sell puts also as you're paying for the CCs in the future, then IMO you should be able to raise your strike significantly esp. going a month or two out. \n\nThough if you have losses of > $25K from the first CC, you could offset the $25K gains and your replacement purchase will maintain your 5K position BUT what about the gains from $85 to $100? That's $15/share - that upside you'd be giving up if say on 8/19 the price of AMD was $100 (you let the CC go for $85, so $25K profit, but offset by $75K in gains you could've had which are losses you can apply to other gains but IMO this doesn't seem like the wisest move).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the response/notes. \n\nI agree CCs are not ideal in a bull trend. It helps to some extent in a bear trend, and works really well if the stock is moving sideways.\n\nMy goal with CCs is to generate a moderate income but more importantly to manage volatility. To give some background -- I have a Portfolio Margin account (can borrow significantly more than a Reg T margin but very high risk in a downtrend/volatile periods if not properly hedged), and my current portfolio is a little over 5 Mil. Have just around 5 stocks -- all mega/large cap with a lot of option action AAPL, AMZN, AMD, DIS, SQ.  I have been using options -- CCs, and spreads for a few years now.\n\nPreviously, in my CC approach once the stock reaches around the strike + premium, I would roll to ATM for the following monthly. Then, I figured selling Puts at ATM  (for same exp.) works better due to premium + higher theta + avoiding a potentially high bid-ask spread on the CC that would need to be bought, and works well if the stock continues to rise. If it drops, then the CCs are in a better state. Using this approach, in this particular case, I have been able to generate a profit of $6/contract so far (from the Puts I sold and rolled over). So, in all I have collected \\~$7 (from the CC) and \\~$6 (from the Puts sold) which would have been better than rolling the CC to 9/16\\_95c. Now, the 8/19\\_100p have an extrinsic value of $1.96 left. If AMD remains where it is or rises, I will be able to collect that too.\n\nRe. am I able to roll -- yes, I can and that is not the issue. And, what you are proposing works too as I have been doing it for years. Its just that the bid-ask spread widens for the **deep** ITM leg (which means the dealer makes a killing) and when you consider 50 contracts, my cost to roll that leg increases. Also, I do need to hold the CC position till expiry due to the Puts sold (significant theta left). So, a thought I have been mulling over -- why not buy 5000 shares on the day of exp. (bid-ask spread in the stock is a few cents), wouldn't it reduce the cost by a significant amount. Let's say, AMD remains over $100 on 8/19, the bid-ask spread on the 8/19\\_85c could be over $1 (or even $1.5) with delta \\~1; the cost to roll is reduced by \\~ $5-7.5K. \n\nRe. the p/l: I did not fully understand your point there. Assume AMD is at $101 on 8/19, I will assign the cost basis for the 85 CC assigned to the 5000 shares bought on 8/19. So p/l for CCs will be 5000\\*(85+7.11-101) = -44.5K, and p/l for Puts sold \\~ +40K, thereby net p/l of -4.5K.

Then it becomes roughy a wash or  to be a precise a slight loss of -4.5K but it achieves your goals in terms of taxes. \n\nYou then buy shares again and sell CCs again but still seems interesting if you're actually able to gain by selling a new a brand new CC that in this contract will net you all the premium (i.e. no rollover cost) but in theory at least you paid for that cost above (in the losses in the first part of this equation: 5000\\*(85+7.11-101)).  Maybe it pays off in future roll overs? You should definitely be able to increase the strike. Sounds like it could work and can't hurt in terms of your goals.\n\nI tend to keep my put and call strikes far apart, very conservative, but I hope I'm able to get comfortable enough with options to do what you do you do.

Ex. long call of $50 and the stock price at $52 would mean the intrinsic value is $2, or $200 as options represent 100 shares of the stock.  \n\nTheta value is collected by the option seller.  If I sell an OTM option and collect $1.00 in premium from the option buyer and the option expires OTM then I keep $1 ($100) as profit and the seller loses $1 ($100).  \n\nTheta decay helps a seller profit and works against the buyer.  As theta is time value, and time never stops, this will always benefit the options seller, and so many find selling options to be a benefit to more consistent profitability.  \n\nTheta decay is not linear or even, and there is a big debate over if theta continues over the weekend.  It can be hard to track as the option value is affected by the stock price and IV, so trying to track when theta decays is not very helpful.  \n\nTheta (time value) is based on the time left in the option, so the farther out options have more extrinsic value.  This starts decaying around 60 dte and then accelerates the closer to expiration until it is zero when it expires.\n\nCheck this out.

Even if the stock price remains constant, if the bid was $1.00 yesterday and theta was -.10, the bid would be $.90 today.\n\n> Does the contract lose 0.1 as the day goes on, right at market open on Monday, during AH, during pre-market or at market open on Tuesday?\n\nNone of the above. In theory, it's a continuous 24x7 loss, but in practice it's accounted for every time the bid changes.\n\n> If Theta is an actual loss in the value of the contract, where does that value go? Does it just disappear, or does it go to the seller of the contract?\n\nNeither. It's a depreciating asset whose price is discovered in an auction. The market defines the price, so the market just defines a lower price as time goes on. People who were willing to bid $1.00 yesterday are only willing to bid $.90 today.\n\n> I’ve heard that theta decay doesn’t apply over the weekend or it’s one day worth of theta, or 1.5 days worth of theta. Does anyone actually know?\n\nAgain, theory differs from practice. In theory, it's continuous 24x7, so there is no difference between 6:00pm Friday and 6:00pm Saturday. In practice, the market lowers the bid on Friday afternoon to account for the expected theta decay over the weekend.

If your stock is going up so that your call gains $1.00 every day but you are losing $.03 to theta every day, why should you care? Let that happen for 100 days in a row and you make a mint of money.

You have bigger problems to worry about.\n\nAlso, it's *cumulative*  theta  relative to *cumulative* delta that is the real threat. Losing $.03 for 1 day with no benefit from delta is no big deal, but if that rate increases every day and you hold for 100 days, the sum of all those small numbers can be a big number if delta was small.

That is, roll over an asset from 34 to 37, 37 to 40, 40 to 44, etc. each month for a small premium.  \nMaybe I do this for a year or two or three and I get the strike to 70 by which time it may be way higher than that OR it might not be but eventually there'll be another correction, another 20% decline... so why not keep rolling it over for as long as feasible?  \nThe only problem I feel is that it feels like an overhang, like carrying debt, it's like I owe something to someone but if I could live with it, why not try to increase my gains while collecting premium? AT least until 100% of my cash is invested, this makes sense. If I invest all my cash and then need more cash to invest, then the opportunity cost may be too great and I might want to close out but I'll be in a better position than I am now regardless. Maybe that's the time to start paying a small amount for the CC and perhaps additional time to raise the strike a lot more all at once with the plan to liquidate assuming I am deeper ITM.  \nAnother problem is that I am putting more money into certain high volatility ETFs than I was planning originally since I am compensating for the CCs being possibly assigned BUT I could do this as long as the strikes are ITM. I need to manage risk properly here, i.e., my \"extra\" positions should only last as long as the market is on an uptrend. If it starts a downtrend, I should exit and take my profits. So I need to be a bit of a trader until this CC issue is resolved.  \nIt looks like Fidelity calculates the hypothetical losses if the option is exercised immediately, though it seems excessive to a choice I would make. I wonder how they calculate it, maybe purely based on the current premium and the premium I received? Because I have a CC that is currently OTM by a dollar with a week or two out and Fidelity is (already) showing a small loss which doesn't make 100% sense to me (unless it's the whole intrinsic/extrinsic value calculation that is causing this difference). The price would have go up 30% from current levels for me to have a loss due to the premium I've collected on this particular set of contracts alone.  \nOverall, it appears I've made a 10% gain relative to the S&P 500 since I sold off at SPY 4300 in May including all my options gains and hypothetical losses (which actually appear to have been a wash). It was 10% lower and then by buying in (< 50% unfortunately) when SPY was around 3600-3800, my overall gain wasn't too bad esp. given my goal was capital preservation. This 10% now gives me greater flexibility in terms of scaling in and if we reach ATH again I should be gaining an overall 8% or so which isn't bad for a relatively conservative strategy.

{"title": "Elon Musk challenges Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal to a debate on bots", "selftext": "Centi-billionaire Elon Musk provoked Twitter and challenged the company’s CEO Parag Agrawal to a “public debate” about fake accounts and spam in the midst of a contentious legal battle over a $44 billion acquisition.\n\nMusk filed a bid with the Securities and Exchange to acquire Twitter back in April this year. After the companies agreed to move ahead with a take-private deal, Musk said he was terminating his acquisition, and accused Twitter of presenting false numbers, including in its SEC filings, pertaining to the amount of monetizable daily active users, and the number of spam and bot accounts on the social network.\n\nTwitter then sued Musk in a Delaware chancery court to ensure the deal would go through as promised, and Musk filed counterclaims and a countersuit there on July 29.\n\nIn a series of tweets that Musk began posting just before 1 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 6, Musk interacted with a fan who had summarized his accusations about Twitter including that it was stonewalling him and giving him, “outdated data,” and “a fake data set” when he asked the company for details about how it tabulates mDAU, and estimates for spam and bot accounts.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO wrote, “Good summary of the problem. If Twitter simply provides their method of sampling 100 accounts and how they’re confirmed to be real, the deal should proceed on original terms. However, if it turns out that their SEC filings are materially false, then it should not.”\n\nBy just after 9 a.m. Saturday morning, Musk started a Twitter poll asking his followers to vote on whether ”\\[l\\]ess than 5% of Twitter daily users are fake/spam.” Respondents to the informal poll could choose one of Musk’s provided answers which read either “Yes” followed by three robot emoji, or “Lmaooo no.” (The slang abbreviation “lmao” stands for “laughing my a-- off.)\n\nMusk also wrote Saturday morning: “I hereby challenge u/paraga to a public debate about the Twitter bot percentage. Let him prove to the public that Twitter has <5% fake or spam daily users!”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pc4fltiuhg91.jpg?width=1202&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f27f0b0cb950e14fdfd81530c90462f833e009b0\n\nA source close to the company says a debate is not going to happen outside of a pending trial.\n\nAttorneys for Musk did not respond to requests to comment on Saturday, and an attorney for Twitter declined to comment on Musk’s Saturday tweets.\n\nTwitter’s attorneys have argued in court filings that Musk gave the company just twenty-four hours to accept his offer before he would present it directly to Twitter shareholders, and waived due diligence including a chance to seek more information on false or spam accounts.\n\nThey wrote in court filings, “Musk’s repeated mischaracterizations of the merger agreement cannot change its plain words.”\n\nAt an annual shareholder meeting for Tesla on Aug. 4, Musk was asked to speak about Twitter during a question-and-answer session that followed a proxy vote.\n\nHe said, drawing laughter from the audience in attendance, “I obviously have to be a little careful what I say about Twitter because there’s this lawsuit and stuff.” He confirmed that the only two publicly traded securities he owns are Tesla and Twitter.\n\nAnd then he spoke as if he still wants to become the owner of the social networking company, a stark contrast to arguments made by Musk via his attorneys in legal filings in Delaware in which Musk argues he should not have to go through with the deal.\n\nAt the Tesla 2022 shareholders’ meeting, Musk said: “I think in the case of Twitter since I use it a lot, shoot myself in the foot a lot, you know, dig my grave, etc. I think it’s — I do understand the product quite well, so I think I’ve got a good sense of where to point the engineering team at Twitter to make it radically better.”\n\nHe added that Twitter would “help accelerate” a “pretty grand vision” he had to build a business he’d been thinking about since his earliest years as a tech entrepreneur, [X.com](https://X.com) or X Corporation.\n\n“Obviously that could be started from scratch,” he said, “but I think Twitter would help accelerate that by three to five years. So it’s kind of like something I’ve thought would be quite useful for a long time. I know what to do. Don’t have to have Twitter for that but, like I said, it’s probably at least a three-year accelerant and I think it’s something that will be very useful to the world.”\n\nMusk didn’t go into any further details at that meeting. However, he reportedly said during a town hall meeting with Twitter employees in June this year that he wanted to grow Twitter’s user base to a billion people and saw Twitter as a platform that could evolve into an app like China’s WeChat, a “super app,” that incorporates everything from messaging, video and social media, to mobile and point-of-sales payments, with a robust app ecosystem.\n\nUnless they reach a settlement first, Twitter and Musk are headed for a five-day trial in Delaware that starts on Oct. 17. The judge ruling on the case is Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/06/elon-musk-challenges-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-to-a-debate-on-bots.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/06/elon-musk-challenges-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-to-a-debate-on-bots.html)\n\nElon Musk has challenged Twitter’s CEO Parag Agrawal to a public debate about the percentage of bots on Twitter.

What Twitter has said is \"We estimate we have X monetizable users. We use an algorithm to determine who belongs to X. However, some of X are bots that have escaped our bot filter. We estimate only about 5% of X is bots. However, this is only our estimate. The real number could be higher. Someone using a different methodology could come up with a different number.\"\n\nIn order for that to matter enough to get out of the deal, it's not enough to prove that the number of total bot accounts is much higher than 5%.

Average mDAU for a period represents the number of mDAU on each day of such period divided by the number of days for such period. Changes in mDAU are a measure of changes in the size of our daily logged in or otherwise authenticated active total accounts. To calculate the year-over-year change in mDAU, we subtract the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year from the average mDAU for the same three months ended in the current year and divide the result by the average mDAU for the three months ended in the previous year. Additionally, our calculation of mDAU is not based on any standardized industry methodology and is not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our measures of mDAU growth and engagement may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology.\n\n\n> The numbers of mDAU presented in our earnings materials are based on internal company data. While\nthese numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of\nmeasurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement across our large\nnumber of total accounts around the world. Furthermore, our metrics may be impacted by our information\nquality efforts, which are our overall efforts to reduce malicious activity on the service, inclusive of spam,\nmalicious automation, and fake accounts. For example, there are a number of false or spam accounts in\nexistence on our platform. We have performed an internal review of a sample of accounts and estimate\nthat the average of false or spam accounts during the second quarter of 2022 represented fewer than 5%\nof our mDAU during the quarter. The false or spam accounts for a period represents the average of false\nor spam accounts in the samples during each monthly analysis period during the quarter. In making this\ndetermination, we applied significant judgment, so our estimation of false or spam accounts may not\naccurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam\naccounts could be higher than we have estimated. We are continually seeking to improve our ability to\nestimate the total number of spam accounts and eliminate them from the calculation of our mDAU, and\nhave made improvements in our spam detection capabilities that have resulted in the suspension of a\nlarge number of spam, malicious automation, and fake accounts. We intend to continue to make such\nimprovements. After we determine an account is spam, malicious automation, or fake, we stop counting it\nin our mDAU, or other related metrics.

A call means you call bullshit on a stock and think it will crash. Use this if you think a stock is overvalued or will crash soon. 8/12 is the expiration date meaning this is how long you have to hold and make money. The closer it gets to the date the more money you can make.\n\nSPY 420 P 8/12. This is a put. Think about it as putting your money where your mouth is. If you are putting faith in a company going up you buy puts to the price you think they're going up to. The easiest way to remember this is P= Profits. Buy them when stocks are going to go up. The same expiration date information applies to puts.\n\nDD = Don't Do it. This where users argue against what they believe is going to happen to strengthen their arguments. Anything you read in a dd should be taken as false it is strictly a thought experiment.\n\nIV = Instant Value. The higher the IV the more likely your position is to make money.

{"title": "I am the guy who 10X’d a $45K YOLO in BBBY. The following is my analysis on why I believe this run is just beginning… (The Ryan Cohen Effect).", "selftext": " Hey guys, if you have not seen my Yolo post, here is a shot of the position at the time ….\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/6bx6d3rm2fg91.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb3d24bf0a0bd8446e2a29b44a9c7bc945165041)\n\n...My inbox has been going absolutely insane, with people asking what my decision making process was and taking such a large position in a seemingly dying equity. The following  is a summarization of my answer.  \n\n\nMy Thesis on this Play is as follows -  \nI have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, it has been consistently running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only one of those companies (other than GME) that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..\n\n  \nAfter the BBBY URN - ings disaster, the stock was pummeled and plummeted from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks. So Initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal play. However, After the aforementioned meltdown and a subsequent -50% day and news of the CEO stepped down, the stock was pounded further down into the 4s.\n\n  \n…Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 10% of the company in March) was again performing a hostile takeover, and had actually forced the overcompensated CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board. This is also after penning two open letters on behalf of RC Ventures, voicing his distain for the way the company had been running, it’s lack of profitability, and how it stemmed from the top down, as its corporate executives were highly overcompensated, and he proposed the sale of its spin-off company- “Buy Buy Baby”. This spinoff acquisition seems to be rolling, and a proposal of a hefty investor dividend from the proceeds has been initiated.\n\n  \nWith GME as far and away, my primary holding, I am, and have been HEAVILY invested in Ryan Cohen. As an investor, I do not invest in companies with the conviction in which I invest in people. This theory of mine started with Steve Jobs / AAPL , back when I was 18 and the first iPhone came out, continued with Elon Musk in Tesla before they even had the first consumer vehicle on the road, and now Ryan Cohen, as he is tactically fighting to dismantle the forces of Wall Street that blatantly fuck the little guy. Not to mention the turnaround/pivot strategy in which he executing in GME. So naturally - his acquisition of equity in $BBBY caught my attention, and it soon became immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market.                         (Especially considering RC’s cost basis is $15, in addition to the millions of dollars worth of $60, $65, $70 and $80 strike call options he holds, expiring January 23.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RC VENTURES BBBY HOLDINGS](https://preview.redd.it/6fyertmk3fg91.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=478d80696050b72babda6908d275b968acd075ca)\n\n  \nAs GME was getting ready to split, I started seriously tracking and charting $BBBY to find a clear bottom, as I had/have supreme confidence that a serious turnaround is/was just on the horizon.  \nThat said, it does not take genius to see the DEEP value, and spot a reversal play when a stock goes from mid $30s in March to sub $5 in June - even without the Ryan Cohen factor.\n\n  \nAgain, $BBBY was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks. The correlated movement is especially apparent when GME is in its FTD cycle - The one that has seen it consistently and predictablely pump from The bottom, to the tip top of the descending wedge in which it is currently in the process of breaking out of. But when is the next FTD cycle you ask? I’m glad you did, because it started last Friday, and runs into OPEX clearing at the end of August.\n\n  \nSo again, these stocks move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops - or in the case of bed Bath and beyond in March when they announced a share buyback after hours in March 2022, BBBY actually acted as a catalyst for the rest of “meme basket” and bed Bath & beyond, GameStop, K O S S, AMC, and the rest of the Memes all had an exact correlating after hours pop.\n\n  \nSo back to this play - I started seriously considering taking a large position leading up to the Gme split, as I anticipated a very solid pop in GME’s stock price, and a subsequent appreciation from BBBY, as it was literally, aside from the Covid crash, at its lowest point since 1996 - almost 3 decades.\n\n  \nI waited patiently to take the larger position, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, as the five dollar calls ran from .035-$.60+ - except I only had about $1000 in play at the time… either way, gains is gains, and that is when my eyes truly lit up to the probability of a massively historic opportunity here.\n\n  \nAs things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.  \nThen last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BBBY Short Percentage of Float](https://preview.redd.it/a0qkfrw44fg91.jpg?width=541&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8705b60271ccf02b2958658978c4855929a5d279)\n\n  \nAfter watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post… I was super burnt out and my brain friend when making the post. My apologies)….  \nAnyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.\n\n  \nThe stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.  \nSo yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.  \nEventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.\n\n  \nThursday 8/4.22 it closed at $6.12, and if it were to be able to close above $6.50 the next day, Friday 8/5/22 (It did), The entire float would be in the money via derivatives (It Is). That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.\n\n  \nFriday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.  \nSo yeah… I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.  \nAgain, he has millions of dollars in $60- $80 call options expiring January 23, as well as a $15 cost basis. He also holds the grenade that should act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of “MOASS” like Price action go down with Gme , but once again, at the very least, his cost m basis is $15, just about double what the current price is.\n\n  \nAs one of, if not the best investor of my generation, as well as the largest single entity shareholder in $AAPL, I think it wise to closely monitor and follow his investments.  \n It is my hope that in addition to providing some DD on BBBY and why I believe it is a very bullish future, this post can serve to answer the hundreds of inquiries I have received, questioning my decision making process around entering the YOLO.\n\n  \nIn closing, if you feel like you have missed out on this opportunity, **You could not be more incorrect, in my opinion.** As it is my opinion (and just that, my opinion -  nothing else) **I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022.** I wouldn’t go as far as saying it is GameStop2.0, but it is most certainly close, and if there was ever anything even remotely close, $BBBY is certainly it (again IMO).\n\n  \nFor anyone interested in the statistics on short interest end all around holdings I would urge you to check out - w w w. byebyeshorts . c o m\n\n  \nIn regards to the Yolo…\n\n  \nI Chose the strikes I did because they were closest to in the money, had the best Delta, & the least risk of incurring a substantial loss, should the price have had negatively fluctuated overnight.  \nI decided to Exercise what I could because I have supreme confidence that the stock price will go much much higher. Also for tax purposes obviously. HOWEVER - I believe the $BBBY stock price will reach between 60 and $80 if not more before January 2023 here is why….  \nMuch love everyone!

Exercised because I have supreme confidence that the stock price will go much much higher. Also for tax purposes obviously but, I believe the stock price will reach between 60 and $80 if not more before January 2023 here is why….\n\nThesis - I have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, has been running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only company that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..\n\nAfter the E a r nings disaster, the stock was pummeled from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks.  So initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal. However, After the E R meltdown and -50% day the CEO stepped down, and the stock was pounded down into the 4s.\n\nCome to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 11% of the company in march) was again performing a hostile takeover, and forced the CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board.\n\nI am pretty much fully invested in Ryan Cohen, so this caught my attention, and it was immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market. Especially considering RC’s cost basis is $15. In addition he holds millions of dollars worth of $60 and $80 strike call options expiring January 23.\n\nAs GME went through it’s split disaster, I tracked the stock and waited for a bottom, as I had supreme confidence that a serious turnaround was just on the horizon. But it does not take genius to see the value, and spot a nice reversal play when a stock goes from $30 in March to five dollars in June - even without the Ryan Cohen‘s factor.\n\nAgain, It was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks , So again they move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops. This was leading up to the Gme split, so I anticipated a solid appreciation from $BBBY’s lowest point in almost 3 decades.\n\nI waited patiently, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, except I only had about $1000 and play….\n\nAs things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.\n\nThen last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.\n\nAfter watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post… I am super burnt out and my brain is fried. My apologies)….\n\nAnyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.\n\nThe stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.\n\nSo yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.\n\nEventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.\n\nThursday it closed at 6.12, and if it were to be able to close above 6.50, The entire float would be in the money via derivatives. That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.\n\nFriday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.\n\nSo yeah… I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nAgain, he has 60 and $80 call options expiring January 23. He also holds the grenade that would act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of “MOASS” like Price action go down with Gme. And again, at the very least, his price basis is $15.\n\nI have yet to sleep, and my brain hurts so I’m gonna stop typing now lol. If you have any other questions I’d be more than happy to answer them, but I’m going to take a break from Reddit for a while and get some rest and try to process what just happened.

{"title": "Someone is very scared of BBBY", "selftext": "Today on CNBC a man spoke at 2:50 PM EST advising to sell your shares now due to the run up. Same individual said he would only be interested if it trades over the 200 MA.\n\nTranslation: Once we get over the 200 MA, this thing is going to flyyyyyyyyyyy. If you look at virtually any chart, there is literally no resistance until 12.50. We are basically knocking on that door. You go past that and its 18 and then its 25. Once we hit 25, we are completely out of any arguable resistance. \n\nWe actually got an instant knee jerk reaction from this statement too:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/do2dafkkkjg91.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3c767d86e29bc703f2674a30ac4552f959aa42\n\nTheres actually an interesting support going on here just below 11. Low of the day is 10.76 and was tested a few times here unable to shake it. Tested 10.82, then 10.77 and the stock just can't seem to trade under this 10.70 area. Why? Its a buying point on the day and on the week.\n\nSo where is that 200 day?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xafz0esykjg91.png?width=1601&format=png&auto=webp&s=02ed6ab44c80942f389e906746cda83ccadc9d47\n\n14.77!  We have not even tested this level yet and new price floors are being put in as we speak in the 10/share to 11/share range here. But everyone knows where this is going, and its not back down. We might get some wildddd swings over this next week, but are we going back to 6? 7? 8? 9? 10? Maybe in your dreams as you sleep on your bed bath and beyond sheets and bedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/od3k9xw0mjg91.png?width=1595&format=png&auto=webp&s=290336e025816c4a7d5044d8790f38e01728f92f\n\nAbove here we crossed into the previous floor of about 12.50. It actually breached it going all the way to 13.29 before cooling off. Now I play alot of SPY and these resistance and support zones are just flat out important. Once they get breached, its an incredibly bullish signal the stock wants to not only repeat that price but exceed it.\n\nIf you don't believe me, see SPY:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtjfpvhsmjg91.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ac953fd9ca0bd426de06b920bd490838abb289d\n\nAll last month it was a debate if SPY could fill that gap on the yellow line. It even touched it and retreated back just to exceed it not even a short week later.\n\nNow old resistance is support and that is only growing here on the broader market. Absolutely no one in their right mind thought this possible with the mix of negative GDP, high inflation, unimpressive earnings reports and housing declining. Everyone was caught off guard, it must have been one of the longest running loss porns I'v seen all over WSB with destroyed accounts betting against the market. But all this could have been avoided by acknowledging the strong af uptrend.\n\nSo now, if I had to guess, shorts are probably piling in given the CNBC signal. No one goes on that show without a personal interest in the stock they are talking about and its not hard to determine the guy saying sell is either short or actually looking to start a position because of FOMO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are your financial advisors suggesting you sell immediately:\n\n[Admits if it holds over 10 which it obviously is, its going higher.
