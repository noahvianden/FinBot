Everyone was just handing out money - and RE supporters were screaming - don't miss the boat. RE always outperforms the stock market, etc.  \n\nIn 2001 - you had the tech bubble pop.  Same situation - but, with technology.  VC/PE firms were handing out money to every single tech company (it seemed) - people would go IPO - champagne would flow from heavens, and everyone made money. \n\nFlash forward to today - the market runup in RE, commodities, stock, etc. - has been unprecedented.  Interest rates have been kept too low -- too long.  I mean, back in 2012-2017 - interest rates were around 5% IIRC.  RE market did not crash.  \n\nSomething that inflates THAT fast - has to have SOME air let out of it.  The fact that people claim interest rates today make buying too expensive - means 'something' is out of whack.  It needs to be rebalanced.  So, either the assets deflate - OR, you inflate something else to create another bubble.  \n\nI think the problem the FED has - it CANNOT afford to have interest rates move that high.

A lively being, resembling a squirrel, was gifted to the boy by an enigmatic stranger. This creature, named Whiskers, was brimming with life, an embodiment of the spirit of the townsfolk, their tales, their wisdom, and their shared laughter.\n\nHowever, an unexpected encounter with a flamboyantly blue hound named Azure, a plaything of a cunning, opulent merchant, set them on an unanticipated path. The hound, a spectacle to behold, was the product of a mysterious alchemical process, a design for the merchant's profit and amusement.\n\nOn returning from their encounter, the boy noticed a transformation in Whiskers. His fur, like Azure's, was now a startling indigo, and his vivacious energy seemed misdirected, drawn into putting up a show, detached from his intrinsic playful spirit. Unknowingly, the boy found himself playing the role of a puppeteer, his strings tugged by unseen hands. Whiskers had become a spectacle for the townsfolk, and in doing so, the essence of the town, their shared stories, and collective wisdom began to wither.\n\nRecognizing this grim change, the townsfolk watched as their unity and shared knowledge got overshadowed by the spectacle of the transformed Whiskers. The boy, once their symbol of unity, was unknowingly becoming a merchant himself, trading Whiskers' spirit for a hollow spectacle.\n\nThe transformation took a toll on Whiskers, leading him to a point of deep disillusionment. His once playful spirit was dulled, his energy drained, and his essence, a reflection of the town, was tarnished. In an act of desolation and silent protest, Whiskers chose to leave. His departure echoed through the town like a mournful wind, an indictment of what they had allowed themselves to become.\n\nThe boy, left alone, began to play with the merchants, seduced by their cunning words and shiny trinkets. He was drawn into their world, their games, slowly losing his vibrancy, his sense of self. Over time, the boy who once symbolized unity and shared knowledge was reduced to a mere puppet, a plaything in the hands of the merchants.\n\nEventually, the merchants, having extracted all they could from him, discarded the boy, leaving him a hollow husk, a ghost of his former self.

Everyone sat up and took notice when Citi tightened up their conforming policies and starting shaving off points on the back, but I was suspicious of how Countrywide could still manage to offer better rates than, say, Flagstaff or Wells Fargo, and started to plan around exiting.\n\nWell, I was going to anyway because the business is soul-sucking and I hated it.  The reasons why were all red flags as well, in retrospect.  Volume was king, no matter what.  We had dozens of subprime houses offering niche - places that specialized in SIVA and SISA programs, sub 500, 400 and up, 5 or even 3 years out of bankruptcy, 7/5/3 ARMs and 10 year balloons, divested equity lending, all sorts of crap.

Sure, underwriting is probably under more scrutiny, but the real problem wasn't robo-approval, it's the programs themselves, and appealing to selling long term debt to borrowers for short term gain in paper sales.

We have 2 negative Qs back to back and they're still saying no recession, but don't worry, they will, they just wait until it is no longer a question in anyone's mind..\n\nNow, CNBC was NOT warning as much as they should have, until stocks collapsed. No other media outlet was reporting as much as they should have, until stocks collapsed, but some people 100% predicted it (Peter Schiff (banned from CNBC), Michael Burry (comes on very occasionally but barely ever invited), and many other less known folks CNBC doesn't bring on) and these people were ridiculed by CNBC/MSM whenever they came on, warning about this in 2006 and 2007, saying in early 2008 that we were in recession, basically laughed out of the room because in the NBER hadn't \"declared\" one yet and the government \"doesn't see one yet\".\n\nPeter Schiff and Michael Burry have been calling for severe inflation since COVID started due to Federal Reserve monetary policy, that it would NOT be transitory, that much bigger interest rate hikes than we've had so far will be necessary, that we ARE in recession right now, and that it will be getting way, way worse once the financial crisis begins and either large systemically important corporations start needing bail outs and/or some financial institutions fail and/or the stock market and debt market ceases to have the deadly levels of hopium and copium they've been smoking and fall 50%... Then suddenly EVERYONE will claim they saw this coming and present obscure clips of them saying \"welllll maybe things could go badly here yeah know...\" they'll blame the Fed for tightening too much when in reality it was the fact that the USA in particular but the entire globe in general is SO FREAKING INDEBTED (because the REAL mistake the Fed made was keeping interest rates at 0% for 13 years essentially and printing $9 trillion during that time, and more recent than that, pretending inflation is transitory for way too long and taking way too long to tighten, NOT \"because they tightened too hard..\". So now that there's all this debt accumulated post-2008 due to 0% interest rates, including US gov debt, that a historically normal Fed Funds rate of say 5 - 6% will cause massive mortgage delinquincies, defaults, foreclosures, massive stock market collapse, either taxes will need to go up massively, the budget will need to be cut massively, or the Federal Reserve will need to print epic sums more of fresh money fuelling inflation. The sad thing is they'll probably have to do all 3 based on how abhorrent the debt loads are for US gov, US households, and US corporations, especially in a recession where US tax revenues fall... The bond market will probably jump to 20% on long term debt realizing the ONLY way the USA will ever pay the principal back with Fed Funds at 5 - 6% or higher will require massive money printing...\n\nIt is going to be bad. \n\nBut yeah, at this point in 2008 the warnings were basically \"some bad stuff is happening in sub-prime, but only over-exposed institutions to the sub-prime market will be effected and the economy can handle this fine...\" then it was NOT contained to sub-prime (just like inflation was not transitory) and shit VERY SUDDENLY hit the fan and CNBC went from \"this is probably a great buying opportunity\" to \"this will be perhaps worse than the great depression\" in about the matter of one week. Stocks started those few weeks of the 2008 crash down ~15 - 25% IIRC and then fell to lows of down 55% or 60% over the following months, most of it in the first 2 or 3 weeks of CNBC flipping the script. But they never said \"SELL EVERYTHING!!!\" It was always, and always will be \"well, it has sold off 35% so at this point you can't sell..\" It is basically \"hold your stocks because this is probably a correction even though literally every sign points to recession or some depression ahead\" and then, once stocks due crash \"welp, it is too late to sell now, if ANYTHING you should be buying here, and that's why we always say to keep dry powder around... Even though we also constantly tell you all to buy the dips...\"\n\nMakes perfect sense if the goal of your network is to be a salesman for Wall Street stocks, right? They want you invested permenently, never to sell, and to always be putting more in thanks to 401K and IRA etc for retirement. But never ever sell. Meanwhile, Wall Street is way smarter, they know when to sell, when to buy, etc, at least for these much bigger credit cycle moves like 00-03, 08-10, and 22-2X. So Goldman Sachs for example has been consistent sellers since late 2020 (and if you look, the market hasn't done much since then, but they captured a ton of those 2021 gains as well). They have a massive cash pile. All other big banks with long and good track records are doing the same. Google, Apple, etc. - massive cash piles. Berkshire - massive cash piles. Now, you can look at Goldman and think \"wait they still have the same amount invested in stocks as they did in late 2020, what gives..? Yes, they are similarly invested. What they pulled, into their pile of cash though, are profits. That cash will set for a year or two earning safe interest over night at the Fed's Reverse Repo Facility SCAM and then when markets crash, stop taking their 100% safe 2.5% / year return, and deploy it to high quality companies at prices not seen since maybe the early 2010s, if not that low then I imagine AT LEAST as low as either the 2015/2016 tops, or the 2015 / 2016 bottoms.\n\nThey are all ready for a huge crash. They make some losses but pick up a ton of cheap shares that they sold at the top, perhaps doubling, tripling, or quadrupling their stakes in good companies.

I know my father was an engineer at the shipyard and during all of the 2000s era always worried about mass layoffs. Luckily he never was laid off but overtime definitely vanished a lot and grilled cheese/weenies beanies was what’s for dinner. He sold his house in 2006 for a premium right before the downturn but also repurchased so took a hit there which those houses finally just recovered to those prices. I worked in restaurants then and run them now and the consumer inconsistent slowdowns are similar in the last few months but other things are different. It’s like a recession where some are struggling to battle inflation and others are upset because they can’t get their 10k watch for 3 months because of supply shortages.\n\nA lot is different now but there is definitely shenanigans going on behind the scenes. It’s almost like the government was like what are we going to do about all these baby boomers about to retire with no money since they took it up the ass so many times in recent decades. It’s like we orchestrated growth letting the rich get richer but helping those middle class boomers simultaneously but then Covid came along. So what do we do? Let’s print more money at the wrong time. \n\nThe big difference now is jobs are everywhere. Sure there is some media tech slowdown fud but overall everyone is hiring. I think what’s important now is housing needs to stay somewhat sustained. Unless air bnb, Zillow etc go out of business or some strict policy gets introduced changing the tax profile on multiple house ownership then that area will probably sustain and maybe even grow another 20% in the next 5 years. Just no supply. \n\nWhat the future brings I feel will highly revolve around what happens with middle class wages. On average lower income got raises, lower middle class got raises, middle class 60s-100k got nothing, upper middle class became upper class through asset growth. So what will happen in the future around middle class 60s-100k incomes is important. Their jobs are valuable to lower middle class and those companies are getting crushed by lower class wage growth so are not currently addressing that income sector which is very important for economic growth. I assume the new middle class needs a 25-30% increase in income to sustain growth. I think this will be achieved as lower income jobs will continue to be eliminated by technology doing those jobs allowing companies to justify wage growth elsewhere and it’s just a matter of how long till this happens. My guess is in 6-8 years we will see some crazy stuff happen with technology advancements. Lower income workers in whole have horrible work ethics and we are only looking at their income as a concern because of how many adults are working college kids jobs as careers. I’m sure the concept that if you have kids it’s better to make 30k then 50k with government perks doesn’t help that. $15-$20 an hour is just too much money to pay that quality of work and it will continue to be a focus of elimination for years to come. \n\nLong term everything looks pretty screwed as we continue to keep things going through debt. Problem is, no politicians are acting for the economic long term and instead just continue to pad the short term. Until some leaders say I don’t care if everything tumbles and everyone hates me, think about our great great grand babies then nothing will probably change. At the same time in an everything bubble any sudden shock could tumble everything very quickly. Something like a catastrophic war event on US ground could do that but our Navy makes that very difficult to accomplish. \n\nTLDR: need housing prices to sustain (they probably will), lower income jobs will be eliminated, middle class incomes need increases, and America loves debt.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "as energy prices come down, we may very well be peaking inflation now. 2008 I was on the internet but not reddit and not stocks/investing, so i wouldnt remember that part, but the bank imploding and housing crisis was very real.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Everybody started worrying about this recession in 2010 and they have kept worrying more and more every day.

When he practiced law, the American financial and judicial systems were more honest and forthcoming than they were when I got to college. Not saying there wasn't corruption or dishonesty in his time, just that there were more honest people participating in those systems than today.\n\nSo, initially, one of the things a lot of us took away from that class was the goal of owning a home. As far as I can remember, the average American had no idea the housing market was about to crash. In fact, now that I remember, the media tried to water everything down as much as possible. President Obama initiated his $300B stimulus plan, and a few months later it was reported that as much as 1/3 of it just up and vanished.\n\nSo, from where I was at the time, nobody talked about a recession because none of us really knew it was coming. It wasn't until the market started crashing and property values began to plummet that people knew something was up, and that someone or a group of people at the top had screwed everyone over and no one dared speak about what happened.\n\nI was actually very lucky because I was young, working an hourly job, and didn't own any property or investments.

The financial world envisioned by Minsky is different in every respect from the EMH [Efficient Markets Hypothesis] paradigm. While the good times are rolling, people forget the bitter lessons of the past. (“This time is different.”) So financial excesses grow more, not less, severe as the bubble progresses—creating greater vulnerability to shocks and more damage when the crash comes. The crash itself always seems to come as a surprise; and after it, sentiment swings radically in the other direction. People shun risk, pessimism rules, and the economy struggles. . \"\n\n3) Reinhart-Rogoff recessions are worse than Keynesian recessions. \" . . Reinhart-Rogoff recessions destroy parts of the financial system and leave much of the rest reeling—and needing to deleverage. All of that stunts and delays recovery. Reinhart-Rogoff recessions also leave large buildups of debt—financial sector debt, corporate debt, household debt, and public debt—in their wake. . \"\n\n4) Self-regulation is oxymoronic. \n\n5) Fraud and near-fraud can rise to attain macroeconomic significance. \n\n6) Excessive complexity is not just anti-competitive, it's dangerous. \n\n7) Go-for-broke incentives will induce traders to go for broke. \n8) Illiquidity closely resembles insolvency.

Additionally their Cpu’s typically generate less heat than Intels as well. \n\n- Has started taking marketshare away from Intel in laptop, and notebook segments and is looking at huge improvements for next year.
