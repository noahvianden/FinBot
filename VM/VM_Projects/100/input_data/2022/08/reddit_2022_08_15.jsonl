It would likewise put SPXU around 16 (remember this because it is 3X leveraged and that it is a decaying asset. This would explain why when the S&P 500 was at 4000 back in late July SPXU was closer to 17 but will not reach that high again when if it hits 4000 in the future).  \nAlright, if a person was to play it safe and have an options trade (put) set for SPY with a strike price of 400 and an options trade (call) set for SPXU with a strike price of 15, does this seem like too easy of money? The opposite seems even more \"too easy\" - which would be to have a long call say for June 2023 doing the opposite (betting that SPY will be above current price and that SPXU will be below current price).

It would seem pointless in that respect. \n\nHowever, there are three possible outcomes:\n\n* Scenario 1) The price never drops below the strike price. In this case, your (B) costs cancels out your (A) profits and you break even. This is the worst outcome.\n\n* Scenario 2) The price hits the strike price but doesn't drop much further.

This is an acceptable outcome, but you would have been just as well-off had you remained in cash and simply placed a limit order for $100.\n\n* Scenario 3) The price hits the strike price and keeps dropping.

In July, Tesla said it delivered nearly 255,000 vehicles in the second quarter, down about 18% from the previous quarter. Still, the electric-auto maker beat Wall Street’s expectations in its second-quarter earnings, defying projections that Shanghai shutdowns would hurt its bottom line. \n\nWhen earnings were released, Musk said the company had been in “supply-chain hell for several years,” but barring a surprise, “we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.” \n\nIn that report, Tesla said the Shanghai factory achieved “the highest vehicle production month in our history” in June.

This is gonna become less and less of a problem as time goes by and eventually charging infrastructure becomes ubiquitous\n\nI also wanna point out that swapping stations are massive and easily take up the same space as 2½-3 or more parking spots. And probably cost the same as 10 charging stations to setup and maintain. So for every swapping station, that's a lot of extra parking spots and charging stations that could be set up instead, which would help alleviate the issues you describe. \n\nAnd while I would argue that battery degradation isn't really an issue in general. If that is something you're worried about (as I assume it is since you bring it up) I really don't see how that's not something you'd worry about when using swapping stations. Right now you might not be getting 10 year old battery packs that's been passed around between hundreds of cars, but that's obviously gonna change over time, and eventually very well used battery packs are absolutely gonna be swapped into your car regularly. And personally I'd worry a lot more about degradation when I'm getting swapped in decade old packs that's been in a 100+ cars, than a non swappable battery in my own car that I know has been treated well\n\nSwapping to a bigger pack if needed does sound neat I'll admit (though pretty limited in it's use case). And again, allowing for battery swaps, especially if different sized packs have to all fit in the same cars and work in all future cars so each swapping station will be future proof for at least a decade or more, means that *a lot* of compromises have to be made in terms of cost, complexity and efficiencies.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "For what it’s worth, I like driving teslas and I think they are fun cars.

I suppose this makes me biased in some peoples view but I’ll try to be impartial.\n\nThe swap stations take up 3 parking spots and can theoretically fully charge about 12-13 cars per hour (from x% to 93% charged). 3 supercharger spots can’t do that. So they take up less room than most tesla supercharger stations if you are concerned about the footprint. Yes most people probably don’t charge to 90% though because Tesla does do a good job of telling you how much you should charge to optimize your time. Yes as charging tech improves then swapping becomes less necessary perhaps, but swap speeds can also improve. Swapping also has the benefit of charging batteries off peak hours, monitoring battery health, getting poor or damaged batteries out of circulation, etc.\n\nI personally don’t care about battery degradation but I know a lot of people online seem to, that’s why I brought it up. I think it’s an overblown worry. \n\nSwapping to a bigger pack is limited use I suppose, but it addresses a big complaint of people online which is lack of range or range anxiety. If you wanted to tow something (another issue brought up often online) or do a road trip, and your car today has a 75kwh pack and you can double that with 150kwh for your road trip and tow your camper, that seems to me to be ideal to solve one of the issues that people without EVs constantly moan about. If by limited use case you mean road trips are rare, yeah probably right, but it doesn’t stop the loudest people from complaining about lack of range. I think we shouldn’t cater to the loudest, dumbest amongst us, but hey, one less excuse for them to avoid an EV is probably a good thing imo. Paying 100 bucks or whatever to upgrade your battery for a week or two is something that a lot of NIO owners I know have taken advantage of and been happy with. \n\nI don’t think there is any worry about battery packs no fitting into the cars in the future… it would be insane for them to create different sized packs and multiple incompatible swap stations. The tech improves and energy density improves, but they still stick em in the same size pack and slot it into your car. NIO currently has 70, 75, and 100kwh packs in circulation. Soon they’ll have 150kwh. Every NIO can use every battery. \n\nAlso chargers are everywhere in China, and you still end up waiting at times for a charge. As chargers become ubiquitous, so do EVs.

The stock price just keeps going up, and up, and up. Let's find out why.\r  \n**Stock Buybacks**\r  \nFinancial engineering has a bad reputation because of the implication that it's used to hide flaws in a business. Now, that being said, perhaps something \"dark\" and manipulative is happening with AAPL stock with relation to financial engineering. Here is what **CNBC** said in 2019:\r  \n*Apple's aggressive use of its copious cash resources to repurchase its shares at modest valuations in recent years has shown the power of buybacks for a maturing company that is clearly in a growth lull. And, Apple is not a typical company, long-term shareholders view it more as a financial asset, and have directly benefited from the company's spending on capital investment.*\r  \nWhile this may slander AAPL reputation, the fact is that AAPL is openly manipulating its own stock in a manner that could be described as self-dealing. The company is using its cash to proactively pander to large financial institutions and smart money investors. But the AAPL stock buybacks are at least rational given the valuation. \r  \nThe slowdown in iPhone unit sales in the past few years has slowed Apple's overall growth since its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2015. In fact, net income this fiscal year is projected to be almost exactly equal to what Apple booked several years earlier.\r  \n**Global Central Banks**\r  \nSince 2020, Global central banks have been pumping $834 million into the financial markets every 60 minutes… and every 60 minutes the market cap of global tech stocks has risen $780 million.\r  \nSo, an insane amount of money is being printed and pumped into the financial system, which increases demand for financial assets, and then that added money pours into AAPL stock itself. That is, investors buy the stock because the price of the stock keeps going up. \r  \nWhen you increase the money supply, smart money people use that money to chase after financial assets, assets like AAPL stock. In other words, increases the money supply inflates the price of a stock itself. In effect, when M2 increases, you get inflation in the real world, but you also get asset inflation in the price of stocks, like AAPL.\r  \nAlthough AAPL is getting more and more mature, it's still a growth stock. I mean that in terms of products and services, AAPL is no longer a growth stock, but in terms of stock price, AAPL still moves like a growth stock. And, as its stock price grows, it's actually acting like a battery, holding financial energy. As the M2 money supply increases at a fast pace, AAPL is the kind of company that can roughly keep pace with inflation, because of investor demand.\r  \nIn plain terms, inflation is driving up prices. Because of investor demand, AAPL stock price increases, which causes it to capture more of that money, even if each dollar is worth a bit less. Furthermore, AAPL stock continues to appreciate, holding the value of previously invested money so that purchasing power holds.\r  \nFor many investors, it's far better to hold AAPL as an asset than cash. As the money supply increases, every unit of \"money value\" decreases. However, if your assets can keep pace, or do better, then you can keep racing ahead of that inflation curve. Again, AAPL is a financial battery, because it holds value.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Everyone who buys VOO,SPY etc is pumping up apples value though, people invest indirectly", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "SP500 also just weight more heavy into AAPL as well. \n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-stock-price-sp500-weighting-51660238751", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "I think VOO and SPY etc are overvaluing a lot of companies, its just all hype, imagine the stock prices without ETFs\n\n\nThat being said, VOO is the best thing to buy regardless", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Have you seen VUG?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Cramer says don’t trade AAPL lol.

They also called the stock market’s rally off the mid-June lows unsustainable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEquities were slightly higher at midday Monday, taking back modest loses seen after U.S. data missed forecasts and China’s unexpected signs of slowing growth damped investor sentiment. Financial markets have been shifting back and forth between two narratives — one in which easing inflation and slowing growth give the Fed room to back off aggressive rate hikes, the other in which persistently high price gains coupled with a robust labor market compel policy makers to continue lifting borrowing costs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJuly’s downside surprise in the consumer-price index gave equities a boost and helped send the S&P 500 SPX, 0.40% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, 0.62% to their fourth straight week of gains on Friday. The S&P 500 has surged more than 16% from its June low and retraced more than 50% of its bear-market drop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRead: Inflation surge cools in July.

Our bottom line: The latest inflation reading isn’t enough to spur the Fed pivot we’ve been waiting for to lean back into stocks.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat’s more, they said, consumer spending is in the process of shifting toward services and away from goods, the category which benefited from the stay-at-home stage of the pandemic. That shift “could hit stocks,” according to the BlackRock strategists: They note that earnings tied to goods are expected to make up 62% of the S&P 500’s profits this year, versus 38% for services, as shown in the chart below.

I think differently, so much so I think we will see ATH this fall and possibly hit 5000 by Christmas.

The line at Chik fil A is still long as ever, and people still can’t get a PS5 at retail.\n\n2: The Ukraine war isn’t that big of a deal. Support is starting to wane, and oil prices are going down anyway. Eventually the conflict will fade into obscurity. As for the European winter, so what if they have to turn on their coal plants? They will still be itching to buy the next iPhone.\n\n3: Chinese housing crisis isn’t a crisis at all. CCP will simply “fix” the balance sheets like they have the last 20 years, and everything will be alright. It’s worked in the past, it will work in the present. The mighty Chinese economic machine will keep churning\n\n4: Inflation is going down, but even if it didn’t, it’s not a big deal. Companies will just raise their prices, and people will continue to buy at those prices. Corporate profits are at ATH in some sectors. Therefore stocks in those remain high. Do you really want to stay in cash with all that action happening?\n\n5: Despite rising interest rates, they are still at historic lows.

{"title": "BBBY is well on its way", "selftext": "Regards fellow Regards.\n\nI wanted to do a quick update on BBBY as there are some interesting developments and further landmines for shorties.\n\nLooking at what happened to BBBY last week, we saw a big gap up from 8.16 to around 13 and close of 11.31 Monday. What caused such a big move like that was this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lewmlo804sh91.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=439d7174ffa44ed087a5e6579ddd11f4ad3690f7\n\nAbove was the options chain as it was Thursday the 4th. On the 5th, as we closed above 8, all of the highlighted calls expired ITM. Approximately 37,118 just going off the open interest in the snap shot I had back then which = 3,711,800 shares.\n\nAs BBBY already had a ton of open interest leading into these recent movements, you will see on virtually all option chains there is a ramp being built. As BBBY moves higher, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy of expiring contracts ITM and further propulsion higher.\n\nHere is the options chain of ITM contracts for Friday (we closed under 13 and remained that way through 5:30 PM which is the last moment you can exercise).\n\nHere is fridays contracts all ITM\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekbjpjmv4sh91.png?width=1941&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e012a8dc978a396616e772e818241be6469bc64\n\nThis represents 62,849 contracts ITM and this equates to 6,284,900 shares. This is roughly just under double what happened on last Friday the 5th.\n\nBelow is Aug 19, this coming Friday and this is already all ITM:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wndkgerd5sh91.png?width=1941&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d0e9fe0cca40f89c1490c5b833cf4fcb6c1d9ae\n\nThis represents 51,618 contracts ITM right now that dont even expire until this Friday and I imagine even more will be added in further out strikes over the week. This represents 5,161,800 shares.\n\nOpen interest is stacking elsewhere too, more particularly on the Sept 16 and further on the Jan 2023. Here are the highlights for whats in store:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xsbqgyhw5sh91.png?width=1941&format=png&auto=webp&s=748cbb6b01d0ff868a5b275706bb94597a7d6422\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x86lkr9y5sh91.png?width=1941&format=png&auto=webp&s=a147237277c66a0d1ec46ddc0b93a28c462363c5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0t3wzr316sh91.png?width=1941&format=png&auto=webp&s=1be658cd876ea5d960c9e670f4b1e78368bf30b3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheres even a cute buildup of open interest on Jan 2024!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nt7uqbq36sh91.png?width=1941&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2f3ba50d9e4ad2e9026bf6a7cad8f2e9f8ec0c6\n\nI decided to do the math and if there is any part of all this thesis on BBBY that is a nail in the coffin it's this.\n\nJan 2023 ALONE has 305,170 open interest running from 8 to 80. So if BBBY ever gets to 80, exactly 30,517,000\n\nKeep in mind the stock only has  79,960,000 outstanding shares and a float of  69,450,000. 55,767,626 of which are owned by the top holders of BBBY and 29,000,000 shares are short. So right now between shorted shares and actual holdings not even by any retail at all, 84,767,626 shares are tied up. Throw another 30,517,000 shares in the mix by Jan of 2023 and who knows what the price action will do. Could go down, could go up, who knows!\n\nIf you haven't noticed, all stocks are doing well right now. It is important that the maco economic green light is on so to speak. This makes BBBY the value in BBBY shine even more. BBBY has 7B in trailing 12 months revenue. The ONLY thing \"holding it back\" according to all our favorite analysts is debt. Let something come up about a debt refinance, far OTM warrants offering or restructuring of the bonds break loose and we go even higher because then the analysts won't have anything left to complain about.\n\nLong term it matters if the management company cares about the company and fixing its fundamental problems. Once net income is fixed, BBBY doing 7B in revenues. Buy Buy Baby doing 1.3B. This revenue will only grow especially under this leadership team that actually cares about the company. This in and of itself can command the previous prices in 2013 and 14 of 80/share before Tritton ever got involved.\n\nWorried about some tomfoolery coming in to basically cheat like they did last time? The odds of that are very low now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ro4taj7r9sh91.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01e6ede77ae4a4165cc1f5ab13866ea81eee53f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lptl66ht9sh91.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=41a7f7ac6301c8066334c04907461ff77d029d2a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/587trmhw9sh91.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=73b6fa33edb1830fc32c27e5862d8b4a2405ec45\n\nRobinhood is in some hotwater and it serves as a warning to other brokerages who did do the same thing to try it again. It acts as a classical skull on a pole type of message.\n\nThere were some interesting things that happened with GME and its price swings. This sums it up:\n\nEvery day, high frequency trading firms like Citadel siphon away investors’ money using their super-sophisticated, blink-of-an-eye trading systems to anticipate upcoming market moves and pick off investors’ orders at favorable prices.  They then turn around and immediately resell those shares at the improved price, pocketing billions of dollars in sure-fire profits.  Called ‘latency arbitrage,’ the practice moves money from the pockets of everyday investors to the coffers of the sophisticated professional traders who get to take full advantage of their ‘sneak peak’ into the market.\n\n[https://bettermarkets.org/newsroom/todays-court-win-for-the-sec-is-a-big-win-for-investors/](https://bettermarkets.org/newsroom/todays-court-win-for-the-sec-is-a-big-win-for-investors/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gv2q0pkash91.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb115b2444db7508ce719f1b66516b31303a8f23\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t6xu226mash91.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=a03d5311524b36a2fecada710d8883bbfd6de414\n\nCitadel lost this case July 29th or at least that is when these were reported. Notice anything interesting since Aug? Some stocks have just been on a tear! Coincidence? I leave that up to you. What we do know is a certain someone can't cheat openly anymore.\n\nThe most recent whale wisdom is looking good. We even have a fair bit of healthy disagreement going on with one group buying a TON of puts and another fund happy to take the opposite with a TON of calls:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akylwn5cbsh91.png?width=1671&format=png&auto=webp&s=520436fc1234a3611c7140aeb8c16f9226dc936e\n\n[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/bbby](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/bbby)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mentioned earlier that the macro environment matters and it does. Its important to note that its basically party on until mid Sept. Next fed meeting is Sept 21st:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hmdoz8fqbsh91.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd62495c4e0a605a482a7d6d625248a3c43edb76\n\nNext inflation data Sept 13th:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jxdkplvsbsh91.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ba7ba1cb7b56f6bbb02bf98ec4f84dbbf31749d\n\nSo there virtually nothing to come in and pull the rug from the broader market macroeconomically. This means that money is coming into the markets because the coast is clear for now and we have seen that happen on just the broader indices. We don't even have BBBY earnings until an estimated 09/29! So there is literally a full month of no random inflation report or JPOW stepping in and destroying the direction of this recent rally.\n\nHeres something to laugh about:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v3me9eyqdsh91.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad03db91505cdbf1ddf362e4413a7e94d37b33a4\n\nLastly we still have the update coming this month! What could it be? It could be the start of no return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR;\n\n37,118 contracts expired 8/5 propelling us higher on 8/8. lil under double that has expired ITM on 8/12 for 62,849 contracts having expired ITM on Friday. Jan 2023 has 305,170 contracts ITM if it gets to $80 by then. Robinhood has more eyes on its practices than ever and so will other brokerages if they try to pull a fast one and speaking of fast ones, citadel and other traders like them don't have high frequency trading like they used to.\n\nBuckle up buttercup. Gonna be a bumpy ride\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqj1y837dsh91.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e9794accbb6909d0efbd333e2091b152b7b22f", "id": "wonfp2", "created_utc": 1660529561.0, "score": 3582, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 402, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|75|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1900|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vtw4n2/ryan_cohens_plan_for_dumpster_fire_company_with/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wgbdiy/ryan_cohens_plan_for_bbby_and_why_its_going/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wgbrj2/bbby_and_the_middle_game/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/u1qg8h) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wonfp2/bbby_is_well_on_its_way/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wdy79l/monkeypox_is_just_getting_started/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wdxu9u/monkey_pox_will_make_a_new_mrna_out_of_these/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vn60o3/tell_me_your_manipulating_the_stock_without/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vny656/i_figured_out_the_plan/) \n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wonfp2)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wonfp2)\n    \nHey /u/snippythehorses, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I aint becoming another DFV.

In a recession companies issue layoffs to keep profits up, and minimize losses, as people can’t afford goods.

If it proves stickier, then he'll be reviled like most other Fed chiefs.\n\nExpectations of poor corporate earnings - Earnings have mostly held up very well with a few notable exceptions, the general thesis among bears was that this current earnings cycle was going to be very poor, now they are pushing their pushing their poor earnings expectations down the road; for now the bears are wrong, but they could be right come Q4 as Q3 earnings come in.  Personally, I think earnings continue to hold up well.\n\nHigh oil and commodities - This is probably the one area that has - for now - been a resounding win for the bulls, prices are down dramatically for oil and most commodities.  This is a win for everyone and I wish I hadn't sold my puts on XOM.\n\nRussian aggression against Ukraine - No wins here, also no resounding losses, just two countries in a stalemate; any cessation of hostilities would represent an amazing reprieve for markets.\n\nThe bears are winning the war, but losing the battle in Q3, and the tide may continue to turn against them.  If inflation continues to decline, the Fed backs off on hawkish talk, and Q4 earnings are good, my bet is that SPY and QQQ return nominal gains for the year.  Those who invested between April - July will be rewarded handsomenly.  \n\nThis is my opinion and not investment advice.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Looking for the earnings thread? \n\nYou can always find it linked in the daily or weekend thread.
