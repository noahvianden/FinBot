The tax only applies to companies making huge profits. The minimum tax is 15%. Any company turning a profit and not even paying 15% in taxes, should be eradicated anyway. Small and medium sized companies are usually paying much more than 15% in taxes, since they do not have very expensive lawyers, accountants and financial setups dedicated to avoid paying taxes.

For example, corn at supermarket is generally an example of perfect competition because most don't care where it came from, how it was grown, and focus on price. \n\nWe, for the most part, operate in an imperfect competitive market which means producers DO have some control over price and have differentiated themselves from their competitors meaning factors other than price impact the consumers decision. Cell phones for example would be an imperfect market as some people care about price and some care about brand and others care more about features. Thus, producers CAN raise their price, to a degree, and maintain operations and maintain sales levels..\n\nNow, I've purposefully left out the concept of marginal cost but it's not as important when it comes to pricing because it's essentially just the bottom dollar a producer will sell at in perfect competition. \n\nBasically - because brands matter to people, producers can raise their prices and the market can sustain those prices.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Well this bill changes only the marginal cost, right?
