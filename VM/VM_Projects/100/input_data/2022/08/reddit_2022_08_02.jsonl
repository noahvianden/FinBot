Those cards were being bought up in record numbers for crypto miners, gamers, business use, etc., leading to the shortage. With the crypto market crashing (or at the very least…receding), miners won’t buy cards in massive lots. And their 40-series cards are the third generation of their RTX technology. Meaning if someone wants that, they can still get a 20-series card that does an excellent job. So while Nvidia will do fine, the launch of the 4000 series will not be the windfall like the 3000 series was. They also don’t make CPU’s, so…I think they’re the riskiest bet of the three. \n\nOnto to Intel. They are in the shakiest position. They’ve enjoyed years of essentially being the top dog until AMD finally managed to give them some competition. And while they’re trading blows in the consumer space, I see only losses there. But the commercial space is where it really matters, because that’s where you get $10M orders. Now I believe Intel likely has hold over the CPUs in business laptops and I don’t see AMD changing that (for security reasons built into the chips that AMD doesn’t do). But on the server side? AMD has built products to challenge Intel, but…Intel has agreements with companies. So the question is going to become can AMD convince Intels customers they’re the better choice in the long run, and cause Intel to lose them?

And they need to start really cracking into the server realm for companies to really grow, and we aren’t seeing that as much. There could be reasons behind that, license/service agreements, but if they can, that growth could be huge. Or they might flounder. I’d say AMD is the middle ground between the two companies.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.05 compared to $0.63 a year ago primarily driven by higher net income.\n- On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 54%, operating income was $2.0 billion, operating margin was 30%, net income was $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.05. The record non-GAAP operating income was $2.0 billion, or 30% of revenue, up from $924 million or 24% a year ago primarily driven by higher revenue and gross profit.\n- Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $6.0 billion at the end of the quarter and debt was $2.8 billion. AMD **repurchased $920 million of common stock** during the quarter.\n- Cash from operations was a record $1.04 billion in the quarter, compared to $952 million a year ago. **Free cash flow was $906 million in the quarter compared to $888 million a year ago.**\n- Goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando were $50.4 billion.\n\n**By sector:**\n\n- **Data Center** segment revenue was $1.5 billion, **up 83% year-over-year** driven by strong sales of EPYC™ server processors. Operating income was $472 million, or 32% of revenue, compared to $204 million or 25% a year ago. Operating income improvement was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. [Note: INTC saw 16% decline in its data center segment]\n- **Client segment** revenue was $2.2 billion, **up 25% year-over-year** driven by Ryzen™ mobile processor sales. Client processor ASP increased year-over-year driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales. Operating income was $676 million, or 32% of revenue, compared to $538 million or 31% a year ago. Operating income improvement was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\n\n- **Gaming** segment revenue was $1.7 billion, **up 32% year-over-year** driven by higher semi-custom product sales, partially offset by a decline in gaming graphics revenue. Operating income was $187 million, or 11% of revenue, compared to $175 million or 14% a year ago. Operating income improvement was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating margin was lower primarily due to lower graphics revenue and higher operating expenses.\n\n- **Embedded** segment revenue was $1.3 billion, **up 2,228% year-over-year** driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded revenue.

Talked to a loooot of my buddies for a long time about Taiwan over the past few days. Nobody over the past 7-8 years has ever made a convincing case to me that the Chinese stand a chance in a war with the U.S. and my DC group is largely in agreement: baring some unique scenario where they really can pull off some sort of new-tech enabled pearl harbor, which i deem unlikely, there is zero chance the PLA can ever break an American blockade. I'm happy to cross swords on this, but the U.S. isn't stupid and we know that fighting in the 1st island chain is risky. If the PLA can't completely wreck a serious number of U.S. capital assets in the first few days, they will lose, and badly. They can't defeat a blockade, and we will enforce one with-vigor (to say the least out of shipping going to zero due to lloyds of london).\n\nYeah there is a chance of unintended escalation and random crisis, but as long as there are no unintended moves, I am extremely confident that there will not be anything worse than the 96 strait crisis--patrols, airspace violations, a few bombs here and there (but not populated targets), economic sanctions, big threats....\n\nDo not worry. The U.S. military can fucking destroy the PLA if they survive any off-chance fuckery in a day zero event and dont get stupid and try and knife fight in the Chinese littoral. The Chinese are an export oriented economy that completely relies on oceanic transport. Even if they took Taiwan, we can look at 2500 years of western naval tradition for guidance...you have to defeat a blockade or escalate in other ways to end the blockade, which we will not end. This is like...a cataclysmic scenario, but if any of you pay attention to Chinese defense media, blockade scenarios are very top of mind for them. They think about it. The U.S. would squat in the indian ocean and western pacific and peel back China's A2/AD onion with a sharp knife over months....the Chinese economy would implode. This is the worst nightmare for Chinese military planners. \n\nWe just had a class-A example of an authoritarian regime with fancy tech weapons that blusters a lot but with poor training and soldier quality / moral issues get their face stomped in when push came to shove. The PLA has been worried about that exact same thing for over 10 years. \n\nI was completely wrong on Putin giving up after what i SUCCESSFULLY predicted--a massive Russian military upset. Feel free to call disagree but put-up-or-shut-up.\n\nI am going to buy every dip that this taiwan crisis offers. This crisis is probably a godsend to us. Xi knows that Biden and Elon hate each other and they will definitely read into that. Tesla may be less-screwed in any pressure chokehold on american companies.\n\nTLDR: The PLA still ca'nt fight and win a war with the U.S. Unless random fuckery happens, do not worry.
