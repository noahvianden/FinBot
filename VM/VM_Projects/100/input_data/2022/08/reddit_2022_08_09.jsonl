The cost of the 1% tax on buybacks will be borne by companies like [**Apple**](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/) ([**AAPL**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)), which added $90 billion to its share repurchase plan in April.\n\nBuyback Tax Impact On Apple, S&P 500 Earnings\n\nThe tax on such a massive Apple stock buyback could amount to as much as $900 million a year, once the tax takes effect in 2023.\n\nConsider what that might mean if the tax were in effect now: A $90-billion stock buyback would raise Apple earnings per share by about 3.5% thanks to a lower share count. However, a $900 million tax would shrink the buyback's boost to EPS to about 2.5%.", "id": "wk1fbx", "created_utc": 1660046250.0, "score": 211, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "Is that math correct?

You might have heard of the “dividend discount model” for valuing stocks favored by some of the old legendary value investors. A dividend in general makes the stocks significantly more attractive to investors, increasing demand. Many dividends are also reinvested again increasing demand for shares.\n\nUnfortunately dividends are taxed and stock buybacks or not. But I would absolutely rather have the cash.

And that’s a fat red flag investors may want to heed, warns our **call of the day** from Citigroup.\n\n“Our index of global sell-side recommendations is back to peak bullishness levels reached in 2000 and 2007, after which global equities halved,” noted a team led by chief global equity strategist, Robert Buckland.\n\n“Analysts are net buyers of every sector in every region, but then they usually are,” he said, noting specific concentration on U.S. and emerging markets. “They are still bullish on cyclical sectors suggesting few fears of oncoming global recession.”\n\nCiti calculates its index of global sell-side calls by aggregating those on all stocks in MSCI indexes, ranging from 5, a strong buy, to 1, a strong sell. Their index is above three almost everywhere. They note that analysts are never net sellers of their stocks, even in the case of bear markets. While it seems analysts get more bullish as equities rise, it could also be that the “market rises because they are getting more bullish.”\n\nIn any case, that “analyst herding” has triggered a red flag in Citi’s bear market checklist, which has eased to 6 from a potential 18 flags. Note, this particular flag gave a false sell signal in 2012, when global stocks were flat for the following 12 months. But still, what happened in 2000 and 2007 makes it worth noting they say.\n\nBuckland and the team say analysts tend to get the start of bear markets wrong, by turning even more bullish when they should be growing cautious. “Even though they are starting to revise down earnings forecasts, falling share prices and cheapening valuations keep them positive. They eventually do turn more cautious as earnings forecasts fall further, but it is a slow process.”", "id": "wk0zp2", "created_utc": 1660044861.0, "score": 575, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "“Stocks might go down but they also might go up.

{"title": "Market timers, this post is for you: the relative cheapness of value stocks is at historic levels, across the world. History says to buy!", "selftext": "**TL;DR**: Value stocks are calling out for your attention. The value spread is at historically favorable levels (for value stocks), and this predicts strong future earnings relative to growth.\n\nNot since the Dot Com era have we seen value stocks spreading themselves so enticingly.\n\nWhat is the value spread? Definitions abound, but in general, it measures the relative cheapness of value stocks to growth stocks. For example, one might compare the E/P of value stocks to E/P of growth stocks (the inverse of the P/E ratio). More complex frameworks include metrics such as book/price, forecasted earnings to price, etc. \n\nBut value stocks are cheap for a reason, you say. The literature comes to the rescue: there have been numerous empirical studies verifying that periods of outperformance follow relatively cheap periods. Much as heightened values of the Shiller P/E ratio tends to forecast poor returns, historically cheap value stocks forecast great returns. This phenomenon is pronounced for small cap value.\n\nIn fact, simple mean reversion implies large premiums:\n\n> Value stocks look like a heck of a value right now! Look at it this way. As of yesterday, value stocks have a forward P/E of 13.4, against growth stocks at 22.4. The ratio is 0.57. To get back to the historical average ratio of 0.75, and assuming stable earnings, value stocks would have to rise by about 30 per cent, or growth stocks would have to fall by over 20 per cent, or some combination of both. A little mean reversion here would mean a lot of outperformance for value.\n\n[Source](https://www.ft.com/content/e3fb3c34-b982-4827-9762-f5b9a8d33dc5)\n\nLet's now present some graphs. From AQR capital, a normalized value spread measure the last few decades: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/PzKHi5Q.png). Here higher is cheaper value. They use a complex mixture to compute valuation, described in their [blog posts](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/Is-Systematic-Value-Investing-Dead).\n\nFrom the FT, a simpler graph of price/earnings: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/nz83cmC.png). Note that here 'lower' is cheaper since they use P/E instead of E/P.\n\nThis phenomenon is robust across the world: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/ytkZewM.png). In fact, the cheapness is even more extreme than Europe: [graph](https://i.imgur.com/P3nudFF.png). An [FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/a841583e-4ea7-4ff6-b673-ece22b72f100) explains just how remarkable this is:\n\n> Arnold also writes “value stocks in Europe are currently trading on lower PEs than they were five years ago . . . there are very few, if any, parts of developed market equities that the market is so pessimistic about that they’ve actually de-rated over the last five years.”\n\n> On top of the gap between the valuation of European growth and value, there is the gap between US value and European value: “The Russell 1000 value index is a 16.5 forward PE, while the equivalent in Europe is on 11, an enormous differential in its own right. A cheap stock in the US is held in much higher regard than a cheap stock in Europe. Value stocks in Europe are the unloved of the unloved!”\n> \n> Finally, Arnold writes that “over the last five years Europe’s cheapest companies have delivered more profit growth than their growth counterparts . . . so over that 5 year period the real growth stocks in Europe, in terms of fundamentals anyway, have been the value stocks!” \n\n\nGrowth has been impressive the past decade, as [Larry Swedroe writes](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/is-small-cap-value-dead/), both in returns and fundamentals. But value stocks has done well for itself, fundamentally.\n\n> While it is true that earnings of large growth stocks have grown faster than earnings of small-cap value stocks — Avantis estimated that large growth earnings grew by approximately 194 percent between January 2010 and July 2021 versus an earnings increase of 177 percent for small value stocks — the differential was less than 2 percent per year. That differential is a lot smaller than what would have been the expected differential, and certainly cannot explain the fact that the return to large growth stocks was 492 percent versus the 181 percent return to small value stocks over that same period.\n\nSwedroe gives a short literature review on the evidence that this spread predicts returns.  For example,\n\n> Adam Zaremba and Mehmet Umutlu, authors of the March 2019 study Strategies Can Be Expensive Too! The Value Spread and Asset Allocation in Global Equity Markets, examined whether the value spread (the difference in valuation ratios between the long and the short sides of the trade) was useful for forecasting returns on quantitative equity strategies for country selection. To test this, they examined a sample of 120 country-level equity strategies replicated within 72 stock markets for the years 1996 through 2017.\n\n> They found: “The breadth of the value spread can predict the future returns in the cross-section. We show that equity strategies with a wide value spread markedly outperform strategies with a narrow value spread. In other words, if you wonder which strategy might produce decent payoffs in the future, pay attention to the value spread.”\n\nMean reversion alone predicts strong outperformance, but it is comforting to have empirical evidence across the world verifying that this mean reversion will probably happen.\n\nThis cheapness won't last forever, if history is to repeat itself. Eventually, money will flows into such unappreciated value, with strong fundamentals. The time to sin a little and market time is now. Thus, I conclude with a recommendation to buy small cap value ETFs, where the premiums are even higher.", "id": "wk4aa5", "created_utc": 1660054167.0, "score": 172, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "Interesting, thanks for sharing. How can it be that the Shiller ratio is currently relatively high, suggesting the whole market is expensive, and yet value stocks are comparably cheaper?

This is not unexpected: the growth part is higher than the average and the value part is less than the average.\n\nNow, it could be the case that value is in absolute terms expensive. That could imply trying to market time being in equities versus bonds. But the problem is that's even harder to time. The literature on this shows that the Shiller PE can trend upwards or downwards for periods spanning 50 years. Trying to time the Shiller PE is futile if it spans your entire investing horizon!\n\nThus, the interpretation of my post is, if you want to hold equities for the long term, there is a case to be made to overweight value relative to the market.\n\n> Also RE European value being at a discount, is that influenced by energy prices perhaps?\n\nLess to do with energy prices I think and more to do with the massive appreciation of the USD. But this makes buying Euro stocks 'cheaper' for US investors. There has always been reasons Euro stocks are very cheap, so I don't necessarily see them as 'worse' than say 5 years ago.

The BLS tries to introduce objectivity; it’s a guided survey. Homeowners input numbers into a formula, and OER is calculated from that. It’s not something extremely informal like:\n\n> BLS: “yo, how much would you rent your house for?”\n\n> Homeowner: “uhh…$1k?”\n\n> BLS: “cool bro”\n\nBut still, it’s prone to a lot of error.

It is the most secure crypto exchange and has a 56 million user base with 11% market share. 90% of their revenue comes from fees that they have held steady. Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges, of any type, in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin *AND* all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. For now, COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict but they are rapidly diversifying their revenue streams (NFT marketplace; custody agent for Facebook's crypto wallet and SoFi's crypto offering and others; starting a media arm; crypto derivatives; Coinbase AWS type of cloud services offering; etc). Once you have defi and staking opportunities really start come online at critical mass at COIN these create a yield generation opportunity. Another advantage of COIN is it is the first crypto exchange on a major market exhange, meaning COIN potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value. \n\nAs far as the criticism of Coinbase’s business model being eroded by other competitor entrants, COIN isn’t the same as a traditional stock exchange or broker, whose services are easier to duplicate. Coinbase has more comprehensive services, from custody to exchange to brokerage, and its fees take this larger suite of services into account. Handling cryptocurrencies is much trickier than holding stocks, given that crypto has a history of being hacked or lost. The company is also building out a “suite of services” that have recurring revenue, including a program called “staking” that allows crypto holders to earn interest. Also, the structure of COIN is really different when compared to traditional stock exchanges in that you have to think about COIN as being an amalgamation of a brokerage like Schwab + a custodian like BNY Mellon + an exchange like NASDAQ + an OTC desk + investment bank like Goldman Sachs and having a Citadel Capital all baked into one company. This collection of business types in COIN has a real moat and hence you have to look at COIN very differently and not compare it apples to apples with any type of traditional stock brokerage or even other crypto brokerages. COIN's ability to bundle these different services creates a moat that defends its margins and gives it pricing power.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I think the last 12 months has shown us that btc is not an insurance from inflation nor a store hold of value", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Neither is most of the NASDAQ.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Lol no one said it was.. what’s the Nasdaq got to to with anything", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "So what happens to Blackrocks offer and stock price?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "creepto is a scam.

They certainly didn't want Musk to buy originally, and if he does buy now they're probably all getting fired, so they might prefer to not get fired? But if the deal doesn't go through they're probably all getting sued by investors, so they don't want that.

Because then Musk would own the company and have all the data to figure out exactly how many bots there are, plus also have access to all their communications for the last 7 years or so?

{"title": "BBBY- The Do-Or-Die Moment for Short Sellers on 8/8 and 8/9 (DD)", "selftext": "I had been working on some DD prior to the initialization of the squeeze, but didn’t finish it in time, and there’s a lot of good DD out there already. I’m going to focus on what’s happening right now (8/9, BBBY down \\~20% and what it means).\n\n**TL:DR;** $BBBY has a lot of underwater short interest that is actively working against a squeeze. Today was a do-or-die moment.\n\n**Positions:** 11K shares at about $7. Took profits along the way, but I’m holding what I have left to see what happens.\n\n## Shares, Ownership & Short Interest\n\nBBBY has been buying back shares for the last few years (terrible capital allocation imo, but that’s water under the bridge) and is now down to **79M shares outstanding from 186M in 2015:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olsk42b65qg91.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae9337fa823a6d3a0c2661bda05316a4a6f238b5\n\nCurrently, institutions and strategic entities are long **84M shares** out of **79M outstanding** \\- yes, they are long more than 100% of issued shares. We’re not even talking about float here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9shqtnw75qg91.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=363edeb45e8cfcf1e6cff1ba8ba166e0749ce708\n\nAs you can see from the blue line in the first chart above, there was one large short cover during the squeeze in Jan 2021, but since then, the short interest has been mostly flat up until July of this year at about 20M shares - despite the buybacks.\n\nThat’s from quarterly short interest reporting. Now, S3 reports that **10M shares were shorted below $7**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo7mhoad5qg91.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=66cc9dacca854c0a0f7e6fd13f121329d3d5e490\n\nThe short thesis here, again, is bankruptcy. Admittedly, this is not an impossibility, though the higher the share price goes the less likely (given the potential to do share offerings to raise capital).\n\nSo, nutso summary here:\n\n* **80M shares issued**\n* **85M shares owned by institutions and funds**\n* **30M+ shares short, with 10M shorted below $7**\n\n## Price action on 8/8 after hours on 8/9\n\nI was pretty attuned to the GME squeeze in 2021 having written a lot of posts as part of my EndGame series. I’m seeing many similarities in behaviors. Here are some notes:\n\n* Shorts tended to defend the price level of 2x their entry. For GME, this was $15.8, which was defended hard a few times, and when that level was lost it was squeezetown. $15.8 represented **2x the entry price of a large quantity of shorts.** Why is this significant? At 2x the price, your short is now at **-100% and it’s very likely your risk mgmt group is going to shut you down.**\n* BBBY started going on 8/8 and in particular after hours. Why did we have a 16% spike after hours? **That started at $12.** **My hypothesis is that there were a group of shorts that entered at $6 and began to get force closed at -100%.**\n* Premarket at 8/9 was sitting at **$13+**. If the market opened bbby at $13+, there would have been a slew of force closures from smaller and potentially larger short entities as that would represent -100% for larger and larger portions of the 10M short shares added under $7. **It was critical for shorts to move the price down. Do or die at $13.**\n\n## So it's do-or-die, what do shorts do?\n\n* Selling during low volume premarket to establish downward trend\n* Shorting via synthetic shorts (short calls / long puts)\n* Analyst downgrades\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snvpahsh5qg91.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ba2111b9a9b32a6f2d5ee0cd540325aedc2a148\n\n* Potential astroturfing in WSB (low karma, low post history accounts sharing negative sentiment in daily thread)\n   * A decent amount of algos follow sentiment in retail, and in addition to shorting you can astroturf social media investing sites to change sentiment\n* Once BBBY hits -10%, they can’t short on the bid, so they establish sell walls to keep the price below ask (examples):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37lifq8l5qg91.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d24eb24f35033e1eae45703a253cdd71e4ba5eb\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05gaejgo5qg91.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=4126d9fe8c91366f36a8405f4a1ba80dc6e43ebd\n\nAdditionally, today marked the opening of a slew of strikes upward, **which is generally bearish b/c a bunch of retards tend to buy the highest strike, leading to negative pressure on the underlying when MMs later dehedge those positions.**\n\n## Where does that bring BBBY today?\n\n1. Shorts have won the day, turning momentum around with a massive reversal from 13+ to $9 currently\n2. However, they’re still sitting on 30M shorts, and probably more after today, with 10M+ entered below $7/share. So far, this hasn’t undone the beginning of this squeeze:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sosc4oq5qg91.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9a5b5011e344ec6b9aa557df23d3387817b49f2\n\nFinally, short shares availability is quite low - **so there's no evidence that shorts have actually covered at all during the 5-day rally.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Blue bars: short shares available. Red line is short borrow fee. ](https://preview.redd.it/uz4iys386qg91.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=524f21743a2735c778e44188acc1800f40be70fe)\n\n## So what now?\n\nThe long game: The short thesis is bankruptcy for $BBBY. If $BBBY can avoid bankruptcy, the short thesis is squashed and they’ll need to exit. This may not be today, tomorrow, or next month - but that’s the long game. Personally, I’m betting $BBBY finds a way to squash bankruptcy risk which will push this to a long struggle to get out for shorts.\n\nThe short game: It’s generally looking like retail is giving up the short game in the face of many strong short-seller tactics.\n\nIn my opinion, buying OTM calls just helps move the price down as MMs de-hedge, while shares reduce the pool of people that shorts can buy back from.\n\n## UPDATE: OH SHIT.\n\n## Just realized. BBBY short interest might be updating EOD TODAY! If that's true, that's another reason for the push down today.\n\n[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest#:\\~:text=All%20short%20interest%20positions%20must,settlement%20date%20designated%20by%20FINRA](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest#:~:text=All%20short%20interest%20positions%20must,settlement%20date%20designated%20by%20FINRA).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zp3pazgerqg91.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd311dc71f1ed2b0f9e542382979200b6079ce48\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlle43jdrqg91.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25a2e12dc3824a2117c0e43d39b666de745a684\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 8/9 SHORT INTEREST UPDATE \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Between 6/30 and 7/15, **Shorts added 7M shares short of $BBBY**\n* Between 7/15 and 7/29, **Shorts added 500K shares short of $BBBY**\n* Current official short interest as of 7/29 is **29M shares** [per Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest)\n* Unofficial ORTEX estimate is at **52M shares

is that significant?** \n\nLet’s look at [BBBY’s price between 6/30 and 7/15](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/history?period1=1656547200&period2=1657843200&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gtlaxv274rg91.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=c86cdcafc1bbe3da6e860f6aef081f8c50de7bb2\n\n \n\n**That’s an average close price of $4.9.**\n\n**7M shorts were added to BBBY’s short basket at an average price of $4.9.** \n\nBBBY is currently at $10 after hours. **7M shorts are sitting on over 100% loss.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4bv8sub4rg91.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=09671f8cb013cbf29b2845fe233428de8687e6dd\n\nKeep in mind in my previous post I shared that I don’t see any evidence of covering. \n\nNow, let’s look at [BBBY’s price between 7/15 and 7/29](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/history?period1=1657843200&period2=1659312000&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i3p4jxe84rg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cfae153a8f11ef2b7e993c2a8edf1fe5a7f1cf4\n\n \n\n**That’s an average close price of $5.08.**\n\n**500K shorts were added to BBBY’s short basket at an average price of $4.9.** \n\n## Summary: Shorts R Still Fuk\n\nSo, **7.5M shares were added in a month at an average price of $5,** there’s **no evidence of covering,** and **they’re sitting on a 100% loss at current prices.** \n\nYeah, I’m going to see how this all plays out. \n\n&#x200B;",

Think of this almost like a savings account where you just increase your position over time (this is good for blue chip stocks or dividend stocks with a solid track record).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, the opposite is also true.
