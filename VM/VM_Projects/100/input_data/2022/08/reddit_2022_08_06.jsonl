(from Financial Times article) = **$14,502,580,897.8**\n\nI therefore estimate that Elon needs a combination of an additional 14.5 Billion in cash, investment, and/or cooperation of existing big TWTR shareholders who are willing to go private.\n\n* **Edit:**  Elon likely has about 6.5 Billion in cash from TSLA stock sales in April.  This is net of taxes on 8.5 Billion worth of sales that ended in April ([https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-sells-tesla-shares-worth-4-bln-says-no-more-sales-planned-2022-04-29/](https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-sells-tesla-shares-worth-4-bln-says-no-more-sales-planned-2022-04-29/)).

I believe it has something to do with potential from PayPal that was never realized.  And as a platform for future self-governance of a Martian nation.  Remember that Elon said that real people needed to be authenticated.  This is critically important for a transactions service or a voting service.\n* Gaining 3 years is probably worth it to Elon.

Under this theory, the institutions would then swoop in and buy a lot of TSLA stock on the cheap.\n\nFor whatever reason, it didn't play out as the immediate disaster that Gary and many at TMC feared.\n\n* \"Bargain hunters\" are competing with one another for shares.  They are playing chicken with one another, and everyone has a different idea of a bargain\n* I agree with you that if Elon were legally obligated to sell 10s of Billions worth of TSLA stock, TSLA market valuation would lose hundreds of Billions in market cap.\n* I disagree with you that the effect would be instantaneous loss of 45% of TSLA's market cap.

It's like a giveaway.\n\nAs we know Joe has some success rolling over his fellow democrats and it looks as though this act which has massive financial incentives for green energy, both for consumers and the companies that provide green solutions may pass into law.\n\nThe best bits.\n\n## Households could receive $28,500 in up-front incentives to buy electric vehicles and household appliances\n\nUsing the tax incentives and rebates in the Inflation Reduction Act, a  low- or moderate-income household could choose from a variety of  incentives that add up to $28,500 to switch to efficient electric home  appliances, install rooftop solar, and buy new electric vehicles.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act makes the transition to an  all-electric home more affordable than ever by offering the following  incentives, which would be available beginning this year if enacted:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Purchasing electric vehicles**: The Inflation  Reduction Act offers up to $7,500 toward the purchase of a new electric  vehicle or up to $4,000 toward the purchase of a used electric vehicle.  Eligibility is capped so that these credits are not available to the  wealthiest families—those earning more than $300,000 per year for new  vehicles or $150,000 per year for used vehicles.\n* **Installing rooftop solar**: The Inflation Reduction  Act provides for 30 percent off the cost of rooftop solar, which amounts  to average savings of $7,000, according to [estimates from the Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/Build-Back-Better-Act-factsheet.pdf). The bill also offers 30 percent off the cost of home batteries for the first time.\n* **Switching to electric appliances**: The Inflation Reduction Act offers homes up to $14,000 in rebates to switch over to [electric appliances](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/decarbonize-households-america-needs-incentives-electric-appliances/)—covering  up to 50 percent of the costs for moderate-income households and 100  percent of the costs for low-income households. The total program is  capped at $4.5 billion. This includes up to:\n   * $8,000 for a heat pump, which serves as an air conditioner in the summer and heater in the winter\n   * $1,750 for a high-efficiency, all-electric heat pump water heater\n   * $840 for an electric induction cooktop\n   * $840 for a high-efficiency all-electric heat pump clothes dryer\n   * Up to $9,100 for enabling improvements to the electric panel, wiring, and home insulation\n* **Improving energy efficiency**: An alternative rebate  option offers to cover more than 50 percent of the cost of whole-home  energy efficiency retrofit or more than 80 percent in the case of homes  occupied by low- or moderate-income households. Households that do not  participate in either rebate program can still claim a variety of home  energy tax credits, which are improved and extended for 10 years by the  bill.\n* **Making major investments in affordable housing and multifamily rental units:**  The Inflation Reduction Act’s investment incentives aren’t just for  individual homeowners; in fact, the bill provides rebates of up to  $400,000 for whole-building energy efficiency retrofits in large  multifamily apartment buildings as well as grants and loans worth $1  billion in total for improving efficiency and installing zero-emission  equipment in affordable housing units.\n\n(source [https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-major-benefits-of-the-inflation-reduction-acts-climate-investments/](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-major-benefits-of-the-inflation-reduction-acts-climate-investments/))\n\nCompanies that stand to benefit are electric car makers PV makers.
