Your point being ?\n\nJust because they have a prototype, and a pretty bad one according to what they presented, it doesn't give any credit to Musk bold claims about the robot capabilities and what the robot will do.\n\nIf Boston Dynamics promises a humanoid robot that would run the Olympics sprint alongside other human opponents, it would be a credible statement because Boston Dynamics absolutely lead the tech on dynamic behavior, situational awareness and plan management.\n\nMusk on the other hand made bold claims about stuff that the humanoid robot will do without even showcasing basic elements of robotic technology that support those claims. Tesla has absolutely no technical lead in anything that makes a humanoid robot, or at least if they have something they utterly failed to show it.\n\nContrary to what Musk says, building robots to perform tasks in a factory line requires very different skills and technology than what is required to build a humanoid robot to assist people at home. The companies that Tesla bought so far are specialized in factory automation.\n\nAlso contrary to what Musk says, just because Tesla has some leading tech for supervised self driving it doesn't make that particularly relevant when developing humanoid robot tech.\n\nSpeaking about unsupervised self driving? Where the hell is the full unsupervised self driving car tech that Musk promised to be ready years ago ? Everything is on schedule for the big robo taxi master plan, next year people will be able to convert their model 3s to self driving taxis with an over the air update, right ?\n\nright ?\n\n> It’s not going to happen overnight, and until tesla actually starts putting resources behind it we will only see progress like we’re talking about now. *Which is still technically progress.*\n\nAnything can \"technically be progress\".

You believe the state can and should monopolize what's considered law (Because I know your argument better than you, I know that you probably believe law is a public good that only the government can provide, therefore the monopoly on legal aggression and final say in disputes in a given territory aka the state ought to exist as it is currently understood)\n2.

Given 1, 2, & 3, you don't believe in consent is the foundation of society, rather you believe tax funded political authority and taxation is the foundation of society\n5. Given 1,2, 3, & 4, you believe people that call themselves the law have the right to compel you to pay the tax bill they send you\n6. Given 5, you believe that if people do not comply with what the government calls the law, then government agents should have the ability to steal your assets and/or force you into court in order to hear charges the government should prosecute you with\n7. Given 6, If you do not comply with the state's orders, then you believe the government should have the right to force you into compliance and in doing so capture and cage you and even murder you if you should defend yourself against their aggression\n8. Given 1-7, once the state has your money, you believe politicians should spend it on whatever political ends you prefer\n9. Given 8, you believe the ends justify the means\n10. Given 9, Regardless of the ends resulting in what you believe they were going to result in, the important thing for you ( and other ideological people like you) is that the state have the power to tax.

Now, what’s reasonable and what will actually happen is a different story. That’s very macro dependent. It’s hard to make a case beyond 2026 without new factory announcements and stuff.

And most my reasoning is based on the fact that if you’re to buy a new car in 2025-2030, you’re gonna want it to be electric. But I’ll break it down super simply for you. \n\nReasoning for potential to sell 15-20M *if things go well* (my exact words) by 2030: EV demand will be huge due to people not wanting to buy an obsolete product in 2030. Legacy started too late (looking at you Toyota/Honda) to scale to adequate numbers by then. So demand will still be greater than supply. So it’s simply a question of “Can Tesla produce 15-20M cars by 2030?” I’m not sure, but I’d say it’s possible if they continue building factories aggressively (which Elon has stated they plan to do)\n\nReasoning for growing 50%/yr in the near future: the math for factory production makes it possible. They will be producing 1.35M cars in 2022 with virtually none coming from Texas and Germany. And each of those factories are bigger than the ones before them. Capacity at those alone take us to 3M. Plus 1-2 new gigafactories will be announced this year to allow growth beyond. As long as demand is there it will happen. Which it will be as I’ve mentioned before due to the future being electric. Sensing a trend here?\n\nSo now that you have that reasoning, combine that with the fact that analysts are not pricing in this happening, and you have a stock that is undervalued and a great investment.\n\nAlso, don’t trouble yourself with your bear reasoning. I can predict it right now. First you’re gonna say “Tesla can’t grow that fast cause nobody else can. Hurr durr look they’re even losing market share (ignoring that smaller piece of bigger pie is > bigger piece of smaller pie)” Then you’re gonna say something something “competition is coming” without any knowledge of the competition’s planned EV production capabilities.

Either you fail to realise what I'm looking for or you're actively not engaging because you have realised that your knowledge is, in fact, not as in-depth as you claimed.\n\nI asked you why you think the company is gonna do that well and all you can say to that is \"Well, EVs are coming and they'll probably have the ability to produce as many\". Really? That's it? That's all you got from following the company for years?\n\nA monkey with google could find out as much in 20 minutes.\n\nYou did not touch on pricing and price segments, even though I gave you that notch before - Tesla is operating in the upper class and luxury space. The annual global car market right now is around 68 million cars sold. By the back half of this decade, that number is likely to be somewhere between 80 and 100 million.\n\nThe average price of a new car (globally) is around 28,000USD. With TSLA in it's current state you're looking at the lowest spec model being almost double that. So how much of that market do you think will actually be adressable for Tesla? I'll say it's not the 100 million. And, yes, competition should be mentioned. Now don't get me wrong, I don't think anyone will pass the numbers Tesla is gonna do in their own price segment. But that doesn't mean we should disregard the likes of BMW and Porsche (who are already starting so see substantial success - they are a smaller player, but they are still a competitor to Tesla when it comes to the luxury segment - my point is, Tesla is not gonna own 100% of the space it plays in) amongst others. (numbers from Statista) And you know, looking at the US, how many cars are there sold annually that cost more than 50k? Around a million. The US has the biggest market in the world when it comes to that kind of buying prowess. And, you know, about 70% of people buying these cars have income north of 75k. (carsurance) That's only about 15% of americans. Market's looking a lot smaller than \"entire global car market\" all of a sudden.\n\nNow if you were expecting Tesla to compete in the middle class or even the lower class, reasonable sales estimates would look very different. However, cars in that price segment usually yield very low margins, so we would see margin compression for Tesla. What's more, an assumption like that and the base for it would be part of any reasoning. Since you didn't mention it it's probably safe to assume that is wasn't one of your assumptions.\n\nYou see where I'm going? Putting your own assumptions above those of the consensus of analysts whose job it is to put hours upon hours upon hours into companies trying to map out exactly how they're gonna do going forward based on nothing more than \"more people like EV\" and \"building capacity good\" is exactly what I mentioned before - ignorance, not knowing what else to look at, and arrogance, thinking that little work is enough to confidently stand above them.\n\nThis is not meant to glorify analysts. Their estimates aren't very precise for the most part, although I find the general direction of consensus estimates to be part of any proper DD - that also means evaluating these estimates, of course.\n\nThe fact that you're trying to spin any questioning and any critique of your... let's call it \"thesis\" speaks a thousand words as well. Apparently you don't stand up to that kind of test.

EVs have less maintenance and lower fuel costs. They also last longer. So it would be totally acceptable to pay a higher upfront cost and have total ownership cost be the same. Bet you never thought of that huh?\n\nYes, ultimately Tesla will need to make a lower priced variant. But it will likely be in the $30-35k range with a total cost of ownership close to something like a civic. And the lower class people? They will do what they’ve always done: buy used.\n\nAlso, the fact that you mention the $28k global average is laughable. People driving in India aren’t the target market.

MoM core CPI at 0.3% is barely above where the Fed would want it to be so assuming it wasn't a fluke we're now on a fairly solid path to a soft landing given lower inflation alongside a fairly robust economy.\n\nThat said, I think there are two many concerns. Firstly, the market continuing to price in a soft landing makes the soft landing less likely. The last thing you want when CPI is at an annual rate of 8.5% is for bond yields to start dropping and asset prices to sky rocket. If businesses and consumers start to feel more confident while the market is loosing financial conditions it's quite possible inflation will spike back up in the coming months.\n\nThe other concern I have is that it's possible the Fed has already overtightened and these last few rate hikes combined with the increased pace of QT and slowing economic growth could be setting us up for a recession starting early next year.\n\nValuation are also getting quite high again, but if the market is right and inflation is about to drop off quickly from here then valuations aren't worryingly high.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that there's at least a reasonable narrative that explains the rally. There's still a lot of uncertainty though and I'm sure we're going to continue to have growth and inflation scares for some time yet so I highly doubt the market will head straight back to ATHs, but the worst could be behind us.

Inflation 8.5%, wage growth something like 5%.\n\nWhere there has been true economic growth, productivity has risen (currently falling), people have increased savings (currently falling), living standards rise due to a fall in the cost of living or a real rise in wages (not happening). There was deflation in the greatest growth period in the US history in the gilded age, yet economists now would claim its somehow impossible.\n\nEdit: Deflation depressing spending is in my opinion one of the most non-sensical statements and I do not understand how it continues to live on. As prices fall, more people can afford those goods, increasing the total spending. People are also able to afford better products, increasing their standard of living. When prices rise as they now have been, less people afford those goods and services unless wages grow even faster, which they haven't, leading to less spending. Look at a graph of real wages over the last decades and tell me, do you really think this inflationary system is increasing or decreasing the standard of living?\n\nAlso take into consideration that official inflation is obviously understated due to how it's calculated, and the reality of real wages and GDP in the last 3 to 4 decades after 1980/1990 adjustments to CPI is much worse. Compounding, but in the opposite direction.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "What i just told you isn’t the “official narrative”. It’s what has historically happened, aka reality. \n\nSavings do NOT improve living standards during periods of inflation. It lowers them through a loss in buying power. During deflation, yes, savings can raise living standards as buying power is gained through an appreciation of the dollar. \n\nDebt, debt based spending, and monetary and fiscal stimulus do NOT always lower living standards in the long run. If used appropriately during periods of opportunity to expand debt, debt based spending, and stimulus INCREASE living standards. The entire point of taking debt for investment and governmental purposes is to increase REAL growth and/or prevent a total default on prior existing debt (today’s circumstances for many governments). \n\nYes, it is obvious that when inflation outpaces nominal growth their is a decrease in REAL growth. \n\nYou attempting to compare today’s globalized markets to the gilded ages is like comparing a 96’ Honda to a 22’ Ford F-150 Lightning. They’re nothing alike. There are much more powerful comparative advantages at play now. The world is more competitive than ever in terms of production capabilities and competitiveness of smaller economies.\n\nDeflation DOES depress spending as deflation usually occurs during times of higher unemployment and lower aggregate demand, or times of exponentially increasing productivity. (Gilded ages was a time of exponentially increasing productivity and that’s what caused intense deflation) As deflation becomes entrenched it become MORE likely large capital firms CUT spending and hold their capital for the hopes of increasing buying power and purchasing larger quantities of goods and services at a later date (aka deflation incentivizing saving and reducing spending).\n\nThe median wage has spiked higher in the past two years than it did anytime over the past two decades (maybe longer). Yes, inflation has outpaced this LARGE increase in nominal wage growth creating a sight decline in REAL wage growth, but that does not justify your false statement and belief that deflation increases OVERALL SPENDING. Deflation disincentivizes spending. Especially at the beginning of a deflationary cycle.\n\nYes, I agree the Consumer Price Index is a faulty measure of inflation. I instead prefer to look at the year-over-year U.S. Export Price Index as a a more realistic measure of inflation. Last month CPI was at 9.1% and EPI was at 18.2%. The real inflation rate is somewhere in between, if not then it is EPI’s measure 18.2%. (New CPI numbers came out today at 8.5% the year ended July 2022. Which is down from last months CPI for year ended June 2022 at 9.1%)\n\nI agree with you on many things, but deflation does decrease spending. Billionaires, millionaires and the financially literate aren’t going to use or give away something that has a potential to increase in value. \n\nSpending increases AFTER prices have already experienced deflation. Not during deflation. \n\nAlso, the reason i told you your comparison didn’t matter was because there was opportunity for markets and Real GDP growth to expand exponentially during the Gilded ages. That growth has already been realized and then some. Today’s markets are already highly leveraged and experienced intense periods of growth. As markets mature growth is expected to be much slower.

Demand doesn't just spring up, there are hard limits to how much crap people need to buy. This reminds of the apoplexy the music industry fell into when CD sales began to level off, expecting indefinite growth. It doesn't work that way... supply does not necessarily scale with demand, and price doesn't necessarily either.\n\nI have to be blunt: Saying you have a business degree basically doesn't mean anything. Most business schools or programs are fucking awful (they kind of have to be I guess to graduate people who think depressions are good and who don't know that hard assets are leveraged as lending anchors in the financial system after 2008).

What matters is how we respond to that and you earned my respect for being constructively reflective and considering the things driving your perspective. It's not always comfortable... believe me, I know, and I appreciate you for having the integrity and character to consider an alternate perspective.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, inflation is a big problem, and we're all feeling the pain in various ways and at various levels. We don't want that continuing at this rate, it's definitely bad and the problem with real wage suppression people have cited is a real problem.\n\nBut whether we agree with the reserve system or not, it's a fact of existence and it has its own rules. I'm personally not much of a believer in the idea that the market has a natural state... it's entirely contrived by humans and every version of it that we live in created by humans and has rules that exist, by design, to subvert nature. The only natural economy is hunting and gathering and even that's a stretch... the very origin of economics from the invention of fire was to beat natural patterns.\n\nYou know who also believed this? Adam Smith, at least based on his broader works. I think Smith's entire idea about the \"invisible hand\" has been historically taken out of context and that's caused some problematic ideological frames about laissez-faire systems to proliferate. We have to remember that Smith was modeling a very specific point in time and even in that Colonial system, Imperial representatives still fundamentally controlled the regulation of those markets... they just did so with other pressures and needs that required more self-direction for market participants, but the English colonial economy was 100% not a completely \"free\" economy.\n\nWhat Smith was was a classical liberal and as such he didn't love the overreach of Monarchy, but in the end the system he modeled definitely had governmental contrivances and planning involved in it, as well as external capital introduction.\n\nSo applying this thought to the Fed and the pandemic, while expanding the M2 so much wasn't ideal, it also was necessary because the alternative was letting the entire financial system unravel as toxic assets choked the reserve system, causing it to mass deleverage. 16% unemployment was really bad, but letting the financial system collapse is how you get a global meltdown and 30% unemployment. The destruction of wealth and stability from that would have been tragic.\n\nIt probably would have toppled the geopolitical stability of the globe, which is not that stable as it stands at the moment, if we just let the market decline.\n\nAnd as a function of inflation, while it's not completely disconnected, if you look at the amount that came out of the reserve system and into the hands of consumers, it's only a handful of percent of the M2 decline. Most of it is still in banks being held as capital anchor under FDIC capitalization rules and probably close to 25% became available to institutions (why the market shot up, in part). Since prop institutions end green generally, there's not much space for that to really put capital pressure into the market, and the data we have points to the majority of the inflation coming from supply chain disruption and pent up demand coinciding.\n\nSo on the scale of mistakes, I think history will - once we get beyond the pain of the moment - largely record the Fed's actions as good. (Unless they make a policy mistake, overtighten, and we end up in that depression anyway... but that mistake will be in them reflexively listening to policy hawks and being too aggressive, not due to the expansion of the M2.)\n\nBut again the point the other poster was making was that here are better ways to handle inflationary imbalance than collapse and wasn't advocating for M2 expansion, a point I very much agree with.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "What are you smoking?

Yes you heard it right the last coz we are ending this season. So this is me his friend the \"Illuminati Guy\" from whom he takes opinions regarding Stock Market. Tbh, Sasuke doesn't understand markets like i do. He is just better in T.A. stuffs. He is also not that confident while speaking as you might have observed in his recent talk over here on Wsb. \\*\\*Cough lot of 3.4%.

We don't do these kind of stuff here. We leave that kind of stuff for Youtube guru's. What we do here is present you the data and what you should be prepared of in the upcoming months. So yes the stock market is about to collapse on the head of Democrats and the worst Fed chairman in history called \"Jerome Powell\". Powell if you're reading no hard feelings but you should resign. Seriously. \n\nGuys the government will soon blame this on wallstreetbets. I am not sure but they could come guns blazing out towards reddit to stop this community temporarily or forever if the stock market crashes pretty bad in upcoming \"Bearish September\". They pressure companies like Meta, Google, Amazon Microsoft and Apple so what's stopping them to go after Reddit. Just so you know guys i love every single one of you. Whether you hate me or resent me wont change my feelings towards each and every one of you. Personally i believe Reddit should go public by 2029 :) It is such a wonderful platform.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo guys enough chit chart lets dive in this what i call the \"Illuminati data\" on stock market crash that will make your mind blown part. Are you ready ? If yes then lets beginnnnnnn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Stock Market Collapse Analysis \n\n**( When Everyone's bullish that's when you have to be extra Careful )**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/597345flavg91.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b0d37b6e835027c2e7f4cb024cb8bb847a9524\n\n\"Dude what is even this ? \" \"I'm not joining your cult\" \"Get back to your meds\" Guys guys guys have a bit of patience. Please. It's not what you think. Allow me to explain this very important concept called \"Shmita\" before we actually dive in the data. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So what exactly is Shmita ?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Don't get confused with your sabbatical year after school. Lol](https://preview.redd.it/wui6d5lcavg91.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=cda75d81d57399063e8618e2404f53862a2b1cf7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring Shmita there are the rise of empires, the fall of empires, the beginning of wars, the ending of wars and the financial collapse. Almost all of the financial collapse occur during Shmita year. So let's look at past 100 yr where all Shmita year have been impacted financially. \n\nHere we will be discussing political, economic and financial collapse all the way back to the signing of declaration of independence and the beginning of revolutionary war. So guys i'm sure the teacher of your school must have taught you history so well. So i will try to keep it concise and just give you few flashbacks from your history class. You can read about them in depth later on and please fact check them.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here's the data** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. 1777 : Declaration of Independence signed. (Beginning of Shmita yr)\n2. 1783 : Revolutionary began after Independence and ended in 1783. (Beginning of Shmita yr)\n3. 1846 : Mexican american war began. (Beginning of Shmita yr)\n4. 1861 : Civil war began. (Beginning of Shmita yr)\n5. 1873 : Black Friday on 9th May at Vienna Stock Exchange. (Beginning of Shmita yr)\n6. 1896 : Panic of 1896 in depth of Economic Depression. (Heart of Shmita yr)\n7. 1903 : Panic of 1903. (End of Shmita yr)\n8. 1917 : World War 1 & Russian Romanov family Empire collapsed. (Last month of Shmita yr) \n9. 1931 : Dow collapsed 88% ushering Great Depression. (End of Shmita yr)\n10. 1938 : Still in Great depression stock market collapsed another 50% after it had risen ushering in a Severe Recession. (End of Shmita yr)\n11. 1945 : WW2 ended. Austria Germany Japan Poland were in ruins. (End of Shmita yr)\n12. 1966 : Stock market collapse of 1966. (End of Shmita yr)\n13. 1973 : Stock market crash of 1973. (End of Shmita yr)\n14. 1979 : Collapse begin and went until 1982. Oil prices peaked and there were gasoline shortages.\n15. 1987 : Stock market crashed 33% on Black Monday. (End of Shmita yr)\n16. 1994 : Bond market collapsed. (End of Shmita yr)\n17. 2001 : Attack on World Trade Center. (End of Shmita yr) Stock market closed and reopened on September 17 and dropped -7% on last day of Shmita yr.\n18. 2008 : Largest stock market loss in history i.e. 777 points. (Occurred on last day Sept 29th. End of Shmita yr)\n19. 2015 : Shanghai stock market crashed 30% in three weeks. (During the heart of Shmita yr)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink for top 10 crash :  \n\n[https://www.finance-monthly.com/2018/12/the-top-10-biggest-market-crashes/](https://www.finance-monthly.com/2018/12/the-top-10-biggest-market-crashes/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Note :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The difference is usually b/w 6 to 7. \n* \"Crashes\" were called \"Panic\" in history.\n* At the beginning of history we collapsed at the beginning of Shmita year but later on it was usually at the end of the \"Shmita\" year and mostly around September. Hence September is the worst month in history.  \n\n\n[Calculate September returns. xD](https://preview.redd.it/h4qwk5nvqvg91.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=1096791888e69d2e8f4e93fbcbc7c61939be4eb1)\n\n\\-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Result :**\n\nIn 2022 exactly seven years after, the stock market of United States or could be United Kingdom ( As these two have high inflation. Hey could be China as well ) will get obliterated before the end of Shmita year. Currently we are approaching the end of Shmita year. \n\nThis Shmita year began in \"September 2021\" and will end on \"September 25th 2022\". So prepare yourself for a collapse and please don't say afterwards you weren't warned before. As for people working in institutions and hedge funds you probably must have had a nice talk about this at lunch didn't you.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Context :**\n\nToday is what 9th august 1947 we are 47 days away from end of Shmita year. Btw guys this is not only a Shmita year ( The seventh year in a cycle ) but this year is also known as \"Super Shmita\" year                 (Everything bubble collapse xD) which is the seventh year of seven \"7 year\" cycle. \n\nSo its the 49th year and of course this occurs every 49 yrs. Hence it has heightened importance on Jewish calendar. You maybe thinking this is all weird. I ain't believing this hocus pocus and thinking \"What has letting land rest and forgiving debts have to do with all of this\". \n\nGuys just see the chronicles of events. The beginning of wars, Ending of wars, Financial stock market, bond market going back couple of hundred years. They seems to correlate and i don't know why. They just do. It's not like i'm BS'ing you. I just read you the data which you could find on your own. Even Peter lynch and Warren buffet talk about all of this. \n\nWatch one of Peter Lynch seminar in 1991 where he talked about the most important thing that everyone should especially GenZ need to know about stock market in last 100 year. Stock Market go up in value and they go down in value. And when they go down they can go down a lot. He further adds in last 100 years stock market had 51 corrections of 10% and more. That means every 2 year there is a correction. And out of these 51 corrections 15 had crashes of 20% or more. That means roughly 7 year out of 100 year you get a severe crash. So guys all i wanna say is you don't have to time it but you gotta position yourself just in case. Coz that's the most important job of every traders and investors.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions :**\n\nSo guys i cannot give you my positions but hey i will send you the Uchiha positions. He might have talked about this in his guest appearance here on Wsb. Lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Emerging market short coz he cannot do puts on USA.](https://preview.redd.it/crdumae4svg91.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73122c3c771285de2c25d5037a6b8b0e0b6c8a6b)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhqk6fe4svg91.jpg?width=1069&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8c345610b2679026927d9e3f296ffcb49f3a6ed\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lpqrfae4svg91.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1583beb0d0c07c17d0251615605da90299dba6e\n\nSo\n\nInvestors : You buy massively at vix 40+ or hedge a lil bit portion of your portfolio.  \nTraders : You buy 2m puts till oct 29 in case to be safe. If you wanna go aggressive go buy it for sept 29. But please dont blow your whole money. Just a small portion of it.  \n\n\nWe have already given you dates in WS-10.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\nJust remember it isn't precise. It doesn't happen exactly in the last month or last week or last day exactly. But it usually happens in \"Shmita\" year and more often than not it does occur in last month toward the end of \"Shmita\" year.\n\nI'm not here to scare you or be negative. I'm just here coz Uchiha has gone somewhere and he basically told me to write something interesting. I'm your guy who inform and prepare you for what has happened historically. ( I just tell him and he tells you )  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Invalidation :**\n\nThis Sept 2021- Sept 2022 if you look back from the future let's say 2029 ( End of Shmita yr. xD ) that this year was indeed Shmita year and maybe the collapse occurred in first 6 months of this yr and maybe the fact that stocks and bonds collapsed during 6m period would make it unusual and stand out as reset or collapse. This is what will be then called as collapse in the \"Heart of Shmita yr\" ( We exceeded more than 20% crash )  \n\n\nOr Perhaps i could be right and  \n\n\nIn the next 47 days we are looking to a period of time where we will have a greater collapse in front of us.\n\n  \n\n\n**Advise For :**\n\nThis advise perhaps is best for financial advisor managing an active portfolio and for people who hire a IA. So if your guy hasn't told you about all of this. Fire him immediately.  \n\n\nPersonally i love history and believe in historical cycles. Hence that June 15 bottom was such a fabulous entry but this Sasuke man. He wasn't convinced enough and flip flopped. Feel Sorry for him duh.  \n\n\nIt breaks my heart that these kind of information will never be covered by Bloomberg, Cnbc or some other popular websites because it has certain religious component to it. But its important to take a note of this since the correlation is just incredible.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-x-x-x-x-x-x-x--x-x-x-xx-x--x-xx--x-xx-x-x--xx--x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all i have to say guys. I know i know you must be thinking Cpi is coming down and the report is so good. Therefore i'm posting this bearish post in a market where everyone suddenly thinks its A-okay and we are going for a new bull market. But i still have to believe we could be shaping up for a collapse by Sept 25. Hey, at least a double bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith lots of love guys. I bid my farewell. I also made a short video for you guys.

Prosecutors presented evidence that included detailed trading records, chat logs and testimony by former co-workers who “pulled back the curtain” on how Nowak and Smith moved precious-metals prices up and down for profit from 2008 to 2016. \n\nA salesman on the desk, Jeffrey Ruffo, was acquitted of charges he participated in the conspiracy.\n\nThe case was the biggest yet by the US Justice Department, which alleged the precious-metals business at JPMorgan was run as a criminal enterprise. Nowak, the managing director in charge of the desk, and Smith, its top trader, were convicted of fraud, spoofing, market manipulation. \n\n“They had the power to move the market, the power to manipulate the worldwide price of gold,” prosecutor Avi Perry said during closing arguments.\n\nRead More: JPMorgan Trader Spoofed So Fast Colleagues Urged Ice on Fingers\n\nUS District Court Judge Edmond Chang said Nowak and Smith will be sentenced next year. Each faces decades in prison, though it may be far less.
