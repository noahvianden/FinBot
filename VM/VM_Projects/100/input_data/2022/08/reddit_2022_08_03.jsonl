It's obvious that 2.5% is gonna go up, and that 9% is gonna go down and both will meet together at some level, at some point. Might be 3.5, 4, or 5%. Also about the neutral claim, I suspect Summers usage of the word and Powell's usage is probably different. \n\nStopping to issue guidance is not a hawkish turn at all, especially after the WSJ guidance leak fiasco.

Third, we consider the depth of the decline in economic activity.
