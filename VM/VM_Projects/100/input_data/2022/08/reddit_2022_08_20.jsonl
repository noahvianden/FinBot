But any number x100m is a lot of easy profit which pushes up the price target.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Assuming a mere 25% of the total fleet size and the $199/mo sub for FSD, that's a monthly revenue of $4.975Bn or annual revenue of $59.7Bn, which is nutty already. 3x-ing that for the theoretical 75M vehicles in the market and you're looking (I'd assume on average that 25M vehicles at any given time won't have FSD due to cost or some other factors or say for margin of error), and you get $179.1Bn/yr from vehicles.\n\n\nBy 2030-2035, we should have CT adding to S3XY revenue, Semi adding to that revenue, megapacks, solar roof, and powerwalls with autobidder managed VPP adding to that revenue, the stated but long term HVAC adding to those revenue, and the supercharger network shared between Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles adding to that revenue.\n\nAll in all, it would then be reasonable to *assume* that Tesla between 2030 and 2035, could be hitting $500Bn in annual revenue. Then when you factor in the bot which you can run 24/7, 365 and whose cost (over time) vs output of value is probably 2-3x initially, 3-5x midterm and 5-10x optimized of FSD revenues (as economies of scale would drive margins through the roof as you'd no longer be labor constrained), then you'd be looking at ~$447.75Bn ~2035 for Bot *alone* for a 2.5x factor of FSD initial, $716.4Bn mid-term factor (4x average) and 7.5x long term (optimized) of $1.12Tn.\n\nMeans that adding everything together, it's theoretically possible that Tesla could hit $1.5Tn in annual revenues. Apple is worth $2.8Tn at ~$365Bn in annual revenues. So applying that to Tesla in 2035 with such numbers (theoretical) means Tesla is $2.8 * 4.11 (1.5T/365B) = $11.5Tn in 2035 valuation +/- $500Bn.\n\nSo, Napkin Mathology then would be a 10x on stock price value aka $8,897/share (post split) assuming no other stock splits take place between now and then. Pre-split price for all the 2010 investors who are still HODLING would be that x15 for a price of $133,455.
