{"title": "BBBY LinkedIn jobs and why its disingenuous to say its bullish", "selftext": "We all saw the \"bullish\" news about BBBY adding 1500 jobs to LinkedIn today.  I looked at their corporate site and found they're actually hiring 1308 total positions between Corporate, Retail and Warehouse, so pretty much in line with what was posted on LinkedIn.  Were all those positions created today though? \n\nBBBY careers doesn't list posting dates, so we'll take our search to Indeed where they have 1,334 positions posted.  Hmm, wait a minute, only 54 were posted today, 8 yesterday, and 10 two days ago.  That's not close to the 1500 today number.\n\nBut okay, 1500 open positions is still a lot of jobs, right?  I wonder how many stores they operate though.  According to Yahoo Finance, there is 771 Bed Bath stores in the US, so they're hiring roughly 2 people per store.  That seems about normal for retail I'd think.  But we all know most retail is hiring and currently understaffed, and they're hiring just 2 positions per store?  That seems a bit low.  But further research is needed.\n\nSearching Google for \"Bed Bath and Beyond Competitors\" some of the most common names are: Wayfair, Kohl's, Lowes, J.C.Penney, Christmas Tree Shops, Target, Williams-Sonoma, Home Depot, Ikea, Walmart, Amazon, Macy's, and Crate and Barrel.\n\nI'm going to throw out Wayfair (online), Lowes and Home Depot (not the same kind of store), Walmart, Target and Amazon (too big).  That leaves us with Kohl's,  J.C. Penney, Christmas Tree Shops, Williams Sonoma, Ikea, Macy's and Crate and Barrel.\n\nLets see how many they're hiring:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Store|Current Employees|Hiring|Change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Williams-Sonoma|27,000|1400|5.2%|\n|Kohls|99,000|4961|5.0%|\n|J.C. Penney|55,000\\*|3600|6.5%|\n|Christmas Tree Shops|unknown|180||\n|Ikea|14,200|281|0.2%|\n|Bed Bath Beyond|55,000|1308|2.4%|\n|Macy's|unknown|6863||\n|Crate and Barrel|7,500|607|8%|\n\n\\*The numbers were all over the place.  Most common were 50k and 60k, I settled on 55k\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, so BBBY is on the lower end of positions available in relation to current employees.  But, not as bad as Ikea.  What about on a per store basis?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Store|Stores|Hiring|Per Store|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Williams-Sonoma|502|1400|2.8|\n|Kohls|1,156|4961|4.3|\n|J.C. Penney|669|3600|5.4|\n|Ikea|51|281|5.5|\n|Christmas Tree Shops|80|180|2.25|\n|Bed Bath Beyond|771|1308|1.7|\n|Macy's|509|6863|13.5|\n|Crate and Barrel|112|607|5.4|\n\nOh, that paints a much better picture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, but they wouldn't be hiring if they were going bankrupt right?  Revlon entered chapter 11 protection two months ago.  They currently have roughly 5,700 employees and have 116 positions available (an increase of 2%), nearly the same ratio as Bed Bath has now.\n\nBBBY isn't hiring because they see growth in their future, they're hiring because they need employees to staff stores if they have any hope of surviving.  They're adding fewer people per store than their competitors and are hiring a lower percent of their total workforce.  Think about how many companies are currently hiring- if you see that sign outside, they're at worst hiring .7 less people than your local Bed Bath.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Bed Bath is hiring 1.7 people per location and is only trying to increase its workforce by 2.4%, smaller numbers than its competitors.\n\nEdit:  I want to add I’m not saying anything about the squeeze play being dead or BBBY not being a good investment.  This post is entirely in response to the posts today saying BBBY posted 1500 jobs today and how that means BBBY isn’t dead.

I don’t know the leadership at BBBY personally. I have not worked there. But I have been in many companies that have hired, realized they made a mistake, and closed the position within a week, a month, or two months. When job negotiating, loyalty is rare. Pick the companies and leadership teams you trust. Stay at those you feel valued. Always understand that a corporation will act in its best interest. You will be removed if they need to remove the position. It is extremely likely for a company to make a new hire and declare bankruptcy.
