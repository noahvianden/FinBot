You bet that if you bought stock about a company you know little about, it would increase in price. It didn't.\n\nInvesting, on the other hand, is usually long term. And even then, it's not guaranteed to be safe. You find a company with good fundamentals and potential and put your money in it. \n\nNow, is Apple that company? It really depends on what YOU want. Apple's the biggest strength (and weakness) is that it's almost a cult. Just like Coke VS Pepsi, people decide that Apple is better and are willing to spend much more than they would otherwise for a comparable product.\n\nAnd there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. All brands based on luxury and upscaling do it. Starbucks, Tesla, Dom Perignon, Armani, Rolex, Bose.. they are all good, some really good, but not as good as the price reflects. There are comparable products for a fraction of the price.\n\nSo that strategy is great. While people have extra money to spend. In times when the economy isn't doing so well, people are concerned about rent, gas and groceries and not about the phone that will make you look wealthy. \n\nSo Apple doesn't have the brightest near future but it still is a very solid company. A  recession is looming and inflation is starting to take a toll. Any company that offers over-inflated products won't do well for a while.\n\nSo if you want to consider it an investment that in the short-term isn't doing well, it's your choice. But you're going to have to hand in there until the market changes. Think years. And embrace the risk. It might never go back to where it was (personally I think it will, in a few years).\n\nOn the other hand,  you can just call it a bad gamble, sell the position and go home, just like you would at a casino.

Resources were not the problem.  \n\nAMDs resurgence story was a longshot but creating a solid architectural design in Zen during a period of time when its major competitor was faltering (again, consistent with the theme that Intel has lost it's ability to execute) was orders of magnitude easier and less ambitious than the task that Intel has at hand.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hmmm I was typing stuff out but I was revealing a little too much. Anyways. I think there are paths for Intel to pursue and it's mainly a problem of leadership imo. Intel could spin off their fabs, even the scheduled ones and currently building ones if they are not profitable. They have acquired partnerships with Nvidia to fab parts. Smallest size also isn't the end all of fabs, not much of their chips are at 5nm or less. Intel is using some TSMC dies now that AMD's exclusive deal expired.\n\nIntel does a lot of research on emerging tech. I actually did a research project through my university with them and interned over a summer. For one they have analog devices that are hardware accelerators for machine learning that have the potential to instantly as fast as signals propagate over the network, present a result for a network, then reprogram itself and do it again. I predict the first parts will be almost 1000x the speed of a GPU and well about 1/100th the power. They were interested in the parts as low power devices. I think they were able to make a network of 100 at 50nm or something like that but the goal was 1mil 10nm by 2030 or something. GPUs are quickly becoming obsolete with client parts having integrated graphics that suit a lot of people and coin mining seems to die off as people look for alternatives.\n\nIntel has started doing hybrid design that is likely to be copied by AMD but is doing them well in some markets. The little big core scheme I mean. They also can sneak in development on making more power efficient cores and transfer those ideas to their main cores. See Intel has access to 3nm tech through TSMC and yet still it does not solve some underlying design mistakes that they let get out of hand, but those things can be hammered out in a few projects, I think back to bulldozer vs zen.\n\nThey plan to increase their dividends and still have the cash to execute on whatever they need which can tide investors over for a while. Cash flow isn't near as big an issue when you don't have to grow, they really just need enough to sustain so they can take quite a hit without it starting to send them under.\n\nBasically they have all the tools, they just don't have the design or the leaders but with a new CEO and some real pressure from AMD, I wouldn't count them out.

{"title": "Is WallStreetBets Biased in its BBBY Stickies? [Data]", "selftext": "#TL;DR: Yes, but not in the way you think.\n\n**Over the past two weeks, WSB tends to sticky more bullish posts than bearish posts. Both in general, and for BBBY.**\n\n---\n\nAs a mod, I'm constantly being accused of being compromised, paid off, etc. etc. \n\nAs of late, the main complaint seems to be that I \"only\" sticky bearish BBBY posts, not bullish ones. \n\nSo let's take a look at everything that's been stickied since August 5th, and see if that's true!\n\n#FAQ:\n\nQ: Why since August 5th? \n\nA: BBBY was below the market cap threshold before August 5th, and could not be discussed on WSB prior to that. \n\nQ: (I don't know, I'll add some more questions from the comments when they come)\n\n---\n\n#Methodology:\n\nI took the list of all my stickied threads from the modlog, removed the duplicates, and then manually categorized them all.\n\nI don't think any of my categorizations are questionable, but for your curiosity, I've included a full list at the bottom (with links!) if you disagree, let me know and I will update this post accordingly.\n\n---\n\n#Results!\n\nOverall, I pinned 70 *unique* (duplicates removed) posts since and including August 5th.\n\n**BBBY Specific - Summarized**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull|7|\n|Neutral|2|\n|Bear|5|\n|Other|56|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n**BBBY Specific - Detail**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull Serious|6|\n|Bull Shitpost|1|\n|Neutral Shitpost|2|\n|Bear Serious|3|\n|Bear Shitpost|2|\n|Daily Thread|32|\n|Unrelated|24|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n\nWhat about those nebulous \"Daily Thread\" and \"Unrelated / Other\" categories?\n\n**Daily Threads**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull BBBY|5|\n|Bear BBBY|1|\n|Daily|22|\n|Earnings|1|\n|Trash|1|\n|Weekend|2|\n|***Total***|***32***|\n\n**Unrelated**\n\n|**Topic**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bear AMC|1|\n|Bear GME|1|\n|Bear TSLA|1|\n|*Bear Total*|*3*|\n|Bull AMC|2|\n|Bull GME|1|\n|Bull OXY|1|\n|Bull SPY|5|\n|Bull SQ|1|\n|Bull TSLA|1|\n|*Bull Total*|*11*|\n|Education|1|\n|Legendary Post|2|\n|Meme|1|\n|Neutral Wind|1|\n|News|1|\n|Shitpost|2|\n|Tattoo|2|\n|***Total***|***24***|\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nThis was fun to put together and only took about an hour. \n\nI was surprised that it was so skewed towards positive posts, but it was interesting that there are more negative BBBY posts being stickied **as a proportion of all BBBY posts stickied** than other tickers. \n\nI'm curious to see if this changes any opinions, or if people will hold to the fact that WSB is biased in some way.\n\nThere are limitations to this analysis. The biggest that I can think of is how long each post spent stickied. \n\nThis is complicated by the fact that I would have to manually go and hover over every one of the 92 stickied posts (duplicates included!) to see which ones were stickied for how long. (Or maybe I could pull it from the page source?)\n\nAnother limitation is timing. I think it's fair to say that those stickied during market hours are more impactful than others. Fortunately for bulls, BBBY megathreads were the only thing stickied during market hours, and BBBY megathreads are (obviously) overwhelmingly bullish.\n\n---\n\n||Category|BBBY Daily?|Topic|Is Dupe|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|[\"Buying more BBBY puts Monday lfg\" by thisismyname2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wuab08/buying_more_bbby_puts_monday_lfg/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"I don‚Äôt want bbby to go bankrupt so I just pulled ...\" by MrSingh_Entrepreneur](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wub13h/i_dont_want_bbby_to_go_bankrupt_so_i_just_pulled/)|Bear Shitpost| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, August 22, 2022\" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wu8ppj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_august_22_2022/)|Daily Thread|Daily||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Ryan Cohen was an insider when selling his shares....\" by DatSlattSlimeBooBong](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtju81/ryan_cohen_was_an_insider_when_selling_his_shares/)|Bull Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Why the BABY acquisition premise is circumstantial...\" by obiwanjustblowme](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtnust/why_the_baby_acquisition_premise_is/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|[\"Aswath Damodaran - Session 1: Intro to Valuation\" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wte3eu/aswath_damodaran_session_1_intro_to_valuation/)|Unrelated| |Education|Not Dupe|\n|[\"Lambo Wen?\" by doublejeopardyalex](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wt7agl/lambo_wen/)|Unrelated| |Bear TSLA|Not Dupe|\n|[\"675% gains on 2 BBBY options.
