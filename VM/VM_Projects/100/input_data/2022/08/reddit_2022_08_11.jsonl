I just want to rub it in all your stupid faces that once again, America proved you wrong, ate your lunch and shit in your bed.   \n\n\nSo many anti-American fools kept spouting all this absurd FUD about the dollar collapsing, that America was finished, and China was sure to supplant the Untied States as the greatest force on the planet. \n\nIn the middle of this inflation debacle, so many people kept howling that America's time was up, China was going to run shit, the dollar would be dumped as a reserve currency. I'm also going to guess none of those people bothered to listen to the conference calls of American CEO's, some of the smartest and greediest fuckers on the planet. \n\nIn the middle of the worst pandemic since the early 1900's, the American system once again proved that it was the most formidable socioeconomic system on the planet. China destroyed its status as the world's go-to factory floor by refusing American vaccines and shutting down. China also ruined all hopes of being a reserve currency that the world can trust by declaring a war on capitalism that began with the arrest and torture of Jack Ma. Russia humiliated itself on the world stage by invading a smaller, weaker country and getting it's ass handed to it.   \n\n\nAnd where is America in all of this? Coming off GDP growing at a breakneck pace with just a couple quarters of slightly negative growth in exchange for huge decreases in inflation. Stack on top of that huge gains in productivity, wages, and job growth. Oh, and the United States revived commitments the world over to the American-led global system in the wake of Russia's Ukraine invasion. \n\nThe United States is about to enter a major bull market as supply chains adjust and supply catches up with demand. American corporations reporting robust earnings in one of the toughest environments was a marvel to behold. Despite all odds, corporations generally met or beat expections. If you think the bull is running fast now, just wait until those corporations report a quarter where wages have risen and prices have fallen.", "id": "wlfavc", "created_utc": 1660183128.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "‚ÄúDespite all odds, corporations generally met or beat expectations.‚Äù \n\nYou seem to be missing the part where EVERY company massively _lowered_ their expectations for this quarter.

The CPI has remained unchanged, since there CPI is based on what is being purchased, and is adjusted accordingly. Since the ribeye is too expensive to be purchased, it is thrown out of the CPI and replaced with a Big Mac. Magically, the CPI is unchanged during this period of hyperinflation. \nThe CPI by design is intended to reflect the change in price of what consumers are purchasing, and the people that are living paycheck to paycheck cannot increase their spending since they are already spending 100%, therefore they need to change what they are buying in order to stay in budget.

In the 90s the boskin commission made a few recommendations to make the cpi more accurate, one of those changes was to address substitution bias. They started accounting for ‚Äúlow level substitution‚Äù which is basically a switch between different brands of roughly\nthe same product. So organic brand name ribeye to store brand ribeye would be accounted for, but ribeye to Big Mac would not, as these are upper level substitutions. So if the brand name was 10 and the store brand was 9, then they both tripled, and the person switched to store brand, there‚Äôd be a very minor downward bias in that it would show prices increased to 27 instead of 30. But even that‚Äôs not true as some people still buy brand name and others always bought store brand. The actual difference would be even less.\n\nA few other things: \n\n1. Even if this upper level substitution was captured (it is in the chained CPI), then you‚Äôd still be over simplifying bc some people would have always been buying Big Macs and some people would still be buying ribeyes, so the inflation would still show, just less than if it didn‚Äôt. But arguments can be made about which is actually correct.\n\n2. The low level substitution capture impacts CPI inflation by about .25%, not a huge number.\n\n3. The CPI is a cost of living index and does make attempts to capture quality changes. This was another outcome of the boskin commission.

Future growth in the S&P will likely come from companies that don‚Äôt even exist now and with more problems and increasingly complex technology that increases the likelihood of that happening.\n\nIt‚Äôs hard for the largest industries of recently feudal Renaissance era society to grow at the rate of those in the scientific age when a whole new set of industry came out. The growth of that era looked like nothing compared to the growth from the industrial era. The industrial era looks slow compared to the post- war ‚Äúspace age,‚Äù then the computer/ internet era blew all of that out of the water... so, it may be hard to envision what we have now generating that sort of growth, but what about all of the things that will be developed that we can‚Äôt yet even imagine?\n\nWe could see space- based companies, virtual reality firms, genetic biotech companies that can seemingly instantaneously heal wounds and kill cancer for good.

The financial system can facilitate growth in the economy, support companies, fund new ideas, etc, but it can‚Äôt create those new things, so, the answer to whether growth will continue comes from factors outside of the world of finance.

New technology, share buybacks, more offices, more products, etc.\n\nIf a company has no growth at all and keeps making the same amount of money then you can expect the stock return to be roughly equal to the earnings yield long term(1 / the p/e ratio). P/e of 20 = 5% earnings yield. P/e of 10 = 10% earnings yield.\n\nHigher interest rates = lower p/e ratios = higher earnings yield\nLower interest rates = higher p/e ratios = lower earnings yield.\n\nJust like with any investment there is a \"risk premium\", the additional return you expect to make due to the extra risk you are taking. If long term interest rates are 5% then you expect stocks to make a little more than that because you could just have a guaranteed 5% by buying us treasury bonds instead. and in order for the expected return on stocks to be more than before, the p/e ratio has to come down(which makes the earnings yield go up) or the eps growth rate has to go up.\n\n2: inflation - despite what most people seem to believe, inflation is actually one of the main drivers of long term stock market growth, not a reason for it to go down(as long as you have wage growth with inflation and historically wage growth has slightly outpaced inflation).\n\nImagine if suddenly all wages, prices on goods/services, and bank account balances suddenly doubled. Theoretically what people buy and how much they buy should not change because everyone can afford exactly what they could before. But this means stock prices would also have to double to be at the same valuations as before because revenue/profit would also double\n\nSteady and consistent inflation and wage growth = amazing for the stock market. Recently wage growth hasn't kept up because the inflation numbers are so erratic and a salary increase is sort of permanent so companies don't want to raise wages too much unless they are fairly confident inflation won't come crashing back down. \n\n3: population growth - more people alive = more people working and buying things = more revenue/profit for companies = higher stock prices. Birth rates have been declining over the years so this is something I'm slightly worried about. As it gets worse countries will start incentivizing people to immigrate and have more kids.\n\nSo the answer to your question is yes.

The world & US averaged around 1.5% growth in population per year in the 20th century. This likely slows to 0.5% per year in the decades to come. Less population growth should result in slower economic output growth.\n\n2. Look at total US market cap to GDP. It ranges between 40% and peaked at 200% last year with the average being about 90% historically. I think this can be explained for a number of reasons. US corporations have gained a competitive edge in the short term internationally and so earnings growth has been concentrated in American corporations. Another is a larger % of US business are now publicly traded. Either way, these 2 trends cannot be permanent as at some point you reach a peak saturation in both global markets and % of businesses being publicly traded. \n\nI hope we can all agree that GDP growth is fundamental to corporate revenue & earnings growth. The latter is largely dependent on the former. Over the long term US real GDP growth has averaged around 2%, and this was with much faster population growth. I suspect slower population growth will result in real GDP growth at the same proportion, so that would be real GDP growth of 1% per annum. Inflation's long term average has been 3.5% per annum. So, over the long term I will not be surprised to see earnings growth and thus market returns of around 4.5% per year excluding dividends. \n\nHowever, if the 10% per year continues, the only way I see that happening over a long term basis if wealth continues to accumulate into smaller and smaller hands effectively making one of Marx main arguments correct.

Companies using this method can say anything they want during the pre-merger period, and as a consequence they frequently miss their projections by a large margin as Lucid has done in recent weeks\n\n\\- During its most recent earnings call, Rivian kept its future vehicle production guidance the same for the remainder of this year. During its most recent earnings call, Lucid reduced its vehicle production guidance for the remainder of this year by 50%!\n\n\\- Rivian has Amazon as its customer;\n\n\\- Rivian has a 2.5x greater vehicle backlog in units versus Lucid, with an initial deposit requirement 6x as as high relative the vehicle invoice price.  Lucid's deposit for a $160,000 reservation is only $300!   Not much commitment required on the customer's part to reserve a car.

After enough attempts the agent will learn that the optimal way to maximise the reward function is to follow the line.\n\nIf Tesla has created a way to use reinforcement learning such that the bot can visually observe an action, for example a human using a power drill, and then successfully mimic that action, then that is a significant step towards AGI and we're all going to be extremely wealthy.\n\nI think it's more likely Tesla has created a framework for creating human-motion datasets that can then be used to train the bot to perform those tasks.\n\nIt's possible they've combined both supervised and reinforcement learning, possibly doing something like using computer vision as the input to the reinforcement learner, probably creating the action space or using it to create the reward function.\n\nEven if Tesla is using supervised learning for the bot, all it means is that the bot's progress will be incremental and iterative, much like FSD, but I don't see any major barriers as to why the bot can't achieve human-level abilities using supervised learning only.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "That would be amazing, but possibly asking too much for the first reveal.\n\nMore likely it is trained in Sim from bottom up.

But for some, including Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, the coast isn‚Äôt clear until the benchmark index closes above 4,231.66 ‚Äî a 50% retracement level for the current bear market. It closed Tuesday at 4,210.24, so the S&P only needs to gain less than 1% to get there. Using  Fibonacci analysis, Stovall thinks reaching the midpoint would be a signal that the market is poised to make a full recovery:  \n>  \n>S&P 500 must close above a 50% Fibonacci retracement level  \n>  \n>‚ÄúClosing above this level would imply that the bear market low has already been set,‚Äù Stovall said, ‚Äúsince none of the earlier 13 bear markets since 1946 enjoyed a 50% retracement of its decline only to endure a subsequent selloff that exceeded the prior low. It doesn‚Äôt mean that the prior low won‚Äôt be challenged, but it does indicate that the June 16 low will likely hold.‚Äù  \n>  \n>The table below, compiled by CFRA and published Monday, lists the 19 times since World War II that the S&P 500 entered into a bear market ‚Äî a drop of 20% from its high ‚Äî or a correction of 15% to 19.9%:  \n>  \n>Recent history shows that the 50% retracement test worked for all but one. Only the bear market of 1973-1974 recorded a lower low following the 50% retracement of its 15%+ decline. And even that was due to an exceptional geopolitical shock. The Yom Kippur War, in which Arab nations invaded Israel in a conflict that led to an oil embargo, broke out just after the S&P had achieved its 50% retracement. After that, it suffered a disastrous 44% fall.  \n>  \n>For some technical analysts, though, the level to watch is 4,177. This is where the S&P 500 marked the peak during its May to June rebound.

{"title": "#BBBY Gang, who of you continue to hold the line?", "selftext": "This week was crazy, we had many ups and downs, but the thesis stays intact. BBBY has many problems - cash burn, mismanagement of inventories, inneficient marketing strategy, underdeveloped online selling channels etc. However, it is no wonder that Ryan Cohen acquired a large stake at prices way higher than today's. The company definitely has untapped potential and could prove to be a succes story in the long-term. They have physical assets that are valued at billions of dollars,  nationwide brand recognition and most importantly they have a separate brand(business) that  they own  that by itself could be worth more than the whole company.  \"Buy Baby\" by itself generated more than 1 billion in sales, with 50 percent of sales generated online. The high short interest and the meme investing craze started by GME  is just the cherry on top. \n\nHaving said that, I am well aware of the fact that gains might not come very soon and I am prepared to handle the volatility. A near term potential catalyst is the expected update at the end of August from the management about the company's current condition and the steps that have been taken for its restructuring. Nevertheless, as a European guy I am seeing a lot of retail investors from Europe having an interest in BBBY and I can assure you that a lot of us are ready to diamond hand our shares alongside our bros across the ocean.\n\nPS: Investing in a business like BBBY that is struggling to say the least is extremely risky and is not recommended for people who have moderate to low risk tolerance.
