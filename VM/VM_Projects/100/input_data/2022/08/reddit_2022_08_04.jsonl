That's all Tesla needs to beat or attact from. \n\nAs it stands right now, Tesla's engineering staff has better retention than pretty much all of FAANG and was the most applied to company for fresh grads.\n\nAlso, this year is a completely different shitshow for all those pre-revenue pre-IPO startups that threw money at code monkeys for the last few years.

Where does 3% come from? Also big tech is still hiring, and Google did get away with a lot of Tesla SDEs. Tesla is in a much deeper hiring freeze than any of the big tech.\n\nTesla's laid off rarely went to competitors anyway. I was saying that their reputation has gone down in tech, so they'll have a harder time getting and retaining top tech talent. Their competitors don't really care about tech, because they're more focused on building good cars. Not paying high salary to SDE just to keep promising \"FSD next year!\" every single year isn't necessarily a bad thing. \n\n3 years? 5 years? 🤣🤣🤣 Even if so, have fun justifying 111 PE ratio. Here's an actual number: Tesla accounts for 60% of EV sales. And they're only selling EVs. They're the first mover into the space by 5 or so years, and they can barely retain dominance. HBR has an article about how first mover advantage doesn't persist for a lot of industry, and EV literally checkes all the boxes.\n\nThey're a good company, but simply overpriced. Everything is all fun and game when you're dominating an industry, until you don't. Microsoft  used to dominate PC; now they don't. Yahoo used to dominate everything; now they don't. Every company needs a plan for post-glorious days, and Tesla simply doesn't have it. And it won't be all uphill from here. All that makes it very hard to justify valuing it at $1T.\n\nAlso yes keep coping. Having 4 ev doesn't mean you're good at investing.
