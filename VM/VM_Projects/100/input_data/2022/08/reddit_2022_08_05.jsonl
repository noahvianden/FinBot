{"title": "Tesla Shareholders Approved a 3:1 Stock Split", "selftext": " Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla rallied in after-hours trading Thursday as the company won shareholder approval for a 3:1 stock split, the second such move in around two years, as the world‚Äôs most valuable automaker looks to make its stock more affordable.\n\nIn a widely expected move, Tesla shareholders approved the company‚Äôs proposed 3:1 stock split, causing shares of the company to continue rallying in after-hours trading following a 0.4% gain earlier in the session.\n\nTesla first announced the proposed 3:1 stock split in June as a way to make the $925 stock more affordable; based on today‚Äôs closing price the new share price would be around $308.\n\nThough the stock is down roughly 20% this year amid the wider market selloff, billionaire Elon Musk‚Äôs electric vehicle maker has still seen its shares surge more than 200% since the last stock split in August 2020.Stock splits don‚Äôt impact a company‚Äôs market value, but evidence suggests that by making shares more affordable to retail investors, the move does often provide a short-term boost to share price.\n\nTesla shares are up over 30% since announcing the 3:1 split in early June, while news of Tesla‚Äôs 5:1 stock split roughly two years sent shares over 70% higher in the 20 days following the announcement.\n\nSeveral other major tech companies have announced stock splits this year and saw subsequent spikes in their share price; Google-parent Alphabet‚Äôs split 20:1 in February and Amazon‚Äôs stock split 20:1 split one month later.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2)\n\nTesla TSLA shareholders approved a 3-for1 stock split. This means that for every TSLA share you own, you will receive 2 additional shares.

Summer is apparently relatively weak for diesel. (bullish diesel)\n20. Markets are very backwardated, which is a bullish signal, but it's not as bad as it was. Backwardated futures for oil mean the price to get oil right now (spot price) is much higher than in the future, i.e., curve slopes down. This shows tight supply, \"I need oil and I need it now!\" The opposite scenario is contango, when the curve slopes up, so the spot price is lower than it is in the future.\n\nOverall I'm bullish, but I'm cautious in where I'm putting my money.

Show me the numbers. You're just spewing gibberish.\n\nOther car companies have several models. Tesla was outsold by VW and Stellantis in Europe. \n\nAlso Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Swizerland and the UK publish their registered vehicles either daily or monthly. In July from 78581 sold BEVs, Tesla only sold 1776 - a 2.3% of BEV vehicles, not total European cars sold. \n\n[https://insideevs.com/news/602158/stellantis-overtakes-tesla-europe-ev-sales-targets-top-spot/](https://insideevs.com/news/602158/stellantis-overtakes-tesla-europe-ev-sales-targets-top-spot/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Your last point proves the valuation...

Given that they are losing market share already it is unlikely they will succeed. Additionally scaling factories is hard. From 1m-2m you might only need two new factories, but to double that you also need double the factories - it is not like software. \n\nWe are seeing the struggles of Berlin and Austin to scale up. \n\nSupercharging network is a non factor in Europe as chargers are standardised and similar to gasoline stations margins are very low. \n\nIn other sectors Tesla has shown 0 indication that they are the leader.\n\nTesla is very overvalued even if you assume the best of cases.

{"title": "AMC - Terrible Quarter", "selftext": "I just finished reviewing the AMC quarter. I am surprised that they still couldn't turn a profit from either a EBITDA or CF perspective, given the return to theatres and pandemic normalization.\n\nRevenue growth surprised me, but cost containment was disappointing, especially film gross margin (admissions - film costs) of only 50% (58%, 58%, 53% and 57% in prior 4 quarters), which is the lowest it has been in a while. I guess this is what peak volume margins look like since Hollywood extracts tougher deals in post-pandemic times than during the pandemic.\n\nThe biggest problem is the balance sheet. FCF was -117m. This means the business itself lost $117m in this supposed recovery quarter. I see the revenue recovery, but not the earnings. For the first half of 2022, the company has lost $450m running this business. They need to turn it around, quickly. I'm not sure how they do that given the pandemic recovery should have helped them. The net cash position is the worst it has been in 4 quarters: -4.390B (prior 4: -3.661B, -3.813B, -3.808B, -4.333B).\n\nI have always hoped the \"Apes\" make a lot of money as I have no axe to grind. As an impartial referee, this isn't going to cut it. Profits are necessary. All the shenanigans with stock dividends, mining investments, etc. are all a distraction. The core theatre business has to make money. This was supposed to be the quarter. Didn't happen. When will it?\n\nDisclosure: Short a small amount of AMC in my trading competition with Matt Kohrs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I should note they did have positive EBITDA, but it was quite low. At $80m (1H22 only $13m), a run rate of $320m and a multiple of 20x EBITDA (very generous), the business would be worth 6.4B, which when paying off the debt would result in only 2.0B of equity value, or $4 per share.
