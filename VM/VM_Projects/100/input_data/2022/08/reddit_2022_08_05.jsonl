{"title": "Tesla Shareholders Approved a 3:1 Stock Split", "selftext": " Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla rallied in after-hours trading Thursday as the company won shareholder approval for a 3:1 stock split, the second such move in around two years, as the world’s most valuable automaker looks to make its stock more affordable.\n\nIn a widely expected move, Tesla shareholders approved the company’s proposed 3:1 stock split, causing shares of the company to continue rallying in after-hours trading following a 0.4% gain earlier in the session.\n\nTesla first announced the proposed 3:1 stock split in June as a way to make the $925 stock more affordable; based on today’s closing price the new share price would be around $308.\n\nThough the stock is down roughly 20% this year amid the wider market selloff, billionaire Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker has still seen its shares surge more than 200% since the last stock split in August 2020.Stock splits don’t impact a company’s market value, but evidence suggests that by making shares more affordable to retail investors, the move does often provide a short-term boost to share price.\n\nTesla shares are up over 30% since announcing the 3:1 split in early June, while news of Tesla’s 5:1 stock split roughly two years sent shares over 70% higher in the 20 days following the announcement.\n\nSeveral other major tech companies have announced stock splits this year and saw subsequent spikes in their share price; Google-parent Alphabet’s split 20:1 in February and Amazon’s stock split 20:1 split one month later.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/04/teslas-31-stock-split-wins-shareholder-approval-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/?sh=f9b740eefdc2)\n\nTesla TSLA shareholders approved a 3-for1 stock split. This means that for every TSLA share you own, you will receive 2 additional shares. Elon Musk added that buybacks are on the table depending on future cash flow.\n\nDo you think $TSLA will rally leading up to the stock split?", "id": "wgxjoc", "created_utc": 1659711305.0, "score": 516, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "Lol he's just going to keep splitting", "score": 184, "replies": [{"body": "Yup it’ll split again by 2025", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Spring 2023 bet?", "score": 14, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "What everybody in a splitting mood", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "2023 depression", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Push every share price to 5¢.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "what would that really do ? honest question", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "/s (many, many splits + recession = 5¢ share price)", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Delist Tesla?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Everything will be penny stocks after the dip", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Split via dividend.\n\nLike stick a wrench in the short bicycle.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "To get in on the meme bullshit.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Yea, with the correction it is still up 25% this month.

That’s not how recessions are defined; more important, it’s not how they should be defined.**\n\n>Since 1978 the N.B.E.R. has had a standing group of experts called the Business Cycle Dating Committee, which decides — with a lag — when a recession began and ended based on multiple criteria, including employment, industrial production and so on. And the U.S. government accepts those rulings. So the official definition of a recession is that it is a period that the committee has declared a recession; it’s an expert judgment call, not a formula.\n\n>So where did the two-quarter thing come from? Part of the answer is that the N.B.E.R. doesn’t make recession calls in real time. For example, while the Great Recession is now considered to have begun in December 2007, the dating committee didn’t make that call until December 2008. Also, other nations don’t have any equivalent of the N.B.E.R. So there has always been an incentive to look for simple formulas, not dependent on judgment, that can quickly determine a recession.\n\n>Two quarters of economic contraction — a downturn sustained enough that it probably isn’t a statistical blip — seems, on the surface, like a reasonable criterion. But it’s not hard to see how it could be deeply misleading, even if the data are correct.

Concerns of this nature presumably lay behind the “measured tightening” carried out by the US Federal Reserve beginning in June 2004. On the other hand, the Japanese reliance on “quantitative easing”, in addition to very low interest rates, highlights a further complication as monetary authorities begin to tighten. Economic agents more generally will be aware of the extent to which banks have reserves well in excess of normal requirements, and could become increasingly concerned about their inflationary potential. This implies a delicate balancing act for the monetary authorities, in which tightening must be slow enough to avoid destabilising financial markets, but fast enough not to destabilise inflationary expectations. \"*\n\n[https://www.bis.org/publ/work205.pdf](https://www.bis.org/publ/work205.pdf)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Which is why clearly the Fed is barking at the market and bluffing.\n\nThey can't actually fully tighten as much as they need to and they know it.

BD simply can't compete here.\n2. Tesla is now one of the worlds most capable manufacturers. They have the talent, tools and financial resources to do things BD could never even dream of. Keep in mind BD is only like 800 people total and is worth a few hundred million. BD is largely doing \"catalog engineering\" as elon likes to say. They don't have the capacity to design and manufacture the optimal parts so they buy whats available on the market. Tesla can greatly optimize the robot design if for no other reason than they don't need to rely on off the shelf parts. \n\nSo yes, what BD has done is impressive, but what Tesla will do could very easily surpass BD and possibly by a huge margin.

{"title": "AMC - Terrible Quarter", "selftext": "I just finished reviewing the AMC quarter. I am surprised that they still couldn't turn a profit from either a EBITDA or CF perspective, given the return to theatres and pandemic normalization.\n\nRevenue growth surprised me, but cost containment was disappointing, especially film gross margin (admissions - film costs) of only 50% (58%, 58%, 53% and 57% in prior 4 quarters), which is the lowest it has been in a while. I guess this is what peak volume margins look like since Hollywood extracts tougher deals in post-pandemic times than during the pandemic.\n\nThe biggest problem is the balance sheet. FCF was -117m. This means the business itself lost $117m in this supposed recovery quarter. I see the revenue recovery, but not the earnings. For the first half of 2022, the company has lost $450m running this business. They need to turn it around, quickly. I'm not sure how they do that given the pandemic recovery should have helped them. The net cash position is the worst it has been in 4 quarters: -4.390B (prior 4: -3.661B, -3.813B, -3.808B, -4.333B).\n\nI have always hoped the \"Apes\" make a lot of money as I have no axe to grind. As an impartial referee, this isn't going to cut it. Profits are necessary. All the shenanigans with stock dividends, mining investments, etc. are all a distraction. The core theatre business has to make money. This was supposed to be the quarter. Didn't happen. When will it?\n\nDisclosure: Short a small amount of AMC in my trading competition with Matt Kohrs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I should note they did have positive EBITDA, but it was quite low.
