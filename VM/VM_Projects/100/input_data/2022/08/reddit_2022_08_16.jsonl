Instead of waiting until the stock is $3000/share, they'll schedule the split when it's $1000/share for example.\n\nThis leads lots of people to see splits as causing the rising stock price, but really, (at least in the case of a well managed company) it's the case of the company signaling that they have lots of positive insider info and they're expecting the stock to rise a lot soon.\n\nBut of course, if that happens enough times, some poorly run companies will use that psychology and try to signal that they've got \"good things coming up soon\" by doing a split.
