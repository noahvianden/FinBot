The  gauge recouped more than [50%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/out-of-the-woods-the-s-p-500-recovers-50-of-year-s-drawdown)  of the losses it notched between its January peak and June nadir, and  approached its 200-day average -- a line crossed by the Russell 2000 of  small caps. The Nasdaq 100 pushed further beyond its technical  bull-market threshold, following a surge of over 20% from June lows.\n\nAs  equities climbed, Wall Street’s fear gauge crumbled. The Cboe  Volatility Index slumped back below 20, the average level since its  inception. The VIX notched its eighth straight week of declines, the  longest losing stretch since 2019. Meantime, the S&P 500’s 14-day  relative strength index (RSI) topped 70 -- which is seen by some traders  as one indication of an overbought market.\n\nThe next few weeks will be crucial in determining the  sustainability of the rally. With the earnings season almost over,  economic reports mixed at best and many Fed speakers unwillling to sound  too dovish, some analysts see the chances of a breather. To Matt Maley  at Miller Tabak, stocks are indeed getting overbought on a  very-short-term basis, so a decline or sideways move “would not be the  worst development in the world.”\n\nFor now, flows have been robust. [Global equity funds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/bofa-says-cash-racing-to-stocks-bonds-as-inflation-fears-ease)  lured $7.1 billion in the week through Aug. 10, Bank of America Corp.  strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote, citing EPFR Global data. Bond  funds had an intake of $11.7 billion, while $4.3 billion was pulled out  of cash.\n\n“The music hasn’t stopped,” said Matt Bartolini, State Street  Global Advisors’ head of SPDR Americas Research. “The labor market  continues to be positive, earnings growth continues to be positive. So  largely, if there is a recession, it’s going to be relatively shallow.”\n\nLindsey  Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally, said the market’s  about to enter what is often considered a “sketchy period.” \n\n“Historically,  September and October are notoriously volatile, sometimes featuring big  stock market drops,” she wrote. “After a more than 10% rally since  mid-June, a bearish seasonal trend is good reason to temper  expectations. I expect this market to continue to be reactionary and  driven by headlines until we have more clarity on where exactly  inflation is headed as we approach 2023.”\n\nData Friday showed [US consumer sentiment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/us-consumer-sentiment-rises-to-three-month-high-on-outlook)  climbed to a three-month high on firmer expectations about the economy  and personal finances. Inflation expectations were mixed, with consumers  boosting their longer-term views for prices slightly, while reducing  their year-ahead outlook for costs.\n\nFed  Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin was the latest official to  call for continued rate increases, while acknowledging that this week’s  inflation figures were encouraging. His San Francisco counterpart Mary  Daly told [Bloomberg Television](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/fed-s-daly-says-cooling-inflation-is-welcome-but-no-victory-yet)  that the slowdown in price pressures may mean it’s appropriate for the  central bank to slow the pace of hikes to 50 basis points in September--  but noted the fight against inflation is far from over.\n\n“The Fed  is unlikely to claim victory until inflation reaches target, but recent  data support our view that peak Fed hawkishness is behind us,” Bank of  America strategists wrote in a note to clients.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-11/stocks-set-for-steady-asia-open-treasuries-drop-markets-wrap](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-11/stocks-set-for-steady-asia-open-treasuries-drop-markets-wrap)", "id": "wn0il3", "created_utc": 1660350484.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "No!\n\nI DECLARE …RECESSION!\n\n[GIF](https://c.tenor.com/PW5xIUYKjB0AAAAM/declare-bankrupt.gif)", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "Rocket to the moon!\n\nThe data supports it\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm)\n\n>***Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 528,000 in July, and the unemployment rate edged down to 3.5 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today.

Second, you have to adjust the currency in order to properly compare the results. \n\nIf inflation is 9%, and your revenue grows by 2%, you efffectively shrank by 5.14%, as that dollar is now worth less. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>you also have to claim \"real stock prices are a lot lower than they were at the same price levels last year\n\nWhich they are.

However that changes with inflation:\n\n5% inflation: 19.05% effective yield\n\n10% inflation: 18.18% effective yield\n\n20% inflation: 16.67% effective yield. \n\n100% inflation : 10% effective yield. \n\nSo inflation hugely influences the real returns you are getting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That is, unless theres a valid alternative of getting better real yields, the relative yield is all that matters\n\nBut there are loads of companies that have better real yields than Apple. Real yields are all that matters at the end of the day. You can't increase your wealth with relative yields. If your portfolio is up 0%, but down 50% in currency (like it would have been if you invested in the S&P 500 in the 70s), your real wealth is down 50%. Does not matter if you outperformed another guy that is down 10% (so around 60% in real yields). The only thing that would have mattered, is preserving that wealth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And in this example, the earnings yield went up from 10 to 20% regardless of the prevailing inflation.\n\nYes ofc, but Apple did not increase their earnings power by such a huge amount. So it does matter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is a great view on inflation from Warren Buffett. \n\nhttp://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Inflation-Swindles-the-Equity-Investor.pdf", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> If inflation is 9%, and your revenue grows by 2%, you efffectively shrank by 5.14%, as that dollar is now worth less. \n\nNope, you are still growing in nominal terms and are therefore far outperforming the cash alternative. The term \"real yield\" literally has no meaning here because you use the same inflation discount to discount every single alternative from cash to bonds to equities. If you deduct inflation from all of them, relative yields are all that matters. Also your real yield is -6.4% in this case, not sure where you're getting 5.14 from.\n\nAdditionally, with supply side inflation it is a weird claim that \"any dollar is now worth less\" because that only holds up if that dollar is destined for purchasing the average basket of consumer goods. If such a dollar was to be reinvested into bonds or equities that dollar is worth more now, as rates are going up and equity valuations have dropped. And most of these returns that are returned to investors are used for this exact purpose.\n\n> Which they are. However as we see earnings deteriorate and growth slowing., it does not mean that the stock market is cheaper now, then it was a year ago. \n\nI did not claim it is.

Also your calculations of the real yield are wrong:\n\n5% inflation: 14.3% real yield \n\n10% inflation: 9.1% real yield\n\n20% inflation: 0% real yield (duh)\n\n100% inflation: -40% real yield\n\nHow you are getting a positive real yield at this 100% inflation scenario is wild to me.\n\n> But there are loads of companies that have better real yields than Apple.

That the chance is low is irrelevant.  Its not a probabilistic theory of low chance of failure that is generating the risk management issue.  Its the unhedged, overexposure to that risk on margin that is what everyone is warning you about.  In the unlikely event this falls on terrible overnight news you possibly bust out your parents.\n\nNo risk manager alive would recommend making a bust out bet on a single stock based solely on a low delta.  \n\nIf you had a lot of capital and could just take assignment on the puts and hold it, this would potentially be a reasonable risk.  You wouldn’t be betting more than you have on tail risk.  What you are being warned about is risking all your capital (and possibly more than your capital) on one move that requires margin and could force a money losing liquidation from tail risk.\n\nWorse than getting assigned this time, you will likely bet more and more if this works until you blow up an account using terrible risk management and position size, which happens all the time in option trading.

Keep putting money into your IRA on set and forget.

Look for 52 week bottoms to sell LEAP puts and buy LEAP calls.  Look for 52 week tops to sell CC.  \n\n4) Once you've become comfortable and have learned your hard lessons on the cheap shit, start taking slightly more risks with your taxable stack.  By this time you should be 10-20 years in.   I recommend learning wheel strategy using blocks of margin shares. \n\n5) Once you're fully comfortable, start doing options level 1 trading with your tax advantaged accounts. \n\nIt's simple.

Imitation learning (such as from YouTube videos), and/or ginormous amounts of compute for simulations. In fact so much compute, I'm not sure it's possible today on a budget measured in mere billions of dollars. So they would need to develop a variety of algorithms to reduce the amount of simulation needed. For example, if they have made a neural network that can simulate cloth physics more efficiently than a traditional simulator, that could let them increase the experience the bot goes through.\n\nSpeaking of cloth, a robot that could fold clothes would be the most impressive thing Tesla could show. To be frank, I doubt they will show anything impressive. Compute is the main limitation, and they may be limited for years waiting for Moore's law to do its work.\n\nDojo is optimized for training wide neural networks. It's not clear to me how general it is for other tasks. It may not be able to run the physics simulations, unless they develop neural networks that can eat deep into the simulation stack. But of course Dojo would be great for training from video data.\n\nI'm not sure the business case for the bot makes sense yet. Because it's a general device, it would typically be worse at any given task than a specialized solution (such as burger-flipping, fry-dipping robots). And I believe even getting the bot to work well on a single specific task (move boxes from point A to point B) will be a challenge. I'm expecting the bot to be far less capable than what many people have in mind. It's not until the bot can reach a certain threshold of capability where it would be valuable as a general solution.\n\nSo basically there are a handful of curves: Moore's law, increasing commercialization of specialized robotics and AI, and the development rate of the Teslabot itself. The future can go in a variety of directions and I have no idea which it will be.
