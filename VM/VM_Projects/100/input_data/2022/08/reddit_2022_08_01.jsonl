If XYZ always moves more than SPY, regardless of which direction either moves, that could be a play on the volatility ratio. But again, it's hard to make a case for why just playing XYZ alone for volatility isn't optimal.

The idea is to sell an in the money covered call and then by a protective put at the same strike price. The profit in this strategy is the extrinsic value collected from the call minus the cost of the protective put. If my thinking is right there is not any risk from the stock going up because the call is covered and there is no risk from the stock going down because you have protection from the intrinsic value sold down to the strike price and then protection from the put below the strike price. I’m I missing something is there some other risk I would be exposed to with this strategy?\n\nExample, I own 100 shares of AAPL I sell the AUG 12 160 call for $6.00 this gives $1.10 is extrinsic value. I then by the 160 put for $0.70. This means my profit is $40. Which is a .2% return.  \n\nI understand this strategy is nothing ground breaking and the cost of not having a downside is that the return is likely to underperform the s&p 500.

The 160 put is .70 so your max profit is 5 cents a share. Divide that by 160 and multiply by 52 weeks and you have about 1.6% yearly return. But it would end up being a little lower because of commissions, exchange fees, etc. \n\nYou might as well just put your money in a CD or money market fund because that's basically what you're doing but in an overly complicated way. \n\nBut to answer your question the main risk is in this situation. Say you do the trade and apple closes at 159.95 on expiration day. You might think the short call will expire worthless and your long put will get exercised to sell the shares.

You either sell to open or buy to open. If you sell to open, you are short. If you buy to open, you are long.\n\nSell to open a put is a bullish play, because you make money if the underlying goes up (sell high, buy back low).\n\nSell to open a call is a bearish play, because you make money if the underlying goes down (sell high, buy back low).\n\n>My other side of the question is what is actually happening when I decide to short call? Am I obliged to have 100 shares of WE stock to sell the option (so for instance its trading \\~5$ do I need 500$ in margin to be able to selling the options contract?)\n\nThat is two separate issues. First, if you sell to open a call short, your broker will either require that you secure that short fully or partially. How much you must secure depends on various factors, like your option approval level and the type of account. If you must secure the short call fully, for 100% of it's assignment value, you can do so either with long shares or with cash. However, securing with cash alone requires the highest level of option approval which almost no one gets, so you likely will have to secure with shares and only shares. You won't even be able to submit the order to sell to open the call unless you have enough long shares.\n\nWhether you have margin or not matters less than whether you have shares to cover or cash to cover.\n\n>and lastly, if I'm buying a short call/put do I want to hold it past expiry (granted WE is ATM/OTM)? What happens if I sell it before its expiry?\n\nAgain, you can only sell to open a short call/put, not buy.\n\nNo, you should not hold any options, long or short, puts or calls, to expiration.\n\nClosing (which means *buying to close* for a short, not selling) is how most traders make money.

The strikes are not equal in a vertical spread, so they can't cancel each other out entirely. The difference is the spread width. So if one strike is $100 and the other is $105, the spread width is $5 and that difference is left over after everything else cancels out.\n\nAnd spread width canceling **only happens at expiration**. If you get assigned early on the short leg, the cancelation doesn't happen for the spread width, it will be for some other value. Because there will still be time value in one or both legs and that is extra money above and beyond the spread width. This is why the max profit and max loss numbers of a vertical spread only apply at expiration. If you close the spread early, like due to early assignment, you may make more than max profit or lose more than max loss.\n\n>  I shouldn't worry about assignment, as if I get assigned, it automatically gets closed with my long call, right?\n\nRight, but for the wrong reason. Nothing is *guaranteed* to happen automatically for spreads, particularly before expiration. If your short leg is assigned early you should sell to close your long leg yourself, your broker *may not do it for you* (some do, some don't, and it sometimes depends on the type of spread). Note that I said sell to close, not exercise, because you should, as a beginner's simplification, never exercise early.\n\nYou shouldn't worry about early assignment because it rarely happens, as long as the short leg still has substantial time value. Time value is lost when you exercise, which by the way is why the simple rule is never exercise early.

It's not so much about \"goes above the short call strike price\", it's more about how much money you gain/lose by closing. You can make a huge profit without going anywhere near the short call strike, or you can have huge loss without going anywhere near the short call strike.

A low volatility stock could rise to a very high price, given more time.\n\n>Both have a strike 2 points away from the underlying.\n\nUsing strikes between different underlyings aren't necessarily comparable. For example, if one has strikes that are $1 apart and the other has strikes that are $5 apart, those may be radically different delta values. The way to compare contracts is by delta value. So you want two contracts with delta values that are as close to equal as possible. That could make one be 1 strike from the money and the other 3 strikes from the money.\n\n>Since TSLA tends to swing more aggressively than SPY, odds of profit/loss would be higher correct?\n\nHigh volatility means the chance that the final value is far above the profit target is higher, as well as far below the loss level. It means more outcomes far from the mean. The bell curve distribution gets squatter and fatter, with longer tails on either end.\n\n>In short, when trading volatility, best bet is to trade an equity with a higher % swing? Or would there be a case where SPY may not swing much, but it's contract will?\n\nThere's no \"best bet\". It's all trade-offs when it comes to options trading.

Vol cuts both ways.\n\nThe various ways to make money with vol are to:\n\n* Play convexity. [Read up on the volatility smile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatilitysmile.asp).\n* Play for reversion to the mean. This is based on the assumption that when current volatility is high relative to its long term average, it will eventually fall back to the average, or if it is low relative to its long term average, it will rise back to the average.\n* Play for mis-pricing, such as when sellers are overcompensated for volatility today that realizes to a lower that expected level in the future. If you have to pay a higher premium for an IV of 100% today, but in 30 days the realized volatility ends up being only 50%, you overpaid for that contract. That's an opportunity for sellers.

This has been explained to me before but it’s been a while and I don’t recall.\n\nWhy does an ITM call not increase $1 in premium when the share price increases by $1? Outside of time decay or IV shifting, it would seem intuitive to me that extrinsic value would remain the same (assuming the $1 price change happened instantaneously) while the option becomes intrinsically worth $1 more. Obviously this doesn’t happen, or all ITM calls would have a 1 delta. What’s the reason?\n\nFor example: Imagine you had 100 shares of a stock and sold a covered call on it with a small DTE,  then bought a call with the same strike price but with longer DTE. If the share price increases beyond your strike price, you “lose” $100 on your shares/covered call per $1 increase in the share price past your strike, but you don’t gain $100 on the long call per $1 increase in the underlying, you only gain the delta. Right? Or am I misunderstanding something?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">it would seem intuitive to me that extrinsic value would remain the same (assuming the $1 price change happened instantaneously) while the option becomes intrinsically worth $1 more.\n\nIt's useful to compare an ITM call's premium value (intrinsic + extrinsic) to the call's exercise value (stock price - strike price). Let's call the latter the \"parity value\".\n\nAs a simplifying assumption, first think about European-style options. There is no early exercise for those options, therefore, you can't capture parity value in the instant that the stock goes $1 ITM unless it is just about to expire. This means the further the call is from expiration, the more uncertainty there is that you can capture parity value by exercising, ergo the call itself is less likely to have a delta of 1.0 (though this is dependent on the standard deviation of the underlying -- if it's std dev is only $0.23, a $1 move over the money might in fact make it delta 1.0).\n\nOkay, so what about American-style options? Well, you can think of American-style exercise as a kind of \"sliding scale\" version of the European-style expiration-only exercise. The same rule for European-style has to apply -- the more time to expiration, the less certainty about the contract delivering parity value -- so that has to be reflected in the premium of the call. Buyers will not want to pay full parity value for a call that is expiring in 30 days, because they can't be sure the call will actually deliver that value if they hold it the entire 30 days. Most of that uncertainty is reflected in the extrinsic value, but some of it would be *discounted into the* intrinsic value as well, since all extrinsic value is lost upon exercise. If every ITM call was worth parity value + non-zero extrinsic value every day before expiration, sellers would be ecstatic, because the buyer would be taking on 100% of the risk of the contract by paying for it as if it was expiring the same day.\n\nPut another way, if we accept your assumption, that would require accelerating the expiration date of every call to today. Nevermind that it was originally 2 years out, if it is delivering parity value in premium (delta of 1.0) today, the only way it can do that is if buyers insist it expire today also. Otherwise sellers are being overcompensated for the intrinsic value of the call. Again, assuming the stock price move is much less than the volatility of the underlying. After all, you can find deep ITM call contracts that have a delta of 1.0 far before expiration, because the stock price is so far above the strike price that buyers can be nearly certain they will deliver parity value if they hold to expiration.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, this is really helpful.

So today i thought why not do a proper follow up to this post and what exactly is it telling us about the future strictly based on \"Technicals\". So all the fundamental analysts are going to be harmed in this post. So please don't mind that.\n\n**Tl;dr peeps : Go straight down and start reading conclusion and result. I apologise for the scrolling.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Before we begin :\n\nLet's clarify this debate once and for all. \"**Are we in a recession or not\" ?** \n\nMy thoughts : After drinking a bottle of whiskey last night ( stupid bear market rally ) and lying on the floor unconscious i have reached to a conclusion that **nope we aren't in a \"Recession\"**. How dare you guys call it a recession and blame media, politics for not calling it one. Many of you guys will be like \"Wooaahh bro what happened. Did Biden fever got you too\". or \"Go take you Meds\" etc. No guys i'm perfectly fine and i do believe we are not in a \"Recession\". But what i do believe in is **we are in** **\"Stagflation\"**. Now the case remains to be seen is if its going to be **\"Stagflationary recession\"** or **\"Stagflationary depression\"**\n\nP.s. I got inspired by the government last week so **i changed the definition of \"Stagflation\" to \"Stagflation - High unemployment\" \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_** . xD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Philips curve equation :  π = πe​−b\\(U−Un​\\) + v  where  π = inflation rate, πe = expected inflation rate, b = constant, U = unemployment rate, Un = natural rate of unemployment, v = supply shock](https://preview.redd.it/bjg363l9d1f91.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=7382760810fdd7a5fc0eb90974036fd2f52ec260)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReasons of stagflation  : The Fed **cannot hike rate so aggressively** that it causes economic slowdown ( did i used \"cannot\". Oh wait they can't. Fed funds goes 4-6% bid your farewell to USA. Currently its projecting 3.4% with rate cuts in Feb-march 2023) and **neither can they let inflation run out of control** to double digits. They have to **navigate somewhere in middle** if they are looking for a soft-ish landing. Meaning in the **Philips curve unemployment** will slowly start its progress towards somewhere in the middle of natural rate of unemployment Un and the extreme **right side of NAIRU** ( non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment ) for some rate hikes ( coz more we live on extreme left side of lower unemployment higher the chances of wage price spiral and increased inflation ) and these some **rates hikes breaks just one leg of inflation i.e demand side** and bring it down to half of about 4-5% inflation. But the **inflation** will still be **above 4%** ( due to **constant v called  exogenous supply shocks** more by **China \"Recession\"** and the **Russia \"Winter Oil\"** ) and the **unemployment** in upcoming times will be **more than 5%** ( the curve has high slope ). The real growth i.e Gdp adjusted for inflation will also be lower than 1%. Hence this would complete the definition of word \"Stagflationary recession\" by end of this year or by 2023 ( Inflation around 4-5% + Unemployment 5-6% ). If this keeps up for 2-3 years then you get my favorite \"Stagflationary Depression\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow did i reach this conclusion? Ask yourselves these 2 simple questions\n\n\\-> How much higher should Fed funds go ? And will it be enough to fight inflation. If that no > 3,4% i can assure you stock market will make a lower low. Reason : June 14-16. Bond market yields peaked and stock market bottomed.\n\n\\-> Will unemployment number go up as earnings recession comes at the end of year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : \n\n\\-> **Just to clarify i have not ruled out a 'Deflationary Recession\"** (bonds coming from 3.4% 10yr yields) or \"Deflationary Depression\". ( preceded by Stagflationary recession and depression. So coming from govt bonds with yields greater than 4% ) The first Deflationary recession is still in the card if USA marries Russia, China and peace is brought back in the global financial institutions. Currently market is projecting this scenario and believe inflation will come down too fast. Meanwhile supply chains, oil crisis will resolve the problem itself either due to peace or demand just drops way too fast.  And also unemployment will go up.\n\n\\-> Yes you smart Fed officials or knowledgeable economists i don't know the \"Keynesian Philips curve\".  The reason being i slept in my Ecom 301 class. Hence i chose \"Classical Philips curve\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Do it yourselves and teach me and rest of us in comments section :\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ot1hen4kg1f91.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=483cef1c7fedb9c07739776979f4022dfaf23470)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Moving on :\n\nSo now we have clarified some things but one might ask **how do we use this above information**. Well folks when the **Fed will try to fight inflation** and **not try to win a war over inflation. Thereby** we are gonna get **disinflation**. And then in these time **small caps to mid cap stocks are gonna rise** so much **with long term bonds** price. And then Fed will be like Ooff its too much lets cool it down a bit. Then **inflation will start tickling up and go for double digits**. In this case the **stocks will do a kangaroo, bonds will get hammered with yields shooting up and gold prices will go parabolically up**. After that we shall see what happens coz then the situation will get so much complicated even for the best of the best investors in the world. \n\nThe **deflationary** scenario being disinflation ( stocks up bonds up in price with metals falling ) will start turning to deflation and then **stock market drops bonds prices rises up even more exponentially** ( Hence i told you to buy them b/w May 15- June 15 ) **and gold prices collapse even more** but then Fed comes rescue us by QE+ mooning stocks, metals and everything else. The Fed one and only \"Fed put\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here's the 3 trailer of three different movies titled \"High inflation\" in ascending order :**\n\n[1970-80 : The two peak 15&#37;+ Inflation.

So shout out to\n\n\"All in Money\" podcast which releases video once every week. ( Sir if you're reading this i gotta say i'm a huge fan ) \n\nand the other is \"Everything money\" ( Sir you guys are amazing. Love your 8 pillar analysis. Not a huge fan of mocking others though )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese guys inspired me to create a basic principle in investing and trading.\n\n**So here are these 6 technical principles which i created on my own by comparing them with price action :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-> Candlesticks.\n\n\\-> Stochastic RSI + RSI ( Reading and divergences ) + Volume ( Just divergences )\n\n\\-> Moving averages / Exponential MA' ( Mostly 50,100, 200 MA and 233 EMA on daily, weekly, monthly )\n\n\\-> Elliot wave + Fib Retracement / Fib trend extension + Trend based fib time ( rarely )\n\n\\-> Ketlner channels, Ichimoku Clouds ( Sometimes )\n\n\\-> PVT(o)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's go and apply them :\n\n**Experiment : Predicting Top of bear market rally.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Instruments :**\n\nNasdaq : SQQQ\n\nSPX : SPXU\n\nHousing bubble : DRV\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hypothesis :** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-> Comparing things with 2008 coz it worked for us initially. Also the fact that due to housing bubble explained below in Step 3.\n\n\\-> Technical Analysis is a prism to see through the boundaries of space and time and fundamental analysis just screws up with your mind. xD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Procedure :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStep 1 : The Nasdaq Analysis ( Ticker : IXIC since it is the far dated one. Technically solid. )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Monthly chart](https://preview.redd.it/ipkwzv40g2f91.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=a493218501b20a69bb44983f1d56d7cc55e7b3fe)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMonthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Bottom : June 2022, March 2008 monthly candles ) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Candle Sticks : The first bullish engulfing ( July close ) in a long time for 2022 hence we compared things from March-April 2008 times. ( April close )\n* Stoch RSI : In deep water will come for a touch to 30 just like 2008\n* Moving Average : Tested 50 MMA and now will head upwards for middle Ketlner bands. \n* Fib Retracement : There are two fibs taken here. First fib is for the upwards move upto where this bear market rally 2 will go. It's mostly looking like it will go to 0.5 - 0.618 levels. So loadddd up those shorts there. If the candle closes above 0.618 on monthly TF that will be my invalidation case. The other fib is for downwards projections wherever this upcoming crisis will take us. The ans is 1.618.\n* Ketlner Channels : Notice there are two upper green, two lower red and one middle line ( changes color ). So a two green and two red lines makes a green and red band. And one middle line. Right now as you can see we have bounced from a red band in both scenarios. And now are heading to changing color line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/p66rol2kp2f91.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b000e3b2a446aade3322802008372cbe8f175c7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Bottom : 13 June 2022 , 17 March 2008 weekly candle )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Candle Sticks : As you can see we have currently breached that wall at may - june and are working towards for region b/w 0.5 - 0.618.\n* Stoch rsi & RSI with moving averages : As you can see the pattern of Stoch rsi and RSI there is a difference this time around. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2008 we had lower high Stoch rsi and RSI with price action lower high and touching those beautiful 50 and 100w MA after bouncing from 200,233 MA and EMA respectively. Meaning a bearish divergence of class B under reversal section.\n\nIn 2022 now we have higher high Stoch rsi and RSI with price action waiting to be seen if it will breach those 50 and 100w MA after bouncing from 200,233 MA and EMA respectively. In my opinion they wont. The reason being a death cross of 50 and 100w MA is coming. So what will happen is a price action of lower high with oscillators higher high. Meaning class A bearish divergence of hidden continuous section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* For divergences the references is below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKey thing to note is **\"History doesn't repeat it rhymes\"**. So as you can see in 2008 we tested 50wMA after bottom. But here in 2022 we already did that after bouncing from 100wMA before bottom. So there is a slight chance we could drop sooner but definitely not later. Just don't forget that. So the takeaway is we will have a touch of 50wMA but does it happen two times or just one time or maybe not at all after June 15 bottom remains the case to be seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- \n\n[The Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/n23xb6wku2f91.png?width=1817&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4190a7e3003e45751816509fc27f2f68517e4a4)\n\n\\*\\*Very tricky\n\nDaily Time Frame Analysis : ( Bottom : 16th June 2022, 17th march 2008 daily candle )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Candle sticks : Current one looks like Inverse h&s. \n* Stoch rsi & RSI : In 2008 we could see a bearish divergence on daily did the trick. Lets see how it will happen in 2022.\n* Moving Average : This is so beautiful guys. Look at that beauty. In 2008 we greased the 200dMA two times after bottom. Just like 50 on weekly. This times it's looking similarly that we will grease those 200dMA. Just like weekly the case remains to be seen will be it two times or just one time or no time after June bottom. This is the reason guys i flip flopped and told you to sell coz the crash could very well come early ( In references down below ) . But personally i believe its gonna come after touching 50wMA and 200dMA atleast one time. I hope i'm making it very clear guys. If you have any problem feel free to ask in comments section.\n* Fib retracement : You know this by now. Just draw a fib top to June 16 bottom. Then remember 0.50 - 0.618 the loadddd up those shorts zone.\n* Notice those extra green and orange lines. They are for letting you know dates for temporary bottom reversal and the second touch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now you might be wondering what the hell bro why did you do a IXIC  ( Nasdaq top 30 companies analysis ). Should've a done a US100 analysis or NDX. Well my folks it's not that easy. The way we Illuminatis work is by looking at charts which go far back. These two above charts don't go to 1970's time. So friends this was also the reason i didn't do a Pvt(o) analysis coz it doesn't even show there in trading view. Hence i have created these 3 charts on 4hr, daily and weekly time frame. And this is what's gonna blow your mind even more. And then you might realize why i flip flopped and told you to sell above 2% from June 16 Swiss Franc bottom. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Left : 4hr ,  Right : Daily Chart with Pvt\\(o\\) , Elliot wave , Ichimoku cloud.](https://preview.redd.it/19od6gjv23f91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e61bf09e54371d671735111481c0e2592cbb305)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/xlohcerc33f91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8ef75f933ffb0466540d7fc8a8fe9008483c655)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have already discussed above the \"maximum stretch case\" and below down in a reference for \"early case\". These two charts above is \"way early case with no touches.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's concerning me here \n\n\\-> What happens if price action touches weekly trend lines with stoch rsi crossing. Pvt(o) breakout is done on weekly which makes me optimistic though that a short to 200dMA will come. \n\n\\-> But the Pvt(o) on daily scares me. And also the volume and price divergence. And then the Ichimoku cloud too providing huge resistance. Even the trend lines my god.\n\n\\-> 4hr doesn't scare me at all coz it 4hrs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStep 2 : The SPX Analysis. It's your turn now guys. I will leave this one to you. Tbh I'm still in hangover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStep 3 : Housing Analysis.\n\nCmon, guys do i need to explain this one. Just check the last month Redfin data of housing and also the data coming from China. Last time in 2008 it was just one. This time around we have two largest economy in the world for the housing bubble collapse. But yes some people will come and say housing is still cheap compared to rest of the places in Europe or UK. Just tell those guys that current USA employment rate is under 3.6%. Once those unemployment number goes to 5% then come and talk to me about how are you gonna pay the mortgage for the houses. \n\nAlso the rent is about to skyrocket and the tenants will be unable to pay those rents of their household owner. They might leave the place and buy themselves a new home if still employed or they might just i don't know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A case for housing.](https://preview.redd.it/hdi3xv25k2f91.png?width=1852&format=png&auto=webp&s=1949062c2f735a1b995b7c6b75c536befd42cffe)\n\nLook i'm not saying entire housing of Usa will collapse but yah most of the parts of America. Sure.!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStep 4 : It's bonds. I have said explained this billion times already. This chapter is closed for now. May 15 - June 15. Only a change in Fed funds or 10yr yield crossing 3.4% will resume this chapter. So when it happens i will make sure to update this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStep 5 : Metals : My Stagflation \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, My Gold , My Rules.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The strongest Gold rally. This is my reason for double peak Cpi. And not deflationary but a stagflationary recession.](https://preview.redd.it/g1jszjxx93f91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5577a51b402f06f074a12a8923e93487d1ec3cf1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Result :** \n\nNasdaq composite IXIC : Shorting zones for one or two touches. We do nothing for 0 touch except see the global financial system collapse before our eyes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Entry zones :**\n\nBy moving averages : 50wMA / 200dMA , \n\nBy dates : 3rd-4th week of august is end of bear market rally. Exact day is formation of two peaks at 15/16 August and 29-30 August. Choose yourself when you want how you want.\n\n\\- **Target :** \n\nWill be upon your greed levels.\n\n\\- **SL :** \n\nClose above 200dMA and 50wMA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.s. I haven't shorted myself coz how can i. My time machines is broken after my last Wall Street Specials with Peter Lynch. Iykyk :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\n\\*\\*\\* Remember again : Crash could come early. And it all depends do we go for 50wMA/200dMA two times or one times. Hey maybe 0 times too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there are three scenarios :\n\n**A) Two touches**\n\nFirst touch will be in last 2 weeks of August making the temporary bottom reversal at 14 October \n\n16 November shall be the second touch to 50wMA/200dMA. \n\nThis is a \"slow type crash\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**B) One touches**\n\nLast 2 weeks of August ( 15 august first peak and 29 august second peak ) and then we start the \"Mega crash\".\n\nThis is a \"fast crash\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**C) Zero touch** \n\nThe reason i had to flip flop coz crash could start right now in first two weeks of august.\n\nThis is the \"bullet train crash\". The collapse of financial institution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**References :** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Candle Stick Patterns](https://preview.redd.it/m3m1xvbjl2f91.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3612ba5a25edf0733760352aba2ba3f23fde512d)\n\n[RSI, Stoch RSI Divergences](https://preview.redd.it/eebtndbjl2f91.jpg?width=814&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84f242237238d5f3ccfeb399f0276a6a35b6bed5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The early case chart after touching one time.

Buyers and sellers help determine the price of each stock, and the more buyers and sellers a particular stock has interested in it, the more liquid the market will be. Liquidity can have a profound impact on just how violently stock prices can move in either direction, and the reasons have to do with the nature of the market in a stock's shares.\nTrading volume and economic fundamentals of share prices\nAs with many things, what determines a stock's price in the short run is supply and demand. Different investors make a variety of assessments of a company's future prospects and therefore assign values to stock that differ. When one investor is willing to buy shares at a price at which another is willing to sell, then both see an opportunity from a trade. By contrast, if everyone agrees that an appropriate stock price is significantly above the previous trade price, then the shares will rise in value quickly.\nWhen a stock has a lot of investor interest, the greater number of different view on the stock's value creates more opportunities to trade. That typically shows up in the form of narrower spreads between the price buyers are willing to pay and the price sellers are willing to accept for shares. For instance, many actively traded stocks have spreads of just a single penny per share between the bid price from buyers and the ask price from sellers. Stocks that have relatively little trading volume can have spreads of a dime per share or more.\nWhy thinly traded stocks can take you for a bumpy ride\nMost of the time, the impact of trading volume is relatively neutral. Because the spreads between bid and ask prices are wider with thinly traded stocks, their prices will tend to move in a kneejerk manner, compared to the smoother movements among stocks with higher trading volumes.\nWhere investors really see the difference, though, is when a company announces important news. With stocks with high trading volumes, you'll typically see a one-time jump or drop followed by relatively smooth trading thereafter, as the large number of investors following the stock can make rapid assessments of the impact of the new information. With less frequently traded stocks, however, the swings can be much greater, and the stock price can overshoot and reverse itself several times as a relatively small number of investors fight to agree on an appropriate new price for the shares.\n\nTrading volume in itself doesn't affect stock price directly, but it does have a huge impact on the way that shares move. Investors who look at thinly traded stocks need to be aware of the heightened volatility involved before they buy.\"", "score": -4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I've never seen anyone say something factually accurate but still be wrong.\n\nYou belong here.", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "When can I buy puts?…don’t answer, I have opposable thumbs and 15 seconds.
