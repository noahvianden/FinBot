{"title": "3M Co. may face more than $100 billion in losses and potential bankruptcy due to faulty earplugs", "selftext": "3M Co. faces more than $100 billion in losses and bankruptcy because of lawsuits brought by veterans who blame their hearing problems on faulty earplugs, according to a litigation consultant hired by lawyers suing the industrial conglomerate.\n\nInitial results from a handful of test cases shows 3M would be swamped by losses should the more than 230,000 lawsuits related to the company’s military earplugs business go forward, the plaintiff’s adviser J.B. Heaton testified in bankruptcy court Tuesday.\n\n“It is more and more likely within the next several years we’ll see a 3M bankruptcy, yes,” Heaton told US Bankruptcy Judge Jeffrey J. Graham during a hearing in federal court in Indianapolis.\n\n“We strongly disagree with this unsupported and clearly flawed speculation,” company communications manager Sean Lynch said in an emailed statement. “3M has committed to provide $1 billion to a trust for claimants determined to be entitled to compensation.”\n\nSome advocates for the suing soldiers want Graham to block 3M from paying any shareholder dividends, buying back any of its stock or spinning off any assets, if the judge also decides to halt the lawsuits.\n\nRestricting how 3M spends its cash will protect money and other assets that could be used to compensate soldiers who have had their hearing damaged by the earplugs, the advocates said in court papers.\n\nThe company has a paid shareholders a regular dividend for at least a decade. Currently the quarterly payment is $1.49 per share.\n\nCompany lawyers disputed Heaton’s findings during the hearing, arguing that the 19 cases in which juries returned verdicts are outliers and cannot be used to extrapolate results for the other cases. Heaton, a former trial lawyer who now studies corporate litigation, acknowledged that the sample is small and that a judge may conclude $100 billion is not realistic.\n\n3M is in federal court trying to convince Graham to halt the lawsuits while the company’s earplugs subsidiary reorganizes in bankruptcy.\n\nLast month, the company put its Aearo Technologies unit into bankruptcy in Indianapolis as a way to resolve the claims. Under Chapter 11 rules, Aearo is automatically entitled to freeze lawsuits it faces, but because 3M itself didn’t file bankruptcy a judge must agree to give the industrial conglomerate the same protection.\n\nThe bankruptcy is Aearo Technologies LLC, 22-02890, United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis).\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-faces-100-billion-losses-162828827.html", "id": "wqc37h", "created_utc": 1660700738.0, "score": 770, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 192, "comments": [{"body": "Judges and politicians are *way* cheaper than 100 billion.", "score": 585, "replies": [{"body": "Alex Jones will most likely see part of his 45 mill settlement cut to 750k because the Texas Supreme Court put a cap on punitive damages.

The Jones trial ended in a jury verdict, not a settlement. There's no reduction in a settlement, because that's something both sides agree to.

There's no automatic reduction or cap of compensatory damages. If the compensatory damages exceed $750,000 then that is the maximum amount of punitive damages which may be awarded by the court. Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 41.008(b(1)(B).\n\nBut a large factor for 3M has to be that not all states have the same caps, and some have none. The $750k cap is for Texas.

There's just no economically viable way to replace the cheap Russian natural gas that their industry depends on. And even if there was it will take years. What's more they seem to be getting increasingly desperate and are now turning to firewood as an alternative energy source.\n\nIf Germany collapses then the EU is probably screwed too, and that's just Europe. China is in an awful position with their housing bubble collapsing and most of the developing world is facing headwinds from increased commodity costs. I doubt we've seen the peak of higher food prices yet either which disproportionately impacts developing economies.\n\nI think most people in the US are in a bubble right now honestly.
