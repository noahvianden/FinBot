For the first time in decades, the country’s enormous trade surplus is a boon for workers elsewhere.\n> \n> The downturn in the housing market began last summer in response to government restrictions on mortgage borrowing and developer leverage.

The pace of homebuilding has not been this slow since 2009.\n> \n> The result is extra supply for the rest of the world. Iron ore, metallurgical coal and copper are essential materials for making construction steel, household appliances and electrical wiring. Before the recent downturn, China consumed about two-thirds of the world’s iron ore and metallurgical coal and about 40 per cent of the copper. Lower demand means lower prices. Compared with the recent peak in July 2021, iron ore futures are down by half, while Chinese metallurgical coal prices are down by about a third. Global copper prices have dropped by a quarter despite the expected tailwind of additional climate-related green investments in the US and Europe.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Alright but who is gonna make all the stuff we want? \nMost of the stuff we trade are comming from China.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I understand your point: you're worried that a Chinese slowdown means lower production and therefore exports. \n\nWhat I'm saying:\n\n1. China will import less raw materials from elsewhere, lowering global demand and therefore prices. Western companies can therefore get cheaper materials for their manufacturing.\n2. If there is demand for Chinese exports in the West, there is no reason for them to halt. The only reason that would happen is if there is war, sanctions, or barriers to free trade. As long as that doesn't happen, there will continue to be free trade between China and the West.\n\nA recession in the US, likewise, doesn't mean our *ability* to produce and export goods goes down. Usually recessions features collapsing demand for goods, hence production falls and workers get laid off. If China goes into recession but the West doesn't, there will still be demand for Chinese goods, so their production wouldn't just stop. A firm with healthy business from the West isn't going to layoff its workers. It would only do that if there is no demand for its goods.\n\nWhat *will* stop is economic activity related to say domestic housing construction. But that doesn't impact the West.\n\nThe main bear case that China poses to the rest of the world is war with Taiwan and/or trade conflicts.

Homeowners with solar and Powerwall can collect energy from the sun, and then store it in the big Powerwall battery to power their house at night or in the event of a grid outage.\n\nNow, Powerwall has another use case, even when the grid is operational.\n\nWhat Happened: As covered by Electrek, Tesla has been trying out a program in which a virtual power plant (VPP) consists of distributed energy storage systems, such as Tesla Powerwalls.\n\nLast year, Tesla launched this VPP pilot program in California, for which Powerwall owners would join in voluntarily without compensation to let the VPP pull power from their battery packs when the grid needed it.\n\nThis week, Tesla had its first emergency response event. Tesla asked permission from volunteer homeowners to use their thousands of Powerwall battery packs to simulate one power plant to provide energy to the grid at a time of high demand. The use of these batteries in unison lowered the need for peaker plants, which are usually powered by coal or natural gas and are high producers of pollution.\n\nUnlike before, participants in the event will receive $2 per kWh of energy contributed, far above the rate the owner pays to use electricity. It is estimated that participants will get between $10 and $60 per event.\n\nTesla contacted owners before the emergency response event to allow them to opt-out, in case they needed the energy from their Powerwalls for themselves. After agreeing, Powerwall owners didn't need to do anything, as the backup procedure is automatically handled. Owners can also limit how low their Powerwall is allowed to discharge during an event such as this.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fourth GigaPress installed at Texas.

Like labeling images is pretty straightforward, at least if you're just using bounding boxes for everything, and drawing lane lines, etc. Labeling video is more complicated, to make that work you really need custom software and some kind of preliminary autolabeling, otherwise it would take forever to label everything in a short clip.\n\nBut I'm trying to imagine how hard it must be to label the 3d point cloud you get from a lidar? Like, I assume it needs custom labeling software and autolabeling too, but it still seems like it would be a very slow and error-prone task for humans to do. Would they have the raw video playing side by side, or overlaid somehow or something like? Just so that the person doing the labeling can actually see what they're looking at?\n\nAnd then there's the problem of catching errors, either in the data or from auto-labeling or human-labeling mistakes? If there's some artifacts from weird light scattering or occlusions or something you could end up with some messy data that looks good or is labeled all wrong, but not in a way that's obvious.\n\nI would guess that's why Waymo does a relatively high amount of simulated driving for training. At least then you can be sure that things are labeled correctly, but that doesn't help you catch any of the real world artifacts or labeling mistakes.\n\nLabeling is such an under-appreciated part of the process, and I think people tend to assume that lidar spits out nice clean data that you can feed right in to the algorithm. But I'd bet that it's actually a very slow and painful process to go from raw data to labeled data that's useful for training.

A kid who grows up poor whose parents never buy him anything beyond basic necessities, but also don't make him do chores, or discipline him, or hold him accountable for his grades or his behavior or his actions, is growing up spoiled.\n\nConversely, a wealthier family who has their kids routinely do chores (with consequences and rewards for them), keeps up with what their kids homework assignments are, what they're learning about in school, and impresses upon their kids a sense of responsibility with embedded consequences and rewards will raise kids who have a sense of self, independence and responsibility.\n\nUltimately you can't buy parenting.  A kid who is bought everything he wants, but whose parents otherwise ignore him, will have a very low sense of place in the world, and the values he develops will be influenced almost exclusively by his friends, teachers and outsiders.\n\nWhereas poorer parents who play board games with their kid every night after dinner, ask him about what he's learning in school, makes sure his homework is getting done, and makes time for the kid to see his friends, relatives, and pursue his interests (sports or hobbies or whatever they are) will raise a kid who has a strong sense of self and place, and will be more strongly influenced by your own values.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thx, that is in tune with the other answers and what i have always done in terms of childcare.

{"title": "DD for $BBBY after crash, it's fucking amazing.", "selftext": " Okay apes, I’m here with some juicy DD on $BBBY. Although today RC is drilling all our wives and  waved the flag of scumbaggery, its ok because it’s looking fucking great without him. Let me explain:\n\nHere is breakdown of what had happened, what caused the price to drop and what DIDN’T (important) cause the price to drop.\n\nBelow is a chart showing RC selling his shares periodically (this is done to prevent huge movements).\n\nOn 8/16 ---  RC started selling at a price of $18/share, this price was on the charts around 10:20am (very important will explain later), by the end of the day he had sold 5,000,000 shares with prices ranging from $18 to $26 per share.\n\non the next day, 8/17 ---- RC sold 2,780,000 shares, with prices ranging from $23 to $29\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.sec.gov\\/Archives\\/edgar\\/data\\/886158\\/000092189522002496\\/sc13da313351002\\_08182022.htm](https://preview.redd.it/m43f4k6xeki91.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=86f884c3b0754ca17cb60843dab0bbd61a67b6b7)\n\nSo now we know he sold 5 million on 8/16 and 2.7 million on 8/17. But do you remember what the chart looked like on 8/17 when market opened? after RC had already sold 5 million shares the day prior…well let me show you this juice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look at the chart below, on morning of 8/16, there was one dip before we climbed to a high of $29/share, that dip was around the same price that RC started selling around the price of $18 as shown on the chart above, yet we continued to climb. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8naldg5fki91.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=484750bd3e9ae660646c9cc6f8c2b297d273dcd5\n\nWhy though? Why did we continue to climb? Because we had no fucking idea that he was selling. This will get so much juicer just wait. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe chart below shows that at 4pm on 8/16, the price closed with a low of $18, at that point, 5 MILLION shares have been sold by RC (the bigger and first chunk that was sold). But we had no fucking clue, yet the following day, we mooned first thing after opening as you can see below, and held at even higher than the day before, we recovered like it was nothing, and held a good floor. All of this happened after RC had sold 5 million shares the day prior + most of his second batch which was selling periodically throughout the day on 8/17 while we maintained a good floor level. we had such great support that his sell off did not shake the chart. below shows when we closed after 5 million of RC shales have been sold, and right after that circle is when we recovered (again we had no clue) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udjnjzprfki91.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=44e6fe4391cf847804b172e1d416d5717ef0bc7f\n\nOn 8/17 (yesterday) around 3pm, FUD started coming out that ryan cohen is intending to sell his shares. Mind you, at that point he had ALREADY SOLD ALL HIS SHARES AND WE STILL HELD A HIGH PRICE OF 27$, but panic started happening thinking RC was still in and was going to sell, when he in fact had already sold everything because by this point it is 3:30pm and his shares cannot sell as a lump sum, meaning he was strategically selling through out the day yet we maintained a high. What does this mean? It means the huge drop we saw towards closing yesterday was almost purely panic selling. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now on the real DD:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is data from 7/29 showing float being less than naked shorts, 28.26 million float and 29.07 million shorted, this puts the short % of float at a whooping 102.88%, textbook says 20% or higher is considered high. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow since this data is not up to date, counting worst case scenario, RC sold a total of 7,780,000 shares, which were added to the float. This makes the new float around 36 million, while the short is 29 million (new data is most likely higher), this makes the new short % of float around 29/36 = 80.5%. I take pride in having a big dick, but this value is bigger than my dick could ever get. This is still huge, and this is counting worst case scenario. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faj688oxfki91.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf697dea9de5868ec83ed8149d321b8a5aca642f\n\nBut Baylish I am retarded, please simplify this to me? Ok ape, I’ll summarize like you’re 5. \n\n1.\twe had no fucking clue that RC had already sold all of his position, yet we continued climbing. This is huge, why? Because that means RC did not matter. \n\n2. we now have one less entity to worry about that could rug pull moving forward. \n\n2.\tit only started crashing once the fud came out -> causing mass panic. This caused more damage than RC himself selling, in fact RC selling didn’t make a dent, this shows that sentiment goes a long way. \n\n3.\tnew tentative data shows short % still high as fuck (around 80% per morning star’s latest info)\n\n\n4. if we manage to even make slight, yet gradual rise from here and bring back the positive sentiment, we have less risks of rugpull like with RC, and we have proved absolute resilience after the worst that could happen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\nNot a financial advisor. I’m holding my position, because we are back to an affordable price where many can jump in if they choose to. And I believe if we get this started again, especially without a hero figure, we will be unfucking stoppable. It’s all sentiment and a little bit of price rise.\n\nthe good news is that BBBY got huge media exposure that any type of recovery WILL have all eyes on it…. In a jaw dropping way. \n\nReminder:\n\n1. GME went down 50% before it shot up. \n\n2. This sub had a fraction of its current members during GME (2m vs 12m) \n\n\n3. Could u imagine the kind of FOMO that will happen if we pull this just $3-5 back up intraday after all the Psuedo bad news? \n\n4. It’s on fucking REG SHO \n\nInvest on your own risk, this could go 3 possible ways: we could shit our pants losing everything, or shit our pants seeing a turn around, or shit our pants seeing a turn around after paper handing. Choose which way you want to shit your pants. In either case, we will shit our pants. Stay well friends\n\nIf you are bullish and intend to HODL or buy more, speak up about your positive sentiment because ur bullishness can go a long way on this anonymous sub of millions. \n\n“When everyone is greedy that’s when you should be fearful, when everyone is fearful, it’s time to be greedy” - Warren Buffet\n\nEDIT as of 11:24 pm EST: GOLDMAN SACHS BOUGHT 1,000,000 shares worth of calls TODAY!

{"title": "Let’s stop being emotional and start being rational", "selftext": "Ok the stock went down now what? First of all ask yourself why you intend to panic sell in the first place, it’s because your scared the price will keep going lower and why you fomo when the price is parabolic because your excited the price will go higher and don’t want to miss out. This is trading on emotion which is literally investing 101 on things you shouldn’t do, put your big boys pants on and take Ryan cohens dick out your ass and rise like the apes we really are. Literally the worst thing that could happen has happened and now we have nothing else to fear or to hold us back. Ryan Cohen sold on the 16th and the 17th in which both cases it didn’t affect the price. Now the price is taking a nosedive because we got news that he sold and retail is panic selling, Ryan Cohen does not have the power y’all are giving him. We don’t need the help of the same people we are trying to fight if anything this just proved that Ryan is not who we thought he was and we should use this opportunity to short $GME and crash the stock no point in helping someone who won’t help us. Stop underestimating the power that we(retail) have Ryan Cohen bought his shares almost 6 months ago and it did nothing to the price yet we had this major pump once we all United for the short squeeze. It’s not over until we all give up!!! Let’s not give up hope y’all use your brains. When gme, amc and Nokia were pumping last year did any of y’all know who the fuck Ryan Cohen was? Hell nah we the people chose gme as a short squeeze and that made Ryan Cohen who he is today. During the short squeeze last year no one gave a fuck about Ryan Cohen we all just liked the stock and decided to give a big middle finger to Wall Street and it worked. Ryan took advantage of that to make it seem like he was on our side and planned it all along trying to seem like the leader of wsb when in reality he is a nobody rich fuck who only cares about his own self interest. \n\n\n\nLong story short WE HAVE THE FUCKING POWER not Ryan Cohen. He bought shares almost 6 months ago and did nothing to the price it was retail who actually caused the pump, we need to start giving ourselves more credit than we actually do. Sleep well tonight lads because this war is far from over and we will be coming back with a vengeance against Ryan Cohen and Wall Street.🦍🦍🦍", "id": "ws1x9t", "created_utc": 1660875754.0, "score": 504, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|11|**First Seen In WSB**|3 days ago\n**Total Comments**|195|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 days|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ws1x9t)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ws1x9t)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So weird that one dude selling crashed the hole thing and he sold yesterday we where doing just fine with out him", "score": 161, "replies": [{"body": "It’s main stream media pushing out a narrative to cause fear and panic among retail investors because the ones who actually have the power has always been retail investors.
