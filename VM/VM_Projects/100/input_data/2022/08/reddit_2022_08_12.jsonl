Worst case you buy the underlying and it tanks. Then your short call expires worthless and makes you money, but you could loose quite a bit on your long stock. If you are willing to bet the stock keeps going up or stays above your short call strike, then buying a stock and delivering should be cheaper then buying back the short call.\n\nI would consider buying a lower price call instead of a stock in case when you are short a call, and buying a higher strike put, instead of shorting, in case when you are short a put.”\n\nHope that helps!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I have started to do something similar after blowing up multiple accounts.

The market moves proportionally, not linearly.  By your logic, the 1929 crash in which the Dow lost 320 points was miniscule notionally compared to it's current level of 33,761.  What were they so worried about, those doomsayers?!  But a 320 pt fall from its 1929 peak of 381 is massive.\n\nDo yourself a favour, and switch your charts to semi-log scale.  That is far more representative of how the market moves.\n\n\n>There is also a bit of froth from meme stocks like HKD going up 1000x or BBBY tripling from 4 to 12.\n\nI agree with you that there is more of that sort of thing occurring now than in other times, but it's not unusual over much longer timeframes.  We've just given them a new name these days by calling them \"meme stocks\".  A new name doesn't make something new.  Take a look at stocks like MSTR leading up to the 2000 crash, which went from $7 to $330 in a year (and then crashed, predictably), or RCA in the 1920s, which had a >10-fold increase in a year (which of course also crashed, predictably).  There are many many examples of these occurring both in recent times and in markets going back centuries.  Tulips, anyone?\n\n\n>The algos just flip a switch and it's only up or only down.\n\nPeople credit algos far too much for how the market moves.  They have changed the market, without question, but it's more in the intra-day moves that you see these effects, not so much the big multi-day or multi-week moves.  The big moves are still very much human-driven.  \n\nFinal word: The market isn't some cabal of evil overlords with a big \"up\" and a big \"down\" button just waiting to fuck everyone over.  No entity or algo has control over it.  It's a dynamic, somewhat chaos-driven, near-organic cluster of many many humans and human-controlled systems.  It is intertwined with currency markets, bond markets (which are much bigger than stocks, btw), political actions, natural events, religion, moon phases, and tea leaves.

{"title": "Tiger 21, an exclusive club of investors, says the ultra rich are doubling down on stocks", "selftext": "The members of Tiger 21 – a peer network of ultra-high net worth entrepreneurs and investors – are putting most of their money to work in the stock market for the first time.\n\nTiger 21 consists of 1,200 members with a cumulative $140 billion in assets, and individuals must have at least $20 million in liquid assets to qualify for membership.\n\nIts founder and chairman, Michael Sonnenfeldt, told CNBC on Thursday that although real estate had historically been the most popular destination for members’ money, they were now seeing some “real bargains” in the stock markets.\n\nThis has, in part, pushed public equities to the No. 1 spot for Tiger 21 for the first time since the network’s inception.\n\nSonnenfeldt said members are not focused on stock picking for the most part, so much of the equity investment is channeled into ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and index trackers, while technology has been among the most popular sectors. Public equities now constitute 27% of the membership’s overall asset allocation.\n\n“You have a lot of the FAANGs that have come in from much higher prices — they are thinking there is a lot of benefit there, and obviously one of the big areas is energy, not only on the oil and gas side, but much bigger growing interest in renewables and how to play the solar opportunities, the wind opportunities,” Sonnenfeldt told CNBC’s “Street Signs Europe.”\n\n“They know this is the biggest investment theme perhaps in human history, and it is getting a lot of their attention.”\n\nAfter a dismal first half of the year on the back of soaring inflation, tightening monetary policy and recession fears, stock markets have staged a relief rally in recent weeks, and received a further boost Wednesday after U.S. inflation was shown to have cooled in July on the back of a fall in oil prices.\n\nMany investors have increased their cash holdings to weather a likely recession. Sonnenfeldt said the cash allocation of Tiger 21 members has historically held solid at an unusually high 12%.\n\nThis is because they are primarily “wealth preservers” who have sold businesses and live on roughly 2% of their net worth, and therefore use cash reserves to shore up around five years of living expenses, he said.\n\nIn the short term, Tiger 21 noted that members are using their ample cash to look for deals and inflation hedges.\n\n“But they also want resources to pounce on an opportunity and they have been seeing them in increasing numbers, so their cash actually just ticked down from 12% to 11%. It may sound like a small amount, but it probably suggests that members are quite bullish over the long term,” Sonnenfeldt said.\n\n“They have recession fears — a majority of our members think that we are going into recession — and still between real estate, public equity and private equity, it is a 76% allocation, so that is pretty confident in the long term.”", "id": "wmgje9", "created_utc": 1660295008.0, "score": 352, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "Okay two questions:\n\n1.

{"title": "WTF. Trading mistakes? Call CBOE to get them reversed!", "selftext": "So, funny story I'd like to share here. I never knew this was something that's acceptable, let alone legal in America. So apparently, when someone buys something and they have buyer's remorse they can have a big-bully (such as Fidelity) go beat up the seller (me) and just forcefully take the money back and give back the traded item. I never knew this was an acceptable and legal thing.\n\nIn this case an option contract that I sold for $5 at 10:19 am today was then forcefully returned 4 hours later to me after which point (because it's 0 DTE) you couldn't even market sell for $.05 to close because of 0 bids. They bought a vase from me, got pissed and had a buyer's remorse, went to the big bully who agreed with him, and then brought me worthless broken vase, had the big bully beat the living shit out of and take my money to give back to him.\n\nI made a transaction earlier today.\n\n10 SPX 8/11 $4280c was sold for $5 a pop as follows through Fidelity at 10:19 am EST:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c71hoz7cv6h91.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5965566632cd329ac1b2d267aeb8ba49c1b4cae\n\nI had 20 of these contracts that I bought for sale for $.85 a pop, and had 10 for sale at a limit price of $5 a pop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvtdiekyv6h91.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=df2971d1389069f946513d90aa61a21d57570bc2\n\nAnd then about 4 hours after the sale, Fidelity reversed the transaction. They debited my account $5k ($500 x 10 contracts) and gave me back the contracts that had a bid/ask of $0/$.05 as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WTF?!](https://preview.redd.it/shkjr48ov6h91.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=276976bf4b256b331d0e22d58acaea9b35f062c2)\n\nFidelity beat the shit out of me, turned me into a bloody pulp, and then had the previous buyer effectively pee on me and give me back a worthless broken thing that I couldn’t even sell for a penny to anyone.\n\nJustice of course can be served right? MAYBE? Of course, story gets sadder in reality. I call Fidelity. They tell me straight up (well after holding and talking with them for 2 hours) that, “CBOE sent an industry wide letter saying that these specific orders were busted and must be reversed”. From here, our friend from Fidelity tells me that they cannot do anything and that I must be happy with the broken vase and should be grateful that the erroneous trade was caught and reversed. And he proceeds to tell me that “Imagine if you were on the other side of that trade, wouldn’t you want the trades be reversed??”. What he said boiled down to this, the price I received was an “unfair” price that’s completely out of the norm because the contract “never traded that high again” and so it had to be reversed out.\n\nYeah buddy, I can also totally imagine how the trade went. Some moron basically fat fingered and market bought, which effectively cleared out everything all the way up the chain to not only hit my limit prices but even double that. As so:\n\nSo this rich fucker (I’m assuming, yes, but we are talking about 205 contracts that were very likely bought by this same person at exactly 10:19:39 AM EST, nobody poor has that kind of money to throw on 0 DTE SPX contracts) fucked up, and then he had the gall to call his friends at CBOE, who he probably has martinis with during lunch, and asked them please reverse them. Which they happily obliged. 4 hours AFTER the transaction. What’s even funnier is I was debited $5k and given 10 of the said contracts with no cost basis.\n\nIF someone rich can just have their trading mistakes reversed like this when they fuck up, how are we supposed to trust out limit prices? Better yet, what about everybody’s market order fuck ups here? Apparently you can go back and have them reversed because of “unfair” pricing for your dumbassery. If this guy had his transaction reversed why not you or me?\n\nAlright now I’m looking at you Fidelity. How can you have customers believe your order history or even anything you say to them now. And here I thought you were one of the “better” customer oriented ones from the industry. Fuck you is all I can say. You just stole $5k from me. I write this to as a sad and cautionary tale to you retards not to deal with Fidelity. I still have the fucking worthless contracts sitting in my account right now. Gdamnit I need a drink.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: someone (very likely rich and connected) fucked up and made a market order on a very very illiquid financial instrument, i.e. options contract, and then very likely had their friends at CBOE reverse the transaction and left me holding the $5k bag. Fuck Fidelity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I submitted a formal complaint with the SEC and FINRA. What I have a particular beef with is the fact that the reversal happened FOUR HOURS after the event, and I was handed a worthless contract. Someone SHOULD be held accountable at these giant corporations for that loss of mine.

Fuck Fidelity.\n\nThis is not how this works.  Every exchange has published rules for how \"error trades\" can be reversed.  I am not familiar with it in equity options (but very familiar with it in other markets), but the specific rules for the CBOE at least are here: [https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule\\_book/CFEPoliciesandProcedures.pdf](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_book/CFEPoliciesandProcedures.pdf)\n\ntl;dr:\n\n* There is a band of prices around which all trades are not contestable\n* Outside of that band of prices, trades can be contested as error trades.  There is a specific time limit to do this, and specific rules for what is and is not considered an error.  Note a MM algo screwing up does usually count as an error.  \n* A message will be broadcasted out on the market data feed that the trade has been contested. \n* There are very specific rules on how these trades are reviewed, and there is a time deadline to review them.  The final decision will also be published on the market data feed.\n* In some cases (and it looks like on the CBOE), you can voluntarily undo a trade if you're the counterpart.\n\nI honestly do not know what a broker is required to report to a client if a trade they are involved in is part of this process.  But as a trader you really need to be aware of error trade rules if you're going to play in thin and wide markets.

Now you only have two left and if you have to use them you get the week off because they won't let you open any positions to \"protect you from being labeled a PDT\" leaving your account frozen.\n\nThat way you get tempted to sell to open a super OTM put credit spread on a futures contract just so they can screw you by ever-changing margin algos (as described by their rep) and close your short leg while leaving your long leg to burn. This one is probably more so on me, but why not just liquidate the whole spread? \n\nDon't get me going on the software updates that decimate all of your finely tuned settings.", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "Fck never knew Ibkr is so fucking fucked", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Little bitch CEO is then saying gEorGe SoRoS bad.

This guy sounds like he is over leveraged and trading with less than $25k since he’s running into PDT issues and a slight change in margin requirements are getting him liquidated. \n\nAs for a debit spread being a credit spread, this guy probably inadvertently entered different spreads involving only one leg of previous spreads which can “turn” debit spreads into credit spreads or vice versa. I trade a lot of vertical spreads, both credit/debit involving puts/calls and trade horizontal spreads with IBKR Pro every week and I have not had an issue other than when I was a retard and opened additional spreads involving contracts already used in other spreads. And even then I realized what I did and you can “fix” it by entering a nearly identical spread and not affecting PDT rules by doing something like a 144/149 C spread vs a 145/150 C spread.\n\nIBKR pro mobile app lets you browse the option chain by vertical spread, calendar spread, or diagonal spreads which is a nice visualization tool because you can quickly compare delta, gamma, and bid/ask and decide what spread works best for your thesis.

I have the screenshots to prove it because at one point things got so bad before I left them that I had to screenshot my positions 100 times throughout the day. \n\nThey told me their system gets confused and there’s nothing they can do about it. If I only buy to open 1 wide spreads, can you imagine my shock when I suddenly have multiple 2 wide spreads and also short credit spreads. These were not spreads that were legged into either, they were opened outright. And it wasn’t once it was several times a week that it happened. \n\nWhen a strangle order is opened instead of an outright call position, selling a one strike higher put against the long put is what I had to do to remedy that situation. That was not a “fix” per say but a workaround to blunt some of the damage on what was obviously a bullish minutes  release at the time. Not to mention I then was forced into additional commissions by opening additional contracts. Plus the opportunity cost of having my money tied into a position I didn’t want. \n\nI do agree that their phone app’s option chain is highly intuitive, yet I always had to use TWS pro because options would take forever to load on my phone leaving me in the dust. \n\nAnother suspicious thing I didn’t mention in my previous post is that the software became inoperable not once, but twice at obvious market bottoms at  SPX 3600 and 3800. Other than the spread mix arounds, the software never gave me problems other than those two coincidental times. \n\nYou also completely dodged that user’s question about GME, as they DID indeed halt it. \n\nI will own up to not knowing the margin requirements well enough on the ES put spread I sold, but that doesn’t make it right that they liquidated half of an order (with a market order) to leave me theta draining on a small dip and rip. I can’t see how anyone could describe their auto liquidation system as anything other than predatory. I do not use margin other than in spread situations and had always kept tons of cash in the account. In fact I actually converted to a cash account and kept getting margin warnings (as they require a certain threshold in the account to pay data fees and commissions). Didn’t expect that, but it makes sense. Still a total shocker when you went the cash route only to avoid the warning boxes (which also would format oddly that you need to resize them to click them- further slowing you down). \n\nI’m glad you’re experience has been better than mine.
