This saw the S&P 500 move down from 4,818.62 to 3,636.87. This is a range of 1,181.75. Of this range, an ideal fibonacci retracement (bear market short-term rally) would be 61.8% back up in this range. That takes us 730.32 up from 3,636.87 which gives 4,367.19. Yesterday's high was 4,325.28. This high was within 1% error of the ideal 61.8% Fibonacci retracement.\n\nThus, the 50 Week Simple Moving Average of the S&P500, as a further catalyst for resistance, will reject the S&P500 down, thereby allowing for the horrible stock market downturn to continue.\n\nThat said, the first half of 2022 was the worst in 52 years, the third quarter was one of the best, and the fourth quarter may end up being the worst stock market quarter on record.

Statistics](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics) has been updated to include July. As expected, we got a slight reprieve in debit balances in customers' margin accounts. Nevertheless, graphing the data and adjusting for the near-record inflation for each data point, we can see that we are still in the worst bubble by value in the history of the stock market.\n\nFibonacci of this graph shows that Margin has to collapse up to $370 Billion more from August's expected margin value), depending on the strength and speed of the deleveraging.\n\nFINRA Margin Totals, Adjusted for Month-by-Month Inflation. Dotcom crash (left bubble), 2008-2009 crash and great recession (middle bubble) and the current bubble (right). Fibonacci retracement values are listed for 61.8% and 78.6% of each deleveraging period. One can observe that the bottom of margin deleveraging bottoms within that range, depending on the strength and speed of the unwinding. (61.8% seems to correspond to slow and weak, and 78.6% seems to correspond to fast and strong). The data shows that the market will continue to deleverage and crash\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TLDR:\n\nUnfortunately, summer is ending. The short-term rally has expired, as technicals show three problems for the stock market: 1: A perfect rejection off the S&P500's 50 week Simple Moving Average, 2. The 61.8% retracement already happened, and 3. A perfect rejection off the S&P500's 200 day Simple Moving Average. In a 1929-like scenario, total margin (and adjusted for inflation) shows that we are still in the largest margin bubble of all time. Fibonacci levels on the inflation-adjusted FINRA margin data show that the market has to still undergo up to $370 Billion of deleveraging. Therefore, I am hereby predicting that the fall and winter months of 2022 will be some of the worst months in stock market history. Leading market strategists such as Dimon, Zuckerberg, Musk, Novogratz, and even Warren Buffett concur, and some say that 2023 will be a Depression.

Want to know how much any of them have been talked about on Reddit? Zero.  None have been talked about.\n\nBut there's nothing fancy about any of this because you could have just tossed money in a leveraged index like TQQQ and made 40% with nearly no risk.

Very rare I encounter hard braking issues without the radar now, when using autopilot / navigate on autopilot. \n\nOne last thing is NoA likes to be 1 lane out per mile from an exit / interchange. It doesn't care about traffic. So if 1 mile from an interchange it will want to be in the lane needed to take the interchange. If 3 miles out, it's okay being 2 lanes over. \n\nNone of the above matters because FSD v11 theoretically will replace autopilot completely.\n\nEdit: I have my Tesla Model 3 Performance 1 month shy of 4 years. 48k miles on the car.

I can't explain why exactly. It just really put me in a bad mood. Much better without it. Not the same for everyone lol.

Two out of three isn’t bad. \n\nUpdate : I’m still all in.   +4,000 shares.  174,000 / 10C 1/23\n\n4.3M total  🐳💎\n\nBut that’s not the main question, right? \n\nIs RC in?  That is more difficult to answer, lavender hearts notwithstanding.   \n\nTo quickly address the stock performance itself.  My personal pre-week projections/notes called for all days of double digit days and one red day, either Wed or Thursday.   We’re on schedule. The reaction to the down day would what determined if Friday is a double digit or triple digit gain day, and if the latter, all bets are off for Mon open. (🚀)   I debated trying to time either Wed or Thursday and make moves accordingly , and decided not to.   If I chose wrong it would be too expensive to get back in Friday.  Tomorrow may be the last buying opportunity for shorts and retail on the sidelines (GME and AMC holders, that is) [Someone please make a Gandalf meme with “On the 5th day look to my coming from the East!].  Regardless, it will be a big EOW.  \n\n(No need to even waste this space, but yes, the media is blatantly disingenuous and their interests obviously align with the shorts.  CLICKS and NEGATIVES at any cost.   There is no truth premium, sorry.   To be honest, that’s a bullish signal to me.  It’s yet another sign of desperation and everything will be thrown at retail tomorrow to induce sales.   It really will be a battlefield.  They have to make enough tomorrow not to get slaughtered by the bulls Friday/Mon.  My take is that they will lose.  The volume and buy in is too high.  There are too many watching on the sidelines frustrated that they won’t get a shot at 8/19.)\n\nBack to RC. \n\nWhat is in his best interest?  Cut his losses and move on?  Disassociate from meme stocks and his base of support?  High Society Wall Street and take a position in Apple and push for pet wearables? (Hey that might actually be genius).  Perhaps.   \n\nHowever, if he makes the jump from Papa Cohen to Papa Paper Hands, it’s curtains for his reputation.  He has a pristine track record and reputation, pretty much the perfect assets for a billionaire activist investor.   Why did so many people follow him here to BBBY?   That’s why.  The $100-180m or so from sales is kind of small in comparison to the potential billions wiped out of his future positions.  \n\nLet’s consider the OG Chewy RC for a moment rather than GME Chairman RC.   His genius/innovation was on a new way to retail with an incredible focus on customer service, experience etc.   Basically, taking an anti-Amazon position that “life is a vending machine, push button, get cheap product”.   It also helped that he had slightly irrational customers (pet owners) that could pay a premium.   \n\nEnter BBBY and (unmentioned in the media coverage today) buybuy Baby.   The second great group of irrational customers : parents.    (I speak for myself incidentally.   Any stock losses cannot compare with the present and future amount happily wasted/spent on our two dogs and two babies.)  It’s a perfect match for his skill set - Retail that needs a shakeup and better customer service to cater to parents (okay, probably moms - don’t cancel me. I’m a dad and have been to BBBY too, ok?).   So people liked his chances.  Fair enough.   There was some over buying of inventory (same as literally every retailer) and the stock dropped.  Okay, that’s the not problem. \n\nThe problem would be if RC tries essentially nothing, fails and quickly jumps ship.   Reputation gone.  Game over and literally GME over too.  Magic gone forever.  Everything build up - track record, following- all gone for millions rather than billions.  These BBBY 60, 70, 80C’s were just a bs signaling of hubris and a supernatural return to record highs based on just showing up.   Yup, Papa Cohen got high on his own supply.  \n\nDoes that all really add up ?   Or …. ?\n\n\nOne more possibility.  My working thesis and why I entered this position at all.  I believe that in the next 10 days (possibly even 8/19) that the sale of buybuy Baby will be announced.   I think a deal has been reached.   That was always his play and it’s a legitimate one.  I don’t know the numbers or have inside info, it’s just what I think.    It makes a lot of sense.   RC is smart, strategic and sequential.   This filing is first, perception negative.  (Reality unknown). Sale announced, positive.   I honestly thought it could be a spin off, but this reads like a sale.  Just in time for the post-pandemic baby boom.  The jewel in the crown sold at the right time and mission accomplished.  Thank you, Papa. \n\nIncidentally (lol at Cramer), his filing (and potential sale, whether it happens or not) this pretty much guarantees dilution will NOT occur in the next 90 days.  Period.   Interm CEO stays for now, replaced thereafter.  Fresh start.   But honestly who cares about that ?  \n\nIf and when the sale of buybuy Baby is announced, the rocket ship takes off again and RC exits leaving cash in BBBY with the MOASS as a parting gift.  And on to the next one.  \n\nSome stories do have a happy end.   \n\nCalling all GME and AMC bros, you’re welcome to the BBBY happy ending, you degenerates.  \n\nConclusion : 🐳💎 🦍💪,  🐻🤡❌\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n\nIM STILL IN\n\nPlease upvote this comment for visibility.", "score": 776, "replies": [{"body": "One of the best posts I’ve seen on this sub period.
