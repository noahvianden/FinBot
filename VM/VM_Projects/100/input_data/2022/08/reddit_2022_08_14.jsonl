{"title": "Market jump after Fed rate hike is a ‘trap,’ Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson warns investors", "selftext": " [Morgan Stanley](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MS) is urging investors to resist putting their money to work in stocks despite the market’s post-Fed-decision jump.\n\nMike Wilson, the firm’s chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer, said he believes Wall Street’s excitement over [the idea that interest rate hikes may slow sooner than expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/fed-decision-july-2022-.html) is premature and problematic.\n\n“The market always rallies once the Fed stops hiking until the recession begins. … \\[But\\] it’s unlikely there’s going to be much of a gap this time between the end of the Fed hiking campaign and the recession,**″** he told CNBC’s “[Fast Money](https://www.cnbc.com/fast-money/)” on Wednesday. “Ultimately, this will be a trap.”\n\nAccording to Wilson, the most pressing issues are the effect the economic slowdown will have on corporate earnings and the risk of the Federal Reserve over-tightening.\n\n“The market has been a bit stronger than you would have thought given the growth signals have been consistently negative,” he said. “Even the bond market is now starting to buy into the fact that the Fed is probably going to go too far and drive us into recession.”\n\n## ‘Close to the end’\n\nWilson has a 3,900 year-end price target on the [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX), one of the lowest on Wall Street. That implies a [3% dip from Wednesday’s close](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/stock-futures-tick-up-ahead-of-key-fed-decision.html) and a 19% drop from the index’s closing high hit in January.\n\nHis forecast also includes a call for the market to take another leg lower before getting to the year-end target. Wilson is bracing for the S&P to fall below 3,636, the 52-week low hit last month.\n\n“We’re getting close to the end. I mean this bear market has been going on for a while,” Wilson said. “But the problem is it won’t quit, and we need to have that final move, and I don’t think the June low is the final move.”\n\nWilson believes the S&P 500 could fall as low as 3,000 in a 2022 recession scenario.\n\n“It’s really important to frame every investment in terms of ‘What is your upside versus your downside,’” he said. “You’re taking a lot of risk here to achieve whatever is left on the table. And, to me, that’s not investing.”\n\nWilson considers himself [conservatively positioned](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/04/bear-market-rally-setting-stage-for-correction-morgan-stanley-warns.html) — noting he’s underweight stocks and likes defensive plays including [health care](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLV), [REITs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IYR), [consumer staples](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLP) and [utilities](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLU). He also sees the merits of holding extra [cash](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DXY) and [bonds](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y) at the moment.\n\nAnd, he’s not in a rush to put money to work and has been “hanging out” until there are signs of a trough in stocks.\n\n“We’re trying to give them \\[clients\\] a good risk-reward. Right now, the risk-reward, I would say, is about 10 to one negative,” Wilson said. “It’s just not great.”", "id": "wodx1z", "created_utc": 1660503725.0, "score": 1333, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 311, "comments": [{"body": "Wow Morgan Stanley looking out for the little guy how nice of them to ask us not to buy stocks", "score": 1099, "replies": [{"body": "It’s for our own good!", "score": 321, "replies": [{"body": "They may even go an extra mile and buy the stocks to show us how it's done.

When it is clearly over I will cash out on the way down. Odds are you'll never time the bottom or the top correctly so try to play it wisely.\n\nMy thinking is that say you have 3,000 shares and you sell when it hits 80 and your out clean with $240k. Sounds awesome but it keeps climbing. Now it's at $250 a share, looking strong, and you could have been looking at $750k in your account and you FOMO back in for 1,000 shares (all of your money) but it tanks to $180 and now you're out $70k you had locked up already. Fuck. Well if you sell 1,000 shares instead at $80 and ride the rest through the peak (because you WILL NOT time it right) and through the $250 down to the $180 and sell your last 2000 shares you're now sitting on $440k. Yes, you could have more but you could have less and unless you have a crystal ball up your ass you won't play this perfectly. (End previous post)\n\nOnly risk what you're comfortable with. The benefit of shares is you don't have to lose 100% of your investment but the problem with a play like this is it gets very volatile so if you set a stop-loss just know it should be far below the current price.\n\nI also suggest not doing it if you are genuinely concerned about finances.

This means BBBY's price could fall by 20% and you would still be even.  This decreases your returns versus going all in, but also decreases your risk.\n\nFurther I would actually suggest thinking in percentages. In the example above I stated you should double your position. In actuality it would be better to take 10% of your ira and buy bbby. When it increases, you would buy another 10%.\n\n10% could be increased or decreased based on your risk tolerance and how the trade is going. The profit that is required before you add to the position can also be adjusted to help manage the risk.\n\nIf the price starts to drop and you begin losing sleep over it, then you could sell some of your shares to reduce your risk.\n\nGood luck everyone.\n\n845 bbby shares @ 13.65\n(3) Nov18 Call @ $15\n(1) Nov18 Call @ $10\nNote: Options contracts have no impact on bbby's price.
