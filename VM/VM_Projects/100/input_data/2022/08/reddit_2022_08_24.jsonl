The huge thing is their motherboards chip sockets span multiple generations so a lot of people will buy them over Intel just for the opportunity of upgrading way cheaper. \n\nGPU wise Nvidia is the king but Amd overtime has started to appear in their rear view mirror.

It doesn‚Äôt help that the GPU market will probably shrink a bit due to how many people have upgraded with the 3000 series and Rdna2. \n\nEven without all the bugs I don‚Äôt see a big market at all for the Arc380. In fact I think it is more or less a waste and a meaningless card. I think the bigger problem Intel will have is AMD + Nvidia one gen back might be pricing things lower destroying the market for an Intel card and possibly costing them a lot of money in the process.

{"title": "Ripple Effect :: Ford‚Äôs job cuts are just the beginning of another EV earthquake", "selftext": "Electric vehicles have far fewer moving parts in their drive trains than gas-powered vehicles. Fewer parts equate to simpler and faster assembly. EVs do have many thousands of batteries, but these are static and relatively reliable. As a result, car makers can build EVs with fewer workers on the line using more robots and automated processes.\n\nEVs require roughly 40% fewer hours of assembly time than gas-powered cars. Those types of efficiencies must translate into less jobs somewhere in the assembly process, which will ripple outward.\n\nModular designs + fewer parts = fewer jobs\n\nOne thing drivers love about EVs is that they rarely break down and if they do, they are relatively easy to fix. Unfortunately, this threatens jobs at auto dealership and auto repair shops, which collectively employed over 2 million workers in the United States alone in 2022, according the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Oil changes, tune-ups and most other forms of maintenance that dealers charge for will go away.\n\nAside from the battery replacing the complicated combustion engine, EVs have a different braking system that is longer-lived and less subject to wear and tear. McKinsey estimates a 40% decline in consumer aftermarket spending for EVs compared to ICE cars.

Either way, their cars are very expensive because the demand is so high, they could lower Model Y prices by $20,000 and still be as profitable as Ford's Mach E.\n\nThe quality survey is simply not true. Tesla scores the highest in every owner satisfaction survey and they rarely need maintenance.\n\nAnd they can't get their truck \"off the ground\" because demand for Model 3/Y is so high that they had to triple production in 2 years time just to keep order times below 1 year.

They have like 40% fewer parts, and the parts they have are much less complicated. About half the people or less will be needed on the assy line. Many more of the components are commodity type things like batteries and even motors, so more purchased parts vs in-house tech. There is no doubt Tesla has had a nice head start and will enjoy a bit of an advantage, at first. But the OEMs will catch up very quickly. They are not just going to compete against one or two companies, they will be competing against all of the companies, and every one has a target on Tesla. Maybe some will be mediocre or take time to get up to speed, but I guarantee at least a few are going to be world class. They have never seen anything like that. People think the established OEMs have actually been trying to compete w/ Tesla, that is a misunderstanding. They have been testing the waters and biding their time, waiting and learning. They don't have unlimited funds and they can't just carry unprofitable vehicles like Tesla did for so many years. They had no reason to b/c they own the current market and are milking it.

VW is also moving to the single-piece casting (even if it will take them almost a decade according to themselves). It saves hours from the production time, and the result is a cheaper and much stiffer body. It's one of the reasons why Tesla can build a Model Y in 10 hours where VW needs 30 for their ID4 in their most modern facility.\n\n> ... You will see their true effort in the next few years...\n\nBeen hearing this for almost a decade now. It simply doesn't work that way. Scaling production takes a lot of time. Even with the much simpler cars of the previous decade it took legacy OEMs decades to scale from low volumes to ~10M. On top of that, Giga China is the highest production car manufacturing plant in the world. The next biggest is VW's Wolfsburg with 800K. Tesla Fremont is third in the world and the largest in the US with 600K. Average plants are 200-300K. Tesla's Berlin and Texas plants are expected to do ~2M vehicles, and Tesla can build these factories in the time it takes VW to retool a plant and for less than twice the budget. There's no keeping up with that kind of ramp up speed and economies of scale for any of the legacy OEMs, not to mention how they need to completely redesign their factories and move everything inhouse to stay competitive.\n\n> The quality survey is absolutely true (Tesla ranks lowest on J.D.

It's highly flawed data and barely has anything to do with quality defects: https://youtu.be/EuG8mgdnshY?t=385\n\nEither way, it's definitely true that older Teslas like the ones that would be the majority of their cars in 2020 had more issues with small stuff like panel gaps. It make sense that Tesla would focus less on perfect quality when they already have up to a year worth of order times with their current quality. Until now and for a few years to come, Tesla should prioritise scaling faster over delivering perfect cars, as proven by them always being 1st in owner satisfaction. People don't care about a few minor issues as long as they can get their hands on a Tesla.\n\n> Elon would love to keep his several missed promises on that \"truck?\". He would, if he could. Every other OEM manages to develop and launch new vehicles on time even w/ existing production concerns. They would make much more bringing that truck forward even sacrificing existing sales to do it, and you know it.\n\nThis is simply not how Tesla works. They are way more agile than other OEMs and tend to focus on the biggest bottlenecks. For the past few years that was scaling Model 3 and Y up to meet demand. It would have made ZERO sense to waste resources on scaling Cybertruck when they could make more money simply scaling an existing and highly profitable product.\n\n> Tesla is innovating b/c they have to. It's a new product, a new technology, a new paradigm. ICE cars see incremental innovation b/c they are an established tech. OEMs know how to innovate and they will meet the challenges and innovate much faster into the new tech.\n\nThis shows a severe lack of understanding of Tesla as a company. If this were true, they wouldn't be innovating on things that have been established for decades. They wouldn't be innovating on safety when their cars already had the highest safety score possible. I could keep going.\n\n> ... But the OEMs will catch up very quickly ...\n\nWaiting for EVs to be further developed isn't gonna magically make them profitable for those who are not already working on them. VW and Ford have been working seriously on EVs for years, completely retooled factories to be the most high tech factories they have... and they're losing money on those cars while Tesla is making the highest margins in the market. And as long as they're making maybe 30-60 part changes per new model (roughly every 1.5-3 years) while Tesla is making 60 parts changes in a day, legacy OEMs are not going to catch up.\n\n> I'm in automotive, like my father was, my uncles, my brothers and most of my friends too.

This does not make me an expert by any means, but I do understand how 'the current vehicle market' works.\n\nIn that case you should realise how ground breaking the way Tesla works is. With routers allowing them to make changes, immediately ship them, and apply them to the main production line. With around 60 changes a day making it onto production vehicles.

That makes it an even bigger problem that companies like Ford and VW are losing money on their latest EVs though. How are they supposed to scale and catch up if they will lose money on each sale on top of needing ~200B to retool their factories (in VW's case, not sure how much it would cost for Ford).\n\n> Yes, all OEMs will benefit from the lower production costs of making EVs, but that is my point. Tesla has been enjoying this advantage and now the established OEMs will too. The prices will fall dramatically and quickly, is Tesla ready for this pricing pressure?

Tesla has gross margins of 30-32%, with the recent price changes going to 35% and the upcoming EV incentives it'll get to 40-45%. Meanwhile their waiting times are still 4-12 months. They could drop the Model Y price by $25,000 and still make more money from them than Ford does on the Mach E.

Will be great to read our discussion back in 5 years and see who was right.\n\nThat said, I fully believe that your experience in the industry is blinding you to the difficulties of scaling EV production compared to scaling existing ICE models, in the same way it has blinded the legacy OEMs and got them into this mess.\n\nA fun example is how I talked to someone a few years back when Tesla revealed their Semi, and this person had talked to someone working at DAF. This person mentioned how electric trucks would never work, because the battery heating was too big an issue and etc. etc. The person had decades of experience at DAF, and yet here we are just 2-3 years later with companies like Scania completely abandoning the idea of hydrogen semis and moving entirely to EVs as they believe it's clearly the future.\n\nMy point being, sometimes knowledge of an industry is a benefit, sometimes it's a blinder. There's a reason why companies like Nokia, Blackberry, Nikon, Blockbuster, etc. tend to disappear during times of disruption. It's not because the companies didn't have the capabilities to change, but because the people didn't realise in time that they had to and underestimated what was required.\n\n(ps. had to remove some of the quoting, since the post was over 10,000 characters :') )", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Clearly not, since they've all been having huge issues scaling EV manufacturing.

Ford has also decided to use two types of batteries, requiring different materials, and reached an agreement to buy battery packs from a Chinese company, CATL, the world‚Äôs largest producer.\n\nG.M. has said it has secured access to all the battery raw materials it needs to produce one million E.V.s in North America in 2025, and Ford says it has deals to provide 70 percent of the batteries it will need to make two million E.V.s a year by the end of 2026.\n\nBut how those companies and other automakers will obtain enough materials for an all-electric lineup remains unclear.\n\nAnother concern is the availability of charging stations. In most states, stations are few and far between, and vast parts of rural areas have none at all. Home charging stations can reduce the need for commercial chargers, but they can cost an E.V. owner $1,000 or more.\n\nTesla has built its own network of charging stations, although it must continue to expand it as it sells more cars. G.M., Ford and other automakers are working with companies including EVgo and Electrify America to develop charging networks. California‚Äôs network is the densest in the United States, but electric vehicle owners still complain about long waits to recharge.\"\n\nThese car companies can't innovate for shit.

[Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/08/18/ev-tax-credits-rebates-inflation-reduction-act-mass-climate-law)\n\nThe specific wording in the article that deals with manufacturing requirements in the IRA is below (sorry for the length):\n\n**Manufacturing Requirements**\n\nThe IRA aims to get more EVs on the road ‚Äî but not just any EVs. The goal is to build up a domestic supply chain for American-made EVs. To that end, the law establishes three new manufacturing requirements that car makers must meet if they want their EVs to be eligible for federal tax credits.\n\n**Made in North America**\n\nYou can only get a tax credit for a new car if its final assembly was done in the U.S., Canada or Mexico. This requirement ‚Äî which does not apply to used EVs ‚Äî went into effect as soon as Biden signed the law.\n\n**The source of battery minerals**\n\nThe law sets out gradually increasing standards for the percentage of battery minerals that must be extracted or processed domestically. Minerals that come from a country the U.S. has a free trade agreement with or that are recycled in North America count too. (More below on the challenges of determining this.)\n\nTo qualify, 40% of battery materials in cars made before 2024 must meet this standard. This rises to 50% for cars made in 2024 and continues to rise until it hits 80% in 2027.\n\nThe law also contains language stating qualifying vehicles produced after 2024 can‚Äôt have batteries containing critical minerals mined, processed or recycled in a ‚Äúforeign entity of concern.‚Äù As of now, there is no official list of countries, but China, which is where the majority of batteries are currently made, is widely expected to be on it.\n\n**Other battery components**\n\nThe law also establishes minimum standards for where battery components ‚Äî everything from wires to the metal paneling ‚Äî are manufactured or assembled.\n\nCars placed in service in 2022 or 2023 need at least 50% of the battery parts ‚Äî as measured by the value of these components ‚Äî to be manufactured or assembled in North America. This percentage rises to 60% for cars made in 2024 and 2025 and then climbs slowly to 100% by 2029.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Freekin Ford.  Always messing up something.

If you buy a good grinder, and pair it with a cheap, used, espresso machine off of ebay, you'll be able to make great espresso.\n\nWhat's going on inside a grinder is like black magic. It all basically looks the same on the outside, but the difference between a good grinder and an OK one can be night and day.\n\nIf you're buying a fancy espresso machine, then I'd recommend the Niche grinder. It's around $600, and you can pair it with a cheap Gaggia Classic for a few hundred more, or you can pair it with a fancy double boiler costing $2-3k and it'll more than hold its own.\n\nOnce you start talking about spending more than a couple grand on equipment, it's worth it to do some research, and hopefully try stuff out and see what you like. A lot of the difference between a $1k espresso machine and a $3k one is little quality of life improvements, how easy and consistent is it to use, not really how good the espresso is.\n\nAnd once you start to look at expensive grinders a lot of it ends up being personal preference for your \"workflow\". Do you want a grinder that you fill up with one bag of coffee and it grinds a certain amount on demand? Do you want one that you can try three different coffees back to back? Do you want to weigh your coffee before or after it's ground, etc.\n\nBut if you're just getting started, you really can't go wrong with the niche because if it doesn't work out for you, it's popular enough that you can sell it used and get back most of your money. And if you really catch a bad case of 'upgraded-itis' and keep buying a fancier and fancier machine, the niche will keep being a reliable choice even when you're spending way too much to make a little espresso.\n\nAnd whatever you do, don't skimp out on the coffee.
