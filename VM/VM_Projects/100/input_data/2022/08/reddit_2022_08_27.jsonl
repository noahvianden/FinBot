Moreover, there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. **While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation.** But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain\"\n\n\"**We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent**.

Here’s something you should look at - not financial advice. \n\nYou have 100 shares of $msft (options contracts are in shares of 100). $msft closed at $268 on Friday. \n\nWhen the market opens you could buy a Put contact for the right to sell 100 shares of $msft at a set strike price. The options contract will list the per share price so multiply by 100.\n\nMy recommendation if your worried about retaining profit would be to use a put contract like insurance. \n\nYou could buy a put for Jan 20, 2023 (all options contracts have an expiration date, you can exercise anytime until then unless you buy a European option but you won’t cuz ‘Murica) with a strike of say $250.\n\nThat means that anytime between now and Jan of 23 you can sell your 100 shares for $250 per share.

You should be able to figure out how to protect some of your profits. Or - you’ll realize that it’s too expensive to do so and you make a decision about selling or holding the underlying shares. \n\nUnfortunately, everyone and their mom thinks shares are going down so the premium for an options context at or near “the money” (near the current trading price) will probably cost so much money your profit will evaporate in contract costs. \n\nThe options contract itself has intrinsic value and if the market is liquid enough you can sell your contract back to the market before it expires to either recoup losses on the premium (if the price goes up) or to make a tidy profit if the price goes down. \n\nPeople talk a lot about options trading to make money but it’s VERY hard. You have to guess the market direction correctly, AND time the market correctly, AND you have to have cash or share to exercise the contract OR the options market has to be liquid enough to sell into it. \n\nIf you don’t have a round number of shares (increments of 100) using the put contract as a form of insurance isn’t realistic. \n\nThat’s how an options contract could be favorable to you, this is NOT financial advice.

{"title": "This is NOT a drill, Circuit Breaker Monday is coming 🚨🚨🚨", "selftext": "What’s up my fellow regards!\n\nI wanted to share some insights on where the market is headed for the next few weeks. \n\nWe all experienced the amazing (horrible to some) rhetoric of JPOW who finally and unanimously flipped the script on PermaBulls throughout the country that we are NOT going to pivot, pause, or bat an eye until inflation is clearly heading towards the benchmark 2% they’ve outlined for months (and yet the market wouldn’t believe). \n\nSince the June Low of ~3630 when the SP was trading at at 16.1 P/E, we had a magnificent bear market rally to 4320 primarily led by three things: Misinterpretation of JPOW at the July FOMC using the word “neutral” and hinting that there could be cuts at some point. Market took this and ran with it that cuts would be here by 2023 (lmao). Next, hedge funds started realizing they were behind the curve on the rally and began covering their shorts and chasing the rally so they don’t get a broom up their ass for being down another 20% on the year. Finally, the CPI coming in slightly lower (a whopping .2% below estimate) ignited a fervor of “peak inflation” and again drove into the mania that we hit a bottom, the fed would pivot, and there was no recession. Adding to this, we saw another wave of Meme Euphoria led by retail which has a 100% batting average of marking the top since Jan 2021. (Congrats to BBBY buyers smart enough to sell and enjoy the bags to those who are still hoping for round 2 —it’s not coming). \n\nSo what’s next? JPOW laid the hammer down on Friday with his concise and resolute rhetoric that there is PAIN ahead for the markets and that they will not stop until inflation is meaningfully coming down which will take months or years, not weeks. Anyone who has ears realized very quickly that this meant Risk Off and that the market was completely out of balance. As of Friday close near $4040, we’re closer to a 17.3 P/E which is still extremely expensive and unheard of during a recession (which is inevitably coming, don’t kid yourselves). No market has bottomed without hitting 13-14 P/E which would put us closer to $2800-3200. \n\nMy expectation is that we’re just getting started with the third and final wave down of this bear market and if you didn’t know, the third wave is typically the steepest and fastest descent of all the waves. I believe this is due to the psychology that traders know where the bottom is ($3630) and will want to get out before we retest those levels. Smart money is getting the fuck out and going short while some bulls are still buying calls and trying to catch a falling knife. The capitulation of Retail and the entire market will come soon and I suspect it could be as soon as Monday. I’m calling for -2-3% futures Sunday evening and a Circuit Breaker Monday. I expect we fall 5-10%+ in the coming weeks before we consolidate near the June bottom. If that falls, look out below! I do think we see our true bottom in September-early November before we slowly start creeping back up. We won’t see $4800 again until 2024. \n\nGood luck to all and I hope you bought Puts over the weekend! Please for the love of God don’t sell Naked Puts.\n\nEdited there for grammar queens\n\nEdit 2: Futes down -1.2% at 515 CST\n\nEdit 3 Futes down -1.6% at 730 CST", "id": "wz640v", "created_utc": 1661615352.0, "score": 146, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 239, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|1043|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wz640v)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wz640v)\n    \nHey /u/StayingInTheMoney101, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wait... didn't Circuit City already go out of business?", "score": 89, "replies": [{"body": "No, that was The Good Guys", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I think a handful of them have a burger place now.

{"title": "Why the Fed can't solve inflation, and will actually make it worse", "selftext": "Hello fellow retards! Lets jump right into it  \n\n\n**Why the Fed can't solve inflation**  \n\n\nThe current theory on inflation goes something like this:  \n1. Money printer go brrr  \n2. More money but same stuff  \n3. Stuff price go higher  \n4. Money printer not go brrr anymore  \n5. Stuff price not go higher (note: price never come down)  \n\n\nAnd most folks here think the fed doing step 4 will solve inflation.  \n\n\nBut I beg to differ.  \n\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.bls.gov\\/news.release\\/pdf\\/cpi.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/tghilwkshbk91.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=99b554fa36d7262b1bb0b4c0e6232d5fc2ad96b1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee, the price rise is not actually due to demand rising. The biggest components of inflation are energy and food. And stimmys didn't actually cause people to start eating 20 hamburgers and drink gasoline everyday.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.statista.com\\/statistics\\/271823\\/daily-global-crude-oil-demand-since-2006\\/](https://preview.redd.it/arqldzw4ibk91.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e7e3e203b1cc149c38c193041954b9af5d4439)\n\n  \nIt's actually the supply  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/yearbook.enerdata.net\\/crude-oil\\/world-production-statistics.html](https://preview.redd.it/k4pyauesibk91.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a656180fa9d3036a747c9fb3f76a00437ba233)\n\nGlobal crude oil production fell by 7.5% in 2020 and is basically the same as 2012, yet the demand is up 10% in the same time period.  \n\n\nUnless JPow can also print oil, the only way to solve oil prices is to \"drill, baby, drill\", which goes opposite to the current administration's priorities  \n\n\n**Why the Fed will actually make inflation worse**\n\nWhat happens when prices of any commodity goes up:  \n\n\n1. Company makes 10 units of commodity and sells for $30 each\n2. Price rises to $100\n3. Company gets greedy\n4. Company doubles output\n5. Extra supply enters market\n6. Prices go down back to $30\n\nSo step 4 by companies is actually what controls prices. Making it easy for companies to do this is perhaps the best way to solve inflation.  \n\n\n*Yet Fed's actions will have the opposite effect.*\n\nOil exploration and production is actually a high-risk, high-reward business. Companies pump in millions of dollars in buying land and equipment to survey that land. Often they dont find meaningful quantity/quality of oil there. When they do, they now have to invest hundreds of millions to even billions in creating the infrastructure to actually get that oil into the market - rigs, pipelines etc.  \n\n\nOil companies have to spend billions before a single drop of oil is produced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important raw material to produce oil is actually capital.  \n\n\nAnd Fed raising rates makes it harder to get.  \n\n\nThis is likely to create a feedback loop of more prices, leading to higher rates, leading to less investment in expanding supply, leading to more prices, leading to....  \n\n\nTL;DR: Buy long term LEAP puts, probably March 2024", "id": "wzdk4r", "created_utc": 1661634481.0, "score": 88, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wzdk4r)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wzdk4r)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You make the perfect case to buy oil related shares/calls and then you decide to go full retard and recomend puts…", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, this reads like someone who doesn’t know economics.

The central bank agrees to loan you the money,  but you have to pay back the loan with 2 dollars of intrest.  The trick is, that the central bank is the only source to get the money, and only 10 dollars of money exists in the system. So then you ask the central bank for another loan, but this time you ask for 24 dollars. 12 to pay back the loan, and then the 10 you still need to function in the system.  Then you go back to the central bank and have to ask them for 36 bucks, but this time you cant pay the loan back in full, because now the system needs 12 dolalrs to work. So you pay 22 back on the portion of the loan, an you keep the 12 that you need to function in the system, while carrying over that additional 2 dollars of debt, making you 4 dollars in the hole.  And again and again, over and over. You keep borrowing but the amount of money you need to pay back the loan is always less than the amount of money that \"exists\" in the system. It's never enough to ever fully pack back the loan. \n\n This is how the system works. We will *never* get out of debt using this system because the system itself is just a debt machine.

Clearly those hikes didnt work.  \n\n\n\"The issue was that the US specifically disincentivized US producers and importers. Ronald Reagan signed an Executive Order in January of 1981 to eliminate oil price controls and then removed Jimmy Carter’s idiotic Windfall Profits Tax a few years later. As expected, global production expanded rapidly and with the removal of price controls, that production flooded into the US. By the middle of the decade, despite repeated production cuts by OPEC, there was a global glut of oil and by 1985, oil had collapsed all the way to $7. It wasn’t interest rates that made oil decline, it was government policy on the deregulation side, along with rapid production increases from non-OPEC countries.  \n\\-President Reagan’s Economic Recovery Tax Act was signed into law in August of 1981, designed to reduce tax rates and incentivize investment by rewarding risk-taking by businesses. In particular, the Accelerated Cost Recovery System served to accelerate depreciation, reducing taxes for those that invested in productive capacity. Once again, government policy, not interest rates led to an increase in investment and ultimately supply, helping to tame inflation.  \n\\-It wasn’t just Reagan working on de-regulation; The Staggers Act of October 1980, deregulated the railroads, The Motor Carrier Act of July 1980, deregulated the trucking industry, and the Airline Deregulation Act of October 1978 effectively deregulated transport industries. The net effect was dramatic price competition, better ability to invest and innovate, and the ability to eliminate unprofitable business that was funded by profitable business. Almost immediately after passage, pricing for transport services collapsed and the ease of transporting goods expanded.\"  \n\n\nSource: https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2022/06/13/volcker-and-inflation/", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "And then everything fell apart for like a decade.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Fee can never do a Volcker anymore, too much debt, trade deficit too high.

{"title": "Bonfire (Sale) Of The Vanities (VSCO: Victoria's Secret & Co.) 🚀🚀", "selftext": "# Intro:\n\n1. Intro\n2. Trends\n3. Who Gives a Shit\n4. I Want Money\n5. VSCO (Bullish)\n6. VSCO (Bearish)\n7. Entry, Positions, and TA\n\nThis post is going to be bullish on VSCO; Victoria's Secret & Co. While we are all aware of the power of Becky during booms, we need to look at her counterpart Vicky during busts. Who is Vicky you ask? The swath of women caught up in slowing economic times looking to pair up and bed down with a mate during these economic winters. She's not going to college, she isn't reading a book in the park, she isn't trying on sensible cute outfits. She's showing off what God gave her and waiting for you to buy her a drink and cut to the chase by telling her what you can do for her. She isn't waiting for Mr. Right to bump into her outside of a Starbucks and have a meet-cute. She is toxic femininity leaving the bodies of men in her wake as she walks across them in all different types of stiletto's and goth boots that they probably paid for. She's making drag queens jealous with her over the top super-bitch magnetism. She is the physical embodiment of 80's hair metal electric guitar intro-riff, and she is here to rock your fucking world.\n\nFirst, this post may be starting off as a crude misogynistic take on \"modern ***dating\"*** and my username probably makes you think I'm some ultra douche-bag, but my intent is to bring to light the historical effects that economic hardship has on women and how we can profit on it, or at least weather the storm as the destroying dollar made equities only go up, and recession will make them go down. The counterpart version of this DD would be examining why penis pills, toupees, and giant pick-up trucks sell so well in recessions. Male spending gets fucking weird, unpredictable, and comical. Unfortunately, it's that unpredictable nature that makes it hard to trend and predict.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ 2008 Ford Pick-up. It takes up the entire runway and makes the bushes look like grass! ](https://preview.redd.it/sqyrz649dck91.jpg?width=4288&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=911ff1f0d9551febc6be5cf0138c8adf63368998)\n\nTruth is, I am just being pragmatic investor with a non-biased situational awareness of modern society. Also, just because I call out women's instincts and nature and predictability, and treat them as equal, doesn't mean I hate them. Quite the opposite! I am in awe of the mysterious majestic complex savage beautiful animal they are (see gif related). All of my love ladies!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Let's just say, I lost it in the divorce.](https://i.redd.it/cyrxs200fck91.gif)\n\n# Trends:\n\nThe world was shocked when Revlon seemed to rocket into space after their earnings report, and it got me looking at both tickers. (Rev DD to follow?) It seems that the time is finally here to bring out an \"ol' reliable\" that has repeatedly and predictably dropped in and out of society with every boom and bust cycle. A little known trend that we can ride into the atmosphere as a solid and time-tested hedge towards recession. On top of that, there are a few more booster rockets and factors strapped to the industry that can have some long-term growth potential continuing past this economic turmoil and shake-up.\n\nSo, let's kick it off with this:\n\n[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology - Boosting Beauty in an Economic Decline: Mating, Spending, and the Lipstick Effect](https://personal.tcu.edu/sehill/LipstickEffectMS20March2012.pdf)\n\nThis paper is from 2012, but it is not outdated. It discusses the historical effects on the spending habits of women during the recession, depression, world wars, and the reality of existing relationships and courting during these time periods. Here is an excerpt that sums up the thesis: \"An economic recession may signal that financially stable men are becoming scarce.\" Hitting close to home here chief?\n\nIt also states that Men's preferences in a mate lean more towards attractiveness (This is why my 🌈 bros are so fit and hunky. They know what men like!) The demand for women to compete among each other for physical beauty intensifies as they struggle to find the rare elusive \"High-Quality Male\". That's the research paper's words, not mine. I would just say \"Dr. Job Not-Regarded\" or \"Mr. Clean Ninetafive\". It also states, unsurprisingly, that women spend a significant amount of time enhancing their appearance for their own ego boost. All in all, looking good and sexy leads to feeling good about yourself, and has little to do with men. Which may be why they have 🌈 guys design all their clothes, and it's why she isn't responding to your DM.\n\nThe paper goes on to justify itself by looking at the 5% increase on cosmetics during the great depression, and the shift in priorities during spending, and other times of hardship. It is a messy bit of math and trying to put numbers to old data in order to validate the theory of \"The Lipstick Effect\". This is a term that Wikipedia defines as:\n\n*The* ***lipstick effect*** *is the theory that when facing an* [*economic crisis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis) *consumers will be more willing to buy less costly* [*luxury goods*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_goods)*.*[*\\[1\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_effect#cite_note-1) *Instead of buying expensive fur coats, for example, people will buy expensive* [*lipstick*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick)*.*[*\\[2\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_effect#cite_note-2) *The underlying assumption is that consumers will buy luxury goods even if there is a crisis. When consumer trust in the economy is dwindling, consumers will buy goods that have less impact on their available funds. Outside the cosmetics market, consumers could be tempted by expensive beer or smaller, less costly gadgets*[.](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mansplaining&ia=definition&iax=about)\n\n# WHO GIVES A SHIT:\n\nWhat is indirectly proved is an increase in spending on cosmetics to look good. Without a doubt, in this modern era of selfies, Instagram, Bumble, Tinder, and Craiglist, there has almost NEVER been a more competitive market for women's dating. The Cell Phone has created an all you can eat pussy buffet and COVID has slingshot the amount of women looking to hurry-up and pair-up and wife-up into the marketplace after losing 3 years of courtship, dinner, laughing, travelling, and baby-making. Even women IRL are competing with their boyfriends over online THOTs getting paid to wear heavy makeup, play video games or workout with a camera on, or just have big boobs and a skinny waist while they lip sync a joke written by an ugly funny clinically depressed man. Fuck, even some anime cartoons are winning the war on continuing the human race. Despite the 50/50 split between the population of sexes on planet earth, women will need to compete harder as men exit the marketplace. If it just so happens that you are a woman reading this and thinking \"I don't relate to this. I don't have any problem meeting guys!\"; That's great babe, but this is mostly about the women keeping in-demand males through an increase of upkeep. Um... give me a call?\n\nMen, Bumble charging you more for swipes and shit is just a psyops convincing you of artificial scarcity. They know that if you can't initiate a conversation with a women in the wild, you'll be easy to take advantage of and pay up. As a confident adaptable man, my very mild rant ends here and this is where it should end. I think everyone already gets it, and there is nothing wrong with a healthy open conversation about the reality of ***how it be***. Nobody wants Incel bullshit comments, and that goes for you ladies as well.\n\n# I WANT MONEY:\n\nThis brings us to three important things going forward that will need to be acknowledged:\n\n1. Accept that we are in a recession even though unemployment (statistics) are down. If you think the economy is booming and better than it has ever been, you must be morbidly obese and never go outside. People are having a hard time and as inflation comes down, real unemployment goes up as a fundamental, and there is no true statistic that you will ever get from the labor department about how bad it truly is, because they have been changing definitions of unemployment pushing goal posts for so long it is a worthless metric. It is similar to how they changed the definition of recession, but do that every year since George W. Bush.\n2. **You**th virginity is up, marriages are down; and it isn't just about getting rocks off. Single mothers ( [Click for depression](https://singlemotherguide.com/single-mother-statistics/)) , women deep in debt and suffering food insecurity, and other factors sadly lead to pairing up as a matter of survival. Being married is incentivized by the government (one example) because our system is designed to have 2-person partnerships and it greatly reduces the number of people from being dependent on the system. The system and life in general is designed so partnered people have an easier time. The chaotic dance of scrambling for high quality partners in our petri dish intensifies magnitudes when fear of uncertainty begins looming.\n3. The current technology we have created has surpassed mankind's maturity. We are a bunch of monkey's with apps on our phone that let us fuck each other silly and tickle our reptilian brain. Doesn't matter how smart you are, you haven't overcome billions of years of evolution *\\*Elon\\_Musk.JPEG\\**. The natural order of breeding has been replaced with the sex marketplace of Tinder just like the natural order of hunting for food has been replaced by the supermarket. The sooner you get over it, the better.\n\nIf any of these 3 points are in juxtaposition with your world views, this isn't the DD for you. I like to live in fantasy land too, but I only make fantasy money in there so... here I am.\n\n# VSCO (Bullish)\n\nVSCO came out of IPO like an ugly girl in a romantic comedy that takes off her glasses. It stamped an all time high of $**74.77** ON August 13th, and continued to decline and decline to $**26.14** on June 13th, of 2022. A month before in April, the company reported a **loss of 4.5%** for the year. Since then it has made a rough and valiant effort to come back into a sub-median range of about $49.47.\n\n$74.77 -> $26.14 -> $49.47\n\nWhat is happening? Why the turn around? Well...\n\n>*\"Victoria’s Secret* ***& Co***\\*. *has announced a new* ***streamlined corporate leadership structure*** *that will unite the company’s three lines of business, Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Beauty, into a single organization.\\*Amy Hauk, who has been CEO of Pink since 2018, will take on the additional role of CEO for Victoria’s Secret, and the brands’ merchandising, planning, marketing and creative teams will be integrated, the company said.Martin Waters will remain CEO of the parent company.\" \\[1\\]*\n\nPart of this re-structuring includes letting heads roll and cutting staff, **as you do** in lowering inflation and on-coming recession:\n\n>*about 160 management roles, or about 5% of home office headcount, the company said. It will also provide for reinvestment in non-leadership roles, according to the company.Victoria’s Secret & Co. said it expects these decisions to “result in an estimated* ***$40 million cost reduction*** *in the run rate of the business on an annualized basis beginning in third quarter of fiscal 2022.” \\[1\\]*\n\nSo far it seems like the new CEO has really hit the ground running. She is leading Victoria's Secret \"Brand Revolution\", and she seems very fit in this position. She was in a leadership role at Bath & Body Works in 2008, and worked up to vice president in 2012. Also at GAP, and Disney. Part of her biggest ~~challenge~~ opportunity is combining Victoria's Secret with PinkTM and BeautyTM to create a three-headed [Ghidorah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Ghidorah) of fast paced fashion savvy first to market monster. If you are clever you'd notice that I've bolded \"**& Co\"** every time. Bullish.\n\nSome of the things she is doing include: opening up new stores, finding new test locations, re-modelling the traditional look for a more expansive and relateable product selection, closing down losing stores, expanding to include \"mannequins of different body types\" (Finally), becoming a more modern and eclectic yet agile retailer of women's beauty products and lingerie. She is breathing life into the company with \"stores of the future\" concept which seems to be an experimental concept shopping experience that your date/girlfriend/wife will definitely want to go to.\n\n>*Victoria’s Secret* ***& Co*** *had 867 stores in North America at the end of the first quarter. That is down from 1,143 in 2018, but 94% of stores are cash flow positive. \\[2\\]*\n\nAnother pick of the litter hired is Christine Rupp\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Here she is at what I assume to be a work function.  She is in the back.](https://preview.redd.it/pazgq40edck91.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83d22377731e44e30703c029afbd31d02bd4f85e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChristine (Chris to her friends) Rupp, who had previously worked at Amazon and helped launch Prime Day is the chief customer officer. 30 years experience, digital transformation specialist... Why is it a great pick? Because she is an expert in the tech-tonic shift in retail/online hybrid marketplaces, and has the professional connections from previous marketing jobs.\n\nDrum roll.... 🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁\n\n>***Victoria's Secret*** [***announced in May***](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2022/05/amazon-victorias-secret-pink-beauty-products.html) ***that it would for the first time sell some of its products, select items from Victoria’s Secret Beauty and Pink Beauty, on Amazon.***\n\nSounds like Victoria's Secret is positioning itself as a try-before-buy retail store piggybacking on Amazons distribution ability! Using the online sales as teasers to get you into the store to see the more exotic selection. How forward thinking!\n\nThis sort of agility, distribution, market cornering, overhead-trimming, and safe experimental expansion is exactly what this company needs to take on the world of tomorrow. You may think this Amazon partnership is big, and it is, but you really need to see and understand the even bigger picture. The future of the trillion dollar industry that is \"make women pretty\" will NEVER stop selling their products. In fact, it will only ramp up as more women take back their feminine powers of seduction and use it to their advantage. They can make more money off a tweet than you do all month, maybe all year. You want a slice of that? You want a cut every time they powder their nose and turn the webcam on? You want to pimp these pimpettes? VSCO is your ticket. Going into the colder months, us as animals will begin our evolutionary imperative to bed down for the winter, so expect this next next quarter to reflect the lipstick effect. This quarters earnings we will see how hot-girl summer did. I'm optimistic, but cautious. However, the sexual marketplace is now changed forever. The competition and \"price of entry\" is now so high and low respectively, and will CONTINUE for the foreseen future.\n\n[Victoria’s Secret unveils new corporate leadership structure](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/victoria-s-secret-co-unveils-new-corporate-leadership-structure-271657659120?siteid=yhoof2) \\[1\\] (Is there a more Bullish Headline?)\n\n[Victoria's Secret testing new locations, new look for stores](https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2021/07/20/victorias-secret-testing-new-locations-new-look.html) \\[2\\]\n\n[Amazon to sell Victoria's Secret and Pink products](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2022/05/amazon-victorias-secret-pink-beauty-products.html) \\[3\\]\n\n*Pumping this stock with articles is ironic because of the amount of times their articles have pumped 15 year old me.*\n\n# VSCO (Bearish)\n\nNow, no DD is complete without including some downsides. Only scammers won't admit the downsides to a stock they are eyeing. VSCO is currently handling a bit of a crisis with a debt to equity ration of 15.20. Now, for a growth company a high ratio is to be expected, but indeed it sucks. Compared to Revlon's -2.07 ratio.\n\n[Debt/Equity Ration (High means bad)](https://preview.redd.it/comlzj1k5ti91.png?width=1414&format=png&auto=webp&s=e99fd8d2ce90ba2a6277f30851852f2a5fa79737)\n\nDepending on who you ask, high debt is good in time of inflation, low interest rates, and growth. However, VSCO will be increasing their sales and revenue according to the above thesis, and the CEO is aware that in order to continue success, it needs to change quickly and knows that REV's earning are a early sign that things are looking up. Currently, [their interest rate on their debt is 1.85% Which is smack dab average among competitors.](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/EffectiveInterestRate/NYSE:VSCO/Effective%252BInterest%252BRate%252Bon%252BDebt/) You can see that it has had two quarters of steady decline. (What Reebok doin?)\n\nSo yes, the stock is climbing from it's lows. The numbers and financials seem to be typical of any IPO stock that is re-investing in itself and picking the right people to lead the charge to take advantage of the new scene. You can say \"Slut, that's pretty shitty dawg. I'm going to wait until they pay off their debt.\" Well, it's long-term debt that is rising slower than the rate raises, which means that part of it must be locked at a set amount. Also, if you want to know the secret to making money, you buy low and sell high.\n\nIf you want to wait, it'll be too late. I get it though. You deserve that stock that has perfect numbers, high growth potential, AND is undervalued and secret and no one knows about. All the most successful investors I know choose to wait until a company completely turns around to invest and have no recession proof hedging assets **/S.** Like I say all the time to women, lower your standards just a few inches please. There are competitors that sell similar products as the **& Co** portion of VSCO which will also benefits from the thesis. They sell Church-approved makeup and lotions and clothes, but me?... I want the most Slut-tastic one. I want that fucking sizzlin' hot fajita full-throttle adrenaline blood-rush product. The kind of thing that will hook a man and reel him in.\n\n# Entry, Positions, and TA:\n\nEdit: The following was written 2 weeks ago (been waiting to post ), and has aged like wine. Earnings saw a sharp drop and an even sharper rejection. Lovin' it.:\n\n>Been flipping big positions since REV shot up in June. Currently as of this second, I only have 10 shares, at an equity of $398.50. I expect the market to be bearish for the Jackson Hole meeting, where they will decide to doing anything BUT digitally delete the money they flooded into every part of the market except my wallet.I plan to buy a good healthy percent of my portfolio after, and because this is a **recession hedge for now**, options are not being highly balls-to-the-wall advised simply because the stock is mildly volatile and has higher IV than I would like, reaching it's mid-level cooling, and my (awful) technical analysis is showing a smoothing wedge or possibly a 3 month cup and handle (see pic related). Either way, a little now, a lot later is my plan. [Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ibk72igueti91.png?width=1653&format=png&auto=webp&s=3159cbbe977290d4fd32246504f69becd630eb95) If it is a cup and handle, feel free to get yourself some call options out to early December and January. I'm expecting a heavy earnings run-up which is on August 24th followed by an IV crush, and I will evaluate strike at that time. More than likely it will crash into the cup's handle, and then climb from there. I have set dates based on events, but if anyone would like to take a shot at really analyzing this chart be my guest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Edit: Updated chart showing what I expected.  Monday, we ride!](https://preview.redd.it/0mau4xchdck91.png?width=1677&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf05b61b75809955e04a33e5d8249e62b93cd50)\n\nVSCO has a P/E of 6.621 as of writing, and I am shooting for a P/E of \\~10 which would bring it to \\~51.28 in the near term as the pain starts. HOWEVER, with the growth and restructuring, I am expecting a heavy amount of speculation Jet-fuel to get poured into the rocket which could really lift the P/E to something outrageous, and the stock along with it, but that isn't what this DD is about.\n\nVSCO has a SI% of: 8.4% according to [Market Beat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/VSCO/short-interest/) (I don't know what equation is being used here.
