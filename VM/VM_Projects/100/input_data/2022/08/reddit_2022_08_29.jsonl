If you use 50 delta, you have a 50% chance. If you use 25 delta, you have a 25% chance. If you se 75 delta, you have a 75% chance.\n\nFor going long, the most common delta to shoot for is 50 delta, which is the ATM strike. This is because you get the full benefit of the upside potential (as well as the downside, but that's how risk/reward works).  If you go to a lower strike (which is lower delta on a call and OTM), you are lowering your probability, but also lowering your cost. If you go to a higher strike (which is higher delta on a call and ITM), you are raising your probability, but also your cost. So 50 delta is a compromise between probability of ITM and initial cost.\n\nDelta also benefits you in terms of gain per $1 move of the underlying. If you go for 50 delta, you make $.50 per dollar (until delta changes).

Over time you go deep ITM on each side for awhile, but as long as you keep rolling (up/down/out) and receive a net credit, you are lowering cost basis (and making money). TSLA is a great stock to trade because it has decently high IV and the liquidity is superb. In three years of trading covered strangles, I have never been assigned on either side (call or put), even when deep in the money. There is almost always lots of excess premium no matter how few days to expiration and no dividends, so hard to get assigned if you actively manage and don’t wait until an hour before expiration. (Not that I would mind getting assigned, I just want to avoid a large capital gain tax.) In the beginning I was anxious to close options quickly when I made 20-25% (scalping), but now I usually just treat the covered strangle as an endless rolling trade, to generate income and hold onto the shares as long as possible. I’m obviously bullish on TSLA, but I like selling the call as well as the put to protect the downside a bit, and I also skew strangles depending on my short term view, and occasionally I sell extra calls to buy some OTM puts when I’m worried about a price drop.

But before SpaceX there was never a successful private space company, and it's making it look like colonizing Mars is an actual possibility. Extending humanity to another planet was some kind of sci-fi dream not too long ago.\n\nAnd that's ignoring the amazing success they've had with the Falcon 9. The rocket first launched in 2010, and now it's arguably the best rocket that's ever flown. They're launching more payload to orbit than the *rest of the world* combined. And they're launching it cheaper. SpaceX right now owns more of the satellites in orbit than the rest of the world combined. And I believe that SpaceX has launched a majority of the satellites that have *ever been launched in history*. \n\nThe Falcon 9 (and Heavy) are so far ahead of every other rocket, that barely anyone even has plans to develop anything comparable. It seems like most governments have just given up trying to compete, and it's mostly down to a couple startups that are trying to make another rocket with a reusable booster.\n\nBut SpaceX isn't just sitting on their massive technical and operational lead. They're developing a much bigger, much more advanced and capable rocket that will make their current rockets obsolete. The first Raptor engine had a test flight [three years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYb3bfA6_sQ) and now they're getting ready to do an orbital flight, hopefully in the next few months.

That’s an experience I think everyone man or woman should have at least the option to experience whether it’s 20 years from now or even 40+ years from now.\n\n🤣\n...\n\n>Having only one type of automotive option would cause life to stagnant and become bland.

{"title": "The Biggest Short: Why $AAPL Is An Overvalued Company in Decline", "selftext": "Warning: long post with a lot of numbers and sources ahead, there is a tl;dr at the end.\n\nWhile everyone is focused on GME, BBBY, AMC, or whatever else is being pump and dumped on you guys on a weekly basis, I think one meme stock is flying under the radar: Apple. Unlike the three stocks I mentioned above, Apple actually has positive earnings on a yearly basis. However, Apple’s valuation has gone past the point of insanity to the point of mass delusion.\n\nA lot of people treat Apple like it’s the same company it was in 2018. At the end of 2018, Apple was trading at:\n\n>P/E (Price to Earnings): 12.5  \n>  \n>P/S (Price to Sales): 2.9  \n>  \n>P/B (Price to Book): 6.1  \n>  \n>P/FCF (Price to Free Cash Flow): 11.9  \n>  \n>D/E (Debt to Equity): .8  \n>  \n>Cash + current marketable securities: $86.4B  \n>  \n>Long term debt: $93B  \n>  \n>TTM (Trailing 12 month) Revenue: $261.6B  \n>  \n>TTM Earnings: $59.4B\n\nCurrently, even after a 7-8% drop from the recent high, Apple is valued at:\n\n>P/E: 27 (**+116%** since 2018)  \n>  \n>P/S: 7 (**+141%** since 2018)  \n>  \n>P/B: 45.3 (**+643%** since 2018)  \n>  \n>P/FCF: 25 (**+110%** since 2018)  \n>  \n>D/E: 1.6 (**+100%** since 2018)  \n>  \n>Cash + current marketable securities: $48.2B (**-44%** since 2018)  \n>  \n>Long term debt: $94.7B (**+1.8%** since 2018)  \n>  \n>TTM Revenue: $387.5B (**+48%** since 2018)  \n>  \n>TTM Earnings: $99.6B (**+68%** since 2018)\n\nIn their last earnings report, their revenue was only **up** **1.87%** year over year, while earnings were **down 10.6%** in that same time period. This is a company that is in decline, yet their valuation multiples have greatly expanded, cash has decreased, and debt has greatly increased as well. On top of all this, because they bought corporate bonds and treasuries at the top (around $200B worth), as rates have gone up, they now have **$9.3B** in unrealized losses on their portfolio, something that would make anyone reading this jealous. If rates keep going higher, and the Fed has given us no indication of a pivot, the losses will continue to grow.\n\nApple has burned through **44%** of their cash since 2018, but their long term debt level has stayed the same. Their debt to equity has doubled in that same time period. Debt to equity going higher is kind of like increasing the margin utilization in your portfolio. It works well on the way up, but on the way down, these types of debt levels can really weigh down on their business.\n\nThe reason for this increase in debt? Buybacks. As of the end of last year, Apple has dumped [$274.5B](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/04/28/apple-extends-share-buybacks-by-90b-raises-dividends-by-10)into share buybacks since 2012. Taking into account their buybacks from the last two quarters ($62B and $65B respectively), that number explodes to **$401.5B in share buybacks since 2012**. \n\nApple [raised their prices](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/01/apple-increases-prices-in-japan-by-25-percent/) in Japan by up to 25% and immediately saw a revenue drop of **17.4%** in that region. With the way that the dollar is appreciating compared to the yuan, it is inevitable that Apple will raise prices in China as well. With the Fed tightening while the PBOC continues loosening, there is no end in sight for the devaluation of the yuan. China made up **17.6%** of Apple’s revenue in the last quarter. If the Chinese revenue has a significant decrease, which is looking likely due to their [economic troubles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-28/china-s-growth-prospects-weaken-as-economists-cut-2023-forecasts), Apple’s revenue and earnings will drop even more.\n\nEveryone thinks Apple is a strong company but if you look below the surface, the situation isn’t as strong as anyone thinks. Their future products and revenue streams show a sense of desperation to me. They apparently have a VR/AR headset being announced allegedly in January 2023. Sounds great, but it’s expected to be [over $2,000](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks), with a cheaper one not coming out for years after. I can’t see them selling a lot of $2,000 niche products while heading into a recession, but maybe I’m wrong.\n\nAnother product they allegedly have coming is the Apple Car. This thing is faker than the Cybertruck. First of all, they’ve been working on it since [2014](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/07/2014-to-2021-apple-car-has-already-been-six-years-in-the-making) and they still have nothing to show for it. Now the rumor is that they’re gonna launch it in [2025](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/) with no [steering wheel or brake pedals](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/11/apple-car-design-rumors/). The car is reportedly [“mocked”](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/11/23203669/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-vehicle-jogger) throughout Apple and the team is having issues with their software.\n\nApple is also bringing [financing](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/08/apple-pay-later-in-house-lending/) in house for their buy now pay later service. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/03/42-percent-of-consumers-made-late-payment-toward-buy-now-pay-later-debt-survey-finds.html), 42% of buy now pay later customers made late payments. As the economic situation deteriorates, it’s hard to see Apple collecting on all of the money they lend out. That’s a pretty big risk for a company that’s been bleeding cash.\n\nAnd finally, Apple is focusing on [ad revenue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-14/apple-aapl-set-to-expand-advertising-bringing-ads-to-maps-tv-and-books-apps-l6tdqqmg). Apple is going to start putting ads in the Maps app. One of Apple’s main advantages with their software is the fact that they don’t show ads. When this changes, Apple’s software loses one of its main advantages of its competitors. An [analyst](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/06/15/apple-ad-business-could-reach-6b-by-2025-with-41b-from-search-ads) estimates that Apple’s ad revenue will hit $6B by 2025. With both Google and Meta ad revenue in decline currently, it’s hard to see how Apple will get a bigger seat at the table in a currently declining market. This analyst also values Apple at a ridiculous 30 P/E ratio so he’s full of bad takes.\n\nAs Apple’s earnings continue to decrease, my thesis is that they will need to stop their buyback to deleverage and stabilize their balance sheet. This would stop a main source of buying pressure and cause the stock to drop. The stock would drop even more if Warren Buffett stops trying to YOLO on momentum stocks and remembers he's a value investor too, but [40% of Berkshire is in Apple](https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-loss-51652974419), maybe Warren posts here on WSB. \n\nIf they don’t halt or decrease their buyback, they’ll have to continue going into debt until that debt load crushes them. Either way, the outlook for the stock in the medium to long term is not bullish. Eventually, the fundamentals will matter again.\n\ntl;dr: Apple is a declining company that is desperate for new products. Their valuation multiples have increased significantly faster than their revenue/earnings while their debt has gone up in relation to equity. Their earnings decreased 10.6% year over year last quarter and no one is talking about it. This thing is going to come down eventually, the only question is when.", "id": "x0fw8b", "created_utc": 1661748652.0, "score": 264, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|48|**First Seen In WSB**|6 years ago\n**Total Comments**|215|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x0fw8b/the_biggest_short_why_aapl_is_an_overvalued/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vdbhyt/the_next_short_squeeze_hood/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5seog/sars_vs_coronavirus_why_its_different_this_time/) \n**Account Age**|12 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=x0fw8b)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=x0fw8b)\n    \nHey /u/theycallmeryan, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Warren ain't gonna let it happen.", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah he’s been yoloing like he’s Cathie Wood lately.

It’s great. \n\nHere is something I wrote previously: \n\nSome headlines recently mentioned that Apple has told suppliers to prepare for higher iPhone 14 pro sales volume. Great. It seems like a fantastic product with lots of updates that make it a great value. On top of that, they didn’t increase the prices on any of the models which shocked most people. And it should, because it is a certainty that the phone is now more expensive to produce and deliver into peoples hands than it was a year ago. Honestly, it’s a great move by Apple. The headline of “Fancy phone company increases prices because of inflation” would not have gone over well. They are going to eat the short term hit to profitability for long-term goodwill. It’s a genius, long-term oriented strategy. Plus they probably had no choice if they wanted to maintain revenue numbers.\n\nBut what about profits? Apple is great at the supply chain, cost structure, and all of that stuff. But there is no way they can offset higher chip prices and material costs. \n\nSo what did they do to help improve the profitability of the iPhone business segment? They slapped new packaging on the previous years lower end iPhone offerings and removed the worst selling low end model. Almost nothing has changed on the lower end models. According to Statista, the lower end model accounted for a majority of iPhone sales as recently as 2021. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/804398/us-iphone-sales-by-model/) There is probably better data out there, but the point is that the sales of the low end iPhone are really important. If they just slapped new packaging on the phone, why would anyone buy it? \n\nI don’t know. But I do know that it makes the higher end iPhone a much better deal. And this is holding true: “Apple expects 85% of early adopters to opt for a pro model” https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/09/iphone-14-sales/ and https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/09/19/apple-supplier-shifts-production-to-make-more-iphone-14-pro-models\n\nHow could 85% of early adopters opting for a pro model be a good thing if more than 50% of iPhone sales should come from the lower end iPhone? I’m no math magician, but something seems off there.   I’m sure people are talking about this, but I’ve personally stopped watching/listening to most news sources. \n\nAll in all, Apple has a large and complex business, there are certainly other levers they are pulling to increase profitability. But it seems a near certainty to me that profitability is going to continue to decline while revenue may also decrease. I really don’t know, but I would certainly gamble on the stock going down via November 120 puts. Timing is everything though.
