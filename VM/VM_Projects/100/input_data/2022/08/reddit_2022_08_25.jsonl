The more people/companies can borrow, the more they can spend to buy/create goods and services. The Fed can stimulate this growth through QE, and through lowering interest rates. When this happens, companies are expected to grow and so is their stock value. \n\nEventually, the debt increases too quickly due to over-borrowing and over-spending. Sometimes, the economy needs to cool off, and debt needs to be paid back. Fed can influence this through QT and raising interest rates. Companies are expected to not grow as fast, or potentially shrink, and so is their stock value.\n\nThe US economy (and the rest of the world economy) simply has accumulated too much debt, and requires the de-leveraging phase to not get out of hand with inflation.\n\nBut… It already is out of hand. And most central banks around the world are not raising rates or enacting Quantitative Tightening fast enough. \n\nMost of the stock market is speculating right now that the Fed is choosing to not raise rates high enough to truly combat “monetary” inflation. They haven’t even started QT yet. Thus, the market will continue to go up. Because during inflationary periods, the best assets to hold are typically stocks. \n\nHighly recommended for everyone who wants to learn macroeconomics and how it could affect the stock market: \n\n**“How the Economic Machine Works”** *by Ray Dalio*\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Question: so let’s say the fed wants to enter the deleveraging stage and they want to reduce their debt.
