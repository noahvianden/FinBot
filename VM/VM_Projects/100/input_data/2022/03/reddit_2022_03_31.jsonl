This is the classic inflation trade. Liabilities lose value when inflation causes rates to raise. Assets go up in value with inflation. Look at MBS. The ishares index is down over 5% ytd. This pushes up interest rates on mortgages. The ishares residential and multisector real estate fund is up almost 11% ytd.  \n\nWhat people are missing here is that higher interest rates may slow RE price growth, but eventually the underlying MBS yield becomes attractive again. And rates go back down and then prices go back up. Any short-term swings in prices and or rates are mostly zero sum in nature. Longer-term, there is a shortage of 4-5 million homes to meet demand.

The duration of the release hasn't been finalized but could last for several months. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the decision.\n\nHigh oil prices have not coaxed more production, creating a challenge for Biden. The president has seen his popularity sink as inflation reached a 40-year high in February and the cost of petroleum and gasoline climbed after Russia invaded Ukraine. Crude oil on Wednesday traded at nearly $105 a barrel, up from about $60 a year ago.\n\nStill, oil producers have been more focused on meeting the needs of investors, according to a survey released last week by the Dallas Federal Reserve. About 59% of the executives surveyed said investor pressure to preserve \"capital discipline\" amid high prices was the reason they weren't pumping more, while fewer than 10% blamed government regulation.\n\nThe steady release from the reserves would be a meaningful sum and come near to closing the domestic production gap relative to February 2020, before the coronavirus caused a steep decline in oil output.\n\nThe Biden administration in November announced the release of 50 million barrels from the strategic reserve in coordination with other countries. And after the Ukrainian war began, the U.S. and 30 other countries agreed to an additional release of 60 million barrels from reserves, with half of the total coming from the U.S.\n\nAccording to the Department of Energy, which manages it, more than 568 million barrels of oil were held in the reserve as of Mar. 25.\n\nNews of the administration's planning was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.", "id": "tt39kz", "created_utc": 1648743150.0, "score": 562, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 563, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|15|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tt39kz)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tt39kz)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good thing the USA only uses 20 million barrels per day…", "score": 360, "replies": [{"body": "Trying to lower the gas prices .. midterms are coming up and Dems are worried", "score": 222, "replies": [{"body": "Classic political playbook.

Us companies will not create more supply than they can sell at a profitable price, and that has to cover the increased cost of manufacturing/production endemic to domestic oil sources.  \n\nMost people who thump the table on this issue don't understand the first thing about comparative advantage, non-zero sum games, or how oil production actually happens.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I get the principle of comparative advantage.
