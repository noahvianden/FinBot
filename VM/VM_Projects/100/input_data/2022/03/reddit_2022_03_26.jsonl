{"title": "8 Reasons To Never Bet Against the US", "selftext": "#Intro\n\nI’m going to outline 8 reasons why I believe the US remains the best place in the world to invest. This will cover culture, future projections, economic sectors, and international relations. This is going to try to remain as factual as possible with all information sited. Each of these bullet points is going to be generally stating why the US markets have an advantage over other developed markets like Europe and Japan or an advantage over developing markets such as China and India. [This is the theory behind the strategy that I run]( https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialAnalysis/comments/ry1qq5/efficient_leveraged_portfolios/) and suggest to people to best take advantage of this market.\n\n###More Investors\n * In the United States if you want to retire well off you need to be invested in all non-outlier cases. Some people chose real estate, but stocks are far more popular. About [5 percent of people own a second property]( https://eyeonhousing.org/2020/10/nations-stock-of-second-homes-2/) which I’m using as a rough proxy for how many people would be considered real estate investors. The point is that it’s a very low number. To contrast this between [52]( https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/25/more-than-half-of-u-s-households-have-some-investment-in-the-stock-market/) and [56]( https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx) percent of people are invested in the stock market. Social security exists as a safety net, but it will barely keep you out of poverty. In the 1980’s [60% of workers had a defined benefit pension. This is down to just 4% now.]( https://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/pensions_basics.moneymag/index7.htm) This means that if a majority of people currently working want to retire comfortably, they need the market to do well. This is a bullish sign for the market for two main reasons. The first is that most of these people are adding a portion of their paycheck to various index funds every other week. These massive monetary inflows create a permanent upward pressure on the market. The second reason is less direct, but due to the scale of the incentive for the market to do well, laws, regulations, and interest rates are all going to be biased in favor of the market. This explains a reason why the US market should trend up, but why should it trend up faster than other markets? The answer is that the percentage of people who invest in other countries is far smaller. [15% of people in Germany, 17% of people in the Netherlands, 33% of people in the UK]( https://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/pensions_basics.moneymag/index7.htm), and [only 7% of people in China]( https://www.thebalance.com/china-stock-market-shanghai-shenzhen-hong-kong-3305480#:~:text=Only%207%20percent%20of%20China's,swings%20in%20China's%20stock%20market.&text=In%20China%2C%20less%20than%2020,is%20in%20the%20stock%20market.) hold stocks. This means the inflows to their markets are smaller and the incentive to favor the market in their national policies is weaker. This is only one of many factors that influence market movements.\n\n###High Consumer Spending\n * In the United States people are incredibly fond of spending. It’s quite straightforward that a lot of spending means a lot of money flowing into businesses. These elevated cashflows directly lead to increased stock prices. Now of course not all companies only do business in their home country, but that’s where most of their revenue typically comes from. The way I decided to compare this with other countries spending is by looking at [household consumption as a percent of GDP]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/consumption_GDP/#:~:text=Household%20consumption%20is%20about%2060,over%2080%20percent%20of%20GDP.). The US is not at the top of the list, but it is significantly higher than most of its wealthy peers. 68% of US GDP comes from household consumption compared to 52% in Japan or 51% in the EU. You can also see the [sheer scale of US consumer spending when it’s displayed nominally]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/household_consumption_dollars/). The people of the US spend 7x as much as the people of Germany, even though the US only has a bit over 3x the people. \n\n###Low (Enough) Corruption\n * Despite all of the issues you see on the news about the US government and its politicians, it’s a relatively uncorrupted country. [While it scores far from the top on the control of corruption index]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/wb_corruption/) the idea is that it’s more than good enough to invest in. The main point is that it ranks far above most major developing countries that could in theory outgrow the US markets in the next couple decades such as Brazil, India, and China. Despite these countries generally having higher annual GDP growth, their uncertainty and inconsistency when it comes to investing scares away a lot of potential money. This gives the US markets an advantage over most developing markets but doesn’t provide any advantage over Europe for this point. \n\n###Past Performance Indicates Future Performance\n * Everyone has heard that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, but guarantee is the problem word there. Nothing in the market is guaranteed, but the past is still a fantastic indictor of what we can expect in the future, broadly speaking. US markets have grown at an average rate of 5-10% annually for many decades depending on what time frame you look at. This is not as true for other developed economies. Over the past 25 years the US [has returned 50% more on average annually]( http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/comparison/european-stocks-vs-us-stocks/) than a comparable portfolio of European stocks. The time frame is somewhat restrained by the data available in some emerging countries such as Brazil and India who both only got stable exchanges in the 1990’s. This is still far enough back to cover multiple business cycles and generally give an idea of expected returns. Over the same time frame [emerging markets returned a very similar amount]( http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/allocation/emerging-markets/) to their European counterparts. Of course the future could be very different, but past performance suggests that the US has the right combination of traits to be the most successful market and most of those traits likely remain. \n\n###Continued Population Growth\n * One of the biggest long run concerns of investors is that population growth is stagnating or even dropping in the most developed countries. The last hundred years of growth have been greatly assisted by an ever increasing population. Japan’s stock market is famously very flat. It remains [below it’s high that was achieved in the 1990s]( https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/stock-market). There are a variety of reasons for this but one of the major concerns with the country is that there population has appeared to peak and has been slowly trending down since 2010. Estimates project that they will fall from 126 million to 75 million by 2100. [The EU faces a similar issue]( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20190710-1). They are projected to fall from 450 million to 416 million by 2100. This is where the US completely stands out from the rest of the developed world. The US is [projected to increase in population from 330 million to 430 million]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_growth) in this same time frame. This growth rate is on par with many developing countries and far ahead of ones like China and Brazil who are expected to shrink. I can’t state strongly enough how much of a comparative boost this will provide the US. I also want to point out that most of this growth is expected to come from immigration as our birth rates aren’t that much different than Europe. \n\n###Global Reserve Currency\n * The USD is what is known as the global reserve currency. Central banks around the world hold significant amounts of foreign currency for a variety of reasons. These include the ability to stabilize your own currency against another, facilitate international trade, and to provide protection in case of market shocks. It makes sense that other countries would hold something they think is stable, useful, and commonly accepted. The USD is this currency more often than not making up [59% of all foreign reserves]( https://blogs.imf.org/2021/05/05/us-dollar-share-of-global-foreign-exchange-reserves-drops-to-25-year-low/). It cannot be understated how powerful of an economic tool this is. We have just seen this in action when sanctions were placed on Russia. The US government [has frozen more than half a trillion in Russian reserves]( https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/us/politics/us-sanctions-russia-central-bank.html). Another example of this being used was in 2020 when the US created trillions of new dollars. This increase in money supply was not only born by US citizens. It was absorbed globally due to the extensive currency reserves. Why does this give US markets an advantage? It provides the country as a whole with a powerful weapon that can be used to push the world into a more favorable position. It means the US can use QE to escape recession more effective than any other country, on paper at least. Lastly, it makes foreign trade incredibly easy. All of these are pieces that provide better economic conditions than their competitors can create. \n\n###Military Dominance\n * It’s no secret that the US spends a lot on its military. The scale is sometimes lost on people though because there’s a huge difference between being the biggest, and [being larger than the next nine combined]( https://www.visualcapitalist.com/u-s-military-spending-vs-other-top-countries/). This military dominance is tremendously beneficial to the overall health of the economy for a couple of reasons. The first is that it provides an incredibly safe place to do business. People are hesitant about doing business in a country that has even a tiny threat of being invaded. An example that’s frequently talked about on Reddit is the possible risk of investing in Taiwan due to its proximity and scale compared to China. The US has both an ocean and the worlds largest military separating it from any hostile powers. Notice how even though Germany wasn’t attacked by Russia last month, there was still [substantial fear]( https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/stock-market) in their financial markets, though a large portion of this was related to energy fears - another issue the US outperforms in. People might mention that nuclear weapons could reach the US from just about anywhere, but I consider that a non-point. The minute nukes start flying the minute your money doesn’t mean anything anymore. There’s also an economic side to the military that can be broken into two parts. The first is that that 800 billion dollar budget needs to be spent somewhere and that somewhere is in the US economy. In the latest budget [a staggering 130 billion is allocated to research and development]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-23/white-house-to-seek-813-3-billion-national-security-budget), as an example. A secondary economic factor is that this military power allows the US to provide the same protection it provides itself to its allies. Groups like NATO have a “common defense clause” that basically say if you attack any member you have attacked all of the members. So even though a country like Iceland [doesn’t have a military]( https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_162083.htm#:~:text=Iceland%20is%20the%20only%20Ally,the%20Alliance%20until%20the%201990s.) it is still quite safe from invasion because no one wants to go to war with the rest of the pact. Having these safe allies provides both a great place to do business, which leads to economics and trade growth. \n\n###Key Industry Dominance\n * Lastly, the US has economic dominance in two of the world’s most crucial industries, energy and technology. The US [is the world’s largest oil producer]( https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=709&t=6) which drastically reduces their reliance on hostile foreign governments. This doesn’t mean that the country is immune to changes in the global price of oil, but it does offer comparative lower prices [than most of their developed competitors]( https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/gasoline_prices/). It also provides some security if the world enters into a depression or becomes more fractured. On a more abstract note, the US is also the [global leader in technological development]( https://info.kpmg.us/news-perspectives/technology-innovation/us-extends-tech-innovation-leadership.html#:~:text=China%20is%20close%20behind%20but,Silicon%20Valley%20are%20rising%20fast.&text=More%20than%20a%20third%20of,2018%20global%20technology%20innovation%20survey.). Technology is the backbone of the economy and being one step ahead of the rest of the world is an incredible advantage. A huge number of the worlds most advanced projects and highest potential innovations are being done by US based tech companies and this is unlikely to change anytime soon. While China is ranked #2 and gaining ground, this is not as significant as it may seem. China is not investor friendly and is unlikely to change that. Investor money is still going to flow to the US for the foreseeable future. \n\n#Conclusion\n\nThis has been a **BULL** case for the united states. There are currently no intentions to write a bear case as most of the points are simply going to be the inverse of the ones stated here. The goal of this post is to highlight why I believe the US, despite the last decade of massive growth, is still the worlds best place to invest and will remain so for the foreseeable future. If you want to refute one of the points please, I beg you, back up what you say with reputable sources. One thing I want to note is that just because a company is US based, that doesn’t mean those companies have a strictly US based revenue stream. Most of the massive companies that drive the market’s growth are international. If the US goes into a deep recession, most of the world will also likely go into a deep recession. There are benefits to diversification but adding more to a portfolio does not always make it better!\n\n#TLDR\nThe US’s excess growth compared to other developed countries is not an anomaly. The US is highly unlikely to follow in the footsteps of countries like Japan.

I read Dalio's latest book, and I feel his perspective has much more explanatory power than your points about why investors need to diversify. You can google the summary on LinkedIn (those links are blacklisted here). Personally I think you underestimate a few other critical trends:\n\n1. Political dysfunction of the US government, and increasing polarization. If you though the 2020 election was worrisome, wait for the midterms and 2024 and 2028. Democracy is hanging by threads.\n2. Global currency reserve is not going to last. All countries are looking at the economic sanctions levied against Russia, and wondering, why would we leave ourselves that vulnerable to the US dollar?\n3. I think we're seeing the end of globalization, and there will be more conflict between China and the US. Despite China's stock market getting beaten down in the past 1 year, China is up and coming, and the only power that can threaten the US's dominance.\n\nI personally hold about 30-40% of my portfolio in US stocks, but the name of the game is diversification as US can't be trusted anymore like in the past to generate political stability and economic returns. As Dalio writes, \"It is desirable to hold a well-diversified portfolio of currencies, countries, and asset classes.\" I want a diversified stock portfolio, and diversified currencies (including some small hedges of precious metals, and maybe even some crypto) as the world order changes.

The US isn't going to fail just because it's been doing well and \"it seems its time should be up\". It'll fail because the government fails, or growth stops, or population decreases, or someone else creates a better business environment. I will evaluate these as they come.

This one is brought up a lot and no one has yet provided what the alternative will be. There's no currency that's not US aligned that can fill the void. \n\n3.

You're confusing the study of economics, which is not entirely empircal, with physics or something.  There are no economic laws written in stone, like there are with 2 + 2 = 4.  People like Yellen and Powell are operating under the (in my view) faulty assumption that markets are always efficient and seeking equilibrium.  This is why in their model things like 2008 couldn't happen.  2008 was not something you should just allow to happen because \"that's life\".

But I also believe we've gone a little too far to the other extreme where we think everything is perfectly rational, understandable, and controllable.  It's not.  The economy is a complex adapative system, and therefore one should make previsions for what can go wrong rather than just assuming that crises can't or won't happen.  Again, this is all the work of William White, who is absolutely not a fringe thinker or anti-intellectual.

The main demographic of reddit will honestly likely see the scenario of the MURICAN empire failing.\n\n1) murica is the MOST corrupt of all countries. You just don't call it \"corruption\" because it's legalized. Therefore, corruption only appears to be lower on a technicality. The reality is that political lobbying is corruption...dont know a single person who actually knows a thing or two about how the government works that thinks otherwise. Political lobbying has caused so much awful harm and damage to both the MURICAN people and the rest of the world. Murica should have far less poverty, far less crime, and far higher standard quality of life for it's citizens. Yet it doesn't. why? Because the ultra wealthy and corporations can legally bribe our corrupt leadership into doing only what's SELFISHLY beneficial to the very top of the wealth pyramid and not what actually benefits the whole country.\n\n2) All it takes is for the USD to be dethroned as the Petro dollar and we are in serious trouble, and that's a reality that's becoming more and more possible. Even a mere 10-15 years ago this would've been absolutely unthinkable and you'd be laughed into infinity. Just recently the Saudis have literally threatened that exact scenario. That they will trade oil for something other than the dollar. Granted it was an empty threat, but the fact that they actually even spoke it out loud indicates that times are changing. Again even 10 years ago they wouldn't so much as dare to merely THINK such thoughts. Now they're saying it out loud to the whole world? Tomorrow will not get better in this regard.\n\n3) military dominance is both likely to end within our lifetimes and is actually a VERY bad thing. Please look at literally EVERY single country, nation, and group of humans that have ever existed...ever. and notice that they all eventually declined in military power to the point of obscurity. Murica will not break this law of humanity. If you actually believe that MURICAN military dominance will continue until the end of time and space itself than you are a mentally ill crazy person. Simple as that. Also, the MASSIVE military spending is precisely one of the reasons why the MURICAN people again have much shittier safety nets, infrastructure, crime problems, poverty levels, low education rates, etc. We should be totally dominating in all those areas. Like literally nobody should he even close in any of those things. Murica, quite frankly, should be the equivalent of those memes you see about \"the world if XYZ would've been different\" and you see a highly advanced futuristic utopia. Instead we lag behind virtually all of the other players in our league of first world countries in all those measures. Why? Because we WASTE (yes that's right it really is a waste) a metric fuckload of money on military dominance instead of actually improving our country.\n\n4) Industry dominance. Again this is likely to end within our lifetimes. Everybody knows about Taiwan and TSMC and the superconductor control they have. And guess what? Taiwan was a complete shithole ran by an evil dictatorship of the KMT and Chiang Kai-Sheks legacy until the 80's or so. Yes, that's right. It really was an evil dictatorship. Please do some actual learning. Maybe go to Taiwan and do some learning in a respected taiwanese university. Oh you can't be bothered to do that? Cool read some fucking history then on Taiwan. Now think about how within hardly 30 years Taiwan went from like 1 step above the dystopia of sub Saharan Africa to being one of the dominant forces in technology. South Korea did the same basically. A complete and utter shithole ran by an evil dictatorship...yes that's right. They weren't really all that much different from the Norks until about....the 80's. Yet they rose to being a first world country basically and in like 20 years or so. A veryyyyy short amount of time. India is also on the rise, and historically speaking India has been one of the strongest civilizations throughout all of history. Just because the British ASSHOLES did their British thing of being an GIGANTIC FUCKING EVIL ASSHOLE to yet another country with darker skin than WASPY British ASSHOLES and TEMPORARILY tripped up the Indians doesn't mean that they'll stay down forever. They're also reclaiming their original spot as one of the great civilizations of the earth. However slow or fast you THINK that will happen is not really all that important. They will catch up and prolly surpass us in due time. \n\nLastly, you guys do realize that even by your very own 'analysis' right here you've managed to argue against yourself. Half the fortune 500 companies are founded by immigrants. Like you said. And do you want to know what this actually means if you take off the attitude of arrogance? It means that you're not ACTUALLY dominating anything. It was NON-americans who did all the real work, and you're just taking the credit because it just so happened that all these not American people made success on American soil. And since American 'dominance' is actually not MURICAN at all. It means that all it takes is for another country to be more attractive to high value individuals and outsiders for murica to fall back down to what only MURICANS can achieve. Which, by your very own statements here, would mean that MASSIVE portions of 'murican' success would disappear. I mean FAANG companies and the father of Boeing ALONE prove that it's really just a buncha Asians and Indians doing all the real work while 'murcians' take all the credit because they're in leadership positions. \n\nThis is a hard to swallow pill for many (prolly all of you tbh), but it's the truth.\n\nAnd since all of you are about to argue and most of you will just do some downvoting or maybe a sarcastic one liner or so that doesn't help the conversation at all let me leave you with this question to ponder.\n\nHave you ever had the self awareness to realize that the MURICAN people (you included) have done so much bragging and patting yourselves on the back, but the one thing you've never actually done with genuine and serious contemplation is the act of considering that maybe...just maybeeeeeeee...\n\n...\n\nYou guys just aren't as good as you think you are?", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "This sounds like a bunch of jellyness.

What do you think about the low barrier to entry for digital distribution as a downside for Gamestop even if their new business model is initially successful? As far as I know no major game publisher has signed onto using GameStop's marketplace for in-game NFTs. Ubisoft has already tried to put NFTs on their own marketplace. Blockchain isn't a new tech anymore, and if companies wanted users to be able to trade in-game goods for real money using a blockchain isn't necessary and likely more costly than simply an in-house platform like Steam's marketplace.\n\nThe even larger problem I see is that from the perspective of the game publishers, getting royalties off second-hand trades for digital goods that experience no wear or tear makes no sense. If someone is willing to spend $5 on a \"used\" game, as a game publisher I would rather sell them a \"new\" game at $5 and keep all the revenue rather than have them buy it \"used\" and only get a portion. This is exactly what we see with things like Steam sales where publishers drop prices to capture lower spenders (since the recurring cost to serve a customer is so small).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hey fellow MBA! I'm not so sure I would classify digital distribution as having a low barrier to entry.

One of the biggest setbacks thus far has been efficiency at scale for microtransactions. Major publishers haven't adopted blockchain because gas fees for micro transactions would be cost prohibitive. Gamestop has announced partnerships with both Immutable X and Loopring who's blockchain advancements utilizing layer 2 could serve to be a game changer.\n\nRegarding your last point, I'm not sure I fully follow your train of thought. To me though, I think of it more like a channel strategy. If I was a publisher, I would absolutely want royalties for the trading of a license in perpetuity rather than have to invest in resources for promotion of an aged product.

But let’s go through these positions and inspect them, then we’ll come to a conclusion: \n \nBerkshire Hathaway: pretty much the most consistent performing hedge fund ever. Warren Buffett, who you’ve almost certainly heard of, runs this company, and they have an incredible track record for success in the market, while making extremely “safe” plays. This is a guy who held coca-cola through the 90s and then traded it for Apple in the mid-2000s. He recently sold off huge positions in anticipation of the market downturn. This is not a place you go for a get rich quick scheme. This is where you park your money to retire comfortably. Buffett’s getting old, so the train may be arriving at the station in the next decade. \n \nJP Morgan Chase: a banking giant. Struggled due to idiotic bets during the housing crisis of ‘08, but everyone was doing that. Great choice as long as the market as good, if it’s crashing it’s a different story. \n \nJohnson & Johnson: pharma / medical giant. Again, stability over everything else. \n \nThe “risk it” section is ETFs, which are a compilation of entire market sections. For example, the S&P 500 one is essentially “how is the market as a whole doing?” If the stock market goes up, you make money.  All of those are iterations of the same thing. Again, like everything else, these are positions you take to make you rich in 20 years, not 3 months. \n \nHere’s what it comes down to: \n \nCrypto is highly volatile with quick turnover. If you invest $10,000, you could wind up with $30,000 or $3,000, and it happens relatively quickly. It is not a place you park your money if you don’t want to lose your investment, but it has the potential to make you “rich quick.” \n \nYour ex’s stock plays are perhaps indicative of the prior generations (X and boomer) but that doesn’t mean they’re bad — actually, they’re extremely stable. Unless you desperately need that money in the next decade regardless of the market, you’re pretty much guaranteed (99.999% certain) not to lose any money, and you’ll almost definitely get a healthy return. Will it be as big as crypto? No. But it is infinitely more responsible, unless the entire world economy collapses, in which case crypto won’t help you much either. They definitely aren’t positions you could brag about amongst a bunch of rich bros, so I can understand how they might seem meek, but they’re actually perfectly reasonable and extremely sound. \n \nIdeally, you want a combination of stable and volatile plays. (This is not financial advice, but) what I would do if I was in your position is keep all of your existing stocks and ETFs — don’t sell a damn thing — but allocate a small percentage of new income towards crypto. In terms of the stocks, don’t worry about them, don’t check them for the next 5 years. In 5 years, take a peek. You’ll probably be happily surprised. I personally believe Bitcoin will hit $1m in the next 2 decades, and the rest of the crypto market follows bitcoin, so your new BF is far from an idiot.

You don’t get to have it both ways. If an investment is a long term “hold” than crypto has demonstrably absolutely fucking crushed every stock on the market measuring over the past ten years. The two big ones were pretty well known right from the getgo, and give amazing returns in the long term. It’s absolutely no contest. Give anybody the chance to go back in time and buy either of the big two at $2 or Apple at whatever the hell it was at 10 years ago, and if they have a functioning brain, they’ll choose crypto. So don’t tell me that crypto isn’t for long term holders and it’s only for gamblers or any of that bs. As a long term 10 year outlook hold, crypto absolutely destroyed buying some shit etf like vti. \n\nWant to change the goalposts and go short term “well maybe in the long term it was good, but short term it’s volatile and stocks blah blah. \n\nCool. The stock you’re making fun of us up 90% in the past week.\n\nSo it’s somewhat ironic to hear somebody who just got the past ten years so incredibly wrong talk about how I have no vision for the future. \n\nIt’s possible. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe the 7 figures I have in this long position will get crushed, and we’ll end up relying on my wife’s vti to retire in our 60s like you. That’s risk I’m willing to take. Because I’m betting I’m not as stupid as you are, and I have a better vision of which way digital asset industry is moving than you do. You clearly missed the boat pretty hard on the last ten years, and nothing tells me you’ve reconsidered and tried to figure out what you got wrong. \n\nI hope you hit your targets. I do. But the idea that “nobody can beat the market and you should only rely on things with a proven 10 year track record” that seems so prevalent here seems somewhat comical in the face of talking about crypto and the past ten years of performance. \n\nRealistically, this thread has to be satire. It hits every single button of confirmation bias and giving yourself a giant pat on the back for helping somebody join the ranks of wasting their life so that they can finally live when they’re old enough to use a walker. \n\nAnyway. I’ve already put more effort into this response than it’s worth. Frankly, I get more buzz from going and driving my Tesla or looking at my bank account than I do from telling somebody they’re stupid on the internet. And the hard reality is, rather than critically thinking “hey maybe I don’t understand digital assets as well as I think I do, I just got the last decade of investment dreadfully wrong, I should reassess my alignments,” you’re going to walk away saying “boohoo, he just got lucky on GameStop repeatedly and consistently over the past year.

It’ll never make it!” Lmao\n\nI get that I’m abrasive and mean, but let’s be serious for a minute. \n\nAt the rate crypto has appreciated, a 10 year investment *is* retirement money. It’s “I can hold everything in cash for the rest of my life and let inflation chip away at it if I want” money. \n\nPretending that you can accurately predict any companies outlook past ten years is stupid. The markets will shift dramatically in that time. The most accurate crystal ball will give you something to the effect of “apple will probably still be around because it has good management that’s setting them up well for future success on a shorter timescale. They’re not making reckless decisions with their money and their positioning themselves carefully to be able to change with market dynamics.” Which is fine! That’s great! But you can’t say that in one breath then say anybody in the crypto space is a degenerate gambler who doesn’t know what they’re doing. The entire sales pitch for crypto is as a long term hold in the face of inflationary market dynamics. I recognize that’s not true for all crypto folks, and the people over at moonshots have really lost their way, but you can’t dismiss the entire segment carte blanche. \n\nShit the market can change dramatically in 1 year. Inflation is transitory at 4% to “inflation is surprising, sticky, and persistent at 7.5%” in a year. \n\n10 year outlook is absolutely a long term hold for any stock. It’s even codified that anything past one year is considered a long term hold by the us government. \n\nSo yah. Fuck off with that snarky noise. You want to draw the for long term hold at 20y? 30y? Go hit up r/UST30yFixed and enjoy the fixed garbage returns.\n\nEdit: actually this shit gets even funnier. Out of curiosity I just looked up Buffet’s average holding period.

Youre not paying for ownership of a company. For crypto, a lot of times your strategy, if you're in it strictly for gains, will have to vary from coin to coin. The best generalized advice I can give without knowing which specific project someone's interested in is this: dyor, dyor, dyor. Make sure the tech youre supporting makes sense, has a good whitepaper, is transparent, and will be something people want to talk about (for example: projects that lessen gas fees, projects that give crypto-back rewards, projects that convert to fiat for quick payments, etc) because theres only value in crypto if people give it value, so if no one wants to have it or talk about it, at best it might pump and dump if that. \n\nReddit is often where people turn to but reddit knows fuckall half the time. Please don't listen to shillers blindly on reddit because they say something good. They will have you hold complete trash. Take Jasmy for example. Jasmy seemed decent but instead of looking at charts, they just do what they always do and said/say hold. Jasmy was an obvious rugpull. It went from $25 to a penny. Theres still people saying hold.\n\nPersonally, the crypto I hold, I do so because I support the tech. For example, Nervos works to take the best parts of the bitcoin and ethereum frameworks to be a better network, and Monero works to create a truly private payment system using ring signatures and stealth addresses. So for me to sell my holdings (at least for most of my investments) what I hold would have to either show signs of being a failed project or a rugpull.

And don't go all in on Bitcoin, lol, there are some VERY compelling other cryptocurrencies that are worth checking out, that have sold off more than Bitcoin, that do the who \"exchange money securely and anonymously with no middle men and limits on how much of this currency can ever exist\" better than Bitcoin. Bitcoin was the first, there are better iterations of it now. That's not to say don't buy some BTC, you definitely should, but look into some others too like Monero, Ethereum, I like the sounds of NANO but it is very high risk high reward even for crypto lol as it is a much smaller coin/project, but to me it seems to check all the boxes so I keep a bit in that personally.

Otherwise, diversification is key, if you wanna gamble on crypto that's cool, move 10% into it, maybe 15%, see what happens.\n\nBut to me it sounds like your new bf is just trying to win points against old bf which is hilariously lame.

The NASDAQ exchange has all sorts of companies but in general tends to be more technology oriented.\n\niShares Core MSCI Japan IMI: This tracks the performance of companies in Japan across large, mid, and small cap. \n\nVanguard FTSE Developed Asia: This tracks many large and mid cap companies in Asia.\n\niShares FTSE 100 GBP: This tracks the companies in the FTSE 100 which are the 100 largest companies traded on the London Stock Exchange (mostly British.)\n\nVanguard FTSE 250 GBP: This tracks the next 250 largest companies on the London Stock Exchange after the top 100.\n\nOn the currency issue, you will see that many of those ETFs are currency hedged to the British Pound. The goal of this is that those funds attempt to “hedge out” currency risk related to investing in non- British companies and being a fund in British pounds. If the hedge works, then the fund should return the returns of the companies they track regardless of changes in exchange rates between their local currencies and the British pound, so a sudden drop in the value of their currency shouldn’t hurt your rate of return when the hedge is successful.\n\nI don’t know your current boyfriend well enough to say if he is right or wrong, because who knows, he may be a brilliant trader, but at afar it sounds like he may be an EXTREMELY risky investor while your ex has a more long- term and diversified approach to investing. \n\nI also don’t know what is right for you and can’t speak specifically to you, however, I would say that that ETF portfolio seems well balanced for an equity portfolio and the currency hedge also makes sense for a diversified equity portfolio.\n\nSo, I can’t comment on what’s right for you or the investing skills of your current boyfriend but I would make a warning using the NASDAQ index as an example. Thousands of people quit their jobs and thought they were a genius in the late 90’s/ early 2000’s until 2002 when the index dropped by 78% from its high. In London in 1973-1974 experienced the FTSE crashed. People who think they’re geniuses lose everything trading risky options and crypto every day and in market crashes experience catastrophe, so, if your bf is a brilliant trader and has the skills to run a hedge fund then have fun being fabulously wealthy, but be careful and take a look at r/wallstreetbets if you need any current examples.

El Salvador won’t be the only country using it as legal tender, microstrategy won’t be the only Fortune 500 company to go all in on bitcoin and hold it on their balance sheet.

The reasons these currencies go up in value is because of speculation and investor emotions, which is not something someone inexperienced with stocks should get into and most the time the people who actually know about investing avoid them like the plague. Think of them like a Multi-level Marketing scheme, because the only time bitcoin or any crypto or NFT goes up in value is when someone who already owns them convinces someone else to buy them… eventually, people stop buying and the currency stagnates and then plummets as more people jump ship. Your boyfriend and many others will argue that these new age currencies actually have value because of “deregulation” and the reason why this is wrong takes way too much time to explain. I’ll simplify though, these “currencies” can never actually be used as currency because they’re way too volatile. The reason why we want central control over currency is because central banks and governmental institutions can act to stabilize the currency, making it more useful or regular every day purchases.

This is reply is for educational purposes and is not specific investment advice for OP or others.\n\nWith that out of the way, the individual stocks listed have historically been excellent, steady performers. Between share value appreciation and dividends, these are decent ones to own. You will likely not see 1000000x returns; however, you are also unlikely to lose money to them over the long term.\n\nThe next bit looked like mutual funds. I am not that familiar with the ones listed, so I can't say how good or bad they might be. Now then, the percentages listed after each one tells you how much of that account is invested in that fund.\n\nYou should be able to find the prospectus for each fund online. Things you want to look for are investment strategy, risk profile, fund fees, and historical rates of return. \n\nThe investment strategy should cover what types of stocks, bonds, REITs, and other assets the fund  purchases. It should also state whether the fund primarily seeks asset appreciation, dividend maximization, or some blend. \n\nRisk profile is part of the investment strategy. This dictates how much of the fund is invested in potentially safer investments with lower returns versus riskier investments that have a higher potential return, but these also have a higher risk of losing money. \n\nFund fees represent how much the fund managers charge. If the fund is tied to an index like S&P 500, the fees should be minimal. Actively managed funds usually have higher fees as well as a chance to either out perform or under perform an indexed fund.\n\nAs stated earlier, past returns do not mean future returns. Again, this is more seeing if the fund, particularly actively managed ones, are producing value. If any fund consistently loses money every year, strongly consider dropping it. When reviewing past returns, it is worth knowing what the market in general was doing.\n\nTurning to crypto, I know that I don't know enough about it general to have an educated opinion. From my casual reading, crypto coins appear to be high risk speculation similar to monetary speculation.

Probably past time to sell that unless you're expecting another big covid variant. Or if you think stocks will rise drastically in the next few years.\n\nI see Nasdaq, S&P, and Vanguard ETFs. Looks like he chose some low risk scattershot ETFs. Consider them a good store of value, but don't expect amazing gains. They'll be insulated from a general crash (take less loses likely) and will probably slightly beat the whole market in a bull market.\n\nAs for Bitcoin... I personally will never invest in it. Not only is there no federal protections for a crash (you can lose it all) but most exchanges people buy through don't allow for direct ownership (the whole point of crypto currencies). Bitcoin is also hugely centralized, some 90% is owned by the ultra wealthy. In other words they decide the price, not you. A saying to emphasize how dangerous that is: \"It takes 20% of a stock to tank the price 80%, but 80% to drop it the last 20%\". Not only is 90% of it centralized (again against the point of crypto currencies) but that 90% has more power over the price than just 90%. Most importantly Bitcoin is on the decline. You have to be sure it's going to recover to invest. Personally I think it will go lower. The other question is will it be replaced? There are so many cryptos, will others catch on more. There's a lot going on with ETH and LRE for instance right now and trying to get rid of the crypto stigma the public has. Bitcoin isn't trying to get rid of it's stigma.\n\nSummary: Seem like decent stock picks to me, might want to change them or cash out if you think a crash is coming or if you aren't comfortable investing alone.

I really just posted it for the lolz and to rip on myself -about the nature of being obsessive, I didn't mean for it to blow up or hijack the lounge into r/relationships territory, so I humbly apologize for inflicting my drama on anyone... If I annoyed you, here is when you stop reading this screel and downvote me.\n\nAfter this update I promise I will stfu about this subject, and get back to my usual repertoire of making stupid comments and memes. Let us speak no more of this after this post!\n\nLast week you may recall I told how I encountered the GME ape at the bar, flashing his 7k RH account to a woman. How I laughed at that goon! But, the reaction to my post brought a horrifying reality check to my mind- Was I just the more upscale version of this joker ?! We shall see.\n\nAnyway-\n\nHere is the cliff notes version of Q1 Redemption Date Results:\n\nSo we meet up at this nice French bistro place. \n\nAs she walks towards me to greet me, looking like a total Smoke Show i might add, with TeslaLeafBlower's scathing parody fresh in my mind, I was hit by like the worst anxiety attack ever-\n\nMentally thinking \"Omg you're such a fucking tool, you are so nerdy the guys on T*slalounge!* think you are over the top and they post every two seconds... you are trying to sweet talk this gorgeous girl by lecturing her about options chains like you are teaching an online investing course or some shit!!!  You are Professor Dumbass!\"\n\nI quickly went with a classic defensive play and ordered a double whiskey and soda at the bar to recover from my nervous breakdown, and after a drink or two and light conversation at the bar, we sat down at a table.  \n\nSo, i made a conscious effort to let her lead all the conversation and to not rant on any subject. She talked about Ukraine and I held back on any WW2/Napoleonic history lesson, or giving her my Armchair General's opinion on the military situation. Then she moved on to talking about France and her travels in Europe,  where she lived for two years. Despite having been to France and Europe many times, I restrained myself and kept my comments quick, and didn't regale her with any travelogues.\n\nMeal recap -(She had Steak Au Poivre and I ordered Coq Au Vin in honor of Chicken Genius, but I did not talk about him or toast him in remembrance. Some nice red wine to go with. Killer food. I bought her a whole damn box of macarons to take home, cuz she says she loves them and these little damn cookies are like 2 bucks a pop, destroying my Ramen budget for weeks!)\n\nAnyway, about one hour in to the date, she hit me with the Classic Woman Reverse card:\n\nHer- You're barely saying anything!\n\nMe-  well ...I  just wanted to let you talk, you know, i should let you have the floor sometimes, i know I can go on....\n\nHer - you men are so sensitive. You say women are sensitive, but you'all are three times as bad. I *knew* you were gonna be like this, you know i was just gently ripping on you right? I like your rants... you are funny and interesting. So don't be all devastated, please?\n\nMe- So... Now can we talk about Tesla?!\n\nHer- lightly punched my arm across the table and laughed\n\nMe- absolute flood of relief that was almost overwhelming. Downed the rest of my wine, and did NOT talk about Tesla or investing.\n\nAfter that, we went to a bar to watch NCAA basketball and we played pool and she absolutely wrecked me at that, and darts. So that was kinda embarrassing, my concentration was not available.\n\nOne other bit of redemption - she brought up how she had been thinking about what I said days ago, about how it doesn't make much sense to save all her money in a bank and lose steadily to inflation. She asked for my help to set up brokerage account and show her how to buy BTC. (So take that ! She might dump my ass any minute, but I might have at least improved her finances!)\n\nI'll leave the story at that.\n\nBut one great moment was, at the end of the night we ran into one of her friends I've never met, and she introduced me as her boyfriend. surprised Pikachu face!\n\n So I think I'm doing okay. I can now transfer my fears and anxiety about going too off the rails with my nerdery/ranting and that I annoy her, to now i can worry about how out of my league she is, and all the usual suspects of jumping back into the dating shark tank. She is really amazing and I might be in serious, serious emotional peril here, but Ill save those posts for r/relationships\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***;TLDR Version- Lounger has a good date after exile on Wallstreet, re-learns about how to give and take in conversations with women, and rights the ship.***\n\n/End Rant  ", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "It’s time to show\nHer Rob Maurer", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Sadly, Model D has yet to enter production, though Im hopeful on Q2.

I have the same kinds of obsessions with other things. Eventually such interests will overshadow parts of your life which are arguably more important for you in the long run. \n\nIt's not bad to think about Tesla since the company is cool as fuck but keeping it surface level is sufficient for most people.\n\nI personally do think it is an issue, especially if you care about interacting with others on a more diverse level. What I did is remove some Tesla youtube channels from my recommended, only kept the necessary. You might feel obliged to watch some youtubers but you really are not, they'll have an audience without you.\n\nA huge part of this obsession is a result of the algorithm finding the most likely thing to keep you engaged, which is Tesla, not only because you like the company but because your net worth (and thus self-esteem) is completely tied to it. \n\nAt a certain point I was also trading 3TSL almost daily and it became an addiction, which is why I only do longer term trades now and invest for the rest. It's nice to earn money but don't lose sight of the more important things in life, you're most likely very secure financially already. It's important to see money as a tool rather than something which is a part of you.\n \nI've also moved my yahoo finance app to a part of my phone which is less accessible, put it somewhere in a folder so I don't check too often. The folder also includes some social media and it's called \"dopamine addiction\". Even if you do check, let the folder be a reminder of what you are attempting to do.\n\nI personally stopped thinking about Tesla as much when my life got busier. Maybe pick up exercising if you aren't doing that already, or just pick up a random hobby you enjoy and stick to it.\n\nIt's a great sign that the lady is patient with you, she appreciates that you have a passion for something.

Embrace it, as long as you don't make it awkward it is NOT awkward. This doesn't only apply to women but for every interaction. I used to always want to reply to people right away or fill up silences to \"entertain\" them, this way you devalue yourself because you feel like you have to do something to make the other person feel good. Since I've started giving other people room to fill up silences I've been having a much better time, because the conversation is more organic and balanced.\n\nWhat I've noticed is that the expression of \"being on the same wavelength\" is a very real thing, sometimes you just match with people. It's a great sign that you guys match. The most important thing now is that you don't feel obliged to impress her, which is the impression I'm getting.

I openly disguise my Tesla fandom, the only thing that would give it away is if people saw my car or inquired into the ring I wear— which I only wear around friends and strangers— never professionally or with just-acquaintances. \n\n2.

{"title": "Booked my Train Ticket on the Tilray Express just yesterday", "selftext": "Good morning fellow gorillas. It's been 14 straight months that I have been watching $TLRY get it's ass pounded. I was here for weed gang 1.0 last March and have seen the price slowly dwindle from $22.00 all the way down to $4.88. Over the past 4 months I've been slowly buying shares and had $7000 total in shares as of last Thursday. Woke up yesterday to shares being up 30% and figured it was going to be another streak of news bumping the price up for a day or two and then coming back down like it has every other day for the last 14 months, so I sold all my shares to buy back in on the price drop. It wasn't until about 1:00 pm that I realized congress is voting on federal legalization of marijuana again. With the house voting next week, I realized I made a mistake in selling. Bought back in at about 3:00 pm and bought another $2000 in shares. I'm sitting at $10,802.70 right now with markets closed.\n\nNow I know what you guys might be thinking, \"What is this guy, fucking retarded?\" and yes, you would be right. But allow me and my 70 points of IQ to explain why the next few weeks are going to be wild. Ballotpedia shows the makeup of congress before and after the 2020 election. Check the subheading \"Partisan Balance\" \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqauma457qp81.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=304f08de52caedd4b0afcf775906fc3231491b8f\n\nLast time this was voted on, the house was a clean sweep with 228 for and 164 against. Then stalled in the senate. This time around there is still a blue majority in the house. If that passes, it's smooth sailing until it reaches the senate again. This time around were looking at 48/50 blue/red in the senate vs the 45/53 the last time this happened. Not only that, but it's been over a year since then I'm betting that time will slowly turn government heads in favor of recreational marijuana. This would open many doors for companies that are waiting on this lottery ticket and I'm betting that the growth of these companies and the hype around cannabis stocks is going to take this sky high.\n\nGlad there aren't many eyes on this at the moment with all the GME hype. I've been trying to save up to go back to graduate school, so if this fails at least I know I was too stupid to go back to college anyways. If this shit goes tits up, I'll make sure my friends have my login info so they can post my obituary to WSB when I invest in $ROPE.\n\nWeed gang 2.0 is on the horizon and I've booked my ticket on the Tilray train. Diamond hands to the moon baby. I'll keep you updated on my positions throughout the week.

{"title": "$SPY - Predictions for the week of 3/28", "selftext": "Unfortunately, I was very busy last weekend and was unable to make a predictions post. I am back though, better than ever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/jpqudzixzqp81.png?width=1489&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e8838a949e81aae451e8cd368d1a00a8d2fd56f)\n\nLast night before I fell asleep... I was just thinking: how is this possible, how could there be a 9% bull run on basically no good news.  Then, the thought finally came to my mind, every market crash has been different.  So many people like to relate market crashes to events that have happened in the past like 1930, 2001, 2008, except they are all different.  I still believe that there is a market crash but now my view has changed: this market crash will be like nothing we have ever seen before, I am not implying this will catastrophic collapse of the financial system, just saying that there will be movements we have not seen before and things that historically do not make sense (like what happened last week).   \n\nInteresting enough: low volume bull runs have signaled an end to a bear market and the start of a longer term bull market.  This will not be the case for 2022.  There is one main reason why I believe this market crash will be different than anything before.\n\n**Retail investors**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Daily volume has increased dramatically in the last year](https://preview.redd.it/vl0ku8bn2rp81.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=482c86d17fb7ac66ed95011504cc163a33e8a419)\n\n[Many more retail investors have started actively trading](https://preview.redd.it/9jl7hlut3rp81.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cdb3b305e623fa5c8b855dc750605baf2cd8fd2)\n\n[Retail investors have caused increased volume in option contracts](https://preview.redd.it/tgy8amui3rp81.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3135894ec464320f78f58f023187f3c8229b940)\n\n[The top 100 stocks with the most option volume have outperformed major indices](https://preview.redd.it/tjko61nw3rp81.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=8445e402b82de7f76c35e036e99d6f6b994957e6)\n\n[The volume on stocks these stocks is mostly hedging...](https://preview.redd.it/juqcqch64rp81.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=8954c5ba6d08ce89e5c97739386c3e88a8015f1a)\n\nOne last thing, just all this above.  Retail investors have access to more information and tools than ever before.  In 1930 retail investors read the stock tables in newspapers they had no complex analysis... that's why one spooky front page title made people panic sell.  Today is much different, I just found this in depth research paper written by a multi-billion dollar bank from just a youtube video.\n\nBecause of the increase in call volume on these large cap stocks, market makers are forced to buy up more shares as a hedge if the options expire in the money.  This has caused a once in a lifetime bull market.  And now, since there is many more retail traders actively trading stocks and options this is why I believe this market crash will be different than anything before.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/k5fz2mzufrp81.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=33991c9953d966e3c9e71e37c7ce72222373bfad)\n\nImportant zones to watch\n\n\\~453 major resistance area\n\n\\~432 major support area\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe RSI is currently at 99 on the daily chart, this is a very bearish indicator showing that the buying pressure is gone now. %K could cross %D in the beginning of next week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/x9kp0momtrp81.png?width=1494&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d952c9228a3d529efb3d1b0bebe2457b0cbc293)\n\nWhile it might not seem obvious at first, to me there is a clear cycle here. During this bear market there will be a smaller cycles.  Cycles of high volatility with a big swing in the market, followed by a consolidation phase with lower volatility before the next swing.  Ignore the market open on the day that Russia invaded Ukraine that is an outlier in this since it is a very rare occurrence.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[US Bond Yield Curve](https://preview.redd.it/g50kn46iwrp81.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6586f655a13515d7408faf30c20d60285e672c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Historical 10Year - 2Year US Bond Chart Compared to SPX](https://preview.redd.it/h4e3970vxrp81.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=34385d6583de6ab9171a765333adc8bc8397779b)\n\n**Predictions**\n\nEven after the rally last week, I still think that there is an overall downtrend.  I seriously believe that there will be cycles also because many new retail investors, the movements in the market will be extrapolated. \n\nWhen the 10 year minus the 2 year bond yield approaches 0% or has even inverted this has previously indicated a recession.  Bonds will always be a major indicator in the markets.\n\nFrom my technical analysis and research I can conclude that we are entering another consolidation period with a down trend.  The situation in Ukraine will not be getting any better and there are no major events happening next week that will shake the markets.  The next few weeks will not be a crazy panic like early January, just a slow sell off.\n\nFor my positions I will be looking for an entry on UVXY and ITM Put contracts for a quick day trade, I do not know if I will hold anything over the next weekend, haven't made that decision yet.  \n\n\\* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more\n\n**TLDR**\n\nMonday🐻Tuesday🐂Wednesday🐻Thursday🐻Friday 🐂, Support\\~432, 10Y-2Y bonds signaling a market crash!\n\n**I will respond to every comment!**", "id": "tp494n", "created_utc": 1648329132.0, "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|22|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|564|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skwpds/spy_current_week_analysis_next_week_predictions/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sqwd9c/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_214/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t23ypl/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_228/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcoh2o/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_314/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7jifc/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_37/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tp494n/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_328/) \n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tp494n)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tp494n)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "5 day forecast, that's a new one", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Not new.
