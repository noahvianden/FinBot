Since my account is fairly small, I can't commit thousands of dollars on a CSP at a 30$ strike or buy 100 shares of Amazon for like 300k$ since I'm trying to keep my position size reasonable. So I went for fairly low priced high IV opportunities. \n\nI currently own 100 shares of MULN at 1.175$ average. However, I've just rolled my first set of CCs and effectively reduced my cost basis to 0.84$, so while the stock is surely currently meme-pumped which is a risky situation, I have a cushion of around 52% based on a price of 1.74 as of writing this, which looks like a very comfortable position. My plan is now to simply keep selling those CCs until IV is not attractive any more and then maybe sell the stock for profit. The only really bad thing that could happen at this point would be for the stock to suddenly lose 50% of it's value.\n\nCan you let me know if there's anything I'm missing here which makes this a very bad idea?

His long leg serves as protection to define max loss and I assume buying power reduction for other trades.\n\nMassive rally ensues and the theta decay gained from extrinsic is outpaced by the rise towards intrinsic.  He's losing on the position.\n\nSo around Thursday 3/17, he starts legging into long ES futures as a way to hedge in case the short leg of 4440 is breached, which it was.  Because of his long hedges on ES futures, he was able to actually profit.\n\nMy question is why specifically is he using long ES futures?  Why is this that much different than just going long on SPX calls?  Since it's so much closer to spot price at that time, anything long would be more expensive unless he went far OTM and at a later expiry.\n\nWhat about the difference in spot prices between SPX and ES?

Forget about what the stock price is or will be. All that matters is that the call's premium value falls below $16.43, then she can buy to close for a profit. The lower the value of the call on buy to close, the higher her profit. When selling contracts, the goal is to sell high, buy back low.\n\n------------------------\n\nIf what you are really asking is was that a good trade? Yes and no. The strike selection builds in a nice profit margin on assignment and stock selection are fine, but there are two things I would have advised against:\n\n1. The expiration is too far in the future. It's best to keep option expirations below 60 days, particularly when selling contracts. As noted above, the shares are locked into that contract and the further out the expiration, the longer those shares are out of your control. If CVX shoots up to $300 tomorrow there is not a thing you can do about taking some profit off the table.\n\n1. CVX pays large dividends, so there is some dividend early assignment risk. As long as SWMBO is willing to part with the shares at any time for the profit she selected, this is not an issue. But it does mean she may miss out on a dividend, because her shares were called away. It's not really a problem, just something to be aware of. On the bright side, she will keep 100% of the credit upon assignment.\n\nAll that said, it's usually better to select a strike that is OTM from the current price. 160 is just over the line into ITM territory according to Friday's closing price, so not OTM. It's not terrible because it is still way above her cost basis, but it does mean that any gains above 160 for the rest of the year are lost to her.\n\nIf she was thinking assignment will happen early because it is ITM, it probably won't, except for the dividend early assignment risk already mentioned. Most likely scenario is that the CC is not assigned until expiration.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks. I've never done a covered call that far into the future myself and agree with what you said. At the time she sold the CC it was OTM, it now has floated up to be ITM.  If she gets to the end of 01/20 and the price is below $160, then if not exercised it would just expire as usual.\n\nIf the price is ITM, is the exercise of a buy an automatic process or does the buyer have to explicitly take an action?

I don't think you can prepare for somethin like the great depression but certainly you can prepare for something like a typical bear market. \n\nBut at the same time I don't think every portfolio benefits from this. To pick an extreme example if you have an entirely passive account(something many aggressively advocate) with little to no attempt to rebalance many diversifications(the go mitigation strategy for most) provide little benefit. to give an extreme example if you bought 80% broad market index ETF and 20% Treasury bonds and never once interacted with your portfolio for 30 years you almost certainly would have been better off just buying stocks since both investments would converge around their average rate of return by that point. by the end it is not even like the bonds would offer any meaningful protection since they would likely be about 1-2% of the total value of the portfolio. Of course the 100% stock portfolio would have more variability during the middle period but why would you even care if you are just letting it sit and are not pulling money out?\n\nIf you are managing the portfolio there can be value although I think many diversification plans lack clear objectives. If you don't have some external requirement to maintain a certain amount of principle in an account or a certain amount of cashflow in a given period I'm already questioning what you are trying to achieve. I also think many people forget that many forms of diversifications are simply trading yield for reduced volatility. That is valid but you still should have some justification for why it is so important to decrease volatility. If you have a long timeframe or a great deal of flexibility in how much you draw from the portfolio I expect the value of diversification to be diminished since given time average yield becomes much more dominant than short term volatility. Of course if your portfolio is some sort of retirement account where you are dependent on the cashflow and are required to take draws regardless of market conditions diversification has substantial value although I think many plans should backload more of their low yield diversification(no I don't think a 30 year old should hold 30% bonds).\n\nOne thing I am skeptical of are claims to reliably reduce volatility while increasing returns. One way or another they all seem to amount to timing the market by predicting it's price actions better than the market as a whole.

This will create a reverse wealth effect as people become more careful with their spending as their stocks and real estate fall in price. \n\nLastly, and the most dangerous, is that because of our enormous deficit of $30 trillion, we simply can't raise rates high enough to fight inflation without defaulting unlike the 80's. A simple 7% rate is untenable today. Even if the Fed doesn't care about asset prices collapsing (I think they very much do) they are handcuffed by the enourmous interest payments we would need to make on our debt.\n\nBecause of our debt **the Fed will only be able to raise rates enough to collapse equities but not enough to fight inflation**.

I've probably spent close to a 1,000 hours researching Tesla. I know their financials, management structure, products, plans, expected deliveries, and a hundred other metrics by heart. The stock could drop 80% this year and it wouldn't affect me mentally, because I know they're on track to become one of, if not the largest companies in the world by the end of the decade. I would just be buying more.\n\nGoing off how I got started in the market, I doubt you have even 10% of this kind of knowledge on one or two different companies, let alone 5 and BTC. That's not a problem, as long as you're aware of it. For Tesla specifically it's very easy to improve your knowledge by watching some of the retail investors on YouTube. There's a couple of really good ones (Tesla Daily, Best In Tesla, Dave Lee, etc.)\n\nFunnily enough, what you consider to be \"the only smart thing you did\" by selling BTC at $45K is the only mistake you made. Nothing fundamental changed to BTC in the last year to negatively affect its outlook. If anything, it became stronger fundamentally. So either you bought in without doing your research, or you sold at $45K and now need to decide when to buy back in while because it's ultimately going to be worth at least 10x what it is today.\n\nSo in short; stop thinking short term. Cutting losses on great long term holds makes no sense. Decide which companies you truly understand and have confidence in long term, hold those, sell the rest and use that money to DCA into the ones you're holding to reduce your cost basis. \n\nOr, if you don't want to do the work to research these companies and train yourself to have the discipline to hold through the tough times, sell it all, put your money in the S&P500 and stop worrying about any of it. The S&P is as close to \"free money\" as you're gonna get. Everything else requires work and discipline.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.

Fractional shares are great, but more brokers offer them nowadays and no broker has demonstrated they will fuck over their own userbase to make a bit of money like Robinhood.

If I buy to close, with the intention of rolling down and out - say May 20, 2022 175p for $1,055 premium - at this exact moment I am taking a loss of $1,040-$450 = $590. \n\nIt does not mean that because I got $1,055 premium for the 05/20/22 175p that I am suddenly not in the loss again.

It only works if the underlying actually begins to move in your favor. If the underlying does not move in your favor, rolling can actually exacerbate losses as compared to just closing the position. So if you're rolling rather then using a stop loss, you'd better have some damn good conviction the underlying will move in your favor.\n\nBABA is a great example of how catastrophic rolling could be for someone. Selling puts in BABA then rolling rather then using a stop loss would've made losses far worse as BABA keeps going lower and lower as time moves on with seemingly no end in sight.\n\nEDIT\n\nDamn, there are a LOT of salty fucks in this thread.\n\nMy claim that rolling only works if underlying moves in your favor (being up, OR flat enough for the stock to land at or above your strike, no matter how small the difference), is true.\n\nMy point was NOT that rolling can't be effective.

Lets say you buy to close. You received $330, and paid out $1,000. Current state, -$670.\n\nThen you \"roll\" and sell a 6/15 125p on apple for, say, $900.\n\nIF that option expires worthless, you're looking at a NET profit of -$670 + $900 = $230.\n\nJust because you came out in profit does not mean you DIDN'T TAKE A LOSS ON THE FIRST PUT.\n\nThat's all I'm saying.

Especially for us sellers of options, a lot of the time, when were confirming a trade, our eyes focus largely on that nice positive number that is the premium you'll be receiving for the transaction. \n\n\n\nWhen faced with the choice of either (a) executing a trade (buying to close) where you'll be seeing both a considerable debit from your account to buy back the position, *combined* with seeing a realized loss, or (b) executing a trade (rolling out for a credit) where you'll be able to get rid of your loser position, start at $0 \"open\" p/l again, *and* receive more premium, one can see why sellers may be more often than not inclined to opt for the roll. On a fundamental psychological level, rolling is just an easier, less emotionally taxing trade to actually execute. \n\n\n\nSince \"rolling out for a credit\" can always be broken down to two separate transactions -- (a) buying current position back to close, and (b) selling to open a new position (which, just happens to be another short position on the same ticker) -- we could refer to the comparison of \"BTC for a loss\" vs \"rolling out for a credit,\" alternatively - and just as accurately - as \"whether or not to immediately, upon the close of the position, open a very similar short position on the same ticker.\"\n\n\nAnd that's why this is the main question, as OP refered to in his post, that one should be asking themselves when making this decision: \"I've made up my mind to BTC this position; do I want to immediately open a similar short position on this same ticker?\"\n\n\nNo matter how far you roll out, no matter how much more premium you will receive from the roll, as OP stated, you will always be realizing the loss that is your current open p/l for the position, because you are closing that position. \n\n\nI think one thing causing the misperception OP is talking about is the mathematical approach often used when describing a roll. \n\n\nI take the  loss I would realize by  closing, subtract that from the current value of the new put I'm selling, and ask myself if I would open the new position the roll would result in, for that amount of premium. \n\n\nSo for example, if I sold a put at $3, it's now worth $4, and I'm thinking of rolling out to a put currently worth $7.50, I'll subtract the $100 in realized loss, from *current price* of the put I'm rolling to, and ask myself if I would open that new position for *that* amount of premium, because basically, that's what would be happening by executing this roll. \n\n\n\nSo that put that is worth $7.50 at the moment - would I be comfortable selling that put for $6.50?\n\n\nThis gets more important if.you start getting into multiple rolls, as it keeps a tab on the running losses you are experiencing with each roll. By subtracting the $100 realized loss from the value of the new put, I'm calibrating my brain to think of the p/l more accurately. \n\n\nOnly when/if the new put drops in price by $1.00 will you be back to $0 p/l on the trades that resulted in this position, so if you just think about the new sold out as already worth $100 less than it is, it'll keep your math for what's actually happening when rolling honest and in check.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/te527d/the_low_risk_of_the_wheel/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yeah op your dead wrong!  \n\nWhen you sell a call to open.

Generally stocks add to your margin equity so this usually helps against getting margin called, but then it adds cash reserves. This one is probably last resort. You can also write covered calls against stock it will trade off longer term possibilities but if it helps avoid selling stock at a loss it might be worth it.\n\nCalls that probably won't happen anymore given the strike or given the price, those moonshot calls you probably need to liquidate, they don't add to your borrowing power, and hoping that TSLA turns around tomorrow isn't a great tactic, we are all pretty sure it will turn around but time can be a major problem with options\n\nCalls that likely will turn around but you need to hedge - consider selling a covered call at a higher strike, yes this does make it more likely that you will lose your shares but at least it will be at a much higher price assuming you get assigned.\n\nExisting Covered/Naked calls - you can potentially roll down (lower strike) your Covered calls for a credit, this will increase your risk longer term at the expense of shorter term safety. You really shouldn't have naked calls on TSLA but I know you like to live dangerously.\n\nNaked Puts, probably need to roll out in time if they are really close to expiry\n\nCash Injections - If you have some money available in a spare checking account or other you can wire in money to your brokerage to help shore up the finances until we recover.\n\nOpen to other suggestions, these are only ones I could think of at this time.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "This needs it's own thread.

{"title": "In-depth Analysis: Putin Vs Elon Single Combat", "selftext": "Putin: \nAge: 69\nHeight 5 feet 7 inches \nWeight: 157 pounds\nReach: 2 feet 7 inches\n\nFighting Styles: \n   Putin’s primary style is Judo. He originally obtained his black belt at 15, but this has since been revoked. \n\nSupplementary: \n   Putin is also said to practice Sambo and Kyokushin. \n\nWeapons training: \n    Putin has extensive training with various fire arms as documented with his hunting background. \n    Poison debufs have long been Putin’s primary damage source for single targets, but it is unclear if Putin has the charisma stat needed to convince Elon to drink/Eat which may limit its impact.\n     Putin has a well documented Chemical, nuclear, and ballistic missiles supply, but the size of the arena may limit there effectiveness. \n   Additionally we can assume he has explosive experience and a potential for a hidden shoe blade(Source Deadliest Warrior: Spetsnaz vs Green Beret S1E2) thanks to his time with the KGB/FSB.\n\nAssumed: \n\n   Due to Putin’s history KGB experience it can be assumed that he has experience with some Greco-Roman wrestling techniques to the extent they are used in Systema. ARB techniques can also be assumed due to Putin FSB involvement.\n\nTheoretical: \n\n   Animal Magnetism. Putin has on numerous occasions showed a bizarre ability to control animals with his mind. Feats include calming and hugging a polar bear and earning the respect of militant pigeons(claimed to be a hoax by many). \n   While it is not certain that Putin can use this power at will or if he will have access to Polar bears at the fight location, it should not be overlooked.\n\n\nElon: \nHeight:  6 feet, -2 Inches *see edit*\nWeight(Assumed): 180.7 pounds\nWing Span: 2’11 inches\n\nFighting Styles\nAllegad: Musk has stated that he has trained in Kyokushin , Karate, Taekwondo, Judo, and BJJ since an early age. I have not been able to confirm this.\n\nWeapons training: We have definitive evidence that he not only owns at least one “flamethrower” and has some experience using it.\n\nAssumed: \n   Autistic Strength: Musk has stated several times that he has Autism and confirmed with his actions. It can be assumed he posses some level of Autistic Strength.\n\nWeeb Techniques: \n   While I can not definitively say that Elon has access to techniques from his love of Anime, it should also be a factor. Additionally it can be assumed he has some mastery of the blade, but it is unclear if this only applies to the katana.\n\nTech: \n  There is a very real possibility Elon would utilize Tesla’s Autonomous vehicles as “cavalry’s” to and/or flame based IED’s. Historically both methods have been proven effective to incapacitate or kill with, but it is unclear if targeting only applies to passengers and innocent 3rd party motorists. SpaceX rockets and Satellites are a theoretical factor that could also become a factor.\n\nLocation: \n\n Russia: \n   If the bout were to take place in Russia Putin would gain a significant boost due to potential for status effects (poison), cold resistance, and ally assist(Snipers, FIS, and Friendly Law Enforcement).\n    We can also assume Putin will gain a slight buff due to the “Defending the Motherland” buff applied to all Russia Citizens when a foreign force invades. \n\n International Waters: \n   Both Elon and Putin’s yachts show experience on the ocean and could provide naval support. Putin has more experience on the water and time at sea due to his well documented yacht escapades. While Elon does have some sailing experience, it is not as lengthy as Putin’s. Additionally we can assume that Russia’s naval fleets would likely be deployed. \n\nUkraine: \n   Elon and Putin would both gain massive ally buffs without a definitive \nadvantage to either side.\n   Putin would likely experience the Away from Motherland Debuff. This is assumed due to the historical precedent shown in Ukraine, Afghanistan, etc. of Russians willpower, fortitude, and strength debuffs when Russia invaded as seen in Afghastan, Ukraine, etc.\n\nTerms of Engagement:\n\n   It is unclear if the bout will be to death, incapacitation, or yielding. If the match is to the death Putin has a clear psychological advantage. \n   It is unclear if weapons will be allowed and to what extent. We can assume both fighters will play dirty and have various undisclosed gadgets. \n\nTLDR/Conclusion: \n\n Both Papa Musk and Vladdy Daddy have distinct advantages in various categories. A clear favorite cannot be chosen until terms of engagement are ratified.\n\nA CEO challenging the most powerful dictator on the planet to single combat is a clear signal of strength to investors. Bullish on Tesla. Bearish on the Rubble.\n\nResearch Methods: Vyvanse 70mg\n\nEdits: \n\nThank you to thekittynati for pointing out that Putin’s funny number age will likely affect the public perception and could be a bullish signal for the rubble.\n\nDue to several Elon Musk height experts concerns I have revised 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet, -2 inches. I believe this is a fair compromise since the best proof I have been able to find are photos with Joe Rogan who is approximately 4 feet 11 inches.", "id": "te2zwf", "created_utc": 1647279284.0, "score": 2586, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 259, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|28|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=te2zwf)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=te2zwf)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "For those asking for less complex analysis here is my [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frfhlt/a_brief_explanation_of_options_for_stoolies/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) guide for new WSB members", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Epic post, thanks for the much needed laugh.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Age 69.

I'm writing all this because if you're investing now you need to consider some things.\n\nWhen your gut instinct says \"Shouldn't the crash be a little less steep?\" You need to follow that thought further. Why is it so steep when it doesn't seem like it should be?\n\nHedge funds and institutions are now openly talking about the market decline. Goldman reduced their S&P projections twice in one month (so far), saying the S&P will go negative this year.\n\nThey don't usually say things like that. It's not in their best interest. So why are they saying it?\n\nA recent piece in Bloomberg just showed that there is a massive influx of retail investors into the market (buying the dip) while hedge funds are selling off. Hedge funds are saying retail investors are nuts and profiting from it. Openly.\n\nSo is it possible that all of those billion dollar institutions who spend so much working capital hiring experts are wrong? While you, as a retail investor, are saying things feel wrong too?\n\nAs far as global markets go:\n\nThe DAX double topped and had a steep sell off. The current pop up is nice but, looking at its chart, it's not yet confirmed if it's a bullshit bounce or a legit rally. Lots of people bought the dip in 2008, 2000, etc. and congratulated themselves when they saw gains. Then the real crash happened and they lost their life savings.\n\nWhile the markets trade independent of each other, they influence each other a great deal.\n\nWhen Russia goes broke, it's bad for the global economy. Pulling out of Russia is bad for lots of U.S. companies who have business there (eg. Blackrock just lost $16BN, McDondalds, Apple, Oracle, MSFT and every other company pulling out is going to take a hit on revenue). \n\nChina's stock market just shit itself, having a one day decline the likes of which has not been seen since 2008. Their real estate mess continues there. How bad is it? Hard to tell. China keeps things under wraps. Especially bad things. Then you have to consider the Covid lockdown they just instated.\n\nIf you look at the charts from 2008, you will see that every global stock market had a crash. But the catalyst was the housing mess in the U.S. Why?\n\nWhen one country's mess gets bad enough, the world pays.\n\nAs far as the U.S. goes, I strongly suggest ignoring the news and looking at all the economic data when it is published.\n\nUkraine is not why the market is spooked. Global conflict typically has a limited effect on markets. Even when it's awful. Institutions knows this. Yes, there is some limited anxiety about nuclear weapons but no one is taking that really seriously.\n\nInflation has long been known to be an issue. Same with the Fed tightening and supply chain. I'm not sure why you think Covid remains a catalyst in the U.S. No one has given a fuck about it for a long time (I live in the U.S.).\n\nWhat you're talking about is things that have happened and things that are happening. \n\nThe market doesn't give a shit about those things. It looks forward, not back.\n\nHere are the real problems:\n\nThe dollar is high (which is bad for the economy because of international trade implications), the trade deficit is off the charts (bad for the economy), consumer sentiment is at decade lows (which is a hugely bad indicator for the economy). \n\nEconomic data points to a recession that will 100% happen (possibly after a very brief bit of stagflation).\n\nDemand, sales and profits are all decline. People point to Q4 earnings and say everything is fine. Of course it was, we all had free money in Q4. \n\nWhen Q1 earnings come out, it will be a blood bath. If you look at what is happening with earnings, companies are posting great earnings for Q4 and getting wrecked (like Netflix). Why? Because their projections are shit. That's all the market cares about.\n\nInventories, contrary to the supply chain narrative, are high. People aren't buying shit because of inflation and because they don't have money.\n\nEmployment numbers are high so people think everything is great. It is. Until it isn't. Monthly employment numbers are nice but they fluctuate wildly. Historically, when the CPI peaks and rolls over (as it's about to do), layoffs surge. \n\nConsumer household debt is $1.4 trillion higher than it was in 2019.\n\nThe breadth indicator for the Nasdaq and S&P are insanely bad. \n\nRents are crazy and the housing market is at all time highs while mortgages may see a steep increase.\n\nI could go on.
