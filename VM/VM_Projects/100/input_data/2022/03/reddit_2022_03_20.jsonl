{"title": "Aftermath of the FED FOMC March 16 ( Quarter Basis Point Hike) & The Risks of 2022.", "selftext": "Respected Traders,\n\nHope you all had a fantastic weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to say wow, what a pump that was. Nasdaq, Russell, Dow Jones and S&P500, all rallied to more than 3% before FOMC. Surely you weren't worried, because I clearly mentioned all of this in my last post, that after March 16 we would get our exit liq rally. The real reason being trillions of dollars of hedged puts getting closed. Add triple witching closes on top of that.\n\n( Sell the rumor. Buy the news )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Everything is just fine.](https://preview.redd.it/hr6mq30j9io81.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=841553062af124407e12d1ffa46932fcbae70014)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarch 16 Meeting. (Summary)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe had a few hiccups when we saw the GDP no in the range b/w 2-3 and the FED funds rate for 2022 to 1.9. What that meant was 0.25X7 = 1.75% hike in 2022 + room for a 50 basis pt hike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Economic Projections](https://preview.redd.it/bhrdieul9io81.png?width=1325&format=png&auto=webp&s=05f0593dff37bb786582c46d6ee2a4294457ab46)\n\nI have to say I was shocked, but then my boi J. Powell came in to the rescue. He was just not having it to see his and other senators portfolios go into red. Why would he ? They all bought calls for Q2 / Q3  2022. He was pretty adamant that the FED was in control of inflation. That guy talked me down like low GDP, no isn't that big of a deal considering we were coming out of a pandemic. He also assured me that balance sheet run-off was no such a big deal. What's getting a few trillions out of 28T of balance sheet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DOT plots](https://preview.redd.it/yz8pq06nujo81.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=235bdfc96c2ccf63528868482eadfbe21da98961)\n\nI have to say it, guys. Powell has switched from \"Inflation is Transitory\" to \"Our Economy is very strong with tight labor market\".\n\nNote : Guys don't forget Bullard and Waller are down for 50bps and Balance sheet runoff. Lets see next week with other speakers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FED voters](https://preview.redd.it/wj1tmyv3tjo81.png?width=1793&format=png&auto=webp&s=60a3e2823357314414122583ca5e590b0af673c0)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAftermath of two camps\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Camp A vs Camp B](https://preview.redd.it/kmq8hd2gsjo81.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a351864de2f54537f423a87f3710152dcbcb1659)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have now got ourselves into two situations :\n\nCamp A) Either Powell has done things right by raising 0.25bps and he is not gonna rug pull us and be transparent about everything, so guys \n\n\" You can buy this dip \"\n\nCamp B) Powell cannot bring this situation under control and then he will one day at one such meeting come out by surprising me (most probably September 2022) and sending my portfolio into recession territory that inflation can only be tamed by Paul Volckering us. So guys, you can chill out and spend time with friends and family. And later in Q4 you see signs of rug pulling, you can \n\n\" Short the market in Q4\" and then buy at -50%+ from ATH.\n\nOr\n\n\"You can buy this dip, sell before september, short the market , and invest profits in -50% from ATH\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo choose the camp you guys want. But i am not joining any such teams. Rather, i am looking at things from diff perspective ( i.e. THE BOND MARKET)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5 - 10 curves have been inverted. Q4 crisis ?](https://preview.redd.it/nc3vr5pwujo81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec7722287848818eb2ae7a23ef9ddc516276173)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n       What if J Powell made a policy error and we shouldn't have increased rates.\n    \n    Yes guys, you heard it first here. What if he made such error or he could just be bluffing about going on with an additional 6 rate hikes. Idk about you guys, but i am not feeling too optimistic about more than 4 rate hikes. The Curve is suggesting there is no room for another hike. Do it and you get an inverted curve (10 -2 yield curve) with banks giving chill statements like nothing happens when a curve inverts. \n    \n    Also long term bond will sell off and since we are in +ve correlation with curve flateening even before mid cycle of rate hike then it means stock markets will drop with each rate hike increase. Add housing and mortage crisis on top of that. \n    \n    \n    \n    J Powell wasn't too concerned about this in his FOMC remarks. But I am coz Powell lied to me about inflation, but curve hasn't till now. It could have been if Russian money was controlling it. But then we can also assume that the whole stock market is being manipulated.\n    \n    So it all depends on the data that will be coming out this year. Or powell could inject QE+ after 4 rate hike and once again skip recession by kicking the can down the road if inflation comes down by september.\n    \n\nSo now that I have established my camp, and where I stand on this.  In no way means it means i am right 100%. It just means I have to sit tight and assess this situation by May 2022. My assumptions could be wrong and hence i will then have to switch to camp A or B. And i will take camp B all day coz i have been supporting it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat they know, that we dont know\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Risks 2022](https://preview.redd.it/nvm912otrjo81.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c778181975c1d890f13369ed577b20b0f7a93f39)\n\nSo campers of the B ( which most of my readers will be coz, i told you to ride exit liq or not and come back in q4 )  i am giving you a HW like any other senior manager of a hedge fund pass-on to their juniors.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut i am not that kind of guy. In fact, in the next post ( 2-3 weeks ) we shall have a great discussion where you throw punches at me, and I will land some right back at you. So come prepared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are a few points you need to research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Is Russia going for a capture fest in Europe after Ukraine?\n\n2) China abandoning Dollar system with Arab, Pak, India, Russia. Basically division of the world into Asia and EU + USA\n\n3) China invades Taiwan and the battle for Sillicon chips. ( The next war would be fought with chips, not carriers )\n\n4) Sovereign debt crisis. Debt/ GDP ( Start with Greece and then study current Russia and then USA bonds ) \n\n5) Financial Crisis. Find out which bank in Europe/USA is getting into default. ( Study Credit Suisse )\n\n6) Gold Vs Equity ( My calculation says near dotcom )\n\n7) Recession , Forgotten Depression, The Greater Depression.\n\n8) Study investing in China and Hong Kong stock markets. \n\n9) Agricultural and Water Investing. \n\n10) Covid new variant\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome other points you could cover were reported by Bloomberg. Its like ecom syallabus for yr 2022.\n\n[Bloomberg 2022 Risks](https://twitter.com/KshitizBisht/status/1477968438777683969?s=20&t=3rTvclwnUnEr-8D7T7ZpBQ)\n\nAnd these are the risks for next week\n\n[Next week after march FOMC week risks](https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1505293879041572865?s=20&t=3rTvclwnUnEr-8D7T7ZpBQ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you guys for taking your time and reading this.

{"title": "Housing isn't coming down. Ever.", "selftext": "So tired of reading the endless copium on housing. I get it. Many of you can't afford homes, that doesn't mean prices are coming down anytime soon.\n\nDespite everything you've heard to the contrary, most houses are owned by people. I know I know: CoRPoraTiOnS ARe buYIng aLL tHe HoMEs!! But it's just not true. For single family rented homes only 300,000 are owned by corporations while 16.2 million are owned by \"mom and pop\" landlords.\n\nTo understand how significant this is we need to look at what has recently occurred with mortgage rates. First lets just overview the 30y fixed that's offered to US consumers. This is an incredible deal that doesn't really exist anywhere else in the world. The reason is fairly obvious, it's just a bad deal for the lender. It's a deeply asymmetric trade; if rates go up you get a better deal than before in relative terms, if rates go down you get to refinance at the lower rate.\n\nAnd that's exactly what happened! Covid struck and all of a sudden people had the chance to refinance bellow 3%, and not just for owner occupied units but rentals too. Every property owner with half a brain took advantage of this.\n\nFast forward to today and rates are at 4.8%. It might not seem like a big deal, after all rates fluctuate. 1.8% give or take isn't really that big of a deal right? WRONG!\n\nIt's a huge deal. We've never pushed rates so low and guaranteed them for so long. Rates need to be viewed on a relative basis. That means paying 4.8% interest is 60% more than 3% with regards to debt maintenance. No one with half a brain is ever going to sell a home they refinanced under 3%. Let that sink in.\n\nGovernment covid policy has effectively removed a very large percentage of homes from the available market permanently. There will likely never be a time in the future in which selling one of these refinanced single family rentals is a good play. Moreover, the 60 million or so single family owner occupied homes are highly incentivized to never move or if they do turn they're existing home into a rental.\n\nThe logical way this plays out does not look good for inventories. People who's financial situation has stayed about the same are extremely unlikely to move. People who's finances have deteriorated are incentivized to hold on for dear life or face significantly worse living conditions, and people who's financial situation has drastically improved are much more likely to rent their old place out and can afford to do so.\n\nInventories are fukt. And not just right now, but for decades.\n\nAll of this has already happened. You can literally watch its effects playing out in the market right now. Looking at market conditions it seems like things are going to get much worse before they get better.\n\nObviously inflation is the elephant in the room, and the US govt is not well positioned to deal with it. If inflation is permitted to run wild housing will get a huge boost. Most houses are fractionally owned with most money coming from the govt as they are ultimately the primary lender this relationship will mean homeowners are making several times the inflation rate just from holding real property.\n\nConversely, govt tackles inflation head on (LOL) by raising rates. This will make the those 3% loans too good to give up. Mortgage rates at even 6% will mean you are paying twice as much servicing your debt at those who bought at 3%. 6% is still bellow the current inflation rate, how likely is it for them to ever get inflation bellow 3% without cheating on their CPI.\n\nSo, we have an extremely constrained supply that is structurally unable to improve. The only available option is new housing. New housing starts data has been bad for years, and while the numbers have improved lately they 1. Aren't enough,  2. Coming on the back of a major materials/commodities re-pricing and 3. Struggling with labor costs and supply so widespread many laborers are able to choose safer/easier work. Best case (for non-homeowners) is we continue to build at an elevated pace and stop the trend, but this will take years not months.\n\nSo before you even get started, no this is nothing like 2008. In 08 people were signing up for horrible variable rate mortgages designed to fuck them, now they've signed up for a bunch of 30y fixed at under 3% designed to stimulate the economy at the expense of the future. So here we are in the future, paying for all those 3% 30y the govt bought up like hotcakes. Even if, as many of you housing bears insist, housing prices come down it will almost certainly be on the back of meaningfully higher lending rates. This will NOT create housing supply since most mortgages are around 3%, unlike 2008 when they were twice that! If interest rates hit 6% and prices drop 40% (they won't) it still wouldn't create the waves of defaults we saw in 2009.\n\nTLDR: Housing operates like all markets, based on supply and demand. There will always be demand but supply will never really come back thanks to ultra loose monetary policy during covid and the govts willingness to buy up all the 30Y mortgage paper. The only way supply constraints can lessen is if asset price inflation is tamed AND rates are close to 3%, so basically never.\n\nPositions: Short 1.2M in mortgage bonds at 2.99% secured by apartments and houses.\n\nEdit: Purpose of this post isn't that housing is cheap and should be bought at these prices, it's that supply has been structurally constrained and this effect is likely permanent.

Because if you sell it, you pay off your loan and end up with 600k. So you turned 100k into 600k. of course you have no where to live now but that's beside the point... yet. you can theoretically then use that 600k as a deposit for an even bigger loan and subsequently bigger investment, and therefore bigger returns. If you get the same returns as the first time around, you turn 600k into 3.6m. see the benefit yet? You might be saying, yeah douchebag, of course, but where do I live?\n\nFirst, understand the pure finance of this as I discussed. This an investment, despite your ideological view of it. It doesn't have to have been a house, it could have been a business you bought and sold while you rented. You could have rented the original 500k house the whole time while you rented too. But ignoring all of that, lets say you love this house and don't want to sell it. You still have 600k equity, but how do you make that liquid so you can capitalise on it through reinvestment? well, you get another loan, just like your first one only this time it's easier as you have a valuable asset to cover the loan. Perhaps you buy another property and rent this one out. with luck, the rent covers most of the loan, \"positive gearing', if not its a tax write off. Either way, you're gambling this property goes up like the first one did. Except this one you can sell.\n\nYou don't even have to invest in property, stick it in shares. as long as the return beats the loan interest rate you're making money for nothing.\n\nIn your case it's not equity we're talking about as you have no loan, it's an asset. It's even more important to get a return on your assets than your equity. again, consider you're a business who buys some machines and vehicles to conduct your business. You measure your businesses success by the return you make on those assets. Your ROA. Again if it beats whatever you borrowed to buy them, plus inflation, you're making bank, congrats. If you own them you only have to beat inflation, but generally less than a 10% return is seen as a poor investment in business.\n\nas asset value increases, banks will loan you more money to reinvest and, hopefully, increase your assets and subsequently the return on those assets.\n\nWhether or not to liquidate some of the value of your home (read: assets) in the form of a bank loan to reinvest is entirely up to your risk appetite, which is a totally separate discussion. many people are unwilling to risk their home/nest egg which is perfectly fine. Just consider what you want to achieve etc. You have to risk it for the biscuit and currently you have an asset in your portfolio generating no return, although you can argue that it generates the return of the rent you would otherwise have to pay without it, which is valid. so again if drawing a loan on it's value, you could think of the repayments as 'rent' and you need to generate a return greater than that rent for it to be worth it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I invest in property and develop real estate for a living.

So we can write that one off. The system knows how to deal with it and the risk relationships aren't the same. (Also like 10 years of capital is in the reserve system, so banks are incentivized to INCREASE lending as balance sheet drawdown is realized and becomes less of an unknown rather than the other way around as they are already covered against toxic asset sludge.)\n\nAside from generating new housing, the only other two options for how a collapse could occur that come to mind would be:\n\n1. A population collapse and/or generational transfer that results in more sales. I wouldn't bet on this one making things better, but it has to be listed.\n2. A general earnings and economics collapse that would create an ability-to-pay divergence similar to the cause of 2008. That won't cause a precipitous crash like 2008, since we're missing the aggravating factors, and when the asset valuations drop as the inflection point is reached, that could cause short sales and property escape as people walk away from their property....\n\n...but given that the average rental property owner now is more generally financially healthy, and given that we're probably entering a deglobalizing period where higher income work will be coming back to the country, I think the only possibility for that kind of thing happening is largely regional or locality oriented, places where wage dynamics can't keep up with housing expansion... and frankly, as we've seen, people will do crazy things to afford to live in expensive locales so it's hard to see a major decline without an unknown variable resulting in a larger economic drawdown in the macro sense.\n\nNot impossible, but also not foreseeable.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

I‚Äôm middle aged, I‚Äôve seen some shit with myself, my grandparents and my parents. In 1984 my parents bought a 3 bedroom ranch in a middle class neighborhood in a fairly recession proof city ( Madison wi) they paid 60 thousand @ roughly 7-8% interest. In 2004, they sold it for 134,000. Today,the market says that same house, which hasn‚Äôt had much in the way of upgrades is valued at 220,000 with an interest rate of about 4.25. Property taxes are just short of 7000 a year for less than a half acre in Madison. In 2010, when I timed the market in a smaller town I got a 2 bdrm bungalow with garage locked in @3.25 % with an FHA. Now they say it‚Äôs worth 70,000. It‚Äôs not an neither is my parents. Mines not because properties around me turned into rentals . The housing market will cool off when people get smart and quit paying for POS‚Äôs that other people think are gold or something. It‚Äôs a matter of principle, not affordability. When you overpay for a house , your just simply bailing out someone who didn‚Äôt set aside enough for retirement or have it 2nd mortgaged to pay for their toys‚Ä¶not because it‚Äôs actually worth that much, and they are relying on that overpriced house sale to cover their asses. In the case of my parents house 220,000 with the need of a roof, water heater and possible furnace‚Ä¶is just dumb. I wouldn‚Äôt pay it.And yes , people are stupid. As long as they are stupid they will overpay. But one thing I do know is that regardless‚Ä¶rich or poor, people tend to over extend their financial leverage with their home values‚Ä¶for loans and other ventures. When you combine that with rising interest rates, and economic slowdown‚Ä¶yes the prices will in fact come down. They tightened lending rules in 2011, but 2nd mortgages they hand out like paper. It‚Äôs worse than money printing because the value is not there to begin with. If I was younger I would live as frugal as humanly possible and just wait until I could smell the desperation, just like I did in 2010 and got a deal. Because when people are paying with 2nd mortgages for 50,000 dollar pick up trucks and shit hits the fan‚Ä¶the banks and the lending market will go through a correction again. See this time around, because of the pandemic they can‚Äôt money print and cut interest to keep the economy chugging along like they could before, and there is nothing there for bank bailouts. Essentially,  they have been progressively lowering interest since 2001 to spur economic activity, that‚Äôs a long time, and it wasn‚Äôt sustainable. So yes, housing at some point will come down again‚Ä¶because there are a ton of people that just simply don‚Äôt know how to manage money.

Mortgage rates have increased 1.5% in 90 days. Doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but 50% of my buyers are within 3% of their max debt ratio 90 days ago. Now they are well over and have to buy less", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don't entirely disagree but there are some things that could happen in the future to bring prices down.  \n  \nFirst off most of these rental properties are owned by mom and pops like you just said. That means they are even more easy to hit the market given certain situations.  \n  \nFor example alot of them are owned by elderly people. When they die and leave these properties to their kids they will likely sell them considering most younger people are mobile these days moving around the nation for work. They don't have the time or ability to manage these properties like their parents. \n  \nAnother factor is these mom and pop owners aren't taking good care of the property and plan to sell when maintenance becomes too much. So selling is always an eventuality.\n  \nFor reference I have lived alot through college and some after with these types of landlords. The houses are typically not well kept.  \n    \nMany of these properties are likely retirement funds for the owners. So they will sell once they need to retire. \n  \n2. Secondly as the market prices increase it will become more and more desirable to build new homes. So supply will increase. This isn't a situation where demand just grows and grows and supply never moves to meet it. Investors and builders will take action. I think we would be seeing this already if it wasn't for covid and markets looking about to nose dive. \n  \n\n3. Urban decay and homes in general are aging to a point where we might see a spike in homes being demolished. The grid street neighborhoods of cities have most homes built around 1890 to 1950. That's where you find most of the rental property owned by mom and pops. Like I previously said they don't up keep these houses enough and so eventually they will need to be replaced. \n  \nWe already see this some with property developers buying up multiple homes in a neighborhood and building new homes on the property.   \n  \nSimply put there is an upcoming bubble of homes that will get so old and decayed that they will need to be torn down. Alot of mom and pop owners own them and don't want to pay to rebuild. So they will have to start unloading these houses for cheap like an old car that's on its last legs. \n  \nLand prices are another interesting factor. While they continue to climb at the moment they may go down in the future if crop prices stay low and farmers start to sell land. Another thing is many farmers are getting older and their sons are established in other jobs or don't have the money or time to pick up the family farms. They'll be selling it.  \n  \nMy last factor and what I think will be the biggest factor in the future of home prices is urban flight. As rural areas gain similar internet speeds to the city and also self driving vehicles and working from home becomes more common we will see rural property become more inviting to people currently in cities.  \n  \nIt's cheaper cost of living out there, smaller community, less crime, better public schools, and so on. \n  \nSo we will see alot of people living in those urban areas moving out to the rural areas. Smaller towns and cities. \n  \nTbh it's even more convenient living in those places for families.
