My own opinion is people should wait a little longer because while there is always more downside to the stock,  the price is so cheap now that the odds will be to the upside once this market finds it’s footing. FB is projected to grow to $134M in sales this year from $117M last year (15%). It trades at a PE of 15 but if you strip out the cash on it’s balance sheet and stopped the $10B a year being spent on the Metaverse, it would have a PE of 10-11.   It would trade at half the PE of the S&P with double the average growth rate of 7% on the S&P.  So someone has this wrong.

Here’s the truth hedges don’t want you to know. \n\na successful trader realizes that holding a stock as it drops in value represents a loss just like not holding a stock as it rises does. I’m always baffled by the recommendation of when prices are dropping that you should hold and that you only lose money if you sell. If you consider not taking advantage of potential gains as being a loss than the truth is when a stock is in a downtrend and crashing you only lose money if you don’t sell. Here’s an easy example to demonstrate it. You start with 1000 shares that are one dollar each and as the stock is falling you sell after 10% loss at $.90 per share and you have $900 cash. When the price drops all the way to $.60 a share that $900 will purchase 1500 shares. When the price of the stock recovers to one dollar your portfolio is now worth $1500 instead of the $1000 for the person who held on the way down and back on the way up. Even when you calculate capital gains at the highest short term rate of 40% you still end up way ahead and it’s important to note that doing this is not what the “wash rule” relates to.  The truth is that any time you sell and you re-purchase at a lower price you realize owning more shares. Those additional shares translate into additional dollars when the share price rises. \n\n2) This is essentially poor man shorting. People think you must buy low and then sell high to make money and they ignore 50% of the potential gains which are in the other direction.  Sell high first AND THEN buy low creates gains just the same.  But because retail investors only think in the long terms they don’t realize that holding a stock as it drops is taking a loss. They get really anxious about selling and then maybe the stock goes up which is not owning a stock as it rises but they don’t see that holding the stock as it drops is just as bad. Buying dips and cost averaging down are terrible investing strategies considering the alternative. Mathematics simply suggest that if you sell in a downtrend you realize gains. You can even increase your gains as illustrated in the 1000 share example if you employ a put buying strategy as it falls as well.  Doing that yields even more than the 1500 shares in the previous example. So the secret is to know when the reversal is happening because the word dip implies coming back up. But what people called buying on the dip is just buying on a downtrend. \n\n3) I wasn’t involved in the Kodak buying fiasco but I helped a friend who was by directing him to sell immediately in that crazy July 2020 day and he was lucky to get $32 and he paid $56. But by buying puts with that $32 as it continued to trend down all the way to seven dollars, he actually ended up with larger gains then had it just stayed up at $62. So I’m not sure why the conventional wisdom during a crash is to not panic sell, when that’s exactly the move to take to minimize losses and maximize gains.  And the thing that causes people to not employ the strategy is their fear that if they sell instead of dropping it will rise. And yet they have no problem with holding the stock as it drops in price. And they’re both equally bad.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just hold man", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "If you liked those companies at the original purchase price, you should be in love with them now.

As supply chain congestion resolves (it's a lot better now than it was in 2021) and the Fed tightens their expansionary policies, we should be looking at an ease on overall inflation in the future. Maybe I am too optimistic but realistic speaking, we will have to see much much higher inflation numbers to see actual willingness to invest into domestic manufacturing because the ROI on domestic manufacturing under current inflation rate is non-existent. I am afraid that by the point at which the ROI on domestic manufacturing becomes feasible via a higher inflation, we are already looking at a major recession.

If you are an oil company, your future income will depend on the future price of oil. In order to make sensible budgeting decisions about how much to spend on drilling oil, you might want to lock in that future price. So you might sell oil futures today to guarantee you a price in a few months. Or you might not; you might be bullish on oil and want full unhedged exposure. Or you might hedge part of your production; if you plan to produce 1 million barrels you might only sell 500,000 barrels of futures. Or, since you are trading oil futures anyway and have some expertise in oil markets, you might end up net short, selling more oil than you plan to produce as a bet that prices will go down. But most likely you are in the oil business because you are hoping to make money drilling oil, and you are in some broad economic sense “long oil.” (You might hedge 50% or 100% or 150% of this year’s production, but you won’t hedge 100% of all of your future production.) If oil prices go down you will be sad; you will make money on your futures contracts, but that will only partly mitigate your sadness.\r  \n\r  \nConversely, if oil prices go up, you will be happy, because you produce oil and your oil is worth more.

I guess time will tell if it was worth it.\n\nI agree with your comment that time will tell. Watching with interest to see whether Tesla puts in a permit application for another big factory building there in coming months - may depend on how smoothly things go from this point. I consider it likely that Giga Berlin will do very well.\n\n> And it was especially a bad idea to build a factory before they had all the approvals.\n\nI believe it was an especially good idea to use the conditional permits - it saved them at least two years, and potentially as much as 4-5 years. The final permit was just granted last week - if Tesla had waited for that, they would only just now be able to start building. And remember that the trees can only be cleared at a certain time of the year - if the approval missed that window by only a little, they would have had to wait nearly a year more to start construction. And there have been comments that approval for a big factory site like this typically takes ~4 years in Germany - the fact that Tesla was willing to make the commitment to build on conditional permits likely motivated officials to expedite the approval process and get it done in only ~2 years - slow for other countries, but fast for Germany. The fact that Tesla did get a full construction permit means that their huge gamble paid off - few other companies would have the courage to take that gamble.\n\nAnother gamble Tesla took at the Berlin site likely cost them up to about 6 months, but it's hard to blame them for that. They had an opportunity to get about a billion Euros from the government as part of a plan to incentivize vehicle battery cell production in Germany, but the rules for the incentive required them to delay construction of the battery cell factory until until a certain date, and then another rule required that the factory in Germany be the company's first site for mass production of battery cells of that type, which means that they would have had to delay production of \n4680 cells in Austin, and ultimately Tesla decided that delaying Austin wasn't worth a billion Euros so they withdrew from the incentive application. In the meantime Tesla was able to secure a large supply of compatible 2170 battery packs from Giga Shanghai, so production can begin at Giga Berlin while they complete their 4680 battery cell factory. Meanwhile Tesla's late addition of the (delayed by the incentive application) battery cell factory to their primary construction permit application required some of the approval process to be repeated, causing maybe 3-6 months delay. But I don't blame Tesla for that decision - a billion Euros is a lot of money, and things we can see in hindsight (such as how fast progress would be in Austin) were not obvious then.

{"title": "White House is pressed on potential oil deals with Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran", "selftext": ">The White House on Monday pushed back on concerns about the Biden administration’s willingness to cut deals with countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela as it looks for ways to blunt skyrocketing fuel prices in the United States.   \n>  \n> White House press secretary Jen Psaki faced multiple questions during Monday’s briefing on how the administration views these trade-offs of bartering with countries “that may have engaged in unsavory actions in the past,” as reports trickled out in recent days that President Joe Biden and European counterparts are discussing a ban on Russian oil imports to further punish President Vladimir Putin for his country’s attack on Ukraine.  \n>  \n>The Biden administration is in a tricky position as it faces bipartisan calls to ban Russian oil, a move that would upend markets in a global economy still recovering from the pandemic. As the White House weighs its next move, inflation tops the minds of Americans feeling the squeeze of rising prices, especially at the gas pump.  \n>  \n>U.S. officials met face-to-face with Venezuelan officials in Caracas over the weekend and discussed potentially easing oil sanctions on the country as part of the strategy to combat rising prices in the U.S. During Monday’s briefing, Psaki was asked about Venezuela’s leader and whether it was “really worth doing business with a despot like Nicolás Maduro to drive down gas prices.”  \n>  \n>“I think that’s leaping several stages ahead in any process,” Psaki said, adding that oil was just one element of the discussions. “At this point in time, I don’t have anything to predict. It’s ongoing.”  \n>  \n>Psaki said that while energy security was a key part of the meetings in Venezuela, U.S. officials also discussed the welfare of detained U.S. citizens. She had a similar message on negotiations in Saudi Arabia and Iran, noting that the talks were in progress and that energy was just one piece of the multipronged discussions.\n\nTL:DR version: US is like \"yeah we've been sanctioning you hard for like forever man, but times have changed man, can you spare some oil like c'mon man\"\n\nSource: [https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/07/white-house-oil-deals-saudi-arabia-venezuela-iran-00014803](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/07/white-house-oil-deals-saudi-arabia-venezuela-iran-00014803)", "id": "t97bdw", "created_utc": 1646709791.0, "score": 503, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 364, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|12|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|90|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sxpovr/any_eagle_stonks/) \n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t97bdw)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t97bdw)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "We have literally allowed the woke generation to fuck us into a corner and potentially start WWIII.

It’s not the same for you and me, because our income isn’t predicated on a specific subset of workers. Saying everyone is predicated on all of the workers around the world is technically correct, but then we’re all either capitalists or were not. It doesn’t apply in this example.\n\n\n> Making money from sponsorships is certainly not capitalism.  You can't invest your likeness in other asset classes, you can't deposit it in a bank.  It might not perfectly fit the criteria of labor, but it's one bad example of being a capitalist.\n\nYou absolutely can invest your likeness in assets, most just choose to exchange it for cash. You can trademark it and receive royalties, or license it out to others as well, the same way you would with a commercial product or asset.\n\nI’m not sure how it’s a bad example of capitalism? Capitalism is about the ownership of production, not how you get your income. If a likeness is a source of economic output, then it can be considered a capitalist asset. Maybe there is some labor involved with the transaction of the likeness, but you could say that about any asset purchase.\n\nI don’t really see how licensing out your likeness is any different then renting out a house you’ve bought. Both are assets that generate passive income. \n\n> If they're making money from real estate or other investments, yeah, okay, that's an example.  You're still splitting hairs to miss my point.  If you labor for your money, you are working class.  If your money comes from the growth of wealth which already exists, you're part of the owner class, the capitalist class, the Bourgeoisie.  It's not about quantity, it's about source.\n\nBut plenty of capitalists labor for an income too. And plenty of regular people derive passive income from investments, real estate etc. In fact I would bet a majority of workers do in some form. Your average worker might make more money from their house and 401k appreciating over their lifetime than whatever their total wages are.\n\nI think you are fixated on passive vs wage-income, when the delineating factor of capitalism is about private ownership of production. Someone with a small business that makes 100k/year is not in the same class as someone pulling in 30 million, no matter how you slice it.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "You will own nothing and be happy. \n\nWe will own everything and be very, very happy.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "I've started college in my 30s now to try to push myself past the middle class.

Like truly, how is everyone feeling during these times because as much as we want to try to add humor to our mega capital losses through memes and trying to brush it off, I know some of you are still looking in the mirror asking how could you lose all that money you worked soo hard for. Money you probably needed or money your family could use. Maybe it was tuition money or money for a rainy day. Regardless, losing is part of trading but it sure beats you down and makes you lose confidence in ever trading again. It may even traumatize you enough to the point you may never trade the same way and that’s okay. \n\nI personally have been there when i first started investing solo, no advisors and strictly going with my gut picks on individual stocks instead of just investing more into my 401k or into ETFs to reduce risk and take tax advantage. What happened literally a few days after i poured a bunch of money into the market  on my individual picks i researched a ton on? The pandemic hit LOL, how lucky right? Never seen 50% of my investment disappear like that before with no idea what to do because I was a novice of trading solo. I had shares and looking back I could’ve averaged down and kept holding. Instead i sold at 50% loss and I tried soo hard to get my losses back. I shorted the market and invested in gold stocks and luckily for me it panned out after months of grinding. But had i even done nothing and held my shares i would not only have made my money back but some of these at ath were at 10x+. Not saying i would’ve diamond held for that long but my point is this:\n\nIdentify what you did wrong and mitigate it from ever happening again. If you trust your stock picks just hold and keep avg down on any big drops. Have stop losses and try to learn through paper trading or through tiny investments first before going ballz deep. When you win keep in mind someone else is losing so take your wins and temporarily celebrate but be grateful you were on the winning side and thank the players for their sacrifice. Many people lose a ton of money and never trade again. My advice is to never give up if you truly enjoy the process because i obsessed over trading everyday. I am no pro, but I learned a ton through losing and I’m glad I didn’t give up because I love trading, i love researching, i love business, and I love these communities where we can share each other’s stories and help one another win and beat the big man. \n\nHats off to all you apes 🦍 who keep on grinding everyday and keep learning and invest in yourself to get better at your craft because practice and experience does make the difference. I am not a millionaire nor am I telling you to do anything, but my passion is telling stories and experiences that can help others going through similar situations and letting them know it will be Okay. \n\nI believe in you my fellow apes 🦍 and keep on keeping on!\n\nEDIT: The market is down 20% so that is considered 🐻 territory. Do we have more room down? Who knows. I am hedging my bets with some puts/shorts but not much invested. My post wasn’t to tell everyone the world is ending and to buy puts, but to let everyone who feels discouraged to not give up and keep grinding because you will recover. Just learn from your mistakes. Unless you have info no one else does, probably best to go cash gang or safer plays like VOO.\n\nSince yall wont stop bugging me and lost the purpose of my post: \nMy positions: \n\nUVXY shares and April 20, $20c\nQQQ Puts june 2023\nRTX and LMT shares\nXLE 3/18 $71c", "id": "t99tvz", "created_utc": 1646718332.0, "score": 116, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|241|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t99tvz)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t99tvz)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Big props.

It's more volatile and everyone has a hate on for growth/tech stocks in favor of commodities.\n\nLooking at SPY for the forst time in a while, looks like it could bottom as low as $380.\n\nIf you look at the Volume Profile, there is little support at its current level. Looking at the market, there is little liquidity and not many buyers. That doesn't bode well for the market.\n\nWhat has been happening is little pops of green days that lure people back in the market. A lot of it is just rotaing money. Buy growth, dump it when it climbs and switch to commodities. Dump those when they climb and rotate back into growth. Rinse, repeat. \n\nSame thing with financial sectors, airlines, utilities, weed stocks. You can see it today. Airlines sold off like a motherfucker on oil news. Oil shot to the moon.\n\nOil and commodities and metals sold off today to a certain extent. Airlines jumped back up. Next Airlines will be sold off and something else will jump.\n\nThe market makers are always ahead of retail investors. If some catalyst hits the news cycle, you've already missed the boat. Retail money dumps in, market makers sell off.\n\nThe problem is that it's a range and finding a bottom is tricky. That's why most people, and I advocate buying VERY SMALL amounts as it drops.\n\nSPY isn't going to pop 20% in a day. If you miss the actual bottom, you aren't going to miss out on much profit (which people are always paranoid about). So pace your purchases and keep your bankroll.\n\nRight now, all the macro indicators and measures of the economy look like dog shit. \n\nWe are 100% heading for a recession and, based on how extreme everything has been, it will be a big one.\n\nSo wait for those to start trending up in addition to the market. And I mean CONSISTENTLY.\n\nPeople are optimistic. And that's nice. Except when it fucks you.\n\nPeople are impatient and emotional. That's not helpful when trading.\n\nI hold stocks that are about 1/2 of my shorts/SQQQ. Stocks I believe in long term that are undervalued.\n\nAs they turn red (5% down or so) I buy tiny amounts. When they turn green (again, 5% or so), I sell. \n\nIf I see any big swing plays, I dump more cash in. Last week and yesterday, I bought oil, gold, silver, palladium, wheat. Bought Airlines yesterday. They jumped 10% today. Again, I have small amounts so I may hold and wait for their eventual recovery in a year (or whenever it will be).\n\nDo I miss profits? Maybe. Do I care? No. I want a stable return. In this market, I'll take a 5% return on a stock that jumps. If I miss out on another 15%, so be it. It's dumb to take a risk like that in this market.

The liquidity in the market is so small volume because big money is playing safe or cash gang, and i have not seen that money pile back in yet which is why you see big tech stocks trading like penny stocks lol. \n\nYou say recession but this will be a depression era, although part of me says we print money out of that era like we did with covid, otherwise we will be in stagflation, depression like the likes we have never seen before. \n\nThese pumps are all bull traps which is what i keep telling ppl because we will just make new lows. For me to see upwards movement will need to see many green confirmations and follow through days.\nWe ALMOST had follow through days a month or so ago but it got rejected which is why i continued to short market.

Consumer staples and cheap shit is all that's going to sell.\n\nYeah. The Fed may ride to the rescue. But first they have to rein shit it a lot. They need the equity market to off gas its bubble and inflation to come down.\n\nYou can see the pump and dump shit market makers are doing. WEAT goes parabolic then off a cliff, airlines tank 10% yesterday then up 10%, oil goes up pre-Russia news then sells off (probably to be rebought). Same with metals (though that's still ongoing).\n\nMy guess is green stocks are next. They've been pumped.

But the future isn't now. \n\nIt happened a lot during the COVID crash. People buying heavy on airlines, cruise lines, green energy etc. in anticipation of demand and profits. But they weren't prepared to wait. And those stocks went insane because of people having free money.\n\nWhen I look at ENPH's chart, it really looks like an artificial fad rally t the moment based on instituons knowing that people will think \"Oil is so high. EV and GREEN is the future!\" and buy them.\n\nI'm anticipating a dump of all those. Any chart that's 1 month or more seems to affirm that. Institutions will cycle back in when they're done shaking out the easy money.\n\nEVs are absolutely the future. But car sales were off the charts 2020-2021. People only buy one car (maybe two) every few years. Consumer discretionary is tanking, commodities to manufacture them are pricey..\n\nSo I'm waiting for a good long entry on all of them once the current hype calms down. If one EV or green company posts shit projections for 2022 that'll be all it will take. \n\nLike you, I have commodities and enegy stocks - but I've been swing trading. Taking profits when they pump. Grabbing small amounts when they dump. \n\nI have been doing the same with metals (PPTL PALL SLV GLD GDX) and fertilizer/Agriculture (MOS SMG DBA GRWG VFF) They all still have room to climb but might see a pullback first.\n\nMilitary stocks are worth a thought LMT GD BA, KTOS, MAXR. Current war has caused people to invest more in military (though I still need to research who supplies Europe with their gear).\n\nI'm holding TLT. Based on: \n\nBonds are ignored as an asset class. That will likely change pretty quickly when the market tanks. People completely misunderstand how yields work, thinking they will rise. They'll drop first. Because of that miscalculation, bonds are really undervalued. Better yet, they are incredibly heavily shorted. \n\nThey won't shine for a while yet. But they will have their day. I've got a small long position and some waaaay far out ITM calls.\n\nADM KO DLTR MKC MCD are also worth a look (along with COST but that's not really well priced). Consumer staples and discount goods are king in a recession. \n\nI have a mix of the top holdings of XLF (why pay the fee when you can buy banks yourself easily). FCFS UPST (that's been fun to swing trade).  Lending seems like a distant idea but it's coming soon enough. Banks do well with higher interest rates. And they're priced lower now because of Russia.\n\nCXW is also a sad but smart stock choice, IMO. A lot of unrest is coming.\n\nThen there are the chip stocks that will have their comeback in a long time to consider. I'm taking very small positions on the best of those when they drop.\n\nGood health sector stocks seem smart. Same thing with cybersecurity (CIBR PANW - though they just had a short term pump) as well as robotics and weed along with MNMD (which will need some years to pay off, probably). Big data is also a good choice, IMO. \n\nI'm also looking beyond our borders now. \n\nThe U.S. trade deficit is at all time highs. The dollar is on a rip. I'm looking at countries that are doing better than us in a lot of ways.\n\nRecently, a lot of money hit the U.S. equity market based on its stability. I think theyre rethinking that now. That money is going to go elsewhere for the next while. Some of mine will too.\n\nI'm still researching the best foreign markets to look at while holding FRDM until I get more specific ideas. EEM looks near bottom too.\n\nEWW is a thought. Based on:\n\nBig imports to the U.S. (who is close so that will mitigate transportation costs soaring). They didn't go insane with financial assistance during the pandemic too. Debt to GDP is half America's.\n\nAgriculture economy (50% of land area is agricultural) which will fare well with the insane food shortages and prices. \n\n2019 saw 23.46% of their energy produced from green sources so the oil mess won't hit them as hard. \n\nThe EWW chart looks a lot more gentle than QQQ SPY. 6 month chart all the way to 5yrs. shows solid support $43-$45. 2yr. shows solid support around current levels.\n\nAnd they are about the last country on earth who will get involved in the geopolitical mess (though domestic politics can be an obvious concern).\n \nOther options are MELI, ILF, EWZ, EIDO, EPI, EWY, VNM.\n\nI can't vouch for those yet. I don't have enough research done.\n\nI would be all over Chinese stocks. They aren't about to start shit with the U.S. and are playing the middle when it comes to Russia. China is out for China. The best strategy is not to ruffle any feathers and trade with everyone. They are the U.S.'s biggest trading partner.
