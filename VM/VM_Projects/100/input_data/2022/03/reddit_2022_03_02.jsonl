We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.‚Äù\n\nThe remarks come amid 40-year highs for inflation in the U.S., complicated by a Ukraine war that has driven oil prices to around their highest levels in a decade. Consumer prices increased 7.5% from a year ago in January, and the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge showed its strongest 12-month gain since 1983.\n\nPowell and his fellow policymakers have been indicating for weeks that they plan to start raising benchmark interest rates to tackle inflation. He reiterated the stance Wednesday that the process will involve ‚Äúinterest rate increases,‚Äù along with indications that the Fed eventually will start reducing its bond holdings.\n\n‚ÄúWe will use our policy tools as appropriate to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched while promoting a sustainable expansion and a strong labor market,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have phased out our net asset purchases. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, we expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at our meeting later this month.‚Äù\n\nInflation still expected to fall\n\nThe Fed will start cutting the size of its asset holdings after rate hikes have begun, he added.\n\nSince the beginning of the Covid pandemic, the Fed has been buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities at the fastest pace ever, driving the total holdings on the central bank balance sheet to nearly $9 trillion.\n\nPowell said the reduction will be conducted ‚Äúin a predictable manner,‚Äù largely through allowing some proceeds from the bonds to roll off each month rather than reinvesting them.\n\nOn the economy, the chairman said he still expects inflation to decelerate through the year as supply chain issues are resolved. He called the labor market ‚Äúextremely tight‚Äù and noted strong wage gains, particularly for lower earners and minorities.\n\n‚ÄúWe understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe know that the best thing we can do to support a strong labor market is to promote a long expansion, and that is only possible in an environment of price stability.‚Äù\n\nMarkets have fully priced in a rate increase at the March 15-16 meeting but have decreased expectations for the rest of the year since the Ukraine war began, according to CME group data.

First let me say I'm not an accountant and financial business is complex, so I could be wrong on some of this, but it's my understanding:\n\nFord lends money to car buyers and dealers. Ford also lends money to dealers to finance the building of their dealership.\n\nA single car transaction usually goes like this:\n\nFord builds a car -> Dealer takes a loan from Ford -> Dealer uses loan to buy car (this is called a wholesale and this is what Ford counts as a sale) -> Dealer pays interest to Ford until they sell the car -> Customer buys the car -> Dealer uses the money from the sale to pay back the loan -> customer finances the Car with Ford credit and pays it back over 3-8 years with interest.\n\nAll of that interest/payments show up as \"financial receivables\" in the Assets section of Ford's balance sheet.\n\nNow, where does Ford get all the money to lend to dealers and customers? They borrow it themselves, at lower interest rates than the rates on their dealer/customer loans. \n\nFord takes a bunch of those consumer loans and bundles them into an asset backed security, and sells it to investors who can trade it on the market. Investors get interest from Ford. \n\nThis is debt - they must make payments on the money they've borrowed.\n\nFord also issued bonds directly to the market. This is more debt. They also borrow from banks/lenders in private transaction. \n\nSee their notes in the 10K: \n\n>Our debt consists of short-term and long-term secured and unsecured debt securities, and secured and unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders.  Debt issuances are placed directly by us or through securities dealers or underwriters and are held by institutional and retail investors.  In addition, Ford Credit sponsors securitization programs that provide short-term and long-term asset-backed financing through institutional investors in the U.S. and international capital markets.\r\n\nSo, long story short, you're seeing as debt the money they borrow to run the whole Ford Credit operation. You have to balance that against items in the Assets section of the balance sheet to see the upside of Ford Credit.\n\nThe debt Ford Credit has is often backed directly by assets (cars), or is pretty safe because the debt is rolled forward into the loans made to dealerships, who *rarely but not never* default.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the write up!

Powerplants can too, but you don't need to physically transport it across a battle zone. Second, digital payment systems for chargers other than Tesla aren't guaranteed to keep operating. So the people are whining that it's just for rich Tesla owners and they can easily afford it. That is of course not the point. Now everyone can charge up at will regardless of their payment system. Third, it's also across the borders which means people can use electric cars to shuttle people into safety without being reliant on overcrowded gas stations.\n\nHow likely is it that any of these situations arise? Hard to tell, that's why they are doing it as a precaution. Imagine Kiev being overrun and the Russians decide to accept massive amounts of collateral damage, you now have over a million non combatants that need to be displaced all at once.

Since Microsoft already owns all of their IP, and development studios, they can distribute that software on their platforms without paying a publisher to distribute their software.  This one also has a crazy supportive investor base, which is really good for growth in companies, in my experience. (See TSLA, AMD (2015-current), all off KREEEEEPTO, etc)\n\nMSFT is building a multi-platform Steam store + marketplace.  In other-words, Microsoft is targeting PC, and Xbox (plus more??? ) with one distribution software, and possibly a completely shared ecosystem, that could rival the experiences provided by Steam...?  Or not, all that matters about this deal is that sweet $24.99 price-point that competitors cannot compete with in the GameStop deal.\n\nAMD is the world leading semi-conductor manufacturing company as far as CPU technology goes, and they have best in class leadership given the massive turn-around AMD has seen in the last 5 years.  They also have contracts to produce nearly all of the console hardware, as well as server spaces (looking at you FF14), which is a massive market that has pretty fast consumer turn-over rates, and pretty decent margins.\n\nNVDA fills in the gaps that AMD does not, by targeting PCs, game development tools, AI supersampling research.  It's been clear that the software that Nvidia writes is closed source, which while anti-consumer, does lock their position in the marketplace through things such as G-sync, and other software closed source solutions.  As AMD grows, NVDA could shrink, but honestly, they seem to grow in tandem historically as semi-conductor research + engineering progresses into the new unknown.\n\nAAPL handles the mobile sector, since they get their grimy fingers on 30% of all downstream app-store sales.  Even if those percentages go down, the public opinion of Apple isn't going anywhere, since the strong majority seem to still choose Apple products over competition in the latest versions.  Mobile gaming is nearly half of the entire gaming population representation by $ value in the US, and Apple directly targets 90% of the population, compounded with their downstream sales leeches, they basically already are the ecosystem that GME, and MSFT are trying to create for consoles.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll 4 of these companies have lots of on-hand cash, which is probably one of the more appealing things about them, outside of all the things detailed above.  They have secured their roadmap to grow in the future, as well as sustain themselves today, which is the first indication of a fantastic value in my opinion.  They have also seen growth independent of each other, and in some markets, even competing against each other.  This means that they are strong companies with secured potential futures, and direct growth correlated to the gaming sector of the market, which should give you very strong direct exposure to the growth of gaming in the stock market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Edit: AAPL -> AAPL)", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "GME is selling physical media in an age of digital download and streaming.
