Interestingly enough, Globalstar received three separate payments totaling $100MM for engineering services from a ‚Äòsecret customer‚Äô about a year or so ago. In their latest ER, Globalstar announced they will be buying 17 new satellites (with an option of 9-more satellites if needed). These new satellites will be nearly fully paid by this ‚Äòsecret customer‚Äô, i.e., they will pay for 95% of the costs associated with the satellites. As of now, this secret customer will be spending about $520MM to Globalstar. That‚Äôs a lot of money. It limits the players to only a handful of potential players.\n\nAbout a year go or so, Qualcomm announced they will integrate Globalstar‚Äôs n53 technology into their flagship 5G modems. Apple will be using Qualcomms X65 modems on their next iPhone 14; which uses Globalstar‚Äôs technology.\n\nSo, at the moment, many are speculating that these two companies are working together.
