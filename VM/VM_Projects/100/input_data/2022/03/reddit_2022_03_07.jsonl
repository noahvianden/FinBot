You waste money trading wide bid/ask spreads.\n\nIVW has just about the worst liquidity I've seen. If the bid/ask is wider than 10% of the bid at the ATM strike, think twice about using that chain. The April ATM strike's bid/ask is almost 50% of the bid. My advice, stay far, far away from that chain.\n\nHere's why. Within the bid/ask are price points that buyers will buy at and sellers will sell at. It's the \"real\" price they want to trade at, if you will. For example, for a buyer, they may want to buy for $1.00 but will settle for $1.10. Nobody knows what those \"real\" price targets are, but you can assume they are within the bid/ask spread.\n\nThis means that the narrower the bid/ask, the more likely you are going to trade at a \"real\" price, rather than an inflated/discounted one. For example, if the bid/ask is $1.00/$1.01, there's no room to overpay/undersell. You'll hit the real price every time just by using the bid or the ask. But if the bid/ask spread is $1.00/$2.00, there is all sorts of room in that spread to overpay/undersell. Like say a buyer is willing to buy your call at $1.40, but you offer $1.30 and they fist-pump for the money you allowed them to keep.\n\n**Wide spreads mean a higher chance you will overpay/undersell**.\n\nSo instead of worrying whether or not your order will \"execute\", you should worry more about how much you might be missing the real price if it does execute.

The purpose of which is to ensure economic consequences to Russia which then destabilizes Putin's ability to remain effectively a dictator, by making overtaking Ukraine as difficult as possible. \n\nThe only reason Ukraine can't be helped beyond the support given, is because it isn't and wasn't in the NATO alliance *yet*, since that takes time to establish. Ukriane, however, was intending to join which is part of why Putin attacked now.\n\nI don't know if you intended it to sound this way, but your comment on Finland and Sweden being attacked is entirely too cavalier to how disasterous that would be as well. Ukraine being attacked is terrible enough and not to be see lightly.\n\nIn regards to communism... I made no such statement. What I would like to see expansion of is forms of socialism we already have in the United States. Meaning medicare, medicaid as you mentioned. Also, infrastructure improvement, social help programs...what our tax dollars pay for that helps the public.

Times are scary, and there is an infinite amount of things to be mad or scared about, so I hope this is more helpful than simply adding to concerns!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Problem is giving supplies, weapons, permission for citizens to fight in Ukraine, and fighter jets could all be argued to be NATO entering war with Russia. Those supplies and permission for citizens to go fight is everything short of declaring war or sending troops. Russia knows NATO is fearing nuclear war, thats why they will not stop them in any country including Sweden or Finland. What we are doing could be seen as declaring war on Russia which can equal a nuclear response. \n\nThe fact that Ukraine is receiving so many supplies and weapons kindof proves Russian fears or point about Ukraine being in the pocket of the US and NATO. I say kindof because it technically is still a cold war between us. But if Russia annexes Ukraine then we will start to see some terrible progression towards other countries. The fact that the west is already removing all the services and sending citizens with weapons, the nuclear war brewing has now been instigated. Instead of being neutral, we now have started to slowly declare war with Russia.\n\nThis 10 billion being spent could lead to nuclear war because we decided to not be neutral. We are taking sides with the country they are invading. Such a dumb move. \n\nHas anyone told you that Medicare and other welfare services has risen costs for the average American? When hospitals are not earning 100% but 80% of Medicare costs then the hospital raises prices. Leading to the highest inflation imaginable. Hospitals either choose to close or raise prices for all services hoping insurance and the government pay for it. Thats why some doctors and hospitals do not take Medicare patents. They do not pay the bills because the government can refuse the full amount. \n\nIs this the first time you're hearing that universal healthcare is a communist and fascist policy? Free college and free healthcare was literally a Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany talking point. If we did that then the entire global medical system would collapse. Israel and America are the only countries left doing medical R&D. They make up 80%. The government does not innovate, private markets do. \n\nThe best thing we could do is remove Medicare and remove the government entirely and medical costs will go down overnight, literally. There is a reason why doctors have to be approved after medical school by the government, to limit private hospitals and private costs. They would be much lower if all the government did was regulate drug patents correctly.\n\nEdit: You're right, its not just a communist thing it was a fascist thing in Germany and Italy. Those NATO countries and all universal healthcare countries relies on American R&D. Look at any medical R&D statistic. America is by far the largest and without their private market the global market would collapse because no one researches drugs anymore. Governments cannot innovate. Germany relies on American markets just like they rely on us for military support. \n\nHealth insurance was not the cause of inflation, it was Medicare and the government refusing to pay for services hospitals charge. Medicine is cheaper in other countries because of hospitality from private companies giving their medicine over for a loss. Doctors are actually harder to find in these countries for advanced procedures due to the government unable to pay for their services. Universal healthcare lowers standards because they have to lower educational standards like they did in China or South America, or force doctors to work for less money against their will. Those are your two options in America. Lower quality of the education they give, reducing the years to gain a degree, or force doctors to work for more patents for less funds. \n\nThe answer to medical improvements will not be found in a class room, it will come from listening to doctors and hospitals and economic opinions about medicine. Where did you think I saw and heard all of these opinions? Out of my ass? They came from CA state colleges pertaining to medical economics. I recommend going to a hospital and talking with a doctor or taking a basic economics class. The proper debates will not be found in a Poli Sci class where fascist and communist policies are given green lights as smart policies in America. They will be found in Economic classes. This is not up for debate, the science has been debunked.

Where on Earth would you get that impression? Pretty sure we have at least one of the Covid vaccines as proof of that, which was discovered in Germany. Canada, South Korea and almost all the NATO European counties have forms of universal healthcare and college education too. \n\nUniversal healthcare would actually eliminate the need for Medicare, but until we have that, Americans are depending on Medicare for getting healthcare at all. The biggest cause to inflation of health costs within the US is the fact that we have need for health insurance companies in the first place. That is why the cost of the same exact medicine is cheaper in other countries, and you can get a doctor faster who isn't crushed in their own form of debt from the cost of their medical education.

Energy, resource, commodity costs, a manufacturing base at the whim of a totalitarian government allied with an aggressive nuclear armed Russia, that coincidentally produces alot of the nitrogen needed for food fertilizer (also imported) and a majority of the populace terrorized by a virus and environmental catastrophe despite no stomach for reasonable domestic measures to take to avoid said environmental catastrophe in the short term.\n\nYou can't code this away.

Your line of thinking is how so many companies developed inflated valuations. Thinking that big revenues will easily lead to profitability (actual positive earnings and profit). Revenue is great and all but what investors care more about is how much profit they're making/going to make. You need revenue to eventually turn a profit, but EPS is not only dependent on revenue. PTON and FB are great examples for different reasons. For PTON they have good revenue and seemed to have a decent customer base but they hemorrhage money in order to generate that revenue. If they could somehow consolidate and turn a profit with their current user base then they'd probably increase in valuation a ton. However, their future growth in terms of gaining more customers is definitely slowing down yet they aren't that much closer to turning a profit. FB is a massive cash cow and revenue generator but because they're investing more money into their own company going forward to pursue metaverse things their EPS will be lower despite an enormous revenue stream. FB will continue to have huge revenues and if they stopped pursuing metaverse then their EPS would go back to an absurd level but they're banking on metaverse being their next big thing.

Decreasing profits with higher inflation and rate hikes will make those small profits look even worse. If you're not generating profit at least equal to inflation then your company is worth less than they were the month before or the year before (whatever inflation metric you're choosing mom or yoy/). Profits and the potential for future profits are a better indicator to battle against inflation than revenue.

But again, revenue doesn't mean as much as EPS and better yet, future EPS. There was a huge valuation spike because they could keep growing their revenue AND profits if WFH continued due to covid. As soon as the main driver of their business model subsided (covid restrictions) then their revenue and profit stream potential also got cut, and therefore their valuation got cut. Add onto that their limited moat due to other well-known companies like MSFT and GOOG now having competing platforms and that potential future profit gets chopped again. They might have a bright future but when people already contract with MSFT for Outlook and office and they get MSFT's version for free then there's little motivation to pay for ZM.

In addition to that core principle - when many are fearful, it may be time to begin being greedy. \n\nIf you are investing within your means and planning for a future in 3 decades, your advice is wrong for me. You said earlier that it is arguable that the short term is more predictable than the long term. That is the point we have been debating. I did not misunderstand you. I responded to points you said, whether or not you meant them is up to you. I dont know your brain. But you are simply wrong in that the short term is easier to predict than the long term, if you are open to the consensus of professionals in the field.

Tesla is on track to have around $75B in revenue - not earnings - in 2022.\n\nEven if Tesla revenue grows at 70% in 2022, 2023, 2024, and they have a net margin of 25% in 2024, their earnings will be “only” 66B. 75B in earnings in 2024 seems a little far fetched to me.\n\n2022 has *de facto* growth built in as two new factories come online. New factories and shortage economy could squelch gross margins a bit without price increases. \n\n2023 is a key year. 2023 has the launch of the CT as well as the first complete year with three giga factories. That’s the lynchpin here. \n\n2024 will be about figuring out the secret sauce, pricing wise, to selling >4M units of 5 models. \n\nI’m thinking we hit 1.7M deliveries in 2022 and 3.2M in 2023.

Say energy and services creep into the positive territory and they are now profiting 45% of their gross auto profit, that’s a bottom line profit of 23B in 2023.\n\nThis tracks with the net income basically doubling from 2021 (5.519B) to 2022 (11B) to 2023 (23B) so this is still very significant growth.

Let's also say that the ASP is still 50k. This seems high to me for 6M deliveries, but let's give the benefit of the doubt, especially considering inflation.\n\nThat's **$300B in auto revenue**.\n\nNow, say they've continued to increase their margins and they are now at 35% margin. Again, high to me especially given that their ASP remains 50k but supply costs probably have gone up over the next three years.\n\n.35\\* 300B = **$105B in gross automotive profit**.\n\nCurrently, as I noted in my post above, their net income is around 40% of their gross automotive profit.\n\nLet's say that energy is taking off and is profitable by 2024 (this is competing with the 6M vehicles produced, but let's not take that into account).\n\nService is now also slightly profitable.\n\nIn all, they are now earning 50% of their gross auto profit (this means they're **netting 10.5B from energy and services**).\n\nThis rosy scenario brings home **$50B in net income in 2024.** I just can't see where they get to anything like 70, 80 B in earnings that quickly. My scenario assumes their margins are going up, they're still at 50k/car, they have infinite batteries, etc.\n\nAnd say they do get to this point. Everytime you scale up you have to do more to continue that growth. If you just made 6M cars *and* enough powerwalls and megapacks to earn probably $8-9B, does the world have enough batteries to yield 50% increase in 2025 all over again? That's 9M cars. Do you have two more gigafactories ready to come online at full speed in 2025 to produce those 3M new cars? These would all affect the P/E ratio. I couldn't say what it will be but I'd hazard a guess that if they pulled this off the stock would be around $4k so that gives you an 80 P/E ratio.

[Biden is as of right now desperately reaching out to the Iranians and Venezuelans trying to negotiate deals with each to restore their oil production back into the global markets.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/us-officials-make-rare-trip-to-venezuela-discuss-resuming-oil-imports-to-help-replace-russian-fuel/ar-AAUHQCs?ocid=BingNewsSearch) The higher oil prices go, the better it is for high cost per barrel offshore-oil producers like Transocean and shale producers. (Yes, i am long Transocean and have been for years unfortunately).\n2. Higher oil prices will result in continued obscene inflation. Higher gasoline and oil costs means higher transportation costs, which means the price of literally everything will continue to go up. Since petrochemicals are also heavily used in the production of fertilizer, in the long term fertilizer costs and resultingly agricultural products will go up as well.\n3. [Any blanket tariffs on Russian exports into the United States will result in Palladium continuing to go up. Right now there is a 0% tariff set on the import into the United States of Palladium from anywhere. Since Russian palladium makes up a plurality of supply, any tariff on Russian palladium will cause the price to go up even more, and resultingly cause vehicle and electronics prices to rise (both which use palladium).](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s72z1u/how_to_profit_off_a_russian_invasion_of_ukraine/) In the instance of tariffs, your favorite Soviet vodkas will also be more expensive.

This is in the same way that other materials and goods that may be largely found in the US are also priced accordingly to a global market.\n\n2.  There’s a reluctance to drill for more oil domestically because oil companies don’t want to see a repeat of 2019/2020.  You see, when the domestic oil supply was the highest, it brought down the price of oil per barrel.  This meant the return in investment was less and those same oil producers also lost out when it came to their shares on Wall Street.  Oil producers are a company just like any other and they want to see fat profits instead of losing out.\n\n3. During the final year of the Trump presidency, when oil was tanking and oil producers were losing money left and right, the Trump administration had a solution: let’s cut down on supply so that oil prices would rise back up.  They did this in coordination with OPEC and agreed to cut back millions of barrels of oil a day starting in April and lasted all the way through to the end of his presidency.  It was estimated during this time that US oil production was cut by 500k-700k barrels of oil a day.  Again, this was the Trump administrations own doing as a response to free falling gas prices. \n\n4. So now we are in another pickle: more scarce supply or a fear of less supply. No matter how the administration responds there’s no easy way out of this.  Even if you announce that you’re going to drill the entire arctic for oil, that would take months/years for that supply to flood the market. Hence why he’s going to these other countries. He wants to tap into their oil reserves to immediately flood the market and bring down the price of oil. Will it work?

Oil and gas investments have decreased since 2014 and are the lowest they’ve been in years.  Now, there several reasons for this but I would hope you would keep in mind that even before you talk about the Biden administration policies you can’t forget:\n\n1. California and other blue states represent some of the largest car markets in the country and California sets its own standards and has said they want to eliminate ICE engines. Other blue states are following their lead. \n\n2. The European Union has committed to eliminating ICE cars. \n\n3. The “modern green movement” as I like to call it really started in around 2014.  And it started to take hold even while Trump was taking office.  You had people like Greta Thunberg that were holding movements against any company that had an anti-environmental stance. This caused these companies to commit to going green to save PR. \n\n4. Major car companies like Ford and GM have committed to going EV only by a certain time period (I believe 2030) and want to compete to be the next Tesla. \n\nSo I mean if you’re an oil and gas company and you look at all of that, why would you want to invest in producing more oil? It doesn’t make financial sense in the long run.
