Since the pandemic started, the trend has been that people are leaving HCOL (high cost of living) areas like DC, NY, SFO, LA for cheaper areas like Las Vegas, Florida, Texas, really anywhere else that has major cities and isn't too rural. I can speak to Florida and Las Vegas because I live in one and was seriously looking in the other. These days, $300k doesn't get you much in either, and the locals (who don't already own a home) are upset, and hoping for a correction or a crash, but the problem with that theory is that people who are moving to Florida and Vegas are coming from much more expensive places to live and have the salary to afford houses much more expensive than $300-400k. There will come a point of equilibrium where housing stops increasing 20% YoY in those areas, however when a 3/2 in DC costs $800k, and a 3/2 in Florida runs $350-400k, know that there is probably still growth ahead. I don't see a 3/2 in FL ever costing as much as a 3/2 in DC, DC is and always will be a high-demand area, same as SFO, LA, Seattle, etc. but the trend is FL TX NV UT real estate moving towards real estate prices in those HCOL cities. Nobody knows where it will stop. It will probably stop at different points for different cities. Nevada for example is a literal desert so I'm skeptical that Las Vegas would continue to match the price growth of Tampa, FL. Still, for all we know we could see a relatively-average home in Vegas go for $500k in the next couple of years.\n\nPersonally I think Florida real estate is approaching equilibrium (the point at which YoY growth returns to \\~4% as it usually has been) when the average 3/2 is $500k. Vegas I see being somewhat lower, maybe $400k. Austin, TX I also see being somewhat lower, $350-400k.\n\nSo really you have to look at it on a case-by-case basis. I am \"bullish\" on FL and NV real estate for the next 2 years, but it does seem like we should see an equal and opposite reduction in demand for New England real estate. I personally would not buy DC/DMV real estate or NJ real estate right now. I still see under $300k all day long for houses in NJ where I am looking (northern NJ) but they are usually very old, outdated and small houses.\n\nUltimately, I think the money will be coming from the same place it always has- the paychecks of high-earners. You still make a boat load more working for a DC-based company than you ever would working for a FL-based company. Very few people would be selling stocks to move from DC or NY to FL I would think.\n\nTLDR: There are areas in the US where I would not buy real estate right now that are probably overvalued, but for the areas where people have been flocking to I see no reason why that growth would slow or come to a halt in 2022, and I am optimistic about 2023. Some are saying there will be a recession by 2024-2025, and at that point I do see a bit of a housing pullback nationwide.

I was told it's a bull run and with covid recovery and everything that a second large drop was \"near improbable\" so soon after, etc. Now they're saying we are in a recession and this is just the beginning. I'm bullish long term (EOY), bearish short term. I knew inflation would catch up with the wallets of Americans, especially as wages have stagnated or went up at a lesser rate than inflation for a large majority of Americans. Furthermore, I knew stimulus money was running out, so as Govt stopped buying bonds AND civilians run out of their stim money, foot traffic of retail would go down. I honestly thought unemployment would be more of an issue due to wage demand as businesses have endured a lot of cost increases on top of, so I figured hiring would slow or stop, as managers can't afford workers they desperately need. Businesses have done a good job at trying to reach an equilibrium of passing costs off to consumers to allow for some wage hikes, taking profit cuts, but still maintaining margins. Now that inflation and wages are more directly impacting everyday Americans, they've began to modify their budgets. This is why Feb. retail foot traffic was down a lot. As others have said, we will see a quarter or two of misses from big companies like HD, LOWE, WMT, MCD, AMZN, etc. as analysts re-adjust their forecasts and companies review their forward looking earnings. Also, supply chain issues. Now that inflation is being reeled in, supply chains issues should ease more and more, covid is ending and life is returning to a sense of normalcy, I would say we are near the peak of our economic struggles. The peak could last a while, but I'd say we're there. \n\nI originally identified mid-year/June area as a pivot point. I assumed it would be the start of the pullback, now I'm thinking it could pose as the potential bottom for us. I could see Russia finishing up it's Ukraine invasion by then, and at this point we would have our first rate hike and be looking at the second one coming soon after. A catalyst like war ending, lowering inflation, and baked in rates could be a good formula for a strong reversal. \n\nIve identified 2 major support trend lines on the monthly chart; A 4000 retest on S&P is what I'm hoping for/currently predicting for the bottom, but max pain would be 3000 retest. If it bounces off 4000, bullish again long as this used to be a resistance line, so confirming it as new support would be strong. 3000 support would be riding the TL that was respected by the 2020 crash, which this area is a zone of consolidation, and i find it hard to believe it would not act like a demand zone. Even moreso considering 3k is -60% from ATH now. 4000 is -20% from ATH, which seems more likely. COVID crash was -35% from ATH. Only thing is now we'd have a resistance line again, and S&P would be stuck in a range.  Still bullish, but less so. I also like that these TLs show psych levels as possible levels of reversal. Worst I'm seeing is the possibility we go relatively sideways rest of year, bottom out at 3000 next year, then reversal (looking at yearly chart)\n\nJust like people told me it was a bull run, I was wrong and a doomsdayer, etc , now they're the ones crying \"recession, recession!\" meanwhile I'm becoming more bullish again. \"Buy when there's blood in the streets\" \n\nThis was my TED talk, thank you.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "The hive mind changed quickly.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Fuck the noise, buy companies you have absolute faith in and don‚Äôt check your portfolio.

I think we could be 6 weeks away from a capitulation event, here's my reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are using MOEX as a functional model because at this point it's the one showing us real time moves most consistent with historical crash models. The same principles explained here can be found in other large market crashes. Notable in 1929 US and 1989 Japan - the two mega crashes. Also present in 1999 and 2007 breaks (And more, many more).\n\nBefore we get into that it's worth noting the credit markets are already into an early stage of capitulation. These could be frontrunning the stocks. This would be common of previous crashes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4ya34j8jym81.png?width=1599&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ebe58a773d2ed5332fd4a442a09a9092f207344\n\n \n\n# MOEX Crash Structure\n\n# \n\nWhile news related and \"Unpredictable\", the MOEX has went down in a very similar form to how markets break. Breaks 161, down to 220. Bounces 220 and then goes into capitulation. You can read a bit more about this [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/ta6bqh/hedging_targeting_and_second_break_levels/) along with an example of this happening in PLTR in the crash from 25 to 10.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/245qzk4bjym81.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=baa577d1df2c40cf60e62afe8702f7217d3b4b8b\n\n \n\nNotable features:\n\n* Smooth trend to 161. Hugs the trendline all the way down.\n* First big divergence from trendline in the drop to 220.\n* Retest of the 127 - 161 zone sets up capitulation to the 320 - 423 fibs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#  DJI\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot a tough job to translate this over to the DJI. Does not take a charting expert. This is pretty obvious how to extrapolate the same move to the DJI using these markers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9um15xggjym81.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=2de64b7aff265c3305d1fc82bc24ca728b66faed\n\n \n\n* Our notable trigger signal is a sharp move in DJI down to 30,700 and then an instant rally back up to the 161 fib. This should produce a strong bull close weekly candle. Huge wick under it as the market goes into a hyper rally into the end of the week after selling-off strongly into the early week. This bullish appearing candle I'd consider a big bearish hint, if it forms.\n* Next warning would be a series of bearish closes on the weekly chart. The market would not be crashing, it'd be another stepping down type of sell-off. We'd be able to watch this happening for a full month of action - a lot of time to see if this is truly forming or not. Hedgers and speculators could build up spot prices shorts here and/or short calls betting against a break of lower highs.\n* As we get back under the 2.0 fib, there's a fast bullish rally and the rejection of this bullish rally sets up the capitulation event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#  The 25% Down Week\n\nIf these triggers are present in the market, extreme long-shot bets could have a very reasonable chance of paying out. After the bull rally and rejection we can buy some puts for 1 - 2 weeks expiry 20% OTM. And if the capitulation event comes, that's going to be the trade of our decade. And you'll have 5 weeks to watch it setting up.\n\n\\-----\n\nThis is a multi step sequential trade plan. We need to see various steps fill to imply the capitulation event is imminent.

Can be attractive for e.g. pension funds or other institutional investors to diversify their portfolio with more bonds. But here comes the clue: With QE the FED usually bought up all US treasury bonds, which raises the question, were inst. investors able to get any bonds in their portfolio the last couple of years? The US treasury's are considered as a safe haven so when their bonds get available more, I can imagine that their will be a run on those.\n\nStock market: Theoretically when bond yields go up, stock market goes down. Makes sense, because inst. investors have to have a low risk strategy (sharp ratio, you prefer lower risk instead of higher returns). Interesting point here is a lot of liquidity exited the stock market the last 2-3 months, question is where did all the money go? My assumption is they partially held in a cash position and are going into the bond market, unfortunately I couldn't get a chart with the liquidity of the bond market (would need a bloomberg terminal). But with interest rate on saving accounts being high enough cash can be indeed an attractive position for inst. investors. \n\nBanks: They would start to increase the mortgage rate, credit card interest rate, loan rate etc. The question here is will the mortgage rate increase be enough that demand for mortgages will shrink? Personally I have some doubts, if the person has to pay now $1000-2000 more per year for their house/flat. In the US people do live mostly on credit card, but mortgages is usually the big factor, since when a mortgage has been sold all of the money goes into the construction/restoration material and labor money. (Just gave me the idea to buy some puts on homedepot while typing that shit lol)\n\nCurrency: USD would (theoretically) appreciate since a higher interest rate would make foreign investment more attractive. Potentially it would make imports cheaper but their export would decrease. However the US already has since a long time a negative net export number, so I doubt a decrease in export would have a significant impact on GDP.

{"title": "This is How the (Financial) World Ends", "selftext": "So, this week, we saw the start of the total collapse of the modern financial system and the end of the Bretton Woods era of international monetary policy.\n\nBold claim, yeah baby?  You're probably thinking this has to do with the war in Ukraine or something, right? Well, it does a little bit, but mostly it has to do with what happened with RSX and LME this week, and a little bit with what happened with Rivian.\n\n**TLDR: Wall Street, China, and Russia are all broke and shit is going to get real over the next few months.  Or, to put it another way, some dude named Noah moved next door and started building a boat in his backyard, and you're just beginning to feel some raindrops.**\n\nLet's start with the biggest shitshow out there, the London Metals Exchange, or LME.  A fair number of people are comparing what happened with LME and Nickel to what happened when Apex Clearing turned off the buy button for the meme stocks back in January of 2021.  And yes, I meant Apex Clearinghouse, not Robinhood you twits, Apex made RH do it, and a dozen other brokers as well.  Vlad was just a fall guy, and not the cool kind that was on TV back in the '80s.\n\nWhat the LME did can be split into two parts: \n\n1) they had a massive short squeeze that was fucking up prices, amplified by uncertainty from the war in Ukraine, so they completely halted trading.  This is entirely normal.  It's happened dozens of times in the 144 years they've been open.  Complete trading halts occur in all exchanges whenever shit starts getting fucked up.  For example, US markets were shut down for a week after 9/11.\n\n2) they fucking canceled 12 hours worth of completed trades.  This is the part that should get your knickers in a twist if you were actually wearing any.   \n\nNow, I know a lot of you are sitting there feeling smart thinking \"I know why they did it! They're criminals and stealing!\"  Well, you're right, but that's NOT why they canceled 12 hours of completed trades, just like Apex didn't turn off the meme buy button because they woke up and decided they really needed to use their broker apps to get their fuck on with retail in a big 'ol gang bang. \n\nNo, they did this for one reason and one reason only: survival.  They were dead.  LME let the Nickel market get so fucked up that they not only had to stop transactions, or unwind a couple at the end, they had to unwind 12 fucking hours worth of trading.  I mean, these people are so goddamned incompetent that they didn't even realize they'd been shot in the head, skinned, and turned into a fucking rug for two whole shifts at Wendy's!\n\nUnderstand, they just set 144 years of skimming trades on fire.  It's not little guys buying FDs on the LME, it's big boys and industrial giants.  They all have lawyers and elected officials on retainer, and all of those clients are as done and gone as your made up Canadian girlfriend from grade school.\n\nI can't decide if the best part of all this is the cover story they put out, or how many dumbfucks didn't take three seconds to realize its bullshit.  The idea that Xiang Guangda just said \"I don't want to pay the margin call\" and then the LME was like, \"ok, well, I guess that sucks to be us, guess we'll just pour all this gasoline on ourselves and play with matches\" is so laughable I just got a hernia from ROFLing so hard.  Look, because I know you 'tards are all stuck on the shortbus trying to figure out what I'm talking about, I'll just drive ya'll on over to the explanation:\n\nTsingshan (the company Xiang owns that has the short position) isn't some kind of nickel producer like the papers are saying.  They make steel.  They're the second largest (largest by revenue) steel making company in China.  You know what that steel is used for?  Construction.  Know who hasn't had enough money to make a bond payment in over six months now?  Every goddamned construction company and developer in China.  What, you think they're paying their fucking materials bills?  \n\nHere's a quote from the South China Morning Post attributed to Xiang:\n\n *‚ÄúForeigners have some activities going on \\[against Tsingshan‚Äôs position,\\] we are actively coordinating \\[to tackle the problem\\],‚Äù China Business News cited Xiang as saying in a report late on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe have received a lot of phone calls today ‚Äì related government departments and leaders are very supportive to us. Tsingshan‚Äôs position, operation and management has no problems.‚Äù* \n\nAgain, because I know you can't read, here's a translation of that quote into a picture.\n\n[I specifically said there are no problems, so it's all okay!](https://preview.redd.it/e4shtzkzqwm81.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19e41c0ca232b1309c0abd65f624d5e4f849183c)\n\nNow, why is it such a huge problem that Xiang has no money?  Well, if he can't make the margin call, the short position, much like a politician or anyone who's daddy donated a library to get them into Harvard, fails upwards.  First it goes up to Xiang's bank, which is also fucking broke.  Then it moves onto the LME itself, which again, doesn't have the fucking money.  So what does the LME do?  Same thing the mobsters in Goodfellas did when the restaurant was too broke to steal from anymore, they set everything on fire.  The reason the LME hasn't opened back up yet is because the short position is still there, and nobody who's responsible for that position has the money to cover it.\n\nNow, you might think, if you were smart instead of so dumb you went to Bangkok to get a TIE Fighter, why does this Xiang guy have such a large naked short position he can't cover?  The answer is simplicity itself - he's broke, so he naked shorted his own shit to get paid, then got fucked when it went sideways.  I mean, people here on WSB like to call themselves reckless degenerates, but lemme give you a full \"trust me bro\" on this one, ya'll ain't got shit on the stupid rich fucks that run the world.\n\nThat's part one.  What about part 2, RSX?  Well, as many people who lost money Friday can attest, some serious, serious fucking of Put options occurred.  Van Eck started to liquidate the RSX fund, but they didn't *say* they were liquidating it, so options couldn't settle as cash value.  But they ALSO halted trading of the ETF, so options couldn't be traded either.  And as a final piece of fuck you brokers weren't letting people borrow shares to even fucking exercise the put option themselves.  Wild yeah? (someone else wrote a very good DD on this exact thing this morning, I highly recommend you go read it - no link because automod hates me every time I put a link in my posts)\n\nThis is example number two of someone burning down the restaurant because they couldn't steal from it anymore.  Whatever MM sold those options didn't have enough to cover them, so this shit with Van Eck not stating the fund was liquidating happened.\n\nThat's strike two for all the market makers and exchanges being fucking broker than you when you've gotta go behind the Taco Bell because Wendy's is too high class for your ass.  Let's see if we can a third K to finish them off.\n\nI give you Rivian, ticker RIVN, a truly shitty EV manufacturer, that like most of them can't actually make cars.  These guys are such a clown show that they tried to raise the prices on the pre-orders from the people who waited years to get one.  So they had earnings on 3/10, and it was just about as big of a disaster as you'd expect.  Then, after hours, they dropped $6 bucks on nearly a million in volume.  Everyone who bought puts printed, right?  Nope.  The next day in pre-market, on less than a third of that volume, the price magically shot back up $5.5 bucks, completely wiping out everyone's puts.  By EOD the price had only dropped a total of $3 bucks from Thursday's close, and wouldn't you know it, the price of an ATM put option bought EOD on 3/10 was more than $3. I'd recommend taking a look at the volume numbers and corresponding price movement of RIVN throughout the day on 3/11 and drawing your own conclusions.\n\nThis is like the, what, hundredth and a half time we've seen this exact thing play out now?  It's not an accident.  More money is traded every day in the market on options than stocks themselves.  When the PFOF brokers that retail uses publicly refer to the MMs as \"our clients\", you know the fix is in.  What makes the RIVN bit so interesting is a) how obvious it is, and b) that they're doing this while under DOJ investigation for this exact fucking thing.  That tells me two things, 1) they don't think they'll actually be prosecuted - which, fair, they've got a whole lot of history on their side for this one, and 2) they don't have a choice 'cause they're running out of money.\n\nAnd why, you may ask are they out of money?  Well, it's a mix of things.  1) all the attention from Reddit and the media and law enforcement has clients pulling money from Hedge Funds, leading to sell offs, which when you're leveraged at 137x, leads to a rapid collapse in your buying power. 2)  Russian assets aren't just in freefall anymore, they've hit the ground and started drilling for oil.  3) remember where I was talking about China earlier?  Yeah, their shit is worth even less than the Russian stuff, but thanks to Xi's brilliant leadership plan, people haven't realized that yet.  Below, I have obtained exclusive photo evidence from some of my old SF buddies of Xi and his top councilor enacting their plan to save China's economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If we can't see the lines go down, then are they really dropping?](https://preview.redd.it/r254e9n2rzm81.jpg?width=444&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e27e89a6f0629808f8be2f7557a8aa35d6dbcf8a)\n\nAs always, the official info coming out of China is a mix of fantasy, lies, and flat out ignorance, spiced up by a heaping helping of corrupt incompetence.  Because Xi is a tinpot wannabe dictator with delusions of Imperial grandeur, he wanted to make sure that while he was hosting the Olympics everything went off without a hitch, so he told all the companies and rich people in China to make like autists and buy the fucking dip in the equities and bond markets.\n\nBecause all those folks didn't want to get executed by anti-aircraft guns while their families went to the organ donor farms, they did.  Which in this case, means throwing good money after very very very bad money.  It's honestly difficult to describe just how badly China has sabotaged itself.  I'm sure you all know by now about the ghost cities made up of structurally unsound buildings with no interiors, and in some cases no exterior walls.  But, do you also know about all the railways to nowhere that aren't being serviced or maintained?  Do you also know how many MORE shitty tofu-dreg buildings have been paid for by citizens' life savings that aren't yet built?  Spoiler, it's a lot.\n\nMeanwhile, the property market in China is in free fall.  Here's a chart of official chinese statistics on the price of housing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Taken directly from the National Bureau of Statistics of China](https://preview.redd.it/dskl8tmog0n81.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=98f46d6498440cde7e703d5b55041ec38c6db306)\n\nNow, these prices all reflect worthless tofu-dreg empty apartments that exist only to sell to the next sucker/investor.  Notice that trend line?  Anyone know what happens when that price increase gets closer to zero?  As our friend Lelu from the 5th Element would say \"bada bing boom!\".  For another reference, look at the Dutch tulip market after it popped.  Remember, these are the official Chinese govt numbers.  I'm guessing the actual numbers have gone negative already.\n\nWestern banks, particularly up in Canada, are extremely exposed to the bonds these empty shell apartments are backing.  Western banks, again particularly up in Canada, are also heavily exposed to the commercial and residential real estate markets.  Both of which are in massive fucking bubbles funded in large part by money from Wall Street, Russia, and China.  Guess which of those are now broke (hint: it's all three of them).  CMBS notes started going bad this month - there's a reason all the politicians all of a sudden decided we needed to be back in the office, and the mortgage missed payment rate is skyrocketing faster than the price of oil.  I have not yet been able to figure out if the spike in missed mortgage payments is banks/wall street failing to pay on all the properties they've accumulated, if it's all the missing repossessions from the pandemic finally showing up, or if it's a leading indicator of a new crisis.\n\nI don't know how much longer the powers-that-be can keep these balls in the air, but it's not much longer.  Assuming Russia follows their playbook from the disaster they had in Grozny in '94/'95, we're about to see the major cities in Ukraine get leveled by heavy artillery and rocket attacks.  Which means you can pretty much kiss the Ukrainian wheat harvest goodbye, because all the infrastructure needed to support it will be rubble, along with the roads and bridges you'd need to get it out of the country.  Couple that with what looks to be bad wheat harvests in the US and China barring some big weather pattern shifts, and we're going to see some massive price spikes in the price of bread and other food this summer.  Expensive food = political instability and riots.\n\nThe US will see a fresh round of \"race riots\" sparked by random online videos that are really about inflation and economic inequality, but the media and politicians will go full hog on the race angle, and people will buy it - if you need proof the general population is that gullible, look at how many think the Ukraine war is responsible for inflation and gas prices.  South Africa and Turkey, plus an unkown number of Middle Eastern countries will see Syrian civil war/Arab Spring type uprisings - remember, the Tunisian revolt started as a protest about the price of bread.\n\nFinally, since this is already way, way, way too long for any of you to actually read through, much less comprehend, I'll cut the part about Bretton Woods and the dollar as the international currency super short - there used to be one global financial system that was set up after WWII in a conference at Bretton Woods, hence the name.  By kicking Russia out of it, we forced the creation of a competing global economic system.  Which will likely be headed by China.  That pretty much guarantees another world war down the road, but hopefully not for a decade or two if we're really lucky.\n\nBecause I know my people, here are some tickers to throw money at if you want, I have extremely tiny positions (like one share in a couple of these) in all of them: long WEAT, SOYB, CORN, USO, YANG, short TUR, short EZA, short SPY/QQQ/DOW, long GME.  Oh, and I also just bought a Lincoln, because in addition to chips, the automakers are about to be short on metals too, and somehow a car counts as a fucking growth investment these days.\n\nIf I had the money to do so, I'd also buy farmland with wind turbines and/or solar on it.  Real assets are about to be king, especially food and energy, which are the definition of real assets with inelastic demand.\n\nI'll be honest, the vast majority of my portfolio - over 90%, is in direct registered shares of GME, with a couple shares of AMC because fuck 'em, that's why.  I think at least a couple of brokers are going to detonate like we're seeing with the LME and fuckery like what happened with RSX will become more regular.  Whenever I have a big gain, I pull most of it out and buy more memes and then DRS them.\n\nThat IS financial advice by the way, but you probably shouldn't follow it.", "id": "tcqov5", "created_utc": 1647118671.0, "score": 7618, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 1483, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|186|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/opydwu/38_million_puts_how_all_of_wall_street_is_using/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcqov5/this_is_how_the_financial_world_ends/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqe5mt/betting_on_oil_gas_and_economic_growth/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6jcq/a_follow_up_to_my_market_crash_post_specifically/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok7hsx/update_on_market_crashing_soon_positions_and_an/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/salggk/behold_your_new_god_manbearape_the_vice_president/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q03iro/were_all_fucked_the_gay_bear_porn_you_need_for/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tcqov5)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tcqov5)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great work!!

I do think this future currency will be a digital \"fiat\" currency of some sort.  The governance of that new currency needs to be decentralized, so no one entity can affect or determine it's value.  \n\nThe question I also ponder is, what would determine the value of such currency?  I don't think it will be gold.  We already tried that over the last several centuries.   Physical gold lacks the portability needed for international transaction. Paper gold is just as worthless and controllable as sovereign fiat.  It won't be any current nation based fiat currencies since each is controlled by their own sovereign nation with their own agenda's and domestic needs.  So what is left to determine value?  Energy?

It depends where you live.  If you live in Russia or China, go on a house buying spree.  If you live pretty much anywhere in the west, just wait.  The housing market is being driven by REITs, they are building and buying properties off each other and forcing the market up.  It is literally a Dutch tulip market.  The giveaway is how much the banks trust it.  If the property market is actually as valuable as it appears the lenders would have no problem offering you a mortgage with zero to five percent deposit.  The less the lender trusts the market, the higher the deposit requirement.  In the UK a lender might advertise a 10% deposit, but when you apply they'll change it to 20% then bump it up to 25 or 30% during the buying process.  Others will flat out refuse to lend if anything below 30% is offered.  So, you can deduce that the lender is not confident about the loan they're offering.\n\nThis isn't like a car loan, car loans come with huge risks, the lender can get the car, sell it and disappear.  If you lend on a home you know where the lender is, he's sat in the home you lent him money to buy.  Yet right now I can get a loan for a car with zero deposit.  I can get an unsecured loan for a boat and only need 10% down.  \n\nLenders know full well that the housing market is going to crash.  The more prolonged the rise, the more prolonged the fall.

I actually agree with a number of your points. The politicians and Wall Street wanted to have the party, but now they dont want to clean up. As a result, the overleveraged companies, that have borrowed billions they knew would never be paid back, are sitting waiting until they are told they cannot refinance. They will start the usual doom and gloom scenario that the whole system will go down. They will probably get their bail out, the government will print trillions more (on top of the $7T they printed since Covid), the executives will get their bonuses, and the rest of the US will be faced with higher prices on everything except to breathe. Then you will have a shitshow of a midterm elections that will be ugly. \n\nAnd in the international world, you have a war between two countries who produce a lot of important wheat. You have China who is holding on to the myth that their glory days are still ahead of them, and you have the Middle East, which is a powder keg on a good day. I dont pretend to be a financial expert, but the only reasons we avoided all out war with the Soviets was nukes. The only other reason we have avoided terrible wars is free trade/globalization. You wont destroy someone you need to survive. However, i think the next few years will be about bringing as much of your economy home as possible and offshoring to reliable countries. For the US, I have always said Mexico and Central/South America should be getting our business a lot more than China and Asia should. \n\nI am not buying real estate now, in fact, i would be selling it. As rates go up, the average mortgage price goes up due to the increase in interest as a % of the monthly mortgage. As a result, the value of the house has to come down. You will see a lot of people with multiple properties all of a sudden have a lot of properties with negative equity. Some will be smart and not panic, others will panic and start unloading their properties. \n\nAnd wtf can the Fed do? They have been crack dealers for decades now and now they look around and see nothing but crackheads. They cant further expand their balance sheet or keep rates low because you will have a lower and middle class wiped out. They will sell out your 401k to keep the country from going down a rabbit hole. The good news, if you are young like me, this will be a gift. You will buy companies that are deeply discounted. The only day you need your investments to be higher is on the day you sell. \n\nEveryone is a genius when the market does nothing but go up. The next few months/years will determine who is for real and who isnt. Back in 2000 (not saying this is that), Mark Cuban sold at exactly the right time. If he hadnt, you never wouldve heard of Mark Cuban. \n\nFor me, I'm buying good companies with good balance sheets, companies with high elasticity on pricing, and companies with intellectual property that cant be touched or have a deep moat within their business model.

First, who was overextending these soon-to-be defaulted margin debts, which will inevitably end up as charge-offs? Second, when large, institutional-level margin is extended, it's common to buy insurance on your exposure (CDS). Global banks' CDS have been going parabolic for a week, now. So, who is holding the shit-end of the CDS sticks? \n\nThird, when a security or options/futures/commodities contract is sold, MMs take the opposite side of that trade; usually trying to sell that position and scalping a miniscule profit off of it.

He said since computers replaced all the lower math engineering plebs he was the only guy that knew what was going on in the project fully, and because there wasn't a team of math doing engineering plebs beneath him waiting for him to retire the company now has the task of finding a new engineer with his specific knowledge already that will probably ask for three times his salary and will do half as well a job for a while. \n\nAnd from what I'm hearing it's a common issue and we haven't even hit the full retirement bump yet. Soon wages will triple causing an even hire inflation rate, all the skilled and knowledgeable workers will be out and there probably won't be enough qualified people to replace them, so production will be down. Not to mention all the retired people now trying to live their dream life of luxury causing even more inflation pressure. Social programs will then start to be strained as the older generation utilizes it more and more... I don't blame the boomers but our government should have started preparing for this a decade ago, from my point of view it's already to late to fix this.
