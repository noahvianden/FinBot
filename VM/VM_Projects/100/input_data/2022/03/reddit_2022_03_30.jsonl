Or do you think it is a valuation bubble/progress will slow?\n\nHere are a few of my picks:\n\n- DIS: Worth 250B, but own (or partly own) ESPN, Hulu, Marvel, LucasFilms, ABC, 20th Century, list goes on. Disney+ growing in popularity as well, and Disney parks will be packed/are already packed as people worry less about COVID relative to before.\n\n- AMZN: Maybe on a dip. Besides their massive eCommerce empire, AWS cloud storage makes the most of their revenue and continues to revolutionize the cloud (used by many companies from Tesla, Snapchat, Volkswagen, etc.).\n\n- CRM: There is currently a shortage of SalesForce devs because the demand has been growing for them. Like the above stocks, used by many major companies (AWS, Spotify, Toyota, AMEX). \n\n- CRSP: Riskier play, but gene editing would be a massive breakthrough and they are and have been the leaders for a while.", "id": "tse35a", "created_utc": 1648667804.0, "score": 318, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 430, "comments": [{"body": "in order of size of position:\n\n1.

When they see the yearly chart over the past year (NIO, PYPL, FB, SQ, DOCU) they suddenly face reality. \n\nWhat about the new EVs? Toyota/Lexus will have 5 new EVs, combos SUV by 2025.

I see owning it but I don’t know about a huge portion long term.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I think there are a few categories in terms of Tesla's \"competition\":\n\n* Legacy automakers that are actually trying to transition to EVs as soon as possible: Mercedes, VW, Hyundai, Volvo/Polestar, maybe Ford, and a few luxury brands.\n* Legacy automakers that are switching to EVs but nowhere near fast enough: Basically each one that isn't in the previous or next category and perhaps Ford.\n* Legacy automakers that refuse to switch to EVs and are just doing the bare minimum to seem like they're doing something while trying to slow down EV adoption at all cost: Toyota, GM, BMW, Honda.\n\nI may have forgotten a few, but especially to clarify the last category: Toyota still has not a single EV on the market today, they're actively and openly lobbying to delay the adoption of EVs in the US and Japan, they've even recently spread propaganda pamphlets in schools to convince the younger generations of how unfeasible EVs are and they're still pretending hybrid and hydrogen are serious alternatives to EVs (same with BMW btw).\n\nNow together with GM and BMW (I don't actually know what Honda are doing, other than that their production targets are a joke), they have announced a bunch of new models, but I think that's actually a negative. This may sound strange, but designing new models is easy and cheap, making them on large scale actually requires investment and resources that would otherwise be assigned to ICE cars. Or as Elon keeps saying; prototypes are easy, mass production is hard. These four brands have production targets (which they probably won't even reach) that are simply laughable. In the order of 1-2 million by 2030, when a huge part of the Western market will be EVs.\n\nThe brands that are actually serious about building EVs are making a as few models as possible, that are as good cars as possible, and scaling those to as much production as possible. The same way Tesla approached things with only 4 models. The reason this works, is because the demand for EVs is so high that people are buying every good EV on the market. Expanding to more models is only necessary once demand starts becoming a problem, and that won't happen for a while.\n\nSo if you see a company announcing 5 different EVs when they don't even have a single one on the market yet, you know they're not serious and you know those cars are going to suck because they haven't event built a single EV yet to learn from. The way Tesla/VW/Mercedes are doing it makes way more sense, building one model that's as good as they can before building another one and iterating based on the learnings from the first.

He and Boris Johnson are probably the loudest protagonists for escalation vs Russia.

Biden has also aggressively pursued Trump's trade war vs China, which is most of the reason behind the semiconductor shortage that contributes the \"scarcity\" inflation factor of our overall inflationary crisis. The splitting of semiconductor supply chains is 100% a deglobalization priority. Biden's fully on board with all of that. \n\n> What would your solution be regarding Ukraine? It seems like the only other options(outside sanctions) are to send troops or let them take over Ukraine. \n\nI don't really care about Ukraine. I was all for supporting Ukraine against Russia in 2014-2016. However, it eventually came out how corrupt, brutal and dysfunctional their \"democracy\" also was. Ukraine is one of the top corrupt countries in the world, along with Belarus and Russia, so much so that it can (could have been) called a kleptocracy in its own right. Before he turned on the heroism after the invasion, Zelensky's approval rating was down in the 20's over some offshore accounts/embezzling scandal. Ukraine is also maybe one of the only openly white supremacist, highly racist countries in the world. Stories of the racism -- violent racism toward Africans, Arabs, South Asians & Far East Asians -- vs foreign people trapped in Ukraine were covered due to appearing on social media for a while but have since disappeared. The country even has a right wing white supremacist militia as part of its armed forces.\n\nI don't care about Ukraine, not enough to want blue collar families to suffer hunger here in America. The country is in the situation it's in partly because of the endemic corruption and brutality of its people at every level of its culture, not just government. The only thing that makes their situation any different than Libya's or Syria's or Myanmar's is the pictures of fleeing people who look like they could be sitting in a diner in Ohio. It's because they're white and look like us, and we have different standards for how badly white people are allowed to be treated in the world (standards that we don't apply to countries of people of color). I feel less obligation to help Ukraine than I feel for just about any other country or resource in crisis in the world right now, that we could be mobilizing to save. I don't know why I'm supposed to care so much about this white country's crisis that millions of people of color in oil-importing developing countries have to starve and suffer. We're giving assurances of supplies of gas and resources to Europe, but how about India, Africa and SE Asia? \n\nIt's a white people's crusade and only white countries are in the little club of those we will help shelter from the economic impact of our sanctions.\n\nI don't have a solution to Ukraine because (1) they are not an ally, (2) they can't ally with anyone because they lack an effective and functional (i.e. not corrupt/racist/kleptocratic) government that would enable them to join the EU or NATO, (3) in 2021 they instigated and trolled Russia to antagonize Putin and invite an invasion for whatever reasons they might have had for doing that. Their situation is their doing and I don't feel responsible for solving their problems, much less as a taxpayer paying for anything but humanitarian aid for the country. I feel less responsible for Ukraine's problems than I feel responsible for Afghanistan's problems, for example. I don't have any sense of ownership of a responsibility to solve their problems, just because they're a white country and that somehow makes their dysfunctional issues top world sovereign rights priorities. \n\n> Do you consider limiting climate change justification enough for increased EV funding and limiting of local oil and gas production? \n\nEV's don't help climate change that much. You do know why coal is doing great, right? It's one of the fuels used to generate power for electric grids. Somehow, \"EV\" became synonymous with \"low carbon\" for this generation, which is firstly incorrect and secondly an appeal to jingoistic symbols in place of a coherent energy plan. Increasing EV production comes with increasing oil, gas and coal use because that's how most electric power is generated to power electric grids, and oil is where most plastics, resins and other chemicals for advanced materials like composites come from. There is literally nothing about EV production and use that can be exclusively and uniquely equated with reduced carbon footprint or lower hydrocarbon usage. There are dozens of other things that would have to change for EV usage to be associated with lower carbon footprint, and those things can/should change with or without EVs. The whole EV fixation is a big generational marketing gimmick. And it's especially absurd to believe that luxury EVs like Teslas come with any relatively beneficial environmental impact. \n\n> Because at the end of the day that's what those are about.\n\nAt the end of the day, lower energy consumption is what lower carbon footprint is about. It doesn't actually matter whether a car is EV or ICE, if lower consumption doesn't happen. The only way to reduce carbon footprint and reduce energy consumption is to reduce per capita consumption. Or to have fewer people living in high-consumption societies like ours. \n\nRefusing to adequately fund oil/gas/coal industry while refusing to lower consumption -- and we're even increasing consumption -- only leads to high oil prices and energy shocks. And every time energy prices get as high as they were getting in early 2022, someone invades someone in the oil producing world. You can predict Putin's internationally scandalous violent or kleptocratic episodes if you look at the chart of the price of Lukoil stock and an oil price chart. \n\nIf I were going to point the finger at any one person or thing for causing the violence this Spring, I'd point it at this generations absurdly simple, delusional belief that there's environmental benefit to starving old energy industries of capital while increasing consumption because somehow Tesla's going to make it all better, as the cause of yet another energy market disruption that, as energy shocks always do, led to an outbreak of petro state violence. Putin just happens to be the first petro state narcissist on a mission with random acts of violence in 2022 as oil prices spike. In the 2000's it was Saudis dive-bombing the World Trade Center, the rise of Al Qaeda and Putin seizing Yukos and imprisoning Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In the 2010's it was the rise of Islamic Jihad and the Islamic State and Putin seizing Crimea. It's all very predictable. Having a strategy of \"starve the beast\" to limit oil producing companies doesn't work to reduce energy consumption AND oil shortages and energy price shocks inevitably lead to chaos.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I don't think it's fair to conflate Russian sanctions with an effort for de-globalization.

EV cars are the first step otherwise every new ICE car bought today that will be on the road for 10+ years is just kicking the can down the road.

Sorry they were so long and frustrated-sounding. Obviously, I can't share them at home or with others because my views are quirky and well off the mainstream, so they were a little pent-up. I agree I make some broad generalizations. I'm not interested enough in Ukraine in particular to vet all my sources for historical accuracy. I felt very let down after the 2014-2016 thing. It's disillusioning to get emotionally caught up in a country's struggle for \"freedom\" and then discover how rotten and corrupt the strugglers really were. I do agree that Ukraine is great at catching at international heart-strings and I can't blame anyone else for getting emotionally caught up in their problems today. \n\nPart of my cynicism isn't just about the race angle (a criticism I've picked up from reading Arab world news reporting of oil-related coverage). But I also feel cynicism about Western diplomacy being similarly disinterested in brutal gender apartheid. Many women in the world live far less free than Ukraine would be under Putin, and are also subjected to normalized violence, and so I'm doubly put off by the double standards for what deserves outrage. \n\nI appreciate your sharing your thoughts about EVs & power sources. I actually like EVs and have EV investments, too. I do get frustrated that we can't discuss it with any nuance or raise concerns about parts of the power solution that we are not taking action on, because comment has to be framed as not criticizing Tesla. \n\nI think that lowering consumption angle is potentially important and we as a culture have omitted from the dialectic altogether. Conservation approaches also come with great benefits of lessening environmental damage in more ways than just reducing carbon, and they make for very positive, engaging marketing campaigns that should be more widespread. I do think nuclear power is a necessary direction to go in, but we seem to have some very tenacious and single-minded activists in the US when it comes to energy markets. \n\nI think your opposing viewpoints are well reasoned and sufficiently grounded. I still don't really care about Ukraine enough to want millions of people to suffer over it (particularly here in America) but I respect that reasonable people do want to get involved. I didn't mean to imply that everyone who wants to get involved in Ukraine is doing so out of White Unity sentiments. \n\nThanks again for reading my long winded stuff, considering my reasoning and sharing your views.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "You mean like canceling the Keystone pipeline as his first act in office, publicly insulting the Saudi royal family, and then crawling on hands and knees to Saudi Arabia to beg them to increase oil production?

Yet, every time energy companies do so and prices start to come back down, politicians move in and then try to squash their enterprises and businesses with regulatory constrictions & market manipulation, ostensibly to reduce pollution. So increasing production is rewarded by policy and regulatory punishments, in the US.\n\nWe have a dysfunctional approach where we try to bring about environmental change by one form of constriction on the energy sector after another. But the only real way to lower energy utilization is by lowering consumption. A high consumption society is an energy intensive one.

EVs are the least relevant to the most people in need. It’s certainly the least important energy problem we face. And it’s especially ironic since American politicians have basically created the supply chain crisis in the past few years by deciding to have a trade war and engage in trade protectionism and escalating them during a pandemic, and they also created an energy crunch with their intentional policy snd capital underinvestment squeezes and then take these shortages to another level with sanctions against Russia that actually don’t help the Ukrainian people and aren’t effective at crippling Russia so far. And, to top off the all this — the trade war powered pandemic supply chain disruptions, energy production constrictions and sanctions that are bound to inflict the most pain on energy importing countries and the lower classes — the US federal reserve has been deliberately stoking inflation because the most reliable federal response to just about any national challenge is to immediately start inflating stocks on a massive scale and giving unlimited free money to corporations as a top priority.\n\nWe have caused all of these problems, from trade war boosted supply chain disruptions to a doctrinaire anti-energy, mismanagement-caused energy crises, to excessive, prolonged QE to pump up stocks and now the sanctions against Russia to amplify these problems. the US has been creating inflation and economic disruptions intentionally and by choice, and by finding ways to enforce sanctions globally and involve other nations we are now finding new ways to export the recipe for increasing poverty, hunger and inequality to other countries. Our leadership has created these problems - all of them, from trade wars to turbo charge pandemic supply chain breakdowns to restrictive energy policies to amplify simple pandemic demand fluctuations into global energy shocks to stock-pumping federal reserve QE inflation and a president intent on battering Russia with sanctions that don’t actually have much effect except to triple the impact of the economic disruptions created by the US' ongoing trade war v China. Our leaders created these problems with their conscious, intentional policy-making and decision-making. The Russian sanctions are a way to export the inflation and shortages to other countries.\n\nSome booster program for EV batteries is a straight up meaningless pander to attempt to show a naive base that the president is on top of their concerns.\n\nI invest in basics, and right now I’m investing in seeds, fertilizers, materials and energy societies need for basic *subsistence*. When you have actual energy, seed and fertilizer shortages, that’s bad for marginal economies. The odds are high that in a few months time at least several hundred million people will be more poor, hungry and maybe even starving, and their societies undeveloping on account of all of these problems our poor leadership has been busy creating out of thin air and exporting to other countries. Imagine the suffering of millions of starving people that will be quietly tuned out by our public’s social media, entertainment industry and video game driven attention span. And new wars breaking out in poor countries battling over scarce resources. We will have instigated the initial conditions to cause all that. \n\nAll of this ceases to be abstract for me when I buy seed and fertilizer stocks, because I have to contemplate world hunger in order to choose those stocks. There’s a high chance that the next few years will be terrible for millions of people.\n\nInvesting, finance and economic policy aren’t just abstract activities. They are how the world works and how societies function. When the US creates an energy crisis, inflation, profound supply chain disorder worldwide, and actual shortages of basic resources, we’re forcing deconstruction of economic activity onto other nations, forcing the world into deglobalization by disrupting how money works and how other societies can function at the subsistence level. That is what this is about, not China or Russia. It’s about forcing [the end of globalization](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/business/dealbook/globalization-fink-marks.html), and doing it in a way that keeps a collective of mostly US-aligned white people countries together and faring relatively better than countries of mostly black, brown, asian and native people, some of whom may suffer subsistence crises and other existential challenges. \n\nSeveral analysts have come out saying that deglobalization will reverse clean energy efforts. From the the source I quoted: \n\n> The recognition of these negative aspects of globalization has now caused the pendulum to swing back to local sourcing. Rather than the cheapest, easiest and greenest sources, there’ll probably be more of a premium put on the safest and surest.\n\nClean energy efforts will mostly fall apart in most of the world. But all of this is OK because out of all the shortages and resource/supply chain disruptions to focus on, EV batteries for Biden’s base, who treat EVs as a sort of magical talisman for their belief that more electrification significantly improves the environment, will solve anything in the absence of actual reductions in consumption.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If you buy new and don’t use national and local tax incentives maybe…", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You do realize that $40K is the average price for a new car in the U.S., right?

Therefore, they're calling for a continued de-risking of equities and risk-on assets.  Based on my independent analysis above, I am in agreeance with BofA.\n\nToo, the London Metal Exchange (LME), as backed by J.P. Morgan, bailed out their short-seller(s) at the expense of everyone else.  In a way that you would only wish that I was making up, the LME just 'undid' days of trades, made by smart investors who beat the 'short-selling tycoons' of the nickel markets.  This type of care-free destruction of public trust in markets could very well spread to the U.S., where investors are already skeptical about the Fed's correlations with short-selling bad actors in the market who are actively being investigated by the DOJ.  As we can see daily, the Fed's reverse repo 'overnight' program has been exploited on the order of $2 Trillion - this is in combination with a $10 Trillion Fed balance sheet, new requests for $6 Trillion budgets, and the [$4.5 Trillion Fed private 2019 bailout of Wall Street banks behind the backs of American taxpayers](https://tokenist.com/fed-finally-identifies-banks-received-4-5t-q4-2019-repo-program/).\n\nFurther, it was shown that [Barclays was just fined](https://www.ft.com/content/386df3ee-4b9d-45c5-9ae1-d5dffb2a822e) for half a Billion USD for over-shorting VXX which is an ETN that is associated with volatility and S&P 500 futures.  They literally short-sold 15 Billion USD of this volatility ETN BEYOND their $20 Billion limit as required by the U.S. - thereby creating false 'stability' pressures (yes: using wide-scale short-selling phenomena to subdue an important volatility ETN that is connected to the entire market system via S&P 500 contracts, options and futures) thereby inducing *fake* macro market stability during a time of geopolitical conflict, in order to put on a front of western market stability... in a way that simply did not make sense to economists.  Now, they have several weeks to months to *buy back all of these shares (thereby going long in volatility ETNs with tens of billions of dollars)*, or face blacklisting from U.S. regulators.  Similar in a few ways to the 'short-vol' XIV scandal in 2018, but in this case 'long vol,' this will surely add to the volatility in markets going forward.  That was owned by Credit Suisse.  That blew up.  That no longer exists.  Will the VXX ETN 'survive' in this process?  You can count on it that there is a line or two [in the 285 page prospectus](https://ipathetn.barclays/ipath/details/341408/download-content/7726665) that will probably lead to a 'no' answer.

Their explanation is a combination of 1) people wanted more money in the checking accounts 2) lower interest rates from things like bonds (not a part of M1 but a part of M2) incentivized them to hold cash instead and 3) change in regulation allowed unlimited withdrawals from savings accounts, effectively moving them from M2 to M1.
