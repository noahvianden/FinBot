{"title": "USD Inflation surges 7.9% on an annual basis, highest since 1982 (according to newly released CPI Report)", "selftext": " The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.8 percent  in February on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.6 percent in January,  the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months,  the all items index increased 7.9 percent before seasonal adjustment. \n\n Increases in the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food were the largest  contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The gasoline index  rose 6.6 percent in February and accounted for almost a third of the all items  monthly increase; other energy component indexes were mixed. The food index rose  1.0 percent as the food at home index rose 1.4 percent; both were the largest  monthly increases since April 2020.  \n\n  The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.5 percent in February  following a 0.6-percent increase the prior month. The shelter index was by far  the biggest factor in the increase, with a broad set of indexes also  contributing, including those for recreation, household furnishings and  operations, motor vehicle insurance, personal care, and airline fares.   \n\n The all items index rose 7.9 percent for the 12 months ending February. The  12-month increase has been steadily rising and is now the largest since the  period ending January 1982. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.4  percent, the largest 12-month change since the period ending August 1982. The  energy index rose 25.6 percent over the last year, and the food index increased  7.9 percent, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending July 1981.  \n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)", "id": "tayrqr", "created_utc": 1646919267.0, "score": 4507, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 865, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to *forget* any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies—all this is indispensably necessary.

Foreign actors have been reducing Treasury exposure so Fed becomes the last buyer of sovereign debt. \n\nResult is every 100bps increase in rates is another $100B in annual net interest. \n\nUS has to run negative real rates for years to try to wiggle out of this. They can’t pull a Volcker. If they tried to make real rates positive you’d add another $800B to net interest and cause a deep recession which would reduce tax receipts and increase spending due to fiscal stabilizers (unemployment, etc).

Yes, Ford has a lot of legacy *baggage*. They have a hugely monumental task of ramping up their EV production fast enough to displace ICE sales in the hopes that demand for ICEs doesn't decline faster than they can keep up with.\n\nEven catching up to Tesla's 1M EVs per year isn't going to be good enough. They need to hit that 4M/year EVs produced ASAP. No law of economics says that the downward trend in ICE demand will be slow, gentle and easy for Ford and an equal-opposite mirror to EV ramp up. Those two things operate at very different time scales. They can hope for a slow decline in ICE demand but need to plan for a dramatic and fast collapse or just not bother trying.\n\nAnd what kind of tech do they plan to use to get there? LG pouch cells. The same pouch cells in the [Bolt](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a38252667/battery-experts-explain-chevy-bolt-fires/), [Pacifica PHEV](https://insideevs.com/news/567150/chrysler-pacifica-phev-recall/) and [Mach-E GT](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/mustang-mach-e-gt-vs-tesla-model-y-performance-power-problem.html).

Heavy loads. With crappy pouch cells known for thermal runaway issues. Probably good for popping popcorn over.\n\nRivian's got its own challenges like any other startup but their tech lead and experience are huge. They're up there with Tesla and Lucid with over a decade of experience and know-how. It's no mistake that these three companies have the longest-range EVs on the market and they're all using cylindrical cells. The only exception are base-model, non-performance Tesla Ys and 3s that use CATL prismatic cells. But if you want high-performance or high-load batteries it's becoming obvious that you need cylindrical.\n\nRivian will struggle but get a big boost when Ford, GM and Stellantis EV pickups are either bursting into flames or stranded on the side of the road at the start of a mountain pass.

Those operations that did stop now don't have the funding to start back up again. Who wants to invest in that?\n\nThe whole system is only healthy if demand is constant and increasing.

Our trustworthiness with our allies had been decimated, after both the Afghanistan withdrawal and our complete abandonment of the Kurds in Syria. \n\nBut it's important to note that most of this was done or caused by the previous administration.

I give Biden a bit of a pass (perhaps undeservedly) because the timeline was basically just a month after he got into office... seriously, one month. But it was still his job to recognize that the timeline was set and to prioritize finding a way to get out of there, but again, it's my opinion that the super tight timeframe between swearing in to office and our withdraw date from afghanistan basically made this mission impossible for him. I personally might even believe that this was an intentional trap set by Trump to hamstring Biden in the first month of his Presidency, but I can understand if you might disagree with that. \n\nAs for Ukraine, I believe Putin was always going to invade. I can't blame the previous administration that the invasion occurred because I do not believe it's Trump's fault. Honestly, the US and NATO should have had a much stronger reaction when Putin took Crimea. \n\nBut what I \\*can\\* say is that I believe Putin would have preferred Trump to be President during the withdraw, and that Putin would have preferred the US to already be out of NATO (if possible, not a requirement but a nice-to-have for sure). I think we all know Trump loves Putin. He sent him fan mail before becoming President. He sees him as strong, he sees he has full control over the country... Trump wanted that for himself... always has. It's been a long time since I read up on the topic, but I recall when the Kurdish backstab was occurring, I remember thinking and reading that this helped Putin tremendously (but I don't remember the context of it to be honest). \n\nI genuinely believe Trump would have let Ukraine just be rolled over and pretended he didn't know until after it happened. Whether I'm right or not is irrelevant, it's a personal belief. I think Germany kinda wanted to do that too. When Trump first got the Republican nomination in 2016 at the Republican National Convention, one of the first orders of business he had AT the convention was to ensure the Republican party platform did NOT offer lethal aid to Ukraine. You can see that here:  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html)\n\nSo basically, I think the Trump administration made very clear from day 1 that they had no strategic interest in Ukraine at all, that we shouldn't offer Ukraine aid or defensive weapons, and (by implication only) that we should not respond or assist Ukraine if Russia does attempt to invade Ukraine. Even when Trump was required to give the aid to Ukraine by law, Trump delayed, did not release the aid, and then eventually asked for \"a favor\", which I'm sure you and i have different opinions on and I'd rather not get into right now but, I think the combination of these things shows that Trump had no interest in putting anything (effort, money, etc) into Ukraine, and was more concerned with what he could get out of them. \n\nIs Trump at fault for the invasion? No. I think it was always going to happen. Did Trump strengthen Putin's hand in some way or weaken Ukraine to make the invasion easier? Not really, but he definitely tried to not give the weapons when he was required to give the weapons, but in the end, he still gave the weapons so he didn't really have any effect here. But would Putin have preferred Trump be in office when he did invade? Yes, I believe he would have. And I believe the invasion would have been swift and successful if Trump were President. \n\nWould that have been better for the US? Would that avoid WW3? Well, I don't know the answer here. I suspect it wouldn't avoid WW3. I suspect that when someone like Putin has an easy success (like crimea) they begin planning the next one. Eventually Putin would have pushed up against NATO. If we were no longer in NATO, would Putin feel emboldened enough to take Lithuania, Estonia, Moldova, etc? Would Putin try to rebuild the entire Soviet Bloc? Your guess is as good as mine. \n\nWould it be better for the US to let Europe fight Russia alone and the USA comes in at the end and mops up resistance like after WW2, which led to decades of prosperity for us as Europe was a burned out husk? I mean, maybe, but that's not exactly avoiding WW3... that's just trying to stay out of it until we can mop up what's left. \n\nAnyway, I think you should really consider whether Biden has ACTUALLY been weak in this situation or not. I know it's fun to cheer for our team, but every now and then it's good to sit back, revisit all the information, and really consider whether Biden did a bad job here. He basically had three choices: 1) ignore it and let it happen,  2) step in as world police and fight russia directly, or 3) do anything he could to expose the plans, ruin the plans, build consensus, get NATO to back Ukraine with super-lethal weapons, etc. I believe Biden did a pretty good job. Will it avoid WW3? No idea... but I think it will, because Russia's military has been shown to be a huge paper tiger. \n\nI think you should definitely take a step back and think about what a weak President does in this situation.

The food index rose 1.0 percent as the food at home index rose 1.4 percent; both were the largest monthly increases since April 2020.\n\nThe index for all items less food and energy rose 0.5 percent in February following a 0.6-percent increase the prior month. The shelter index was by far the biggest factor in the increase, with a broad set of indexes also contributing, including those for recreation, household furnishings and operations, motor vehicle insurance, personal care, and airline fares.\n\nThe all items index rose 7.9 percent for the 12 months ending February.

While given energy costs, yes, inflation this month is probably up that's not what's meant by that term.\n\nWhat that term means is that the effect of changes in the inflationary factors take roughly 6 months to a year to realize.\n\nThe reason for this is because contracts and acquisition methods that move prices into the consumer market are made months in advance. It also takes time for pricing pressure to push prices up once demand is introduced into the economy.\n\nWhat we are seeing right now is, in large part, because we're doing a Year over Year calculation against the astronomical GDP increase at the end of 2020. In early 2020, due to the pandemic, GDP plummeted and inflation plummeted with it. It's worth noting that deflationary curves like that tend to happen quickly, just like they do for stocks. Elevator down, staircase up.\n\nInflation remained low through the massive gap-up in late 2020, and inflation in January 2021 only registered 1.4% for the entire year after being almost flat for most of the year on average. Prices didn't gap up to reflect the intense spending increase in late 2020 until mid-2021 as a result. Since then, GDP growth has slowed significantly and the Month over Month trend since then is half what it was on average compared to the first half of 2021.\n\nWe're seeing in the first two months of this year higher MoM figures (0.5% and 0.6% respectively) because of geopolitical tensions, a higher than normal GDP representing slightly higher economic activity during the holiday period, and energy pricing pressure coming from a combination of 12% reduced energy production compared to 2019 production figures and the winter cyclical energy demand cycle.\n\nJune of 2021 was an inflection point where inflation slowed down, so if you understand the calculation the implications are actually that inflationary forces BEFORE UKRAINE would result in lower YoY inflation once we hit that inflection point this year because of the lower inflationary acceleration trend in the last half of 2021.\n\nThe Ukraine situation really throws a wrench in that, so it's anyone's guess what's going to happen now, but these figures in no way suggest that real inflation now is higher than the read from last month. The data just doesn't work that way.\n\nWhat's happening when you assume that higher numbers imply higher numbers in the future is a known human cognitive bias called \"linear bias.\" There's a presumption that trends continue in the same direction all the time... which is the same bias that causes 90% of the people here to buy at the top and then get surprised when things revert.

{"title": "RIVN is dead in the water and their trucks won't even float.", "selftext": "Okay, so here's the deal. Rivian has absolutely nothing going for it. It can't break into the market for consumers because its target market doesn't know trucks at all, and the market it could feasibly advertise to has brand loyalty and doesn't want electric trucks because the smell of gas is too good. It also has an extremely ambitious plan for charging stations across the US which isn't going to happen under their name because they're hemhorraging money like a hemophiliac with a cut artery.\n\nHell even look at their preorders and manufacturing. Making 1000 cars in 3 months and having 71,000 preordered? On top of having 100,000 trucks slated for amazon? It's going to take two years to make even a tenth of those because of material costs, manufacturing, shipping, and servicing. By that point they're going to be losing money by manufacturing previous models when everyone is buying their Ford and Chevy pickups that run on Uranium or corn oil or some shit that has more power than their already underwhelming pickup specs. That's long term, but it's going to reflect in their earnings tomorrow because holy shit the company has no guidance on what they want to do.\n\n\"But wait, Amazon owns 20% of the company, they wouldn't let it go under!\"\n\nJoke's on you they absolutely would. The services they've started up and failed is getting longer each year. Even the whole foods acquisition is losing them money each year and thy can't expand on it or any of their other side services. Each time they do, the service [lasts 1-2 years max and then is completely removed, whether it's a subscription service or product.](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-products-services-failed-discontinued-2019-3#amazon-webpay-22)\n\n\"The company can remain solvent while they get more manufacturing capacities though!\"\n\nThey have billions in debt and their upcoming factory is going to cost them billions more. Now they want [a battery recycling plant that's going to cost them $5bil](https://www.ajc.com/news/rivian-confirms-ev-factory-thousands-of-jobs-coming-to-georgia/CUH7ZNS5URGODNQG7CEUU2FCVY/) and employ 7,500 people at competitive wages starting in 2024 when they hope to start manufacturing and becoming profitable. Building costs alone are going to eat them alive before it's even making trucks that aren't profitable because they're going to need to manufacture 171,000 vehicles at the promised price which will be a loss.\n\nTheir last quarter posted horrible losses, increased overhead costs, and only boasted further lofty expansion ideals that will again, increase their costs and not generate profit to match. This quarter is going to eat them alive and their methods of generating revenue are going to continue to fail until they start focusing on generating actual income instead of trying to promise the moon.\n\nHere's my positions because I can't buy any more until I make bank from this. https://www.imgur.com/a/lUHPvfX\n\nThis is not financial advice, and I actually have no idea if their trucks float or not. I just know electricity and water don't mix well.\n\nEdit: DJ just sent out a news story saying that earnings don't matter and that the only part that will matter is the manufacturing capacity. Investors are expecting only 40,000 cars by the end of the year, just over half of the preorders if no one cancels. Prices are only going up on raw materials and manufacturing too, so the longer it takes for them to get made the lower they net per vehicle and can't manufacture ones at the new price until previour orders are filled. That's not even including the Amazon contract of 100,000 freight vans. They're expecting an 18% move up or down according to Barrons.com. They're going to lose a shit ton of money on the cars that already got sent out because of the insane costs to everything and they still haven't cauterized that figurative hemhorraging femoral money artery. This stock is going to the GROUND.\n\n2nd edit: these numbers are good for Rivian's forward growth, right? https://imgur.com/a/j511eJE\n\n3rd edit: get fucked Rivian, only 9,000 more R1T preorders since last quarter, $4.6 net operating loss for 2021, losing money for each car produced, tripled amount of R&D spending, and now expected to produce a whopping 25,000 cars in 2022 compared to the 40,000 estimate. Can't even fill all preorders now for 2.5 years at this rate, and by that point the technology will be outdated. My puts are gonna be spicy tenders tomorrow, people!\n\nFriday edit: What kind of autism does actual wall street have? A price sitting at close to open currently for a company that had only 1% of its revenue compared to its losses and it has a $100 price target to put it at a market cap of nearly $120bil?

And if inflation stays high, the Fed is “prepared to raise by more than that” in the coming months, Chair Jerome Powell said last week.  \n>  \n>That would be a mistake. After next week’s hike, the Fed should hit pause for at least the next several months and possibly through the summer — even though the war in Ukraine will no doubt make inflation worse in the U.S.  \n>  \n>It’s unclear how bad the conflict will get, the effect it will have on the region and whether it will lead to a global recession this year. The probability of that last is less than the most extreme predictions, but is nonetheless real.  \n>  \n>A more aggressive Fed might use a recession as an opportunity to rapidly bring down inflation by sticking to its rate-hike schedule. That is risky policy, and one that [Powell seems disinclined to take](https://archive.ph/ybhBA). If a recession hit, it’s likely that the Fed would simply have to reverse any rate hikes it had made in the preceding months.  \n>  \n>A see-saw pattern in rates would weaken the overall impact of the Fed’s policy. Consider, for example, the plight of a homebuilder who cuts production next summer in response to rising rates. She is not likely to increase production immediately if rates fall in December; she’d want to wait for a signal that rates will remain low for a while. From the Fed’s perspective, it would be more effective to leave rates alone, encouraging her to keep production high for the next several months.  \n>  \n>There are also risks to consider beyond outright recession. The direct costs of higher energy and food prices will cut into consumer savings. Even more important, spiking commodity prices are likely to dent consumer confidence, leading to reduced spending on other items.  \n>  \n>Another consideration is the effect of the war on developing markets around the world. Higher food and energy prices will hit their economies harder. Global uncertainty will lead investors to move funds out their markets and into the U.S. That could cause a drop in the demand for U.S. exports, which are geared toward investment goods such as heavy machinery. That would reproduce some of the effects of the mini-recession that swept the Midwest in 2015 and 2016.  \n>  \n>At the same time, money flowing into the U.S. from both developing markets and Western Europe will cause the dollar to rise and the relative prices of imports to fall. As consumer spending shifts toward imports, that will cool some of the underlying inflationary pressures in the U.S.  \n>  \n>The near-term environment is complex. It’s unclear how long the war will last and how far-reaching its effects will be. The ideal Fed response, however, is straightforward: **Go ahead with the rate hike next week. But make it clear that there won’t be any more for at least two more meetings, and then only as the fallout from the war in Ukraine becomes more certain.**", "id": "tb59ks", "created_utc": 1646937083.0, "score": 4273, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 1086, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|280|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tb59ks)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tb59ks)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "We’ve gone from “the Federal reserve should exist to dull the booms and mitigate the busts” to straight up “we must avoid any downturn at all costs or the world will end”", "score": 2265, "replies": [{"body": "That's also because the markets in reality are artificially propped up in the first place.

Are you sure about that? Think really carefully about how you save veggie saying something else really stupid. Because I can think of several places off the top of my head where that didn't happen.\n\nAs for explaining why housing prices went up, I don't know if you're aware, but there's this generational cohort called \"millennials\" which are larger than the baby boomers that all decided to run out and buy their first home at the same time. Home ownership rates among millennials increased by 4-5% across the entire age range for the generation between 2018 and 2021. At the lower end of estimates, that's 2.88 million new home owners in the US. Which would be a pretty hefty demand shock in normal situations, except that homeownership actually increased by similar (if slightly lower) percentages across every other demographic as well - about 3% overall, or roughly 4.5 million new homeowners using a conservative estimate of total number of households in the US. \n\nMeanwhile, since 2020, only 600,000 new homes have been built. What the fuck do you think happens when demand grows at 4.5 million in 3 years, but supply only grows at .6 million? And that's raw supply without adjusting for the actual supply for sale, because that's been even lower.\n\nThat's just US, by the way. Outside of North America, things were decidedly more mixed, with some countries experiencing rapid price growth and others experiencing much slower growth or even decline. Japan, for example, only saw a 7 point increase between 1Q19 and 1Q22.\n\n>during a period where we had tens of millions of excess people dying and hundreds of millions of people unemployed or otherwise negatively impacted?\n\nTens of millions? Really? Because I currently see the global death toll sitting at any 6.3 million. Granted, that's probably low, and the full death toll might be double that, but that's still not \"tens of millions.\" It's \"ten of millions.\" Remember when I told you to think before saying something stupid? You should have listened.\n\nAs for hundreds of millions of people unemployed or otherwise negatively impacted, they're almost exclusively people who don't matter for this analysis because they're by and large people who were never going to buy a home anyway. You should know this, because every financial publication for the past two years has been talking about the K-shaped recovery. People in the bottom half of the income distribution got poorer, while people in the upper half got richer. As a personal anecdote, my gross income went up by about 3x over the last two years. Everyone I employ and everyone I know has seen their income rise by at least 10%, and most by 20%. \n\nThe people who saw their fortunes fall during COVID were, by and large, people working in retail and other direct customer-service roles who are mostly earning around minimum wage. They weren't part of the market to begin with, so them dropping further out of the market doesn't have any impact on housing prices.\n\n>Are you saying that global housing demand organically grew by a factor of 2x or so during this exact period of time? Why?\n\nNo, and this is why it helps to have at least a basic education and to not be a complete moron when discussing economics. I'm saying that the gap between supply and demand and the incomes for folks participating in the market grew at an accelerated rate which pushed equilibrium prices higher. Demand growth and price growth is not a linear 1-1 relationship - once demand outstrips supply, prices begin to grow at a scaled rate that is higher than the growth in demand until such a point where the sum of the price for every available unit exceeds the sum of the cash available across total demand for that particular good.\n\n>Why is Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, NYC, and the other big city markets going apeshit along with all of the others?\n\nThey're not? For most of the pandemic, and even now, you can find units in NYC and SF for significant discounts over previous time periods. There was a 16 month period where you could basically buy an apartment in the city for free, relatively, as long as you were willing to pay condo fees. Same with SF. San Diego, LA, and Miami were special cases because they were significantly cheaper than first-tier cities and also made up of much higher numbers of single-family homes - that is, those three cities (and Austin, Seattle, Portland, Denver, etc.) are basically overgrown suburbs that are much cheaper than NYC and SF and saw an influx of people from higher COL areas that were willing to purchase single-family homes at prices much higher than lower-paid locals.\n\nAbby other stupid questions?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's not Millennials.\n\nhttps://minnesotareformer.com/2021/08/11/millennials-are-the-largest-workforce-and-the-least-wealthy-why-politics\n\n\"Mark Zuckerberg, with an estimated net worth of $97 billion, owns 2% of all Millennial wealth. \"\n\nMillennials don't have any money.

Average wealth per Millennial is $69k. \n\nWhich is why averages are almost never used in economics -- they're an absolutely awful way to look at large groups with broad ranges of results. It also doesn't actually support your argument at all -- in fact, just the opposite. A net worth of $60-70k is about what you'd expect of a recent new homeowner. That's basically a 20% down payment on an average-priced home.\n\nThen keep in mind that there's a pretty steep difference between younger millennials and older millennials. The average net worth for older millennials is [$436,200](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/average-net-worth-by-age). Even the median is $91,000. Either one of those figures is more than high enough to afford a home.\n\nThen further keep in mind that Millennials are still at home ownership rates of around 50%, so we're mostly talking about the right-hand side of the income and wealth distribution.\n\nOr to put it simply: some millennials have money.

Most people buying their first house (if your assumption is that the driver of home prices is Millennial buying) are not buying brand new. \n\nWell, sort of. New construction typically doesn't carry any significant price premiums over most existing homes. But that aside, in your desperate need to use the word facile, you totally missed the point that if population increases faster than number of homes are built, it doesn't matter if millennials are buying new or old - supply still grossly lacks demand. This is especially true when considering that a large chunk of US supply is in dead zip codes where no one wants to live.\n\n>Honestly, I don't really care what you think.

It's certainly not the kind of decline that'll suddenly allow people making $50,000 to buy a half million dollar home.\n\nThe 2008 crisis was spured on by a combination of NINJA mortgages and 5/1 adjustables/interest only loans on the customer side, and the ludicrous abstraction in the derivatives market combined with some very shady practices in packaging those derivatives. And neither of those things is happening currently. Almost like there's important nuance in complex economic issues.\n\n>What is driving prices up is irrational exuberance (free MONEY) and a stampede towards purchasing because rents are going up on a similar trajectory. \n\nSo it's \"irrational\" but it has a clear and rational cause (high rents)? It can't be both, dude. It's either irrational, or it's rational consumer activity in picking from the lower cost option of two interchangable goods. And unless you somehow see rents dropping precipitously, then it's not really a bubble, is it?

Just hold them accountable, instead of letting them profit EVEN MORE than last year?\n\n>\n>At the same time, money flowing into the U.S. from both developing markets and Western Europe will cause the dollar to rise and the relative prices of imports to fall. As consumer spending shifts toward imports, that will cool some of the underlying inflationary pressures in the U.S.\n\n7. Ummmm, then why is the U.S. Dollar having a hard time, while literally every major company is just raking in everything possible, with U.S. consumers able to purchase fewer products??\n\n>\n>The near-term environment is complex.

{"title": "Rivian, failed price hikes, only 1000 vehicles sold, French bonds and Ford's soon to happen dumping, This could mean blood in the water.", "selftext": "So posting this because last time I made a DD on a earnings call it went quite well for me, consider this a good luck charm (especially if you roast me in the comments).\n\nBut Rivian's earnings this time around seem to be expecting a better cash burn rate than this time 3 months ago. HOW? They're still building their factory and I assume paying employees more due to COLAs in addition to increased component costs. \n\nI noticed today that they're selling a billion dollars in USD bonds in France with an expiration of 2025.  This just adds liability onto the bonfire that is the company. Alexa ranks show their traffic TANKING. All their metrics are all down. I expect this to mean it's a brand currently in decline short term. Meaning it's not growing, but adding more debt to the pile of a currently shrinking business.\n\nThe failed price hikes are an example of desperate moves to try to make some profit off the cars, which failed and led to backlash. This means that if they aren't making money off the trucks for the pre-orders, then they're losing money on each truck they sell, meaning cash burn would be worse as of now. Not to mention the planned rollout of charging stations and the cancelled pre-orders on their end (see rivian sub-reddit). This means that unfortunately for the Rivian hopefuls, at least right now, they're most likely trying to decrease units built, not increase them. Meaning a bad guidance.\n\nFord is a major shareholder and is expected to dump once the lockup is over. If that's the case and the eventuality of Rivian's stock price is down, then it only makes sense to dilute the stock like crazy now and get the cash before Ford can. I saw a post the other day saying Ford might dump and then buy the ashes of the company for pennies on the dollar. With the decline of lincoln being more for rich boomers/Gen-x'ers, millennials want an offering to their tastes which is what (I assume) a Rivian division of ford would bring. The only way to survive is to make sure they can't do this, so RJ's gotta crash it first.\n\nRivian puts 0DTE, let's do this. (I got in before IV jacked it up sorry everyone).
