{"title": "All loss joking aside, some people may never invest in stocks again.", "selftext": "In the late 90s, I was making a great salary, aggressively saving, living frugally, but for investing was risk averse, by nature. I did not want to lose money I had earned and saved.  I still don't.\n\nFull blown dot com mania rolled around when the globe.com went public in late 1998.  I played around with an ETrade account during the .com bubble, making harmless $5k trades, no options, took profits way too early, but followed the market action very closely.  I dabbled lightly and did some IPO trades, some premature shorting, and mostly used it as a positive learning experience.   No harm, no foul.   I was mostly a coward, happy to have my money safe on the sidelines, CDs and bonds, but the dot com bubble was spectacular on the upside and the downside.\n\nHowever, the experience left me very distrustful of the entire game.  Investment banks underwriting bogus websites with no earnings to sucker bagholders which turned out to be mom and pop mutual funds, pension funds, and day traders who didn't actually daytrade.  Insiders cashing out of bogus IPOs to the retail sucker.  The whole thing seemed like a huge scam.  A bullet that I dodged since I didn't get too caught up in the game.  I had a day job and did not quit it, and kept earning and saving.\n\nThe moral of the story is that I never really went full hog into the stock market.  I am one of those people.  Missed out on tons of tech gains for the next 20 years.  All due to the skepticism developed during the dot com bubble.  Threw the baby out with the bathwater.   And I didn't even lose any money!!\n\nFast forward to COVID bubble, and some new investors have gotten clobbered in the last year.  Meme stocks, SPACs, and scam IPOs are down 50% to 75% of peak values.  It's the exact same thing.   A lot of people will hold underwater stocks until $0 or until they die, if they never break even.  But, that's another conversation.\n\nI get the feeling this recent bear market will scar some of the victims for life.  My advice is to learn from your mistakes (YOLO options trades, bag-holding meme stocks, invest in diversified ETFs, etc) ....Whatever you see as the lesson for you and move forward with your financial lives.   Do not throw the baby out with the bathwater and stuff cash in your mattress for the rest of your life.  Because there are a bunch of people reading this who are at risk of doing exactly that, which to be fair, isn't the worst thing in the world.\n\nPlease don't hate on me.

I'll summarize the key points:\n\n1. Inflation / Fed.  That's the issue, inflation was such a horrible issue for the economy that the Fed had to raise rates drastically to combat it.  Some inflation is arguably good for the stock market, but when it gets high enough that it's disruptive to the real economy, that's not good for the stock market.   What's more, the Fed couldn't raise rates like that to fight inflation nowadays even if they wanted to.  There's too much debt.\n2. Inequality in and of itself can't crash the market, but it leaves the real economy vulnerable which later has repercussions for earnings and the stock market.\n3. The US government can keep rolling over their debt indefinitely (in theory), but corporations do have to pay back their debt.  If they can keep financing it with new debt, then no issue.  But if there's a severe downturn and people become reluctant to lend, this would become a huge crisis.  It happened in 2008 and crisis was only averted thanks to the huge liquidity injections from the Fed.  But each time we do this debt just keeps growing larger and larger, making us more vulnerable to shocks.\n4. There's no reason to sell anything.  All I'm arguing is for being prudent.\n5.

{"title": "Luckin Coffee DD", "selftext": "**EDIT: 6 hours after my post, Luckin coffee filed with the court to close the chapter 15 case. They also revealed the the joint provisional liquidators were discharged on 3 March. Link to filing [here](http://dm.epiq11.com/case/LUCK/dockets/92?debtorId=11382).  Finally, the filing says Luckin will exit chapter 15 on 7 April.  This is not yet being reported by a single news outlet.\n\n**Thesis: a significantly mis-priced stock because contrary to popular belief, the Luckin Coffee of 2022 is not the same company as the LK of 2020, and almost nobody knows it. It is a much better company, profitable, and well positioned to be talked about as one of the greatest turnarounds ever for a company.**\n\n**BLUF: Luckin Coffee is poised to announce that the joint provisional liquidators appointed by the Cayman court will be discharged, and an exit from Chapter 15 will occur soon after, with common shares intact.**  I know because it is plainly stated in [this](https://document.epiq11.com/document/getdocumentbycode?docId=4063068&amp;amp;amp;projectCode=LUCK&amp;amp;amp;source=DM) court filing.  Nobody is talking about this. Edit: I fixed the link\n\nWe all know the Luckin Coffee of 2020, the Muddy Waters report, the subsequent crash and delisting, but almost no information has been out in the mainstream that has provided investors with a clear picture of the company's turnaround.  In fact, Google trends shows that searches for \"Luckin Coffee\" have never been lower, despite a clear turnaround in their business model and improved profitability.  Most of what you read on yahoo and other blogs is wrong.  Most articles have negative spin and report false numbers.  I believe these are perpetuated by investors with significant bias due to being invested in Starbucks or shorting China in general.\n\nThe majority of the information I have researched has come from the NY bankruptcy court filings, available [here](https://dm.epiq11.com/case/luckin/info), the Cayman Island court documents searchable  [here](https://judicial.ky/court_search/). exit: fixed links\n\nIf you didn't know, Luckin trades as an American Depositary Receipt (ADR), and is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) registered in the Cayman Islands.  That itself carries a bit of risk if you think that the U.S. government will delist these companies in three years.  In July 2020, Luckin entered into what was called joint provisional liquidation.  Unlike the name suggests, it was not due to an inability to pay its bills, but rather because the proceeds from the capital raise several months earlier could be considered proceeds of a crime - thus they weren't sure if they could use their \\~800 million on hand  to pay creditors.  The Cayman court appointed two lawyers as JPLs who were in charge of approving every single large transaction as well as overseeing the turnaround for the past two years.  They filed for chapter 15 Bankruptcy last year, but again, this was not a traditional bankruptcy and only served to  make sure that any settlements reached in the Cayman Islands could be enforced in the US.  Many people sold out on this announcement because they didn't understand this fact.\n\n**Positive developments over the past two years:**\n\n\\- In the last two years, Luckin Coffee drastically changed their business model.  They closed unprofitable stores and started a new franchising model,  they are the only chain coffee shop that also operates in tier 3-4 cities.  \n\n\\- Everyone connected to the fraud is gone.  The CEO does not own any more shares, as they were seized by banks to satisfy a margin loan, and subsequently sold to the leading equity investor, Centurium capital.   \n\n\\- They settled with the SEC without admitting wrongdoing.  \n\n\\- Their latest quarterly earnings (Q3 2021) has a $0.01 loss per share, with revenue growing 106% yoy. \n\n\\- They successfully raised 250 million more last year in order to pay these settlement fees.  They settled with their bondholders, which was subsequently approved by the Cayman court.  \n\n\\- They settled the class action lawsuit from shareholders for pennies on the dollar, which was also approved by the cayman court and preliminarily approved by the NY district court (in fact many have perhaps received notice of this settlement).  \n\n\\- They are back to regular financial reporting.  \n\n\\- Common shares intact after restructuring\n\n\\- 700 million in cash on hand\n\n\\- More stores than Starbucks in China\n\n\\- Valued 8 times less on a per store basis than Manner coffee, another Chinese coffee startup.\n\n\\- Market cap is only 3x price to sales for 2021\n\nEdit: 2020 audited financials [here](https://investor.luckincoffee.com/static-files/7d6b36bc-1c8c-4df6-a74f-962f6e7489fa)\n\nQ3 2021 financials [here](https://investor.luckincoffee.com/static-files/d6ede740-1174-4918-8005-e0167693d75b)\n\n**Risks**\n\n\\- Everybody hates Luckin.  This for me is the biggest risk.  Will they be able to gain investors' trust again?  Those who have been burned may never give the company another chance, our of principle.  I completely understand, but I think it should be understood that the company is an entirely different company with a different management team now.\n\n\\- Chinese VIE (geopolitical risk)\n\n\\- Take private.  Centurium capital controls about 60% of the vote, so it's conceivable that they may make a play to take private with only a 20% premium, and relist in China at a substantial markup.  However, the Poison pill adopted by the company last year makes this unlikely unless collusion by the board.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is not financial advice.  I am a shareholder and I am long (edit: position [here](https://m.imgur.com/a/UkXXaAF)). I truly believe that this is the most undervalued consumer stock that still has a lot of room to grow in a Chinese market serving a billion people in a coffee market that is expected to boom.", "id": "t6epam", "created_utc": 1646383783.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 215, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|4|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t6epam)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t6epam)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm the guy who lost 250k on Luckin Coffee\n\nI still own all of my stocks 8300 at 33 average. \n\nWe will see 😊😊😊", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "I was on WSB but missed you and your story.

But doing so in the wake of Russia’s widely condemned invasion of Ukraine brings unique risks. World leaders are seeking to punish [some Russian companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/R83LEHDWLU70) and cut the country off from the global financial system, and any firm perceived as working against those interests faces potential reputational damage, market watchers say.  \n>  \n>“The whole point of the sanctions is to make them and their instruments untouchable,” said Athanassios Diplas, a veteran derivatives trader who was at Goldman Sachs during the 1998 Russian financial crisis. “I have no issues looking at arbitrage opportunities in distressed situations, like back in 1998. But this is different.”  \n>  \n>**To be sure, the sanctions on Russia haven’t outright banned trading in the assets.**  \n>  \n>Goldman Sachs is primarily asking for corporate debt from the likes of [Evraz Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EVR:LN), Gazprom PJSC and [Russian Railways](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RZHD:RU) that matures within the next two years, and has made bids for Russian sovereign notes, the people said.  \n>  \n>**The purchases by banks underscore a facet of Wall Street’s longstanding culture: Trading desks are geared toward finding undervalued or mispriced assets, and their activities don’t necessarily reflect the broader view of their firm toward an asset class or nation.**  \n>  \n>Representatives for Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment.  \n>  \n>Russian corporate bonds denominated in foreign currencies have plunged to deeply distressed levels in recent days. The debt may soon [be removed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-01/jpmorgan-reviewing-what-part-russian-debt-will-have-in-indexes) from major benchmarks, and concern is mounting that companies could miss principal payments.  \n>  \n>JPMorgan was telling clients that it traded about $200 million of Russian and Ukrainian corporate debt Thursday, including from clients seeking to exit positions.  \n>  \n>Still, some banks and fund managers are erring toward caution, either reining in or abstaining from such transactions amid the rapidly evolving situation, people familiar with the matter said.  \n>  \n>At one major U.S. hedge fund, a decision was made to avoid Russian bonds entirely for now. The specter of holding debt that could become untradeable in another round of sanctions is too risky, and the war is just a week in. At another, the decision was made to look only at corporate bonds that aren’t majority owned by the Russian government.  \n>  \n>“What we’re seeing is a bit of revulsion -- more and more institutions are steering clear of Russia due to reputational risks and pure difficulties in clearing and executing trades,” said Sally Greig, a money manager at Baillie Gifford in Edinburgh. “You have to tear up the distressed playbook. This is not the usual distressed situation. This is a very difficult time.”  \n>  \n>*CDS Play*  \n>  \n>Goldman Sachs is also trading credit-default swaps on names including Evraz and Gazprom, according to the people with knowledge of the situation.   \n>  \n>[Read more: Russia sanctions put $41 billion of default insurance at risk](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-02/russia-sanctions-put-41-billion-of-default-insurance-at-risk)  \n>  \n>The market for Russian default protection has faced growing scrutiny this week as traders try to understand if the contracts insuring $41 billion of sovereign debt could be rendered worthless by sanctions, or could be triggered in the event of a technical default.   \n>  \n>CDS tied to Russian government debt this week signaled a 65% chance of default within five years and 40% within one year, according to ICE Data Services.  \n>  \n>Late Thursday Russia [was downgraded](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-03/russia-cut-again-by-s-p-as-sanctions-and-controls-ramp-up) to CCC- by S&P Global Ratings, three levels above default, citing sanctions that have dramatically reduced available foreign-exchange reserves and are likely to restricted the ability of bondholders to receive interest and principal payments.\n\nBy [Laura Benitez](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ATbVNWPJ0k4/laura-benitez), [Sridhar Natarajan](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AQsv6zME0W4/sridhar-natarajan), and [Katia Porzecanski](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AQlzPWIh6gY/katia-porzecanski)  with assistance by Katherine Doherty, Claire Boston, Eliza Ronalds-Hannon, Rachel Butt, and Erin Hudson.\n\n[ ](https://www.bloomberg.com/tips/)", "id": "t6f6lt", "created_utc": 1646385842.0, "score": 1157, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 275, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|318|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvk0tv/wkhs_has_a_secondary_offering_shelved_with_an/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t6f6lt)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t6f6lt)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Maybe it was GS and JPM traders lecturing us the past few days to not buy Russian assets.

The economy shrank 5.3% in 1998 amid the debt crisis.  \n>  \n>The Russian economy is reeling after foreign governments slapped sanctions on trade, finance and travel, froze the reserves of its central bank and cut many of its banks from the SWIFT global messaging system. Russia has sought to insulate its economy and markets with capital controls, a doubling of interest rates and other emergency measures, all of which will hurt growth.  \n>  \n>“Sanctions undermine the two pillars promoting stability -- the ‘fortress’ foreign-currency reserves of the central bank and Russia’s current account surplus,” JPMorgan’s economists, led by Bruce Kasman, said in their report. “The sanctions will hit their mark on the Russian economy, which now looks headed for a deep recession.”  \n>  \n>Still, investors said while the human and geopolitical aftershocks of Russia’s invasion are greater than what was witnessed in 1998, in the short-term the ruble’s decline has proved smaller and the country now has a greater ability to stave off defaulting on its debt, especially if other nations continue to resist imposing sanctions on its energy exports.  \n>  \n>“It is the long-term that is more troubling,” said Tim Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street Global Markets. “The longer that sanctions are upheld, and especially if they are expanded to include gas and oil exports, the more likely Russia is to become an untouchable capital market for years to come.”  \n>  \n>“The currency weakness we see now will inevitably be inflationary, particularly if the economy remains closed off from the rest of the world,” he said. “It is not hard to envision extreme scenarios similar to the post-1998 period in this case.”  \n>  \n>Russia more than doubles its key rate to shore up ruble  \n>  \n>Oil and gas revenue has been providing a hard-currency support for Russia because the sale and transport of energy have avoided sanctions as the U.S. and other governments worry such limits would end up hurting their economies more.
