Does that sound right?\n\nYes. More time means more uncertainty about what the final price will be, and more uncertainty means more risk that a seller will have to deliver on the contract at a loss. Thus, such a seller must demand more *risk premium* for the additional time risk they take on.\n\n> But what about moving vertically selecting a strike price for that date? The further OTM slots you move into it seems like the more volatile the option premium price will fluctuate in response to the underlying price movement. In other words, it seems to amplify gains and losses.\n\nNot exactly right. On a *dollar basis* the opposite is true. A $1 move of the underlying might only cause a $.10 move of an OTM call. But on a *percentage basis* that might be right, because the cost of the call is so small. A $.10 increase on a $.05 original cost basis is a 200% gain. But at the end of the day, you still only made a dime per share.\n\n> but I don't really understand the best methods for selecting a option strike / expiration for a swing trade\n\nMy advice is stop looking at *stock* price charts and start looking at *option* price charts. Don't base your selection on the price movement of the underyling, base it on the price movement of the call itself.\n\nWhat you will find is that option price charts have a lot of gaps in them. Volume is orders of magnitude smaller than for stocks, so there will be lots of 1 minute candles missing. This means you can't use the same TA or trend analysis you'd use for swing trading stocks. You'll have to relearn all that for option price charts.\n\nSometimes it just isn't possible, like for a contract that only trades a handful a day. For those, you don't have a choice but to use the underlying price movement instead. In such cases, it's best to give yourself more time, like 30 to 60 days to expiration, and set modest profit targets, like 5% to 10%, on the call or put. You'll just have to wait until there is enough underlying price movement to reach your exit point.\n\nFinally, either stay ATM or a few strikes ITM. This increases your probability of profit while also increasing your upfront capital and thus capital at risk. But it's the right trade-off for swing trading.

It stems from confusion over what \"sell\" means. There isn't just one meaning for \"sell\".\n\nIf you \"sell to open\", you are liable for assignment and delivering/receiving shares as long as the contract is open.\n\nIf you \"sell to close\", which is what you are talking about, you are not liable for anything. It is analogous to buying a car and then a year later selling it to someone else. If they crash it into a police station 3 months after you sold it to them, are you liable for damages? No, of course not. The same goes for a contract you sold to close.\n\nWhen you buy to open a contract, you go from 0 contracts to 1 contract. When you sell to close, you go from 1 contract to 0 contracts. Why would anyone with 0 contracts be liable for anything to do with that contract?\n\n> Is it possible to lose more money than I initially purchased a call or a put for?\n\nNo, but there are conditions. As long as you **sell to close before expiration**, you can't lose more money than you paid for the contract. The one way you might lose more money is if all of the following happened:\n\n1. You hold the option through expiration.\n\n1. The option goes In The Money.\n\n1. The option is exercised by exception.\n\n1. The resulting deliverable loses money before you get control of it, 2 trading days later.\n\nSo for example, you buy 1 XYZ 42c 4/14 for $5 when the stock is $40. You hold it through expiration, when the stock is $50. Your call is ITM, so it is exercised by exception. You pay $42/share for 100 shares that are worth $50/share on expiration day. Unfortunately, it's a holiday weekend, and XYZ tanks due to a scandal over the weekend. On Monday you see the XYZ stock drop to $30/share, but you can't do anything because your shares aren't settled yet. On Tuesday morning, when your shares are finally settled, XYZ drops another $3 to $27/share. If you sell the shares at that point, you book a 27 - 42 - 5 = -20/share loss, or -$2000 total.\n\n> Do you HAVE to use margin to trade options?\n\nYes for unsecured short contracts or any strategy that has unsecured short contracts, like a vertical spread, but *using a margin account* is not the same thing as *taking out a margin loan*. It's the later that you might be afraid of, and rightly so. Selling short options requires cash collateral and the mechanism for delivering the collateral is a margin account.\n\n> Also, what are some things about options trading that you feel EVERY beginner should know about prior to trading?

The request will be made at its 2022 annual shareholders meeting expected in October.\n\nThe stock rallied 5.8% in premarket trading, putting them on track to open at the highest price seen during regular-session hours since Jan. 13.

Monday’s rally comes even after a report that Tesla will pause production in China amid new COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nTesla had 1.033 billion shares outstanding as of Jan. 31.

At that time, the stock was trading at a pre-split-adjusted price of about $2,213. The stock closed Aug. 31 at split-adjusted $498.32.\n\nTo lower the stock price to around that level, Tesla would have to increase number of shares it is authorized to have outstanding by more than 1 billion, so it could enact a 2-for-1 split. To match the previous 5-for-1 split, the number of authorized shares outstanding would have to increase by more than 3 billion.\n\nAlthough a stock split doesn’t change anything about a companies fundamentals, it has historically helped boost the stock price as it is viewed as a sign of management’s confidence that the stock will continue to perform well, as Mark Hulbert has written for MarketWatch.\n\nTesla’s stock had soared 78% from the time the company said after the Aug. 11 close that it approved a 5-for-1 stock split through Aug. 31, but then fell 33.7% over the next week. The stock didn’t close back above the Aug. 31 closing price until Nov. 19.\n\nTesla’s stock has lost 4.4% year to date through Friday, but has soared 63.4% over the past 12 months.

Even Tesla Supercharger stations don't get it right or have huge lines of waiting cars at certain times.

Even if they all had a place to charge, there is simply not enough installed electrical capacity.

But they are not in a position to flip a switch and overtake Tesla in the EV world. \n\nNote that these estimates are partly marketing; GM and Ford have a long road ahead to hit these targets. Everything has to go right. The point is that even if they execute perfectly (and perhaps they will), they are an order of magnitude behind Tesla in 2024.\n\nSay Tesla misses their stretch goals (equally possible as Ford or GM missing) - they will still be making 10M EV's year in 2027 or so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Plus, Tesla is losing its amazing Supercharger network advantage by (allegedly, according to Elon) opening it up to non-Teslas.\n\nI think Tesla has calculated that \n\n1) This is better as a monetization option then a moat due to build out of other charging networks\n\n2) The [infrastructure bill provided $5B in funding to states to build out charging grids](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-electric-vehicle-charging-action-plan/) and Tesla is more likely to be eligible for those funds if they're building a charging network for all brands.\n\n3) The Tesla supercharger experience will actually be an excellent brand ambassador. This will give Tesla an opportunity to get their app on non-customer's phones, develop a list of existing EV owners, and get more data on which brands' cars are where.

Even though your response is the type that an asshole would make, perhaps you are just having a bad day, and aren't an asshole.  If you are just having a bad day, and legitimately think that this is how the world works, let me enlighten you a little bit: it isn't.  I did the \"go get a job\" route.  I joined the Navy-mainly because they had a student loan repayment program that would cover the 80k in student loan debt I got from a degree.  A degree that I was assured was extremely marketable. A degree that I was assured (as an 18 year old kid with no financial understand) would pay for itself in a few short years. A degree that I was told was necessary if I wanted to ever have a chance at a job better than McDonald's.  I got out of college and they wanted $2k a month, more than my paycheck.  Even at that payment, it would take 15 years to get through just the interest.  So some form of student loan forgiveness became the option, hence the Navy.  Then they misfiled the paperwork, and didn't give me what I signed up for. So for 6 years under contract, interest accrued \"only lightly\" because of a deferment, while I fought the powers to be to get them to hold up their end of the bargain. They did not. I ended up medically discharged due to an injury, and they offered to send me to school again, this time on their dime.  No interest accrues while in school, so I figured it would but me time to try and figure out how to deal with this debt.  They had me take an aptitude test because they wanted to train me in something I would enjoy.  Results came back, I should be a writer.  Awesome, something I always wanted to do.  But then they said they were instead going to send me for a computer and electronics degree (same degree I already had) because that was a more realistic goal.  So when I finished that, I applied everywhere and anywhere.  For months.  I got one interview for what amounts to a greeter at a gym on a military base, making zero use of either degree for a whopping 15 bucks an hour.  Due to mandates on the installation, it wasn't allowed to be full time work, but I got a steady 39 hours a week.  Again, due to lack of alternatives, I took what was available. Take home pay was roughly 450 a week.  Student loan guys now want $2700 a month.  Then came my daughter.  To go back to work, I'd have to put her in daycare, so I shopped around for a good one.  A good one that teaches her and interacts, has good reviews, and leads to well adjusted individuals wanted 1200 a week.  So I looked for okay ones.  $600-$800 a week.  So I looked for ones that don't kill, rape, sell, or otherwise scar the kids.  $400 a week.  So for 39 hours a week I could work, missing out on time with my daughter, for fifty dollars-and that's assuming that gas to and from work/daycare is free and no unexpected charges come up.  So I became a stay at home dad.  I am not on any government programs, and my medical severance pays my part of the bills(barring student loans) , but leaves zero dollars for anything else.  So I took up writing. Published.  Dream succeeded.  But books don't sell like they used to, so over the last three months my take home profit was ninety two cents.  Student loans still sit in deferment, over 100k now.  Any time I try to get a loan to better my life in any way (by buying a house, for example, with a mortgage well below what I paid in rent) it's declined because of this looming student loan debt that was supposed to be taken care of. \n\nSo if it's okay with you, I'm going to continue to raise my daughter and be there for her, investing only the two dollars a week I can afford, instead of shoving her into a shitty box of subpar daycare workers while daddy tries to get rich.  I don't care about being rich financially, I'm rich where it counts.  Doesn't mean turning my little two dollar investments into something that can pay off those student loans wouldn't change my life for the better.

Tech companies (granted, GME is in transition) typically have multiples many times higher.\n\n5) GME may issue a crypto or NFT dividend.

Overstock did precisely this, and the stock went from like $4 to $130 or something.\n\n6) GME is connected to several other investments, like Loopring and Immutable X. \n\nI dunno, maybe you are just being a turd.
