{"title": "Stock Traders Brace for a $3.5 Trillion ‘Triple Witching’ Event tomorrow March 18, 2022", "selftext": " \n\nIn a quarterly event known as triple witching, roughly $3.5 trillion of single-stock and index-level options are set to expire, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. At the same time, more near-the-money options are maturing than at any time since 2019 -- suggesting a bevy of investors will actively trade around those positions.\n\nAnd once [again](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/triple-witching-to-hit-market-where-traders-pay-up-for-hedges), this triple witching coincides with a rebalancing of benchmark indexes including the S&P 500 -- a combination that tends to spark single-day volumes that rank among the highest of the year. According to an estimate from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, the rebalance in the index alone could spur $33 billion of stock trades.\n\nFriday’s session lands just as the S&P 500 regains its [footing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/stocks-aided-by-upbeat-powell-bonds-flash-caution-markets-wrap) with a three-day jump, buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s optimism the economy can withstand rate hikes and China’s promise to bolster its financial markets. Yet in the telling of derivatives pros, the rally has been fueled by dealers covering short positions to balance exposures while demand for stock hedges is elevated.\n\nNow as many contracts expire, the key question is whether investors will rebuild their holdings of protective puts amid growth concerns and the war in Ukraine -- or will they chase the market rebound with call contracts. \n\n“I’ve never seen an environment where you’ve had so many potential overhangs in the market that can not be controlled,” said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. “We’ll see if people can see to redeploy their puts.”", "id": "tgpmq2", "created_utc": 1647566286.0, "score": 1286, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 246, "comments": [{"body": "I've seen this sub bring up Triple/Quad witching day so many times and it's rare that anything significant ever happens.

I fully realize the cart is way out in front of the horse but they are easily a 20-30 billion dollar company in 6-8 years if they execute their growth strategy.  I know that still seems like a hefty price today for what seems like not a ton of growth potential beyond current valuation.  But I think with the trendiness of the product and the fact they haven’t entered a lot of markets yet means there is tons of potential for the price to revenue ratio to reach stupid levels like Chipotle.  Call me crazy but I would not be shocked if in a decade the company has a higher market cap than SBux, just because of that premium people will pay for a growing and popular brand.  Anyway I think the bear case can be regional consumer preferences and consumers demanding less sugar, of course they can mitigate some for those issues by updating the menu.

Sure, SBUX could fall but if they are falling then coffee shops in general are likely having issues. That being said, I've been wrong before lol.  \n\nAs for BROS, the thing I'm looking for in the 10-Qs/10-K is the company operated stuff only. Show me management can exceed their FY guidance ($707.5M at the mid-point for FY22 and >125 new co.-op stores). Show me AUVs growing at high-teens+%, and show me comp store sales of >7.5% this year. Most importantly, I'm watching their new Dutch Rewards numbers. I think that'll be a huge indicator of how the company is doing.  \n\nAll in all, I like them for their unique approach.

But I think in the day and age of retail investors a similar irrational exuberance can take over.  I didn’t say I think Bros will pass SBux but I will say I won’t be shocked if it does.  Guess my point is I see it as a solid growth opportunity that has all the potential in the world to get memefied (not sure if that is the right word here) into a market cap detached from reality.

It is actually quite polarizing for coffee snobs.  I think it is decent but I prefer a lighter roast and that is what their espresso is, I like it better than SBux but prefer the indie stores usually.  I liked Phil’s when I was in SF.  I’m a drip or Americano kind of guy but Bros sweet drinks are probably where they hit it out of the park according to most folks and are usually about 50 cents to a dollar cheaper than SBux.  I’ve heard people say the Bros drive up model won’t work in larger walking cities.  But a town near me (Corvallis, OR) has a couple walk up only stores so they have a template for a non-car based business even though the majority of their model is based around the drive up.  The walk in store also does drip coffee which I actually really enjoyed, typically when you order coffee from their drive through it is Americano with no drip option.  Maybe they expand drip but I feel drip is tricky to get right as coffee can get stale when kept warm.  So all in all I don’t know that it is super special, probably overrated but I’d say the same about In-n-Out and I still go there.  Decent product, decent value, friendly staff, efficient service and a strange cult like following.  \nAlso a wildcard is their Rebel energy drink line.

There are multiple brokerages you can make an account with online, so, no you don't have to go to a bank to open an account. Several options are TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, E\\*Trade, RobinHood, WeBull (those last two are more for options trading though, which is a risky trading type that you really don't want to get involved with unless you really build up your education on it. Even then, you could lose potentially all of your money). You just go to any of their websites (or apps) and apply to start an account.\n2. You can lose money with any investment you make. Going back to what I said above, stock options trading is the most riskiest investment you can get involved with, so I would stay far away from that as a new person to investing. As a beginner, you should really start with just buying and holding stocks. That's the least riskiest because even if it loses value you only lose that money if you sell at a loss. You should really only trade what you can afford to lose, overall.\n3. It depends on how much you invest. Pretty much you can only make several thousand if a) you are investing thousands already into the stock(s) you buy, and b) if you hold it for long term (like years) and your stock(s) appreciate in value a great deal in that timeframe. Or, which is highly unlikely and I would not at all suggest you have this mindset, you get randomly lucky and the stock(s) you invest in shoot up suddenly.\n4. Again, it depends on what kind of trading you want to do. If you are just looking to buy and hold stocks (or even better, ETFs), no, you don't need to monitor it too often. If you've invested into solid stocks or ETFs, you can just let them appreciate in value naturally over the years. If you want to be aggressive and frequently buy and sell shares (which is extremely risky) then yes, you would have to monitor it frequently. But as a beginner, I do not at all recommend this (it's called day trading and it's really risky). I would make changes to investments only if you are losing value in whatever you have invested in and it doesn't look likely to gain value in the time frame you wanted to sell it in, if you wanted to sell it at all. If you're not looking to sell, then I would just keep your stocks/ETFs and let them appreciate over time since, over the long hall, the market tends to go up.\n5. For a beginner, I would definitely first do as much research and education as possible on stock-buying and do what you're doing now (which is to ask questions). When you feel you have the knowledge you need and you make an account, I would first start looking at buying ETFs (ETFs basically give you small amounts of shares in major, low-risk companies). They will cover pretty safe stocks like AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT. We've been in an extremely volatile market the past couple of years and so the prices you see for each stock may not be what you would typically see.

{"title": "St. Louis Fed’s Bullard says the central bank should raise rates above 3% this year", "selftext": "St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday he thinks the central bank should raise interest rates the equivalent of 12 times this year to convince the public it is serious about fighting inflation. As the lone dissenter at this week’s Federal Reserve meeting, Bullard said in a statement that he would like to see the central bank’s benchmark interest rate boosted above 3% from the near-0% level where it had stood. “This would quickly adjust the policy rate to a more appropriate level for the current circumstances,” he said. Following its two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday said it would raise overnight rates for banks by 0.25 percentage point, historically the typical increment with which the FOMC moves. Accompanying economic projections indicated a path this year that would see the equivalent of seven rate hikes, or 1.75 percentage points. The move was the first time the Fed has raised the rate since December 2018 and came in response to a stunning increase in inflation that has seen prices rise at their fastest pace in 40 years.\n\nBullard was the only FOMC member to vote against the move, stating he would have preferred a rate hike of 0.5 percentage point, or 50 basis points. He added the Fed also should have started the process of reducing the nearly $9 trillion in bond holdings it has accumulated over the past 14 years. In his statement Friday, Bullard said inflation is hurting people the Fed is trying to help the most, namely those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. “The burden of excessive inflation is particularly heavy for people with modest incomes and wealth and for those with limited ability to adjust to a rising cost of living,” he said. “The combination of strong real economic performance and unexpectedly high inflation means that the Committee’s policy rate is currently far too low to prudently manage the U.S. macroeconomic situation.”\n\nFed officials overall were divided on how to proceed with rates this year. Ten members penciled in a fed funds rate of 1.75%-2% by year’s end, but eight said it should be higher. The highest “dot” on the committee’s dot plot, presumably Bullard’s, indicated a range of 3%-3.25%. He pointed out that the Fed has moved that aggressively before, in 1994-95 to combat a revving economy and a gradual rise in inflation. “The results were excellent,” Bullard said. “The Committee achieved 2% inflation on average and the U.S. economy boomed during the second half of the 1990s. I think the Committee should try to achieve a similar outcome in the current environment.” On the issue of the Fed’s balance sheet, Bullard did not provide details of what he thinks the central bank should do, saying only that “a plan” at this week’s meeting would have been appropriate. The post-meeting statement indicated that the committee “expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting.” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said afterward that the process could begin as soon as May.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/18/st-louis-feds-bullard-says-the-central-bank-should-raise-rates-above-3percent-this-year.html", "id": "th1bvr", "created_utc": 1647610113.0, "score": 405, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 226, "comments": [{"body": "Imagine clocking into work where 90% of your coworkers disagree with you every day.", "score": 281, "replies": [{"body": "Don't need to.", "score": 124, "replies": []}, {"body": "Imagine being the 10% who cares about doing their jobs correctly.", "score": 128, "replies": [{"body": "It is so weird to me that this has become the prevailing view on this sub.

{"title": "How to Stop Crying - here's your plan.", "selftext": "TL;DR I'm not doing one. I'm typing all this bullshit to help you. You don't want to read it, don't. Go YOLO your shit into Luckin Coffee, you magnificent retard. I love you.\n\nAnd don't fucking whine about how this is too long. No one cares and I'm tired of this sub being r/whining.\n\nAlright. \n\nThe market is ruining your life. You don't know if we're at bottom or not. But the market is sure you're a bottom and it's coming back to fuck you like a prison inmate again.\n\nRetail investors are plowing money into the market like it's a dime store hooker. Hedge funds are selling off to take their money. Then the stock prices drop, people panic sell. Hedge funds buy all those cheap ass stocks you sold.\n\nSo stop that shit. You're making us look bad. \n\nI mean fuck. You're get raped two ways and then come back for more? Smarten up.\n\nI know. I know. You want tendies. \n\nLife is hard. You want to stop falling asleep on your couch while the headboard of your bed bangs the wall while your wife's boyfriend puts his no no in her yes yes.\n\nShut up. Quit crying. Grab some tissues. Listen up.\n\n1. If you have money in the market that you can't live without, take it out. \n\nThis is some basic bitch shit. A volatile market is not the place to invest your rent money. \n\nNo, I don't want you to be responsible. And I don't give a fuck if you're homeless. I want you to not make dumb, emotional, irrational decisions. That's how we all get out of this mess.\n\nIf you already fucked this part up, you can shut up and hold for years. Or you can shut up, sell at a massive loss and give up.\n\nIf you're leveraged, quit that shit. Paying 8% interest for money that loses 20% is a bad bet. Stop paying brokers and banks to fuck you.\n\n2) Hedge money.\n\n\"But but but what the fuck is that? Is it like shrubbing?\"\n\nIt's cash you keep as cash that you want to invest later or, if you're more into risk, dump some cash into Inverse Etfs (look them up). \n\nBasically, when the market goes down, they go up. If you use them right, you get to keep your stocks and not take a loss or even make a profit on the ETFs (the jury is still out on if gold is a good hedge or not).\n\n\"But but but hedging? But but but inflation. I'll lose money if it sits there.\"\n\nShut up. Inflation is going away. If you invest right you'll make more than inflation will fuck you. And stop buying dumb shit while inflation is high. Don't fuck yourself. You're already getting fucked.\n\n\"Now listen here, dinkface. I don't want to hedge. I want to buy the dip. I'm a big bull. My friends and I show each other our big bull balls and swing our dicks at each other to show that we aren't gay bears.\"\n\nShut up. If you want to brag about what kind of animal you are, go to a fucking furry convention. We're here to make money. Money is like your mom. It doesn't care about how big your balls are and it gets me hookers so I can have threesomes with it.\n\nAnd, shut up, you're still going to buy the dip. But you're going to buy the dip like a man.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nYou buy A LITTLE BIT of stocks on the way down (dollar cost averaging, look it up). Buy a LITTLE BIT more every time they have a big dip.\n\n\"But but but I don't want to buy a little. I'm a big boy. I buy stocks big. And what if I miss profits? We're already at the bottom.\"\n\nShut up. You're going to make a fuck ton less if you assume we're at the bottom, spend all your cash and then can't buy stocks when they're even cheaper. Anyone who says they know where the bottom is at is a liar or an idiot. I called it wrong once. I'll probably do it again.\n\nIf shit turns around (and wait till that is 100% confirmed, retard), the market isn't going up 800% in a day. You can buy more on the way up and still make money as stocks recover.\n\n\"But but but what is a little bit of buying, daddy?\"\n\nQuit the daddy shit. It's cool when your mom says it to me. It's creepy when you say it.\n\nHere's a basic rule that will keep you from shitting yourself as you watch your portfolio bleed like it's got a perpetual period.\n\n(And it's a basic fucking rule. I don't think this shit is going to happen so don't chirp about it.)\n\nWhatever you're investing amount is overall, assume you'll lose 50% of that. If that makes your ass pucker, use less money. \n\nBecause that's your total budget. Spend it wisely. Spend it in small amounts.\n\nLots of idiots plowed all their money back into the market in 2000, 2008 when we were nowhere near bottom. Then they sold at bottom. They hate themselves now. Every minute of every day. Some of them are dead. They died with regret.\n\nDon't be an idiot. Yeah, buying something when it's 20% down feels good. You know what feels better? Buying three times as much of that shit when it's 60% down.\n\n3) Pick your stocks in companies that you will be able to hold for 5 years. Maybe you won't have to hold them that long. Maybe you'll have to hold longer. It's a general rule to give you some direction.\n\nThe point is if you buy shit that you have to sell before it recovers, you lose. That's not how buying a dip works. You have to buy it and hold it.\n\n\"But but but what do I pick?\"\n\nShut up and choose from these options:\n\nA) Companies that have actual value. If you're smart, look up their p/e p/b ratios. General rule, you want something under 25 p/e and 3 p/b. That's a general rule. Some asshole or kind human will probably give a better benchmark in the comments of this post.\n\nYou also want a company that isn't carrying a fuckton of debt. Even when the stock market recovers, things are going to get bad in the economy. If companies go bankrupt you'll be wiping your ass with their stocks.\n\nIf you're dumb and don't want to learn simple facts like p/e p/b, just pick big ass companies that don't get destroyed when the economy sucks. \n\nIf you want tech, go with Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. Not some fucking IPO you heard about from a guy on the bus who probably touches girls while they're sleeping.\n\nB) Buy companies that pay dividends (Google it, I'm not listing them). They'll pay you money even if the stock shits the bed. You may not make money but you'll lose less until things recover.\n\nC) We're going into a recession. I'm not going to explain it. If you think I'm wrong you're the stupidest of the stupid. You should take your money out of the market, buy a gun and shoot your foot off to remind you to be smarter and read basic economic data.\n\nWhen people realize we're going into a big recession, they will freak out and probably sell a lot of stocks. Don't do that. Plan for it. Plan to buy or plan to hold. Earliest it will hit is probably summer but people will probably start to lose their shit when Q1 earnings start coming in and they suck donkey cock.\n\nIn a recession (especially after this wallet raping inflation) people have less money to spend on things they want because they have to spend money on things they need. So don't invest in companies that sell expensive shit that people don't need.\n\nThink on what people buy when they're broke. They buy shit at Dollar Tree and Costco (DLTR COST) They buy food at grocery stores (look up the tickers yourself - not high end grocery stores). They buy fast food instead of eating dinner out (MCD). They buy coke products (I mean the drink - KO). They watch shit on tv (pick a streamer). They still buy alcohol and cigarettes (look them up, I don't buy that shit because I'm ethical as fuck and don't invest in it). Consumer staples like toilet paper and toothpaste (PG JNG). And people still get sick and have to see doctors (UHG).\n\nBuy companies that do well in a recession. \n\nBanks do well in recessions. Banks do well when interest rates are going up (which they are in a big way). Both are happening.\n\nJust know that China's economy is fucked and Russia's economy just got nuked which affected banks all over the world. You might want to see how that global shit works out before you invest in them. Wells Fargo has increased 30% short interest right now (only 1% but still a spike). That's for a reason.\n\n\"But but but my dad buys that stable big value company stocks. I want to buy cool stocks like laser guided robotic cat dildos because I'm awesome. I'm smart, edgy and cool.\"\n\nShut up. You're not. And I'll still let you buy those stocks. Just buy less of those and buy the good ones that have actual revenue on the horizon. Research. Like your dad, it's not hard (which is why your mom left him for me).\n\nIf you're really fucking smart, you buy a little with the plan to hold. Then, if a bunch or retards pump up a stock 30% based on nothing, sell that shit, wait for it to tank and rebuy.\n\n\"But but but HODL! BUY ALL THE DIPS!!!\"\n\nOk. That's fine by me. You're the reason I've made fat cash off of UPST, PLTR, gold and silver (and then rebought them). You're why I made a shitton off of meme stocks last year. Thanks for that.\n\n\"But but but what about other investments that I can't talk about here because of this sub's rules?\"\n\nI'll be honest, I don't know how that stuff is going to shake out. I am sure that if you invest in a volatile asset and think it's a hedge you're so stupid it hurts your ancestors.\n\nYeah, it might be a hedge. But no one has proven that. Investment patterns don't support that idea being true. When the NASDAQ is down 20% it isn't a good time to experiment with a new hedge. Don't be the guy who base jumps with a parachute that didn't come with instructions.\n\nAlright. That's it. Now shut up and get back out there. No more whining.\n\n*THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE.

That \\*easy\\* signal will tell people whether they should hedge or not. Just looking at the angle of the trend is easy for those of us who've done chart time, but to beginners the difference between a pullback and a run in either direction can be really confusing... hell, I'm good at it and sometimes my own bias overtakes my rationality.\n\nThe good news is this can easily be accomplished with 5 moving averages:  \n\n\nThe SMMA (smoothed moving average) 20, 50, 100, and 200 and the EMA (exponential moving average) 50... all on the S&P and NASDAQ yearly chart. (SPY and QQQ work, too... same chart basically.)  \n\n\nPertinent beginner rule: ALWAYS TRADE WITH THE MARKET, unless your stock is decoupled from the market or moves against the market. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPut all SMMAs on one chart. \n\nIn a bull market: All 4 will be in order 20, 50, 100, 200 with the average spreading out over time. That indicates strong upward index movement, which is positive pressure for indexed stocks. \n\nIn a bear market: The 4 tighten, then flip. In the worst stock trend, these are upside down. When the market starts to recover, these will start to get closer and begin crossing until they straighten out. Until they straighten out, the market is not in a solid, confirmed bull run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEMA 50 is critical: The market bounces off of this until the trend changes. If it's under the EMA 50, this means market weakness.\n\nLots of people got confused when the S&P dipped afterhours today. The answer was that it rejected off the EMA 50, meaning we're still in a bearish trend even though we left the January down channel.\n\nWill it continue to dip? Unless you run a massive hedge fund, you don't know. Hell if you do, you probably still don't know for sure. LOL\n\nBut until it gets above these moving averages, it's an indication that the market will trade down and that buying is risky. It's also a clear hedge signal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the stock you want to buy trades with the S&P and the S&P yearly chart is below the EMA 50 and the SMMAs are inverting like right now, the market is working against you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce people get this down, they can move on to support/resistance and setting entry/exit targets. But the first thing is to understand which side of the trend the market is on because otherwise it will fake you out and fuck you up.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost people start on the wrong side of chart TA and go for chart patterns, Elliott Waves, Fib and channel analysis, etc, because they want to predict the future. The chart tells you the past, not the future, but the past can tell you important things about how people are trading in the short term.\n\nBeginners should ignore people on the Internet who draw like 50 year trendlines or Fib sequences and then just call tops/bottoms... sometimes they get lucky and get it right.

Since you are referring to this in the context of WSB, I'm going to assume you are talking about the current popular insults - retarded, saying your wife has a boyfriend, saying you suck dick at Wendy's, calling yourself a crayon eater, and ape, etc. It is true that WSB has always has insults, but so did the entire internet.

I also take those stories with a little grain of salt as I do with any other unsubstantiated claim made on reddit that will boost karma. Who knows if those are lies or not?

Whether it's someone rich af showing off or a retard who just changed his life in a really bad way, fuck it.
