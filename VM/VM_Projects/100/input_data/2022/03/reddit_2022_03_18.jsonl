At the same time, more near-the-money options are maturing than at any time since 2019 -- suggesting a bevy of investors will actively trade around those positions.\n\nAnd once [again](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/triple-witching-to-hit-market-where-traders-pay-up-for-hedges), this triple witching coincides with a rebalancing of benchmark indexes including the S&P 500 -- a combination that tends to spark single-day volumes that rank among the highest of the year. According to an estimate from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, the rebalance in the index alone could spur $33 billion of stock trades.\n\nFriday‚Äôs session lands just as the S&P 500 regains its [footing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/stocks-aided-by-upbeat-powell-bonds-flash-caution-markets-wrap) with a three-day jump, buoyed by the Federal Reserve‚Äôs optimism the economy can withstand rate hikes and China‚Äôs promise to bolster its financial markets. Yet in the telling of derivatives pros, the rally has been fueled by dealers covering short positions to balance exposures while demand for stock hedges is elevated.\n\nNow as many contracts expire, the key question is whether investors will rebuild their holdings of protective puts amid growth concerns and the war in Ukraine -- or will they chase the market rebound with call contracts.¬†\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen an environment where you‚Äôve had so many potential overhangs in the market that can not be controlled,‚Äù said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see if people can see to redeploy their puts.‚Äù", "id": "tgpmq2", "created_utc": 1647566286.0, "score": 1286, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 246, "comments": [{"body": "I've seen this sub bring up Triple/Quad witching day so many times and it's rare that anything significant ever happens.

They will be broken into a few different businesses that you will receive stock to, since you owned the original asset. \n\nOf course, I dont really see that being a requirement. If the companies are intelligent about it, they can spin off each company with an IPO. Use that large influx of cash to continue investing in future companies, rinse and repeat. That is the path I see for the mega caps to technically 10x, but the underlying market cap will have to be kept in check.

I‚Äôm a drip or Americano kind of guy but Bros sweet drinks are probably where they hit it out of the park according to most folks and are usually about 50 cents to a dollar cheaper than SBux.  I‚Äôve heard people say the Bros drive up model won‚Äôt work in larger walking cities.  But a town near me (Corvallis, OR) has a couple walk up only stores so they have a template for a non-car based business even though the majority of their model is based around the drive up.  The walk in store also does drip coffee which I actually really enjoyed, typically when you order coffee from their drive through it is Americano with no drip option.

There are multiple brokerages you can make an account with online, so, no you don't have to go to a bank to open an account. Several options are TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, E\\*Trade, RobinHood, WeBull (those last two are more for options trading though, which is a risky trading type that you really don't want to get involved with unless you really build up your education on it. Even then, you could lose potentially all of your money). You just go to any of their websites (or apps) and apply to start an account.\n2. You can lose money with any investment you make. Going back to what I said above, stock options trading is the most riskiest investment you can get involved with, so I would stay far away from that as a new person to investing. As a beginner, you should really start with just buying and holding stocks. That's the least riskiest because even if it loses value you only lose that money if you sell at a loss. You should really only trade what you can afford to lose, overall.\n3. It depends on how much you invest. Pretty much you can only make several thousand if a) you are investing thousands already into the stock(s) you buy, and b) if you hold it for long term (like years) and your stock(s) appreciate in value a great deal in that timeframe. Or, which is highly unlikely and I would not at all suggest you have this mindset, you get randomly lucky and the stock(s) you invest in shoot up suddenly.\n4. Again, it depends on what kind of trading you want to do. If you are just looking to buy and hold stocks (or even better, ETFs), no, you don't need to monitor it too often. If you've invested into solid stocks or ETFs, you can just let them appreciate in value naturally over the years. If you want to be aggressive and frequently buy and sell shares (which is extremely risky) then yes, you would have to monitor it frequently. But as a beginner, I do not at all recommend this (it's called day trading and it's really risky). I would make changes to investments only if you are losing value in whatever you have invested in and it doesn't look likely to gain value in the time frame you wanted to sell it in, if you wanted to sell it at all. If you're not looking to sell, then I would just keep your stocks/ETFs and let them appreciate over time since, over the long hall, the market tends to go up.\n5. For a beginner, I would definitely first do as much research and education as possible on stock-buying and do what you're doing now (which is to ask questions). When you feel you have the knowledge you need and you make an account, I would first start looking at buying ETFs (ETFs basically give you small amounts of shares in major, low-risk companies). They will cover pretty safe stocks like AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT. We've been in an extremely volatile market the past couple of years and so the prices you see for each stock may not be what you would typically see.

{"title": "St. Louis Fed‚Äôs Bullard says the central bank should raise rates above 3% this year", "selftext": "St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday he thinks the central bank should raise interest rates the equivalent of 12 times this year to convince the public it is serious about fighting inflation. As the lone dissenter at this week‚Äôs Federal Reserve meeting, Bullard said in a statement that he would like to see the central bank‚Äôs benchmark interest rate boosted above 3% from the near-0% level where it had stood. ‚ÄúThis would quickly adjust the policy rate to a more appropriate level for the current circumstances,‚Äù he said. Following its two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday said it would raise overnight rates for banks by 0.25 percentage point, historically the typical increment with which the FOMC moves. Accompanying economic projections indicated a path this year that would see the equivalent of seven rate hikes, or 1.75 percentage points. The move was the first time the Fed has raised the rate since December 2018 and came in response to a stunning increase in inflation that has seen prices rise at their fastest pace in 40 years.\n\nBullard was the only FOMC member to vote against the move, stating he would have preferred a rate hike of 0.5 percentage point, or 50 basis points. He added the Fed also should have started the process of reducing the nearly $9 trillion in bond holdings it has accumulated over the past 14 years. In his statement Friday, Bullard said inflation is hurting people the Fed is trying to help the most, namely those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. ‚ÄúThe burden of excessive inflation is particularly heavy for people with modest incomes and wealth and for those with limited ability to adjust to a rising cost of living,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe combination of strong real economic performance and unexpectedly high inflation means that the Committee‚Äôs policy rate is currently far too low to prudently manage the U.S. macroeconomic situation.‚Äù\n\nFed officials overall were divided on how to proceed with rates this year. Ten members penciled in a fed funds rate of 1.75%-2% by year‚Äôs end, but eight said it should be higher. The highest ‚Äúdot‚Äù on the committee‚Äôs dot plot, presumably Bullard‚Äôs, indicated a range of 3%-3.25%. He pointed out that the Fed has moved that aggressively before, in 1994-95 to combat a revving economy and a gradual rise in inflation. ‚ÄúThe results were excellent,‚Äù Bullard said. ‚ÄúThe Committee achieved 2% inflation on average and the U.S. economy boomed during the second half of the 1990s. I think the Committee should try to achieve a similar outcome in the current environment.‚Äù On the issue of the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet, Bullard did not provide details of what he thinks the central bank should do, saying only that ‚Äúa plan‚Äù at this week‚Äôs meeting would have been appropriate. The post-meeting statement indicated that the committee ‚Äúexpects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting.‚Äù Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said afterward that the process could begin as soon as May.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/18/st-louis-feds-bullard-says-the-central-bank-should-raise-rates-above-3percent-this-year.html", "id": "th1bvr", "created_utc": 1647610113.0, "score": 405, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 226, "comments": [{"body": "Imagine clocking into work where 90% of your coworkers disagree with you every day.", "score": 281, "replies": [{"body": "Don't need to.", "score": 124, "replies": []}, {"body": "Imagine being the 10% who cares about doing their jobs correctly.", "score": 128, "replies": [{"body": "It is so weird to me that this has become the prevailing view on this sub.

And stop buying dumb shit while inflation is high. Don't fuck yourself. You're already getting fucked.\n\n\"Now listen here, dinkface. I don't want to hedge. I want to buy the dip. I'm a big bull. My friends and I show each other our big bull balls and swing our dicks at each other to show that we aren't gay bears.\"\n\nShut up. If you want to brag about what kind of animal you are, go to a fucking furry convention. We're here to make money. Money is like your mom. It doesn't care about how big your balls are and it gets me hookers so I can have threesomes with it.\n\nAnd, shut up, you're still going to buy the dip. But you're going to buy the dip like a man.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nYou buy A LITTLE BIT of stocks on the way down (dollar cost averaging, look it up). Buy a LITTLE BIT more every time they have a big dip.\n\n\"But but but I don't want to buy a little. I'm a big boy. I buy stocks big. And what if I miss profits? We're already at the bottom.\"\n\nShut up. You're going to make a fuck ton less if you assume we're at the bottom, spend all your cash and then can't buy stocks when they're even cheaper. Anyone who says they know where the bottom is at is a liar or an idiot. I called it wrong once. I'll probably do it again.\n\nIf shit turns around (and wait till that is 100% confirmed, retard), the market isn't going up 800% in a day. You can buy more on the way up and still make money as stocks recover.\n\n\"But but but what is a little bit of buying, daddy?\"\n\nQuit the daddy shit. It's cool when your mom says it to me. It's creepy when you say it.\n\nHere's a basic rule that will keep you from shitting yourself as you watch your portfolio bleed like it's got a perpetual period.\n\n(And it's a basic fucking rule. I don't think this shit is going to happen so don't chirp about it.)\n\nWhatever you're investing amount is overall, assume you'll lose 50% of that. If that makes your ass pucker, use less money.¬†\n\nBecause that's your total budget. Spend it wisely. Spend it in small amounts.\n\nLots of idiots plowed all their money back into the market in 2000, 2008 when we were nowhere near bottom. Then they sold at bottom.¬†They hate themselves now. Every minute of every day. Some of them are dead. They died with regret.\n\nDon't be an idiot. Yeah, buying something when it's 20% down feels good. You know what feels better? Buying three times as much of that shit when it's 60% down.\n\n3) Pick your stocks in companies that you will be able to hold for 5 years. Maybe you won't have to hold them that long. Maybe you'll have to hold longer. It's a general rule to give you some direction.\n\nThe point is if you buy shit that you have to sell before it recovers, you lose. That's not how buying a dip works. You have to buy it and hold it.\n\n\"But but but what do I pick?\"\n\nShut up and choose from these options:\n\nA) Companies that have actual value. If you're smart, look up their p/e p/b ratios. General rule, you want something under 25 p/e and 3 p/b. That's a general rule. Some asshole or kind human will probably give a better benchmark in the comments of this post.\n\nYou also want a company that isn't carrying a fuckton of debt. Even when the stock market recovers, things are going to get bad in the economy. If companies go bankrupt you'll be wiping your ass with their stocks.\n\nIf you're dumb and don't want to learn simple facts like p/e p/b, just pick big ass companies that don't get destroyed when the economy sucks.¬†\n\nIf you want tech, go with Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. Not some fucking IPO you heard about from a guy on the bus who probably touches girls while they're sleeping.\n\nB) Buy companies that pay dividends (Google it, I'm not listing them). They'll pay you money even if the stock shits the bed. You may not make money but you'll lose less until things recover.\n\nC) We're going into a recession. I'm not going to explain it. If you think I'm wrong you're the stupidest of the stupid. You should take your money out of the market, buy a gun and shoot your foot off to remind you to be smarter and read basic economic data.\n\nWhen people realize we're going into a big recession, they will freak out and probably sell a lot of stocks. Don't do that. Plan for it. Plan to buy or plan to hold. Earliest it will hit is probably summer but people will probably start to lose their shit when Q1 earnings start coming in and they suck donkey cock.\n\nIn a recession (especially after this wallet raping inflation) people have less money to spend on things they want because they have to spend money on things they need. So don't invest in companies that sell expensive shit that people don't need.\n\nThink on what people buy when they're broke. They buy shit at Dollar Tree and Costco (DLTR COST) They buy food at grocery stores (look up the tickers yourself - not high end grocery stores). They buy fast food instead of eating dinner out (MCD). They buy coke products (I mean the drink - KO). They watch shit on tv (pick a streamer). They still buy alcohol and cigarettes (look them up, I don't buy that shit because I'm ethical as fuck and don't invest in it). Consumer staples like toilet paper and toothpaste (PG JNG). And people still get sick and have to see doctors (UHG).\n\nBuy companies that do well in a recession.¬†\n\nBanks do well in recessions. Banks do well when interest rates are going up (which they are in a big way). Both are happening.\n\nJust know that China's economy is fucked and Russia's economy just got nuked which affected banks all over the world. You might want to see how that global shit works out before you invest in them. Wells Fargo has increased 30% short interest right now (only 1% but still a spike). That's for a reason.\n\n\"But but but my dad buys that stable big value company stocks. I want to buy cool stocks like laser guided robotic cat dildos because I'm awesome. I'm smart, edgy and cool.\"\n\nShut up. You're not. And I'll still let you buy those stocks. Just buy less of those and buy the good ones that have actual revenue on the horizon. Research. Like your dad, it's not hard (which is why your mom left him for me).\n\nIf you're really fucking smart, you buy a little with the plan to hold. Then, if a bunch or retards pump up a stock 30% based on nothing, sell that shit, wait for it to tank and rebuy.\n\n\"But but but HODL! BUY ALL THE DIPS!!!\"\n\nOk. That's fine by me. You're the reason I've made fat cash off of UPST, PLTR, gold and silver (and then rebought them). You're why I made a shitton off of meme stocks last year. Thanks for that.\n\n\"But but but what about other investments that I can't talk about here because of this sub's rules?\"\n\nI'll be honest, I don't know how that stuff is going to shake out. I am sure that if you invest in a volatile asset and think it's a hedge you're so stupid it hurts your ancestors.\n\nYeah, it might be a hedge. But no one has proven that. Investment patterns don't support that idea being true. When the NASDAQ is down 20% it isn't a good time to experiment with a new hedge. Don't be the guy who base jumps with a parachute that didn't come with instructions.\n\nAlright. That's it. Now shut up and get back out there. No more whining.\n\n*THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE.

That \\*easy\\* signal will tell people whether they should hedge or not. Just looking at the angle of the trend is easy for those of us who've done chart time, but to beginners the difference between a pullback and a run in either direction can be really confusing... hell, I'm good at it and sometimes my own bias overtakes my rationality.\n\nThe good news is this can easily be accomplished with 5 moving averages:  \n\n\nThe SMMA (smoothed moving average) 20, 50, 100, and 200 and the EMA (exponential moving average) 50... all on the S&P and NASDAQ yearly chart. (SPY and QQQ work, too... same chart basically.)  \n\n\nPertinent beginner rule: ALWAYS TRADE WITH THE MARKET, unless your stock is decoupled from the market or moves against the market. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPut all SMMAs on one chart. \n\nIn a bull market: All 4 will be in order 20, 50, 100, 200 with the average spreading out over time. That indicates strong upward index movement, which is positive pressure for indexed stocks. \n\nIn a bear market: The 4 tighten, then flip. In the worst stock trend, these are upside down. When the market starts to recover, these will start to get closer and begin crossing until they straighten out. Until they straighten out, the market is not in a solid, confirmed bull run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEMA 50 is critical: The market bounces off of this until the trend changes. If it's under the EMA 50, this means market weakness.\n\nLots of people got confused when the S&P dipped afterhours today. The answer was that it rejected off the EMA 50, meaning we're still in a bearish trend even though we left the January down channel.\n\nWill it continue to dip? Unless you run a massive hedge fund, you don't know. Hell if you do, you probably still don't know for sure. LOL\n\nBut until it gets above these moving averages, it's an indication that the market will trade down and that buying is risky. It's also a clear hedge signal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the stock you want to buy trades with the S&P and the S&P yearly chart is below the EMA 50 and the SMMAs are inverting like right now, the market is working against you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce people get this down, they can move on to support/resistance and setting entry/exit targets. But the first thing is to understand which side of the trend the market is on because otherwise it will fake you out and fuck you up.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost people start on the wrong side of chart TA and go for chart patterns, Elliott Waves, Fib and channel analysis, etc, because they want to predict the future. The chart tells you the past, not the future, but the past can tell you important things about how people are trading in the short term.\n\nBeginners should ignore people on the Internet who draw like 50 year trendlines or Fib sequences and then just call tops/bottoms... sometimes they get lucky and get it right. Sometimes they pick up on patterns. If you don't know how these work, you have no way of knowing who might be working off of good information and who's just drawing shit on a chart.\n\nPart of this is ALWAYS having a plan when the market moves in either direction. Know when to sell to stop loss, and know when you plan to collect profits, and know what to do if it falls short.\n\nWhen I started doing these things and checking them before entering a trade, I stopped making 90% of my bad trades.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "I'm upvoting the shit out of this.\n\nBasic chart analysis is a huge edge that people ignore because they're dumb.\n\nDon't forget that magical MACD/RSI combo and volume profile.\n\nThat shit will change your game real quick in a hurry.\n\nS&P shit itself after-hours for the same reason rhe NASDAQ did.

I've become a muscular beast of a guy, if I do say so myself, so indirectly Lemonade did do its job to beef me up at least, less so financially though\n\nAlright, so I'm a Dutch retard that invests only in US growth stocks and one stupid ass Chinese one (Nio) to make up for selling my virgin 15k USD 100% Tesla portfolio in 338 pre-split and missing out on HUGE gains, which was my first love with feeling the joy and agony of this volatile as fuck market you guys have in the beautiful US.\n\nSo, now.. a few years later.. I've been pooring (shut up Grammarly, I've typed it correctly) in big chunks of my salary every month, since I don't really have much of a life, so don't know what else to do with them sweet moneys and would love to buy a BMW M5 competition or something fancy in 10 years time with the money I threw in, when I hit 40 or so to fend off a mid-life crisis and have some fun while we're at it.\n\nMy apologies kind sir, back to the point that is. I got (950 shares) 23.6k USD in Lemonade now, which is just over 38% of my portfolio, with an average price of 61.9312 USD it appears, so a current loss of over 35k damn it all. The rest is in PLTR, AFRM, HOOD, NIO (these 4 are also a little to somewhat fucked, but LMND is the biggest issue and first one that needs some love) and a few small positions.\n\nSo, basically.. the only thing I want is to just get to a point in which I can just feel **good** about my 'investments' and feel like a damn winner for once. I make about 3k USD a month, Europoors am I right? and can throw in around 1500 USD a month to tidy up this mess of a portfolio and one day come ahead victorious. Show me your way daddy. I might also want to move my stocks to IBKR.. so I can 'hedge' or make use of selling calls when IV is high or buying puts to average down less retardedly.. my stupid ass broker doesn't allow anything, but margin with a 4% fee on a select few stocks. But that probably saved me from just losing it all on short dated calls I'm sure, so there's that I guess. I'm a tiny little bit smarter and more patient now though, at least that's what I hope for after all these rollercoaster rides.\n\nEdit: also, damn fucking nice that you own some of that sweet sour LMND too, they're doing some good business in the Netherlands as well, that's for sure!", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "This guy must have heard the GME earnings conference today‚Ä¶", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Is that the retard refining company?\n\nThey actually earn something?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Is that you Michael?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I go by Cassandra.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Definitely scrolled through this fever dream", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Couldn't even make it past four lines to get your instructions.\n\nKids these days.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If I could read I'd probably like this novel.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "A novel length rant telling us to be clairvoyant about the markets next move.

It seemed like a combo of people with so much money they could lose more than I'd ever seen myself then flaunt it mixed with some poor bastards who seemed suckered into losing money they really couldn't by the whales and the rest of this sub. Now that I've been playing the market myself and been on this sub for awhile, I understand it a little better. If some multimillionaire wants to lose $300k for shits and giggles, I hope they're also engaging in some philanthropy too, but at the end of the day, fuck it. It's their money, they can do what they want and I certainly can't control that, nor would I want the government \"protecting\" them from incurring that loss. Same thing goes for shit like the kid who just lost $200k of his grandma's money or the guy who lost his kid's college fund. I also take those stories with a little grain of salt as I do with any other unsubstantiated claim made on reddit that will boost karma. Who knows if those are lies or not? That 19 year old could actually be a self-made billionaire just farming karma and the college fund dad could just be a rich single guy posting losses from his gambling account with a made up story that's way more interesting.\n\nYou can't get mad or jealous about people who have way more money than you pissing a lot of it away gambling on the market. That's kinda what this sub is about, along with some gambles working out for huge gains. I do agree though that positions should be posted. Not only do I want to know the details behind the incredible loss, but it provides a little more legitimacy because any idiot can photo shop a Robinhood port deeper in the red than Ron Jeremy fucking some deep-vagina'd porn vet on her period.\n\nIn the end, though, I'd rather see loss porn that would make me have a heart attack and die if it was my own as opposed to someone who lost like $7k (also a crazy loss for me, but not something that blows my mind. Whether it's someone rich af showing off or a retard who just changed his life in a really bad way, fuck it. As long as it's their own money, whether earned or gifted, and they are an adult, then I don't fucking care. That's what loss porn here is supposed to be.
