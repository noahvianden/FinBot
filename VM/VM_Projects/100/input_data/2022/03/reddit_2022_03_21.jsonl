Yes higher than desired concentration in single stock but still overall portfolio is diversified with ETFs, MFs and oh, did I mention healthy % allocated to few d*egen strategy* as well (r/HFEA and versions of it, Crypto etc). My cost basis is around $150 so definitely don't want to get called away given tax implications. But comfortable with 0.1 - 0.3 delta and it appears 30-45 DTE seems preferred duration although I have to read up more on few great suggestions on weeklies, 0.35 delta. Last year, I used to follow the .1 delta 30 DTE strategy but with the up only market conditions it didn’t work out well where after several 'roll up and out', was staring at $70K current value hit on the upside gains. However this year I switched to more active management with 0.3 delta, 2-3 months out for healthy premium, sell on big green days, buy back at 20% profit and wait to sell more until next big green candle. I pretty much recovered all my 'losses' from last year and now back in black in this strategy which I track very closely in a spreadsheet. This active management this year has been super profitable but of course the IV has been super high with Powell/Putin contributing to good bit of vol. So I still see my approach thus far and luck as function of current market conditions and not tenable.

The trick is that you want to sell only 33% of the contracts available to you at first, so if you have 1900 shares, sell and roll only 6. This should get you around $1080 per week. When you roll, you will attempt to keep at the 0.35 delta range, if you were itm and you can't do it without coming out of pocket, then increase the number of contracts until you are flat....but if you can roll for credit, reduce until you are back to 33% of available. If you are reaching maximum contracts, attempt to skip a week or up to 4 weeks as far up as you can with as little amount of contracts as you can so that nothing comes out of pocket.\n\n    If the stock has an ex-div date the next day, always make sure you are at least $1.20 otm by half an hour before market closes (the higher the better, your choice)...if not, roll to the following week early as described above for rolling procedures\n\n    If you set a price alert at your strike price, you can roll early up and out for credit usually without having to increase contract size....keep ahead of the game as much as possible. If you roll early, try to go as far up as you can, you shouldn't worry about the credits, this is a corrective action as you gained value on the stock rising.\n\n    If you previously rolled early and stock falls, you can attempt to move the contracts closer in time and down to burn it quicker (try not to go past 0.35 delta). If it's a previously early roll, it is 7DTE, AND you have 33% contract size, you can roll it down to the 0.35 delta to collect any lost premium to adjustments.\n\nThe money you collect on premium can be used to:\n\n    Buy more shares directly to increase your portfolio\n\n    Buy \"forwards\" as I have described many times in these forums (it is a calendar spread to load value and protect against runs). If you build up enough of these, then you could effectively just roll these instead and leave stock completely alone.\n\n    Keep it to the side to help pay to move any positions out instead of increasing contract sizes, giving you more of a \"buffer\" (if you buy shares as #1 suggests, you can actually sell them back to do the same effect, so combining this with #1)\n\n    Build up enough cash to purchase a 600+DTE Put contract to protect the portfolio, it will cost quite a bit upfront, but at 365 DTE, you roll it to another 600+DTE for a minimal carry price. Should be about 4k to set up, but then it's only 1k per year after that per contract.\n\n    Take your wife or husband out for a nice meal.\n\nIf you didn't care about losing the shares, I would say go with 100% 0.35 delta rolls buying forwards with the premium until you are at double rolling....then reduce the longs with premiums until they're loaded up with high value (0.80+ delta), collapse them at the end of the year and let the whole thing cool off for 31 days to clear any wash sales, maybe buy some Christmas presents, start up again middle of January.

For example, with MSFT, if I were able to sell 6 of the 4apr305C for 0.90 each, that's $540. If instead I sold 7 of those and purchased 1 of the 22apr305C, I would be able to get $70, but I get an extra contract roll for 3 rolls. The idea is less to do with the money and more to do with protecting, if the stock were to climb above 305 and you can't roll \"up and out\" for enough credit, you can sell the long position completely for the profit to help pay for the others. If you were to do all 19 contracts, you could do 20 and have a forward out to October for credit....if you did this every week for 19 weeks (depending if stock moved), you would end up with 19 contract rolls in excess (allowing you to scale back your short position if you wanted)\n\n    I priced at 0.45 delta (atm skewed with msft), since your cost basis is 150, you don't actually have to protect that much if you don't want to, but the carry cost (yearly maintenance) will be minimal difference down to about 0.25 delta, so unless you want to specifically save on the setup fee, might as well stick with atm.\n\n    As above states, if you were to go all-in with forwards, you can pretty much double up your position by week 19, possibly sooner (since more rolls means more money faster and since you don't want to go past November, it'll be more like 9 or 10 weeks). Then you'll have 38 rolls making about $3800 per week until October/November. When November hits, you'll want to close all of your positions down (not stock) and don't touch it for at least 31 days, for tax purposes....you will still have to pay taxes on the gains, so if you need to take some money, now is the time to clean up your stuff (refill emergency funds, tax accounts, adjust small positions, pay yourself, breathe, take a vacation).", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Hi.

I'll delete this comment if the post is reinstated, but just in case it doesn't, figured I'd post it here.\n\nDisclaimer: I currently own some $CEI and have been selling some calls on it, and have been debating on expanding my investment. I personally have faith in the company outside of just using it to generate income with CCs.\r  \n\r  \nI was very surprised to see find that $CEI has weekly options, especially given it's current share price ($0.93). This stock has seen some volatility, and I assume that is what is largely contributing to high option prices relative to it's share price. So this post is a sort of a \"what if\" scenario regarding selling covered calls on this stock.\r  \n\r  \nAs of right now, let's say you buy 100 shares for $93. As of the time of this writing, a 10 DTE weekly call for $1 can net you $0.14 ($14 for the full contract, minus fees). That's a 15% return for a 10 DTE call. If the stock rises above $1 by expiration, that's a net gain of 22.5% once the shares are sold for $1 (obviously losing any potential gains if the stock really spikes).\r  \n\r  \nSo what if we scale this to.. 5000 shares? And, since prices fluctuate, let's assume you sold 10 DTE calls for $0.10. $500 net gain on a $4650 initial investment. If things stay steady and you do this 3x in a month, that's $1500. nearly a 30% return in just 1 month. And the call volume is plenty healthy so that shouldn't be an issue. Since we are working with volume, and fees/commissions are per contract, I'd be losing approximately 7% of the income in fees + commissions. That still brings a 20-23% return per month.\r  \n\r  \nOkay, so this sounds too good to be true. I understand a few things:\r  \n\r  \nI understand you are taking a risk on the stock plunging. In this scenario, as long as the calls stay healthy for at least 2-3 weeks, this will help make up for some price drops. Or if it holds through 6-9 weeks, depending on call prices, you will recoup your entire initial investment.\r  \n\r  \nI understand if the stock for any reason soars, you would miss out on the additional gains, but that's not nearly as bad as losing principal. You'd still come out on top, even moreso the longer this strategy holds on.\r  \n\r  \nIf the stock trends upwards, but you manage to not have your shares called away, you can always adjust the strategy accordingly - increasing strike price, etc.\r  \n\r  \nThis strategy obviously will not last forever, but I'm wondering if it's worth trying to capitalize on it in the moment.\r  \n\r  \nOkay, so outside of potentially missing out on additional gains if the stock soars, or end up in the hole a decent chunk if the stock price falls hard, is there anything else I'm missing?

In general, you should avoid having contracts with overlapping strikes on the same expiration date, as this confuses most brokers into thinking you legged into a spread.\n\nIt's useful to evaluate any strategy by comparing it against simpler strategies that achieve the same profit/loss. For example, why not just sell the put and not buy any puts? That improves the upside by removing the cost of the long puts. It has more downside risk, but if that is a problem, a single long put to make a single vertical spread would make more sense.\n\nAlso, it's generally not a great idea to sell contracts that are ITM at open, particularly so close to expiration.

If you are betting on the stock going up, every long put is a dead loss. You aren't \"financing the long puts\", you are instead dragging down the potential profit of the short put with all those longs.\n\n> In case i have significant drop - 4 long puts >>>>> 1 short put\n\nAnd just one long put >>>>>> 4 long puts >>>>> 1 short put. So what? There is no combination of long puts on the same expiration that is going to be more profitable than a single long put at the perfect strike. So all you are doing is making it more likely you are picking the wrong strike. True, picking the right strike is also more likely, but your profit is reduced by the strikes that are wrong. Like if TSLA is 949 at expiration. Three of your four puts expire worthless and the one that is ITM only makes $1/share.

In the course of writing out this long answer, the original question was deleted out from under me. I didn't even get the poster's name. I put too much work into this to waste, so posting it here with most of the context missing. IIRC it was a long call on ADM with a $70 strike, then the underlying rose above $70, so they legged into an (inverted) strangle with an $89 put to \"lock in the gain\".\n\n-------------------------\n\nWhew, a lot to unpack here.\n\nFirst, say more about your thinking behind legging into a strangle. That's not the way I would have protected unrealized gains. In fact, screw unrealized gains, I would have made those *realized* gains and then bought into a new call on ADM at a lower cost of entry to net a profit no matter what happens on the second trade.\n\nTL;DR - the safest way to protect unrealized gains is to realize them. Sure, there are tax consequences, but those are rarely larger than the risk of loss if you continue to hold.\n\nSecond, adding risk to a winning trade is rarely a smart move. You basically reduced your gain on the call by spending part of it on the put. Given a choice between a simple strategy with a single cost basis and a complex strategy with multiple cost bases, go simple every time.\n\n> (1) If I allow this position to go to expiration (or very close to it before exiting or rolling it over), am I correct in saying that the worst I could do would be +2.90 points of profit (minus commissions)?\n\nStart from the assumption that options should never be held to expiration. Expiration comes with expiration risks.\n\nYour total cost is 13.60 + 2.50 = 16.10. If the expiration price is 89.00 where the put expires worthless and the call would be worth (89.00 - 70.00) = 19.00. 19.00 - 16.10 = 2.90.\n\nIf the expiration price is less than 16.10 below the put strike of 89 but close to it, like 73, the call expires at (73.00 - 70.00) = 3.00 and the put expires at (89.00 - 73.00) = 16.00. So again 3.00 + 16.00 - 16.10 = 2.90.\n\nIf the expiration price is $69.99 (worst-case for the call), the call expires worthless and the put has an expiration value of (89.00 - 69.99) = 19.01, so again you net 2.90.\n\nSo yes, it looks like you've locked in 2.90 no matter what happens.\n\n**HOWEVER**: It's important to compare those results with what would have happened had you not hedged your unrealized gain.\n\nThe cost basis of the call alone was 13.60.\n\nAt an expiration price of of 89.00, your call would have made 89.00 - 70.00 = 19.00, 19.00 - 13.60 = 5.40. That's 5.40 - 2.90 = 2.50 left on the table. And proportionally more for expiration prices above 89. For example, at 102, 102.00 - 70.00 = 32.00, 32.00 - 13.60 = 18.40, 18.40 - 2.90 = 15.50 left on the table.\n\nIf the expiration price is 73, the call expires at (73.00 - 70.00) = 3.00, for a 3.00 - 13.60 = -10.60 loss vs. 2.90 gain.\n\nIf the expiration price is 69.99, the call expires worthless for a full -13.60 loss vs. 2.90 gain.\n\nAgain, keep in mind that you could have realized your gain and then re-entered at a lower cost basis, like buying a $95 strike call, and still have been exposed to any additional upside. If you could arrange for the cost of the call to be less than the realized gain (say less than 5.40), you net a profit even if the second trade is a total loss. In fact, if you arrange for the call's cost to net your realized gain down to 2.90, you lose nothing relative to the strangle, while maintaining all of the upside exposure.\n\n> (2) Is there a general guideline on how much time value is considered acceptable when legging into a strangle to protect gains? Or is that something that a trader just figures out over time with experience?\n\nYes there is a guideline.

But it appears that you actually used a \"stop limit\".\n\nYou set the limit too high. A limit order is your price **or better**. So imagine if the price series for DOCU was $4.71 (bid) followed by $4.69. The stop would have triggered because the bid crossed $4.70, but now that the limit is active, the bid is $4.69, which is *not* better than $4.70, so nothing happens. As long as the price stays below $4.70, your order will not be filled.\n\nFor stop limits I usually advise people to set the limit as low as you can stand. Say you want to trigger a 4.70 and the absolute worst price you can stand is 3.00. So set the limit there. If the price is 4.69 after the stop triggers, you get 4.69. You don't get 3.00, because again a limit is that price *or better*.\n\nThis is also why you should not use a stop loss (market), because if the next price after 4.71 is 0.23, your market order fills at 0.23. The limit protects you from ridiculous prices that might be on the order book.\n\nActually, I usually advise people not to use stop orders of any kind for option trades, since the volume of trading and thus price discovery is very herky-jerky for options.

I know the sources that cite that and they have good reasons to cite that, but there is more than one way to play this game well. Especially if you can't afford $500 per trade to begin with.\n\nIt is much, much, much more important to insure that you get at least 34% of the spread width as credit, regardless of the width.

For one thing, the contracts cover 5x as many shares, so 1000 shares instead of 200. For another, some chains don't have $1 strikes, they only have $5 or $10 strikes. But on the pro side, yes having higher quantity and smaller individual positions in the lot means you have more flexibility in how to handle gains or losses. You can take partial profits off the table with higher quantities. You can also pare down losses in smaller chunks.\n\nBut the key fact about spread width to keep in mind is that it defines your risk of loss.

He said the increases could be even higher if necessary than the quarter-percentage-point move approved at the meeting.\n\n“We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability,” he said. “In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so. And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.”\n\nA basis point is equal to 0.01%. FOMC officials indicated that 25 basis point increases are likely at each of their remaining six meetings this year. However, markets are pricing in about a 50-50 chance the next hike, at the May meeting, could be 50 basis points.\n\n‘Widely underestimated’ inflation\n\nThe sudden policy tightening comes with inflation as measured by the consumer price index running at 7.9% on a 12-month basis. A measure that the Fed prefers still has prices up 5.2%, well above the central bank’s 2% target.\n\nAs he has before, Powell ascribed much of the pressures coming from pandemic-specific factors, in particular escalated demand for goods over services that supply could not meet. He conceded that Fed officials and many economists “widely underestimated” how long those pressures would last.\n\nWhile those aggravating factors have persisted, the Fed and Congress provided more than $10 trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus since the pandemic’s start. Powell said he continues to believe that inflation will drift back to the Fed’s target, but it’s time for the historically easy policies to end.\n\n“It continues to seem likely that hoped-for supply-side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal, but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain,” said Powell, whose official title now is chairman pro tempore as he waits Senate confirmation to a second term. “In the meantime, as we set policy, we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near-term supply-side relief.”\n\nPowell also addressed the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying it is adding to supply chain and inflation pressures. Under normal circumstances, the Fed generally would look through those types of events and not alter policy. However, with the outcome unclear, he said policymakers have to be wary of the situation.\n\n“In normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary policy would look through a brief burst of inflation associated with commodity price shocks,” he said. “However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the Committee to move expeditiously as I have described.”\n\nPowell had indicated last week that the FOMC also is prepared to begin running off some of the nearly $9 trillion in assets on its balance sheet.

Another important response from Powell when asked if he's still going to rate hike aggressively during recession, he said the Fed needs 2% inflation to freely provide support to the economy like it did in the last decade. So it seems like he's very firm on fighting inflation, which has always been his stance since Jan/Feb this year, but he's now starting to be very explicitly vocal about it.

In two separate accidents, pilots lost control of their aircraft due to a sudden and unexpected rudder movement, and the resulting crashes killed everyone on board, 157 people in total. Similar rudder issues led to a temporary loss of control on at least one other Boeing 737 flight before the problem was ultimately identified. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the incidents were the result of a design flaw that could result in an uncommanded movement of the aircraft's rudder.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Chinese pilots are well know to be garbage.

{"title": "Meta employees are looking to leave jobs as their stock based compensation has plummeted more than 40 per cent over the past six months", "selftext": "Shares of Facebook and Instagram parent Meta have plummeted more than 40 per cent over the past six months – and some employees saddled with underwater stock options are eyeing the exits. “Joined Meta near [all time stock high], now feeling like shit,” one Meta employee said this week in a popular thread on Blind, a corporate message board with verified members. “What should I do?” “Leave this crap place,” another “Metamate” responded, according to the New York Post. “Same boat,” a third said, adding that they’re “already interviewing” at other companies. “Duh, you’re supposed to think Meta, Metamates, and me. Ask yourself if this train of thought is good for the company,” a fourth joked. “Just kidding … it super sucks.”\n\nMeta is facing a worker stampede as its stock price has fallen from an all-time high of more than $US380 ($A512) in September to $US216.49 ($A292) at the time of writing. The slide started last year as a damning series of leaks put massive political pressure on the company and kicked into overdrive as Meta started to feel the multibillion-dollar sting of privacy changes from Apple and Google that are pummelling its advertising business. “People are definitely paying attention and are concerned about the stock price,” Michael Solomon, who manages software engineers through his talent firm 10x Management, told The Post. “I think a lot of people have questions about if Meta is going to get out of this – if this could be the beginning of the end for them.” When software engineers join companies like Meta, Google or Amazon, their compensation typically consists of a roughly 50/50 mix of cash and stock options, with entry-level employees getting more cash and more experienced workers getting more stock, according to data from tech salary tracker levels.fyi. At Meta, new hires are typically given a set number of restricted stock units based on the company’s average stock price around the time they were hired. That means there can be huge upsides for employees who join before a company’s stock rockets – but it also leaves them vulnerable to downturns.\n\nFor example, a Meta employee who was given $US100,000 ($A134,000) worth of restricted stock units around the company’s September stock peak would now be left with roughly $US57,000 ($A76,000). It also means that opportunists from other companies – such as Microsoft, which is down 10.3 per cent so far this year – can theoretically “buy the dip” by taking a job at a beaten-down company like Meta, getting more stock options at a lower price. In response to a disgruntled “Metamate’s” post on Blind, one Microsoft employee wrote: “The only people would be doing well are those who are currently transferring companies right now. I’m doing exactly that and headed to Meta.” Laura Martin, a tech and media analyst with Needham & Company, said that while many tech workers may feel loyal to their companies, it makes financial sense for many to switch jobs when the value of their options tanks. “If you’re not going to be making any money in your equity options for three years, it is in your interest to leave,” Ms Martin told The Post. “I agree with the decision to leave your current firm and go to a company and get stock at their current price.”\n\nhttps://www.news.com.au/finance/work/at-work/meta-employees-look-to-ditch-jobs-amid-stock-crash-feeling-like-sht/news-story/b8123ee29fd8adee016f6866fa5c82a7", "id": "tjc3ns", "created_utc": 1647870103.0, "score": 4677, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 439, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 931, "replies": [{"body": "I’d rephrase this as, this is the risk an employer makes with stock based compensation.

There's lots of people who don't show up on these list because their wealth is intentional obfuscated and/or is just in \"assets\" that don't have typical, public, market transactions. For example, a dictator of a country could be considered to have control of quite a lot of assets, but those assets don't trade on a market that produces easily calculated values to tally up a neat little list.\n\nFor Musk, I'd argue that his ownership in SpaceX is significantly more valuable than Tesla right now. It's just that he owns ordinary shares of Tesla, and those trade on a public market and it's a company with obvious potential and future streams of revenue/profit.\n\nSpaceX raises capital by selling shares, but it's not a public market, and Musk owns an outright majority of all shares and even larger majority of voting shares. It's his company, and anyone buying a share isn't really buying ownership, they're just paying to come along for the ride. Musk could decide that SpaceX will never be profitable and will use all it's resources to colonize Mars and it will never generate any returns (at least on Earth).\n\nThe transactions prices we see for SpaceX aren't for a small, but equal, percentage of the company. They're for essentially what's a different class of ownership, one without any kind of control at all. We should consider the shares Musk owns in SpaceX to have a different value than anyone else's, and to the best of my knowledge none of those shares have ever traded? So we're left to speculate what value Musk or any potential buyer might put on control of the dominant company in the worldwide space launch business? SpaceX is so far ahead of any other private space company that it's difficult to estimate. Hell, they're the only organization in the world that has any credible plan to colonize another planet. Not even any government is close to being able to say that, it's just an unprecedented potential that we haven't seen in human history.\n\nIf Starship gets anywhere close to its targeted goals it's going to be a technological advancement that shifts the course of human history, or at least accelerates our exploration of space by decades, maybe more. That's the kind of thing that's basically impossible to value in any traditional way, it's the kind of thing that putting a price tag on is almost completely pointless. But just as a very rough estimate, I think putting a \"true\" value that's somewhere in the range of the most valuable companies in the world is probably a good starting point. Using that kind of *very* rough estimate, Musk is already a trillionaire. But again, it's the kind of ownership/value that doesn't really make sense to measure in currency (especially an Earth based currency). It's also not the kind of wealth that you spend to buy mega-yachts or private islands, so it's not the kind of wealth that's typically tallied up for these \"richest person\" lists, which often end up being stand-ins for ostentatious displays of consumption.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "hey man.. you don't have to convince me that these lists are dumb.. lmao\n\nbut nice insight haha", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "yeah definitely by 2025/26. that’s an unbelievable amount of $$\n\na million seconds is 12 days, a billion seconds is 31 years, a trillion seconds is 31,688 years", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "“It is orders of magnitude harder to be a Trillionaire.” -Elon Musk", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I mean...did that really need a study?

{"title": "Interest rates, inflation, and where that leaves Gold and the markets.", "selftext": "**If you are skimming, read the bold.**\n\nWith interest rates finally being raised on Wednesday, there’s a lot to look forward to in 2022 as well as the following decade. The FED has announced a 0.25% rate hike with what sounds like a target of 7 this year, leaving the target range somewhere between 1.75%-2.00%. What does this mean? It means money is becoming more expensive to borrow. This results in a tightening of the money supply in both the market and the economy. Borrowed money is permanently returned and removed from the system. To put it simply, imagine your credit card interest rate rising from 10% to 20%: you are not only less inclined to spend, but also pressured to pay off any outstanding debt ASAP. Hence the fear of money(outstanding debt) flowing out of markets and back to the lenders.\n\nExactly how much is 1.75%, and is it going to be enough to bring down inflation? Well, the inflation rate came in at a reported 7.9% last month. Most of us already know this number is detached from reality, the inflation calculation has been altered over the years to favor government irresponsibility. Using inflation calculations from 1980, the inflation rate would be at 16%. This sounds more reasonable and in line with the price increases we all have experienced.\n\nSource: [http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate\\_data/inflation-charts](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6buhfirsmo81.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6d35faf42483685ab1147a1ce8283b157e7e33\n\nBelow is a chart of interest rates (orange) vs inflation (blue). Every time inflation gets out of control, rates are hiked in order to tame it. Back in the 1970’s, with inflation at around 12%, we needed hikes of 13% to bring it under control. Using the FEDs silly terms, that is 1300 BPS. Again in the 1970’s we saw near 15% inflation and 19% rates (1900 BPS) needed to bring it down. Nearly every year that inflation skyrockets, interest rates need to match or exceed in order to bring it under control. However, there is one difference between now and pre 2008, quantitative easing (aka uncontrolled money printing). When so much of our economy is reliant on printed money (debt), reeling the line back in is an impossible feat without a total collapse.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osa7xnzssmo81.jpg?width=2050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82fa3e37f2943e44c843c5f3349ed461612ae7bc\n\nOne look at 2018 and you begin to see the problem with rising interest rates in a debt dependent economy. **Back in 2015, the FED decided to start raising interest rates to maintain a 2% inflation target for the coming years. This caused a massive strain on markets, resulting in both the NASDAQ and S&P500 dropping \\~18% in 2018. After seeing this, the FED promptly reversed the decision.**\n\nThe stock market and most assets are completely built upon and reliant on debt. **Quantitative easing has turned our economy into a ponzi scheme with ever ballooning prices. Cutting access to that debt through interest rate hikes begins a cascading effect of “margin calls”. As one person goes to settle their debt, the outflow of money puts pressure on everyone else to repay their outstanding debt.** One of the largest contributing factors to the 1929 market crash was Margin debt. Margin isn’t the problem, uncontrolled debt is.\n\nThis is why your schizophrenic, QAnon supporting uncle has been screaming that the global economy is about to crash every year for the past decade. This is at the core of gay bear ideaology. So why hasn’t it happened? And will it happen?\n\nThe entire goal of the FED is self preservation, they will do whatever they need to do to keep the economy from exploding. In what scenario will a bank or the FED EVER tell you they don’t have something under control? Doing so would cause panic, bank runs, and your uncle’s wet dream coming true. **The FED will find any reason to keep printing. If 2018 is any indicator, a reversal on rate hikes is inevitable.**\n\nNow moving on to how the recent interest hikes affect gold. **If you don’t know by now, gold is an unproductive asset. It doesn’t produce anything, it doesn’t grow, and it certainly doesn’t offer dividends. Opportunity cost is the price you pay for holding a stable asset while everything else around you is ballooning higher.** **Why hold gold, when you can gain 2% a year from bonds or 8% average from stocks? That premise is all based on the FED taming inflation, resulting in your 2% and 8% gains outpacing inflation.**\n\n**As commodity & energy prices rise, so do the input costs of your favorite tech companies. Everything from running servers, to buying equipment, to maintenance all have energy or commodity costs associated with them**.\n\nNow combine this with consumer spending. **When the average consumer’s bills go up, their consumer good spending plummets.** Let’s take a look at what happens to Jane’s $2500 paycheck as rent, gas prices, and food soars. Jane used to pay $1000 for rent, $400 for food, and $200 in gas/utilities. This left her with about $900 to spend on consumer goods produced by your favorite companies in the stock market. Now that her rent is $1300, food $600, and $300 in utilities, her spending allowance is a third of what it was at $300. Even advertisement centered businesses like facebook/google see profit losses as less buying results in less marketing by companies. **Nearly every company is dependent on the average consumer’s spending in one way or another.**\n\nOk we get it there’s going to be lower profit margins for stocks, but where does this leave gold? Fundamentally, higher interest rates should mean that it’s more beneficial to secure your money in bonds; but what happens when the real rates (meaning the interest rates adjusted for inflation) are negative? If inflation is rising faster than interest rates, bond buyers are bleeding money.\n\nAs many of us know, the market looks ahead 6 months+ attempting to price in any future events. It’s why the stock market was falling before rates were actually hiked, and why so many people complain about the stock market soaring on expected bad news (it was priced in). **Anticipation of bad news suppresses prices. That pressure is lifted when the expected news actually occurs. This is only true for expected events as unexpected events cannot be priced in.**\n\nGold prices are no different. **Back between 2011 and 2015, gold prices drilled to local lows in anticipation of interest rate hikes.** **No one wanted to hold gold knowing that in a few years the FED would raise interest rates**, their money would be better off in bonds or elsewhere if that happened. This was the market pricing in rate hikes in the price of gold. **The exact month that the FED hiked rates marked the bottom in gold. The following 4 years saw one of the largest bull runs in gold even with interest rates rising.** The price was so suppressed in anticipation of FED responsibility that it ballooned higher when rates slowly increased. Once the FED reversed, and COVID forced interest rates to 0, gold went parabolic all the way to $2000/oz in August 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yoy0hdbusmo81.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c32c1010dad500e326612fd9a0e949c4d8340c5d\n\n**So here we are again with an 18 month consolidation in gold prices as the market waited in anticipation of rate hikes and FED responsibility. During some of the highest inflation we have seen in US history, gold went from over $2000 in summer of 2020, to reaching $1700 lows near the end of 2021.**\n\nHow is this supposed inflation hedge losing value in the 18 months after COVID. Even after massive money printing, record inflation, wars, and every other event that should be sending gold higher?\n\nIt all comes down to the market pricing in interest rates and responsibility from the FED, which effectively suppresses the price. The market expected FED “responsibility”, but it’s time to face the music and Powell ain’t dancing. **Now that rate hikes are actually happening, the pressure on gold prices is being lifted.** There is a decade-long bull run in commodities coming and gold is not going to be the only player. Uranium, silver, and gold will be the trade of the decade.\n\n**TLDR: Input costs for stocks rising, consumer spending cut due to inflation bills. Anticipation of rate hikes has suppressed gold prices, actual rate hike always mark the bottom in gold prices historically speaking (buy the rumor, sell the news). Debt dependent economy cannot sustain rate hikes, the fed reversed in rate hikes 2018 after stocks crashed and will do it again.**\n\n**Please at least read the bold in the post.**\n\n**Positions:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tts09p00tmo81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f5f6c839ddb474eded2f5e5e05a234e3516d629\n\n50% of my account is in $AG first majestic shares (a junior miner with one of, if not the highest leverage to gold & silver).

You don’t rapidly lose consciousness unless you’re at like 35,000ft or more. This is all common knowledge and can be looked up, but I also have first hand experience as I stated before; in the navy, aviators and Aircrewman undergo hypoxia training in Pensacola. We go into a chamber where they remove the oxygen to simulate 25,000 ft altitude, then we perform elementary tasks for several minutes until we feel the effects of hypoxia and can no longer perform basic tasks; like playing pat-a-cake or putting shapes into a child’s toy.

There were no specific procedures to do so, and no one thought enough to ask for one. The aircraft was arguably, that is technically, legal, and it was probably safe, if it was carefully greased. It was not, we know that without question. And the lengthened inspection intervals were such that it was not to be looked at again, until it was in our laboratory. When it finally failed, ground support from Alaska Airlines seemed to encourage the crew to proceed with a broken plane on to their scheduled destination, for reasons perhaps of convenience both to passengers and maintenance -- we won't really ever know.

My thesis this was pilot error, however, has not changed*\n\n\nIn short, this will not fall on Boeing and likely pilot error, unfortunately. \n\nBuy BA because it will rebound.\n\nUpdate:\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/china/china-eastern-crash-wsj-report-inlt-hnk/index.html\n\nCan i say i told you so now?\n\nEdit 2: whats up fuckheads, shouldve bought.

It was a moment that began in May 2018 when the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2018, effectively clearing the way for legalized sports gambling.\n\nLegal sports betting is currently allowed in 30 states and Washington, D.C., and [the Washington Post reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/01/14/legal-sports-betting-states-2022/) that number will only increase. Some states have restrictions on the type of betting, with Oregon banning betting on college sports, and states such as Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia restricting betting to in-state college teams.\n\nWhile some critics [have raised concerns](https://www.vox.com/recode/22947732/phones-sports-betting-gambling-apple-google-march-madness) that legalized betting could enable people with gambling addictions to lose a life-ruining amount of money, many states have the viewpoint that people will place bets no matter what, so they may as well get some taxable revenue out of it.

Coupon-clipping types are playing them against each other to make risk-free bets.\n\nDave is a 34-year-old high school guidance counselor from Buffalo, but his true calling is hunting deals. He and his wife started out as extreme couponers, buying up massive supplies of shampoo and paper towels for a fraction of their usual cost. From there they moved on to credit card sign-up bonuses and, between the two of them, opened more than 100 accounts. In July the couple paid for their six-week, 13-country honeymoon almost entirely with points and miles. But Dave had never considered applying his deal-hunting skills to gambling until he attended a talk at ZorkFest, a conference in Las Vegas that promises to help patrons wring every last dollar out of corporate promotional offers. There, a presenter explained how people in Colorado had used a system called matched betting to make tens of thousands of dollars harvesting intro bonuses and free bets from online sportsbooks.\n\nIt was simple, the man said. Use a promo offer to bet on one team to win a game, and then hedge the bet by wagering a mathematically precise amount of cash on the other team. This system, he claimed, could guarantee a predictable, risk-free profit, no matter which team won. And you could keep at it for as long as sportsbooks continued to offer more giveaways.\n\nDave was intrigued, but he had no legal outlet for sports gambling once he flew home from Nevada, so he put the idea out of his mind. “But fast-forward to January,” he says, when the state of New York legalized online sports betting, “and I’m like, ‘Oh shoot, what was that guy talking about in Vegas?’ ”\n\nAt that point Dave, who asked that I use only his first name to conceal his identity from sportsbooks, had made just a single sports bet in his life. While enjoying a comped drink in a New Orleans casino (another miles-covered trip), he’d wagered $100 on a multi-leg parlay that required Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen to surpass an improbable number of benchmarks, including one for passing yardage. As Dave remembers it, Allen came up 10 yards short. “I was 0 for 1 in my sports betting career,” he says. But he also noticed that every time he used the internet, he was barraged with ads for promotional offers: a $3,000 deposit match and $300 site credit from Caesars, a $1,000 risk-free bet from FanDuel, and a $5,000 risk-free bet from DraftKings, along with a series of smaller deals.\n\n“So I started asking around,” Dave recalls, “networking with people that I’ve met over the years that are really into this hobby of maximizing the return on their spending.” One of them pointed him to the r/sportsbook forum on Reddit and, specifically, a post from “this really mysterious, shadowy figure named DarkHorse.”\n\nDarkHorseOdds, to use his full handle, seemed to have anticipated all of Dave’s questions in a multipage explainer headed “New Yorkers: How to make $7K guaranteed from these sign-up offers.” He wrote, “Depending on how the bets play out, you’ll need anywhere from $9,250-$15,750 to do this. The size of the winnings scale with the size of the bets. If you don’t have that much to commit, you just won’t make as much.” And $7,000 in winnings was merely the start, he added, because sportsbooks would continue to send new offers even after you played through the initial deals.\n\nThe post amounted to a more technical version of the strategy Dave had heard about in Vegas. DarkHorseOdds offered users a four-phase, nine-step plan for exactly how to play the different companies’ sign-up deals against each other, beginning with BetRivers and DraftKings. “1. On BR: Activate the $250 bonus. This might take 48 hours to appear after your deposit. 2. On DK: Place the $5 to win $200 in Free Bets. Do NOT opt into the $5,000 Risk Free Bet on DK yet.” And so on.\n\nR/sportsbook has only 279,000 members (or “degens,” as the forum’s “About Community” tab calls them), compared with the 11.8 million users on its more famous cousin r/wallstreetbets, but it features a similar aspirational ethos. Although many posts are sports bar arguments about which team is the surest bet that day, there’s also a constant background chatter about how best to cash in on the billions of dollars bookmakers have spent over the past few years to attract new customers. Below DarkHorseOdds’ post, someone using the screen name GirderErection asked, “Serious questions. Should I take out a personal loan and pay the bank back next week?” Another user, squaredeel, replied, “Have you considered refinancing your home? Rates at 3% right now, free money imo.”\n\nAt first, Dave had trouble following DarkHorseOdds’ explanations. “It was like a foreign language to me, all the odds and the nomenclature,” he says. “But I read it, and I read it again, and I read it like another dozen times.” Eventually he was persuaded enough to open accounts at all four mobile sportsbooks then operating in New York. Over a three-day weekend he made a series of bets that escalated in size, culminating in a wager north of $11,000 with Caesars on the National Hockey League’s Dallas Stars to defeat the Montreal Canadiens, hedged with a $5,000 “risk-free bet” from DraftKings on Montreal.\n\nDave was guaranteed to win a little more than $3,000, no matter the final score. Even so, he says, betting a quarter of his annual salary on a hockey game was terrifying. “It felt like a rocket ship, like the fire was burning as I’m going back and forth between the two different screens,” he says. “And then, when I finally clicked bet on both and it went through, it was like the rocket ship went off.”\n\n“Human error is really the biggest risk.

{"title": "Blackrock Crisis Part 4", "selftext": "Is BLK still going to 0?\n\n**TLDR:** Yes.\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7qm7s/blackrock_crisis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t82pod/blackrock_crisis_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tbwd2h/blackrock_crisis_part_3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nOh Blackrock, you big beautiful fucked bastard, I am so excited to buy up all your shit with the money I make on you on the way down. \n\n**Quick summary of 1-3:** \n\nBlackrock is a equity holding giant, the vast majority of their revenue comes from that little MER section at the bottom of the ETF description that you idiots never read. They hold 40% of their crappy overvalued holdings internationally and a boat load of that is worthless Chinese equities and properties. Blackrock owns the world and the world is overvalued. How is China looking since my last post? Not so good huh? A bit of a relief rally during last week's quad witch party was nice for some BABA holding degens, but lets be clear... China is fucked. Since my last post we have seen new lockdowns and a 2008 style sell off as a result. Granted it was gobbled up when the CCP announced they were going full JPOW but we'll see how that goes.  \n\nAll in all Blackrock has been bleeding out for months and as you can see in part 2 I circled this week as a nice little buying opportunity for you guys. I sold some of my April puts around $680, and just went all the way back in gorilla style today for May dated OTM puts. \n\nThis week we're talking about **BONDS:**\n\nThe bond market is rattled at the fed for raising rates too slowly. Last time we talked about how the mortgage rate was moving independently from the real rates, time to look at those pesky yields. Blackrock like another asset manager works with leverage, therefore they have to paying off debt on the majority of their holdings. As yields increase the payments to service that debt increases and with the majority of its revenue coming from that tasty MER or a percentage of their investment holdings their ability to service that debt is dropping and will drop much further as equities and assets continue to correct. Take a look at what the 10 yr is up to recently:  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6ckgqnp2so81.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=369fcd2bd283766ca0e29fc7a88e7c8e374895c0\n\nGood luck paying off that debt during the upcoming recession. Oh and if oil ripping up 50% wasn't a good enough recession indicator how about **the yield curve**. If you've never heard of anything before you won't know that yields are supposed to go up the longer the maturation period. i.e. 1<2<5<10<20<30 At the time of writing this Bond yields are:\n\n2yr: 2.107%\n\n5yr: 2.312%\n\n10yr: 2.299%\n\n20yr: 2.647\n\n30yr: 2.523\n\nSo far the 5 and the 10 are inverted as well as the 20 and the 30. The classic ones to watch though are the **2 and the 10**, so lets check those out:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bn4gzjb73so81.png?width=1843&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a81d8b375f6d04389e0de148a2c383a9156c875\n\nOof... Give it a week or two and we'll see the inversion.\n\nLast little chart to take a peak at even for dummy bulls who think we're back on easy mode. Here is **BLK and SPY from 2018.** You can see even though spy had a bit of a rally before the bid dump at the end of the year, BLK was pretty much a steady blead all year. \n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekq10k5n3so81.png?width=1850&format=png&auto=webp&s=1237e8a02206c2cb103685b9f7b3da9553b9f948\n\n**TLDR:** Buckle up. we're dumping.\n\n**Positions:** INB4 yeah last week was ass, but sold the last of my other positions in my gambling portfolio and dumped them in to buy the put dip.\n\nBLK Apr 14 22 630P\n\nBLK May 20 22 650P", "id": "tjig56", "created_utc": 1647887246.0, "score": 219, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 172, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4374|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tbwd2h/blackrock_crisis_part_3/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7qm7s/blackrock_crisis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t82pod/blackrock_crisis_part_2/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tjig56/blackrock_crisis_part_4/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mp6wu9/leveraged_index_etfs_as_longterm_holds/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tjig56)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tjig56)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It’s simple, if OP can’t spell **bleed** I’m in", "score": 134, "replies": [{"body": "Underrated.", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Blackrock owns everything, ur astronomically retarded if u think it's going to 0", "score": 294, "replies": [{"body": "Owning everything and having liabilities against those assets is no assurance of solvency in the long run.

{"title": "South Park Investment Theory (deeper dive)", "selftext": "Ten months ago, u/robertisaak proposed, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naehn4/south_park_investment_theory/) on wsb, using a portfolio derived from South Park episodes. He promised to return with a graph but never did. I took it upon myself to continue his research. \n\nWhile the show definitely had its tenbaggers, I assumed that the good calls on Build A Bear Workshop, Tesla ($TSLA), Apple ($AAPL), Sony ($SONY), Amazon ($AMZN) were just lucky, and, all-in-all, the performance should be roughly on par with an index (let's say S&P500, as it uses the same acronym). \n\nI did however decide to look deeper into it, and to my surprise, a very simple South Park Index^[1] drastically outperforms S&P.\n\nThis is how they actually compare:  [2009-2022 graph 🚀🚀🚀](https://i.imgur.com/VhUObvd.jpg). \n\nA different comparison showing how good our South Park predictions are is the following: consider you buy a stock mentioned in an episode during that day and keep it for a month, respectively a year - how does the performance compare to buying $SPY on that day? Average returns:\n\n* **1 month hold**: South Park Stock: 5.93% 🚀 vs S&P 0.93%\n* **1 year hold**: South Park Stock: 35.42% 🚀 vs S&P 11.86%\n\nWhile past performance doesn't guarantee future performance and this approach has some small biases^[2], the numbers make it quite clear that South Park has been a really good stock selector. But why is that? You could argue that the publicity that it brought helped, but it's definitely too small of an impact for the large-cap stocks (i.e. AAPL, AMZN). Most likely it's just the fact that the episodes tend to focus on things disrupting & impacting our society, those things that change the way we do things ($TSLA, $AAPL, $TWTR), those we love ($SONY) and those we hate ($AMZN). Buying such companies at an early time is a good way to make a strong return (especially in a long Bull Market).\n\nSo, should you buy the next stock mentioned? Maybe, probably. \n!!This is not financial advice!!\n \n\n[1] The index is an **equal-weighted** combo of all stocks mentioned in episodes in the previous 18 months, and they are \n\n[2] Mainly survivor bias\n\nMore detailed info on data preparation, biases, portfolio construction & rebalancing in my yt on this: https://youtu.be/8CRYaVEQD-4\n\n\n**Later Edit:** By popular demand, here's how the same index construction (except this time position is set the next trading day, as Simpsons airs on Sundays) would perform for **The Simpsons** [2009-2022 Graph](https://i.imgur.com/dTb05BF.jpg).

I also realize this is WAY beyond your timeframe, but it is a somewhat direct mention of a stock.\n\nRecently (\"Pajama Day\", S25E1, Feb 2, 2022) they talked about Bitcoin.

The restaurant ended up closing down during the pandemic, although in a very South Park move [they actually spent their own money to buy it](https://www.kktv.com/2021/09/28/south-park-creators-finalize-casa-bonita-purchase-31-million/).\n\nIf they ever decide to actually launch [Tegridy Weed](https://www.tegridyfarms.com/) it would be interesting to see how sales would go up on episodes that mention it. I'm convinced its a reason why we still have Randy owning and operating a pot farm; they want to eventually make a real life marijuana business, but they just need it to be decriminalized before they can do it. Granted, they've done South Park for so long that they may like having Randy there just for something new to talk about.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
