Nixon hammered his Fed chair to provide cheap money to keep growth high at all costs even if it resulted in some inflation so long as it didn't result in recession. As we all know now  it resulted in both.  With the fed not raising rates while all of the other factors were being added to the mix, the real interest rates were going steeply negative  ultimately requiring the shock to the system that were the 20% interest rates needed to bring inflation back in check and restore the environment to one suitable for stock asset investing.  \n\nHaving said all that, the current situation seems a bit different in that the glut of recent spending seemingly resulted in staving off of the negative effects of the pandemic with respect to overall economic growth.  This appears to be a positive for the market.  \n\nWith regards to the inflation side of things, if the Fed is able to raise rates unimpeded by political actors like the influence Nixon exerted, then it should result in a less catastrophic unwinding of the cheap money policies of the last decade or so.  Even though some of the causes of inflation appear to be transitory like the supply chain issues and increased government spending, the right approach should still be to allow the fed rate to rise to keep the real interest rates from an accelerating negative trajectory. \n\nIf this happens, I would expect the stock market to do a soft landing and not a catastrophic crash.  But there is no certainty in predicting how our political elites will act and if we see signs that the fed is being held back and not taking decisive action then I would say watch out below.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "By a soft landing, does that mean they will let the market slowly decline 70% over a few years?

Imo, if there is unexpected inflation, then these two assets should do well. Unexpected inflation is the difference between real inflation and the forecasted inflation. So if interest rate policies don’t perform as expected and supply chain inflation factors don’t come down, then these two assets should do well. \n\nIn terms of the stock markets, inflation will likely impact start ups, and non profit generating companies more than others. If you’re going stock market route, go with companies that are cash flowing and have the ability to push costs down to consumers or down the supply chain. Sadly this only perpetuates inflation. \n\nBitcoin and other coins don’t have enough (actually no data) data to support that they will be a good hedge against high inflation as we are experiencing now. I don’t really follow this much, but from what I’ve read, they often follow high risk assets, so similar to how tech and start ups trend. Again, there isn’t enough data to support how this asset performs in high inflation periods, so it could very well do the opposite and perform well. If you want to speculate on this allocate accordingly - maybe a 1-5% allocation at most. \n\nCurrencies - just as much of a speculation as Bitcoin. Here you’re essentially betting on certain countries experiencing significantly less inflation than US (if you’re in the US). Considering USD is still the world’s reserve currency, most currencies will trend with USD and most monetary policies also follow US. China’s yuan is seen to be appreciating, but I doubt you’ll make more money speculating on currencies than the other assets above.\n\nAs a last resort, if you don’t know - diversified ETFs and just DCA and hold.

That was it. And that’s known knowledge. I posted this after researching after other things to buy in anticipation the war continues. This is known knowledge not only coveted by that podcast. You think that podcast is the grail of information? 🤣 \n\nAnd even if I did post information from that podcast, I can’t? You’re mad for no reason troll.\n\nAnd we’re discussing Canada in this chain. So your bs trolling is just BS trolling ;)", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Well sir,  I'm a proud Canadian.  I have a couple of degrees in science from one of our top universities and I consider myself pretty lucky and pretty happy.  I have a good job, zero debt and I notice the price increases because I, like you, have to shop for groceries and other needs.  Like you probably are, I'm also worried about housing prices.\n\nI would argue that the cause of these price increases, both in wage, in shelter and at the grocery store can be narrowed down to one fact.  Growth is decreasing while supply of non-productive money is increasing.  That money needs to go somewhere or it depreciates in value.  It goes wherever it thinks it can make a gain.   \n\nInterest rates are very low in both Canada and the US.  The real yield on a long bond purchase is negative.  Meaning if you invest in bonds, you will have less purchasing power at the end of the term than at the beginning.  What once was a viable long-term investment is no longer the case. \n\nSo where is that money to go?  Wherever it can make a profit.  In Canada, we have a bulletproof (almost bulletproof) housing market.  Our CMBSs have been very safe investments historically (until very recently).  Our government insures these assets and makes sure home buyers are qualified.  It's one of the safest investments you can make.  The excess money flows there.  \n\nInternational money flows there also.  You can't blame overseas investors.  That's where you would put your money too.  Canada is pretty safe and pretty awesome.  Now look what's happening overseas.  The money is going \\*poof\\*.  The assets backing our mortgage-backed securities are losing value.  You can see confidence evaporate by looking at any etf that tracks them (CMBS from ishares is a good example).  You can see that confidence evaporate almost instantly right as Evergrande started making news this summer.  \n\nSo again, where is this non-productive money to go?  People aren't working and companies are already at historic valuations.  Housing is looking kinda sketchy long-term.  Nobody wants to buy the top.  What's left?  Whatever people deem safe.  Physical materials.  Energy, food, bigmacs.  \n\nWe need to increase productivity so companies and goods can measure up to their insane valuations.  We need to increase wages so people can actually buy these ridiculous prices.  Unemployment is low and wages are increasing because the non-productive money is desperately seeking productivity.  That's where your $15 minimum wage comes from.  It's an effect, not a cause.  \n\nI'm glad you made money.  It's difficult to do.

{"title": "How Tesla is BANKRUPTING its ‘competition’ and the BIGGEST RISKS for Tesla Stock to skyrocket.", "selftext": "There is no *~~real~~* competition.\n\nInstead, Tesla is Bankrupting their competition.\n\nTesla has positioned themselves to survive these difficult times, as high inflation and chip shortages force other car manufacturers to LITERALLY STOP production. Thanks to Tesla making the MOST PROFITABLE vehicles Tesla will be able to survive and thrive.\n\nSo what the hell is going on? **What will happen** to Tesla stock during these difficult times and how has Tesla created THE MOST PROFITABLE vehicles on the market?\n\nIn this article I talk about the BIGGEST RISKS facing Tesla at the moment whilst also discussing specifically how Tesla is bankrupting their competition and is on pace to become one of the worlds biggest companies ever…..\n\n# Why the Competition is Dying 🤯\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpmyfny28do81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dca1aef3984718d375d695f0ea626e61b3efa5e\n\n[Thankyou for opening your Tesla folder! 📂](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/)\n\nIn the last week alone, due to oil prices rising to record levels, the number of people ordering Tesla’s grew by 100%! Soaring gas prices really show the power of Electric Vehicles and people are realizing that Tesla makes the best. Buying a Tesla in the long run literally saves you hundreds of dollars of fuel and repair costs.\n\nMeanwhile the ‘competition’ is literally shipping vehicles without key security features, like Ford shipping vehicles without chips controlling non-safety critical features. Not only this, but Ford and other OEM’s are at the mercy of dealerships, Tesla doesn’t have this ridiculously *outdated* model and is achieving higher profit because of it. You know something else that competitors can’t say?\n\nYou know something else that competitors can’t say? The fact that a Tesla will be harder to order and buy TOMORROW than it is today! **The Tesla backlog is growing,** I’ve said it time and time again, Tesla has a supply issue, not a demand issue.\n\nThe Tesla back log (number of vehicles ordered but not yet delivered) is growing rapidly, with the average Tesla buyer waiting (eagerly) for 3.5 months before they can drive their new car.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/noufoer48do81.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=642287b174bfa4d63a69693ab2b3beea8155f513\n\nTesla backlog visualized, credit: Twitter user TroyTeslike\n\nThis backlog is actually GROWING, this is despite Tesla increasing production and increasing their prices. This is a super bullish indicator….\n\n**Why would anyone want a non-Tesla EV?** Or even a non Tesla vehicle in general?\n\n>“If (you) care about having the latest technology, much lower cost of ownership than an ICE vehicle, little maintenance and best in class safety, then an EV is the way to go (specifically a Tesla). “ Respected Twitter analyst [Sawyer Merrit](https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt)t said\n\nAnd that isn’t even taking into account that Tesla’s tend to APPRECIATE after having bought them..\n\n>“Tesla’s hold their value better than almost any major auto makers vehicles.” said Merrit.\n\nOK, so buying a Tesla and having the cars value go up is insane right. But it gets crazier.\n\nLet me tell you something REALLY crazy.\n\nTesla delivered 500k cars in 2020 and nearly doubled that IN ONE YEAR to 930k deliveries in 2021 WITHOUT ADDING ANY NEW FACTORIES…..\n\nAnd you know what is even crazier??! Tesla is *about* to **OPEN TWO! YES TWO NEW FACTORIES!**\n\nIn these factories Tesla will implement all the things they’ve learned from the Shanghai and California factories to ensure that the Berlin and Texas facilities will be producing 500,000+ vehicles per year! Specifically Giga-Berlin will start production on March 20th!!! This is absolutely groundbreaking for Tesla in Europe. Respected Tesla investor [Sawyer Merritt](https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt) outlined it perfectly when he said:\n\n>“Tesla is **already a leader** in sales in Europe and sales will only continue to grow with the opening of Giga Berlin.”\n\nThe current issues in Europe have mainly been the fact that Tesla is importing all of the currently sold European EV’s. The costs associated with this mean Tesla makes significantly less profit on Tesla’s sold in Europe than those in China or in the United States. However with the opening of Giga Berlin this will change very soon.\n\n>“Tesla has been **supply constrained** in the EU for a long time, so the opening of Giga Berlin is a massive deal. **Sales will skyrocket**. “ Merrit said\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w55mazh78do81.png?width=1415&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3bfe0fbd72a7696d3f7013d2eb552088eda4a8a\n\nWhen asked what major shocks Tesla could survive that competitors would struggle with, Merrit said:\n\n>“Tesla is the most vertically integrated major automaker in the world. This allows lower prices, agile manufacturing, quick process change and adaptability not possible with traditional OEM structure”\n\nHe again mentions something super interesting, and something that many people surprisingly don’t know, and that is the fact that **no** other car manufacturer has the level of Vertical Integration that Tesla has.\n\nThis has allowed them to scale so massively whilst competitors struggle to produce meaningful amounts of EV’s.\n\n>Merrit further said that “Tesla has handled the chip shortage better than most OEMs because of their vertical integration and finding creative solutions. Tesla designs their own FSD chip in house.\"\n\nMeanwhile competitors are partnering with Sony and other brands to produce the software for their vehicles, this is simply not good enough. Further stating that\n\n>**“Nobody in the auto industry has done anything remotely similar.**”\n\nIt is clear that in this business Tesla is clearly number 1 and approaching the finish line, whilst competitors are just starting the race..\n\nHowever, as Rocky Balboa once said *“****the world aint all sunshine and rainbows****“* And even Tesla has some **SERIOUS SERIOUS risks** they are battling and need to overcome quickly……\n\nFriendly reminder that I write free in-depth articles over at [teslafolder.com](https://teslafolder.com) like this if you're interested :)\n\n# The Biggest Risks for Tesla right now⚠\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fam9yti88do81.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e784059463cfcd2abfdfcc51952df51881c68c59\n\nThe world, not just Tesla is navigating a tough road right now. It is misty, and it is hard to see what is in front of us. Nevertheless we must navigate and get to our destination safely and quickly.\n\n*IF* the world doesn’t transition to sustainable energy soon **it may be too late.** Companies all around the world are facing serious inflationary risks, Tesla is no exception.\n\nThe stock is down more than 30% from it’s all time highs. Here are the biggest risks facing the company at the moment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5w39vjy98do81.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=737cc992893a7f5666e598108719854b3ab9b80c\n\nInflation hasn’t been this bad in a long time, during the 2020 pandemic roughly 80% of all currency in circulation was printed. This is a huge risk!\n\nThis is a huge risk, and with COVID lockdowns still creating supply chain bottlenecks and natural resources getting more and more expensive, this inflationary pressure is likely to last for a while.\n\nThis is important for Tesla because material prices skyrocketing is dangerous as Tesla relies heavy on certain materials to produce their vehicles. What we are seeing in recent days with Tesla increasing the price of its products is a direct response to the inflation they are seeing in their supply chain. You can see the increase in prices here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7fnwft0b8do81.png?width=288&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e607ddf05a49871279846050f0f7f125ea2c09e\n\nLuckily Tesla has a nice cushion and can absorb higher cost of resources, but we see they are passing this on to consumers which means the increased cost of production is likely significant.\n\n>“(However) as Dan Ives of Wedbush said, ‘ Tesla has the ability to pass that \\[inflation\\] on to the consumer, very similar to Netflix & Amazon Prime. Demand for Tesla’s is high, and people are willing to pay for them.’ Said Merrit.\n\nThis is exactly what we are seeing, Tesla is uniquely positioned to navigate the current inflation storm, Tesla is much better prepared than its competition.\n\n>“(Tesla) Wait times are still as long as ever. Margins will likely start to dip next quarter anyway due to Tesla opening up Giga-Texas and Giga-Berlin and ramping those factories up (Which require lots of capital)” Merrit said.\n\nSimilarly another risk, something that has been worrisome for some time now is Key man risk. It is the risk that if a critical employee is out for any extended period of time and for any reason, that it could seriously hurt your business.\n\nIt’s obvious for Tesla who i’m talking about. I’m talking about Elon Musk. He has been integral to Tesla’s success, we need him to stay onboard as CEO for the near future as Tesla continues their rapid growth.\n\nThis third risk is the reason Tesla stock actually DROPPED after record earnings. The fact that Tesla spent so much time talking about FSD and Robotaxis without addressing institutional investor concerns regarding the product roadmap update (Cybertruck, Tesla-Semi) and other factory related questions. However it is hard…\n\nIt is hard to give Tesla a lot of credit for a future (potential) success, investors want to see results about things they understand. **FSD is something they don’t.**\n\n>“Solving full-self driving is tough (clearly), but I believe Tesla will achieve it.” Merrit Said\n\nThat being said, FSD is continually improving and it is onlya question of WHEN not IF it becomes good enough where humans are no longer needed.\n\nAnother major risk [Sawyer Merritt](https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt) sees is the scaling of the 4680 batteries, a new technology that will prove hugely important for future Tesla growth.\n\n>“Scaling 4680 is another risk. We don’t yet know if they can do it and things have taken longer than expected.\n\nTesla has some of the best engineers and minds in the world though working for them so I have **no doubt** they will succeed on that front too. Tesla said they produced 1 million 4680 cells as of January 2022.”\n\nLastly, one of the biggest risks facing Tesla at the moment is actually a big one, namley: **Geopolitical risk.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkeg519c8do81.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=886079535f91be5c01c3221f24a234267d00582a\n\nWith everything happening in Ukraine, we need to remind ourselves that China isn’t a democracy. Although due to China being so integrated with the Western economies, and being a more mature company than Russia, i don’t expect China to bully Tesla around but it is always a risk one must consider. That being said, China is one of the worlds largest (car) markets and it is absolutely crucial Tesla has good relations with China and holds a factory there.\n\nWith all of this being said. You need to relax. You need to stop. You need to take a step back. Make sure that you’re not panic trading and losing money, either by selling or buying something you do not understand.\n\nFor Tesla bulls it is simple. Has Tesla lost demand? No. Are Electric Vehicles no longer the future? No. Is Tesla software/tech getting worse? No. Is Elon leaving anytime soon? No. Is the business shrinking? No.\n\nKeep a long term focus, keep your cool during these turbulent times. Tesla makes the MOST PROFITABLE vehicles in the world, how? Only a few years ago Tesla was losing money?! Let me tell you EXACTLY how, it’s actually crazy!…….\n\n# How Tesla makes Most Profitable cars📈\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7u6bse4d8do81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ea0c09304f6cfcecc3f067f7757e51390b3c0e8\n\nTesla will become one of the worlds most profitable companies this decade. Think about how powerful that sentence is! As of Q4 2021 the Average Cost To Produce A Tesla Is Just $36,000!\n\nIn Tesla's annual report, it noted that it achieved the highest operating margin \"across all volume OEMs\", that is insane!\n\nIt’s very interesting that the old argument against Electric Vehicles was ‘every EV sold is sold at a loss’ has never been further from the truth than today.\n\nWhat is really going on is that Tesla is selling literally everything they make due to the high demand. This is thanks to Tesla’s innovative vertical integration.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sk3aygve8do81.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b2cb46e29be398992c03204ad3274b8d1522df1\n\nTesla is the most vertically integrated car manufacturer in the world, then you add the fact that Tesla doesn’t have a dealership model, Tesla is in control of a major share of its supply chain. Allowing for optimisation, lower cost of production and increased scaling. It is a key reason that Tesla was able to nearly double production from 500k vehicles to 930k vehicles in one year.\n\nThis graph is truly powerful and highlights just the immense differences between Tesla and their competition. This is also why Tesla is best positioned to face the current uncertain environment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7yi48v4g8do81.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=05a20d7591c0fb30298d48fdcfa8ec0196c25feb\n\nWhat people don’t realise is that Tesla is something completely new. It is very comparable to the Iphone. When first introduced people thought it was ridiculous to pay $500usd for a phone. But the value proposition was just so much bigger than any competing phone product it made sense.\n\nThe fact that Tesla has near 30% Gross Margins is simply not heard of. Each dollar Tesla saves compared to its competition is compounded exponentially because Tesla is able to re-invest into their company. This is producing state-of-the art Giga factories in Berlin and Texas, further growing the gap between Tesla and the competition.\n\nAs the competition starts building their own EV’s the gross margins for these legacy makers will continue to decline as they push EV’s. They wont be able to scale as efficiently as Tesla.\n\ndropping during the early stages of their EV push because EV's is a loss-leader until you manage to scale efficiently. Let's call it the 'transition cost' that people generally don't account for. When talking about Tesla and how other automakers cannot catch up it is because Tesla has been making electric vehicles for more than a decade! Meanwhile the competition is only just starting….\n\nSo how is Tesla going to battle the risks they are facing? How is Tesla going to secure their position as the number 1 car brand? Let me tell you EXACTLY HOW this information ties to Tesla stock and your stock portfolio…..\n\n# What about the Tesla Stock Price? 💸\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ow1h25xg8do81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=11f449cc94053496a246ccbbe1d177979cb5eb0c\n\nHistorically, right now Tesla stock is super **cheap**. Since the start of the year Tesla price targets have gone up 17% from institutional investors.\n\nThese price targets are likely to continue to move higher as Giga Berlin opens and Giga Texas open, meanwhile Tesla will have another record quarter for Q1 2022. This disconnect between Tesla stock price and Tesla price targets and estimates is unprecedented.\n\nAs Future Fund manager Gary Black mentioned:\n\n>“This (is an) anomaly - higher estimates, lower Tesla price - won’t persist.”\n\nIt’s only a matter of time, currently the macro-environment is dominating Tesla stock price.\n\nSo **What needs to happen** for Tesla stock to catch up?\n\nThe War in Ukraine needs to end, the world and the people of Ukraine deserve better. This should help commodity prices come down as instability comes back down. Similarly inflation needs to stabilize and Tesla needs to prove that it can financially mitigate the higher cost of production whilst maintaining super growth. (The recent price increases show Tesla is being pro-active, it’s a good sign).\n\nInflation costs cannot keep increasing at the current rates, this instability can lead to long term risks for the entire economy including Tesla. The higher oil prices make EVERYTHING more expensive and could lead to economic down turn which in turn hurts Tesla.\n\nThanks for reading Tesla Folder!

These turbulent times have seriously proven how quickly we need to get off oil and gas and transition to sustainable energy and electric vehicles. This is good for Tesla.\n\nAlso remind yourself, the Tesla demand is growing, Tesla is about to open 2 new factories, Tesla creates the most profitable vehicles. Tesla is well positioned to mitigate the incredibly hostile macro-economic environment.

{"title": "SPY and TSLA Callapalooza", "selftext": "\nSup freaks. Its me again, the only guy left on this piece of shit forum that still posts some trades BEFORE it’s too late to get in on them.\n\nThis one is easy as fuck. Buy some SPY calls. Attached are my positions. All 2069 of them. Thats right I’ve got 2000 SPY calls and 69 TSLA calls (that I purchased this week).\nHere’s why you should follow me.\n\n1. The rate hike is in. Its a beautiful quarter point raise, Jpow hinted that the rest will be quarter points as well and the market loves it.\n\n2. Ukraine conflict has been fully priced in. Putin’s midlife crisis has hopefully come to a head and the sanctions being imposed have definitely shook him and his boys up. Its also made China realize the cost of doing war in a fully globalized economy. Barring any major escalations from Putin, the market will continue its uptrend.\n\n3. The global economy is sizzling hot. Metrics from almost every sector are putting up great numbers, unemployment is at all time lows, we are seeing the final exit from the covid economy. The last lagging effect is supply chain issues. Which brings us nicely to my next point.\n\n4. Inflation is actually transitory and not as bad as the numbers suggest. Most of the inflation we’re seeing isn’t because of all the money we printed. Its because of heavy demand coupled with supply side hiccups and hangovers from covid. Its known as cost push inflation. So all the urchins out there trying to peddle some crap about hyperinflation and weimar republic are just abusing your pea brain for clicks. However inflation will most likely remain high for some time while the fed reigns it in. So if inflation persists but the economy is hot…. What should you do with your money?\n\n5. Buy the dip ******. Stop trying to be fancy with grandma’s death money or your shitty kid’s community college fund. I don’t know where you retards are getting some of these awful plays that I see in the loss porn. Maybe TikTok? Treat yourself to some tasty SPY calls, or if you’re feeling frisky, TSLA calls. Everything is pricey right now due to all the volatility, but calls are cheap relatively and in my opinion dirt cheap if you believe that the market is moving up hard. Pretty much everything is going to rip and soon. I’m already up roughly 200k on my positions but they’ve got plenty or room to run. This week was most likely the bottom and beginning of the rip, but you haven’t missed out.\n\nMy final speculation is that not only are we going to see green, but the market will retrace back up to our previous ATHs scarily fast. \n\nTL;DR\nMonday was the bottom, buy the dip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[positions](https://i.imgur.com/mpQcgoe_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)", "id": "ti7acr", "created_utc": 1647730935.0, "score": 99, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|15|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|26|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ti7acr/spy_and_tsla_callapalooza/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ti74az/spy_and_tsla_callapalooza/) \n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ti7acr)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ti7acr)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Forget spy and tsla they're already up, get into AMD $120 weeklies all in", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "This is where I'm thinking of heading", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Based on...?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I actually think he’s got more than us", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "EPS hasn’t been revised for a single company that have completely shut down all operations in Russia.
