For the most part, driving is actually a *simplified* task in that realm. Most automakers (including Tesla!) don't even model the pathing in three dimensions, but rather two dimensions, and the overall *goal* is as simple as applying [A\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to some user-provided input (a destination). The outputs are simple — acceleration and steering only, on an inherently stable agent — no balancing required, no shifting centre of gravity. The inputs are mostly predictable and clear.

Is there a dust pan? What do I do with it? What if the dust pan is missing?\n* Where do I find an appropriate rubbish bin, and how do I know it's important to avoid spilling dust on the way there?

They absolutely nailed it, and if you ignore the problem they present, you're making a critical error in understanding the challenge inherent to getting a robot to perform nuanced actions consistently and reliably.\n\nBuilding a bare simulator — and even a photorealistic one, at that — is not *particularly difficult*. Hell, if you want to be impressed, Waymo is at the point of building photorealistic scenes *entirely in neural networks* ([Block-NeRF](https://waymo.com/research/block-nerf/)) and even *that* doesn't mean much in isolation. It's the *semantics* of how you interact with a scene that is the major challenge, and one that is unsolvable by a simulator itself, alone, in a general manner.\n\nThis statement:\n\n>Once that's done, do the same thing for Starbucks baristas, cashiers, baggers at grocery stores, shelve stockers, you name it.\n\n...to put it delicately, is just a *gobsmacking* understatement of a sentence rolled up into a neat little package. Neural networks and deep learning simply *do not work that way*. They *cannot learn* a task as abstracted as *being a drop-in barista* simply by watching and learning, they need to be specifically trained (ie, adversarially) on *each specific minute sub-task* (ie, picking up a cup) of *each discipline*.\n\nEach one of these subtasks is monumentally complicated, even at its simplest. Articulated joints mean shifting centres of gravity. Tasks and targets exist in three dimensions, and multiple orientations. Goals are dynamic, and sometimes ambiguous or nuanced. Objects presented for manipulation are not guaranteed to be from a finite, defined set, and have a non-finite number of possible interactions.\n\nIn contrast, as I mentioned in another comment, the subtasks involved in basic driving are absolutely minute — it is actually an immensely *simplified task.* Pathing happens in two dimensions, and the overall goal is just shortest-path navigation of a map to some user-provided input (a destination).

I completely disagree with you that it's simple.\n\nThe whole point of machine learning is that you don't need to program any of the complexities that you're taking about.

So first in terms of my trading, I don't count any year before 2020 as \"statistically important\" for my strategy.

So my max drawdown would be -100% hahah.\n\nIn terms of dollars $, from 2016 until 2020ish~ I lost a net $30k to paying my tuition to the market before I learned how to trade and actually succeeded at doing so. People may not think it's a lot but I worked really hard and scraped up all that startup capital as a teenager. So the fact that it was very difficult and took me that long to save up money for trading emboldened and drilled in my head very hard the lessons I learned from losing all my money even though it might be a small amount. It also drilled into my head the fact that I should stop slacking and gambling and putting off all the stuff I was trying to learn how to trade quantatively like a bookmaker.\n\nFrom Autumn 2019 to Spring 2020 (Corona) is where I took everything very seriously, finally put into action all the lessons I learned and all the information/books about trading, math, stats, etc that I learned from and started to make money. I began to run it as a business.\n\nI stuck to 2-3 edges/strategies that work for me and have been doing so ever since. My main edge that's made me the most amount of money has made me about a net 2000%+ since 2020 from mainly being net short vega and net long theta. (Note that sounds like I'm completely selling Options but you can still buy calls/puts and structure a portfolio to have the former Greeks exposure). I'd say 90% of my trades were STO options (sell to Open) and the other 10% was buying premium. \n\nAnd pretty much all the trades I placed since then were combos apart of a larger structure such as credit spreads, debit spreads, iron condors, etc I never just straight up bought/sold options naked unless it was a rare case and dislocation in the market.\n\nTL;DR Total trades since I started: I have no idea but it's in the thousands, I don't look at it. I just hit my edge when it pops up and repeat. From 2020 and onwards my max drawdown from my main strategy/edge is 25%ish. Although there was a couple times where it was -50% due to some pure emotional gambles on shitty meme stocks like AMC/GME but I only lost profits and house money and made it all back. Total return on investment is +2000% (1809% to be exact).

And maybe you don't even want to use the coupon yourself.  You sell it to someone else for $2.  They spend $2 plus $3 to save a bit on the $5.50 burger.   \n\nBut you have risked $1, and gotten back $2.  That's 100% return in less than a year.  \n\nOf course it doesn't always work that way.  You laying out your money up front costs you something.  And maybe the coupon gets less valuable.  Maybe the Big Mac drops to $3.49, cutting the value of your coupon in half.

He'll pay you some money and worst that could happen is you have to sell your shares for 3200 end of the month. \n\nSame goes the other way around with puts.

{"title": "$88k SPY puts yolo", "selftext": "Proof inside, options expire June 2022\n\nhttps://ibb.co/ZWw7gCB\n\nIf you're a bull, tell me why I'm wrong. I'd love to see your side of the market.\n\n*edit* I'll write up a post about why I made this trade in a few hours.\n\n*Here's the write-up*\n\nMost of this is going to be about my macro-economic view of the market. To start off, we have the highest level of margin debt since 1950 (and possibly since the 1929 crash, but I don't have data on that). We have more money (and debt!) in the market than we did in 2000, and than in 08. There's a market frenzy, people who shouldn't be in the market are in the market (our version of 1929 shoe-shine boys, this I have seen with my own eyes), we have insane valuations, and all because people are caught up in \"stocks only go up\".\n\nPeople are borrowing record levels of money to throw into the market. When it starts to come down, people are going to panic and pull out. You're going to see tons of margin calls, forced selling of positions to cover margin, and it's likely to be one of the greatest wealth transfers in our history.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL663067003Q\n\nThe general market is basically just all tech, that's all that is propping it up. Tech is still sitting at insane levels, esp with meme stocks like Tesla. You can try to justify it all you want, and you've heard this before, but there's no logical reason for Tesla to be worth 900B. That's multiples more than Ford, Toyota, Honda, BMW, and GM combined, with less cars sold, and with easily reproducible tech. It doesn't take very long to slap an electric motor and batteries together, look at how fast the other car companies spat out EVs. The stock market is riding on hype. There's nothing about this economy that's better off than how it was pre-covid. We're at record high inflation, overvalued stock and housing markets, a fucked up supply chain 2 years later after the beginning of Covid, and yet the market sits much higher than what was fair value pre-covid.\n\nPeople say covid only caused 30% crash, but I counter that without Jpow and his printer, we would've fallen even more. Since the Covid crash, we've printed an additional 40% of the pre-covid money supply, see 2020 January. \n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WM2NS\n\nThe Fed basically has no credibility. In printing an additional 40% of the pre-covid money supply, the Fed has repeatedly, in 2020, stated that inflation would not be a problem. When inflation started to become a problem and crossed their 2% threshold, they mentioned it was going to be transitory and over with in a couple months. When it turned out inflation was not going to be transitory, they said they were going to start tapering in December and end the taper in June. And just one month into the taper (near December end), the Fed revised their timeline and doubled the speed of their taper so that it would end in March. \n\nI don't believe Jpow is dumb enough to think printing 40% of the exising money supply would not have inflationary effects on the economy. It's my belief that he's appeasing the market as best he can, using the lowest numbers he can get away with, hence \"inflation is transitory\". Current CPI says we're at 7.9%, I believe we're worse than that. For many of you, that CPI doesn't reflect your true cost increases, and that is what matters most. The Fed can spin the basket and calculations and numbers any way they want, but it can't falsify the real cost of inflation eating away at the general public. They've repeatedly gone back on their words, and it's why I don't trust the current rate increase of 0.25% is going to solve anything. Sooner or later, they will have to raise it much higher and much sooner than what they've been feeding the market. And let me remind you of the general rule of thumb that retail price is about 4x the cost of production. In general, if a factory spends an extra $1 in producing, you'll end up paying an extra $4.\n\nI am likely wrong about the time-frame for the crash, but I have no doubt it is going to happen. Within 3 months? Maybe, maybe not. What I am almost sure of is another big spike in volatility within that time frame. This year is the year the Fed decides what they're going to do with the market, and it's likely to continue to be volatile. Are they going to do their job and protect the value of the US dollar, or keep the market inflated? And no, I'm not betting on a nuclear war.\n\n\nI'm not into TA, but I thought some of you would find it interesting.\n\nDaily SPY chart: https://ibb.co/WGYsPpn\n\nDaily SPY June 30 330P: https://ibb.co/B3TnFMD\n\nAlso, I may end up paperhanding.\n\n*edit*\n\nI woke up nervous.
