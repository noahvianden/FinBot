I don’t want to make a prediction exactly as to what’s going to happen in the second half of the year,” she continued. “We’re likely to see another year in which 12-month inflation numbers remain very uncomfortably high.”\n\nThe Treasury secretary’s comments came just hours after the Labor Department published its latest gauge on how fast prices are climbing for American consumers. The report showed that consumer prices rose 7.9% in the 12 months ending in February, the hottest pace of inflation since 1982.\n\nThose remarks also come just months after Yellen told CNBC that she expected inflation to moderate toward the end of 2022 as supply-chain hiccups resolved and met fiery consumer demand for goods. She was reluctant to make a similar forecast on Thursday. Yellen said that Russia’s attack on Ukraine has introduced more uncertainty and driven up the price of several commodities including crude oil and wheat. Crude oil futures leaped to multiyear highs earlier this week as the Kremlin intensified its assault on Kyiv, sending the price of West Texas oil for April delivery to nearly $130 a barrel on Tuesday. It has retreated somewhat since then and was last trading around $105 a barrel on Thursday. But the price is still up about $30 a barrel from three months ago.\n\n“We have seen a very meaningful increase in gas prices, and my guess is that next month we’ll see further evidence of an impact on U.S. inflation of Putin’s war on Ukraine,” Yellen said. “Russia, in addition to exporting oil … Ukraine and Russia are major producers of wheat,” she added. “We’re seeing impacts on food prices, and I think that can have a very severe effect on some very vulnerable emerging market countries.”", "id": "tbfw38", "created_utc": 1646966495.0, "score": 1816, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 659, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Honestly it’s the supply chain issues that have driven up prices.

And three months later there was a massive demand rebound effect, people were brought back and we’ve been swamped with work ever since. Every raw material has gone up in price because we’re running on a deficit of three or more months of not producing. You can’t simply catch up from three months of not producing, especially when people aren’t going back to work. I received a raise because there was a “labor shortage” and my employer was afraid we’d go and get new better paying jobs. Well less people in the workforce drives up wages, but less people also means less productivity but orders are still coming in with precovid demand and then some. So demand is outpacing supply. Now maybe this level of demand is only possible because of cheap money, so saying simply printing money is what caused the inflation we see now leaves a lot to be desired.

{"title": "Goldman cuts U.S. GDP forecast as it says recession odds are as high as 35%", "selftext": "The U.S. stock market put in a resilient performance on Thursday, given the data showing inflation surging to a new 40-year high even before the impact of the recent sanctions on Russia, what appeared to be a pretty dismal result from the Russian-Ukrainian meeting of foreign ministers in Turkey, and a surprisingly hawkish decision by the European Central Bank.\n\nBesides the humanitarian catastrophe, sky-high commodities prices have been the result so far of what has been a two-week invasion. Economists at Goldman Sachs have now cut their forecast for growth for the world’s largest economy in 2022 to 1.75%, from 2% previously and the consensus of 2.75%.\n\nIt’s a pretty straightforward call. “Combining our commodity strategists’ forecasts with estimates of pass-through to consumer prices, we estimate that rising gas and food prices will create an effective 0.7 percent point drag on real disposable personal income in 2022 with larger drags for lower-income households whose spending is typically more sensitive to fluctuations in income,” said the note written by Joseph Briggs. “Although households will likely partially offset this income drag by reducing savings, this hit to income should weigh on spending in 2022.”\n\nBesides commodity prices, the Goldman team also noted that consumer sentiment tends to be affected by geopolitical crises, and already gauges from Morning Consult and Ipsos have dropped. The downgrade to Europe’s growth prospects will hit U.S. exports, and a tightening of financial conditions will also weigh on U.S. growth.\n\nThe Goldman team said, if anything, they may be too positive on the outlook for the U.S. economy. “Even after these downgrades, we still see risks around our growth forecast as skewed to the downside, particularly if sanctions escalate or if oil prices rise even further, for example, to the $175/barrel price target our commodity strategists see as possible if supply losses reach four million barrels a day. Additionally, we have not assumed any growth hit due to metal shortages since—aside from palladium—only a small share of U.S. commodity demand is met by Russian exports,” said Briggs.\n\nRecession risks, they said, are mounting. While they expect further service-sector reopening and spending from excess savings to keep the U.S. economy growing, they said the chances of a recession next year are between 20% and 35%, or roughly as implied by the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-cuts-u-s-gdp-forecast-to-a-full-point-below-consensus-as-it-says-recession-odds-are-as-high-as-35-11646999690?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-cuts-u-s-gdp-forecast-to-a-full-point-below-consensus-as-it-says-recession-odds-are-as-high-as-35-11646999690?mod=home-page)", "id": "tbtzs1", "created_utc": 1647016452.0, "score": 939, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "Had the Fed pulled back accommodation a bit earlier in better times, there would be some room to ease policy when the economy is facing slowing growth. \n\nThey helped save the economy at the outset of Covid, but they didn't \"take profits\"--and now we're here.

I have a routine now. I check my nurse assignment at 7, and I offer them Starbucks. Sometimes I see the familiar faces of the nurses and docs I’ve dealt with on the way, sometimes not. Sometimes I even see some of the other longer term patients here in the PICU in the halls and on the elevators. I don’t really socialize with them at all. Nobody is on this floor of the hospital because their kid is having an easy time. There is another dad I see around constantly since my admission. He is about my age, but he belongs to a local religious group, I think likely mennonite. I’ve seen his son, around the same age as my daughter, as I walk to the elevator from my daughter’s room every day. Around day 6 he walked by our room on the way to the fridge’s and looked in on us in passing. We just gave each other ‘the nod’ that all dads inherently just know.\n\nEvery day I hear alarms in our room. I know which one is for my daughter’s feed line. I know the alarms for her IV lines. I know which ones mean what on her vent. I know the settings of a drager c500 ventilator like I was traveling salesman and it was my only product. Sometimes I hear the alarms in the hall for other rooms. I know their severity based on the urgency of their noise, and how quickly free nurses rush past towards them. The PICU isn’t somewhere everyone leaves. Some kids are only here for a short time. They’re the lucky ones either way. That’s what I tell myself. My wife and I are lucky ones too. Our daughter has a cure to her sickness and she already received it. She is getting stronger every day. Even if she has failed her extubation trial twice, she will be extubated soon enough. I heard another code last night and saw the rush towards the room down the hall. I just went back to sleep.\n\nToday I went and got my coffee and my mennonite friend and his boy were gone. Here yesterday, gone today. I don’t have the heart to ask, but the room was empty. There is a chance he got moved to general pediatrics. I’ll tell myself he did.

With the company on path to 3+ Billion in revenue this year it is way under valued. The Clover Assistant Ai software saving money and lives is what separates it apart from the competition. This should be valued as a tech company which would put the stock somewhere between $15 to $30 based on this years earnings. It is also a prime candidate for a short squeeze which could lead to a much higher price than predicted. The short data does not reflect all the naked shorts and synthetic shares trading hands on dark pools.

{"title": "5 Reasons why RECESSION IS COMING in 2022", "selftext": "Recessions are a natural part of economic growth. The last big one was 14 years ago and it's only a matter of time before the next one comes along. These are 5 indicators of upcoming significant economic downturn in 2022:\n\n**High inflation:**  \nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has today announced the highest inflation in 40 years at 7.9%. Jump does not include recent oil price spike, which would make inflation even higher. As we can see from history, a high rise of inflation is often followed by a recession. Not to mention Europe, where the inflation situation is much worse because of the Russian invasion.\n\n**US Treasury Yield Curve is close to be inverted:**\n\nThe US Treasury Yield Curve is considered as one of best recession indicators. It is close to be inverted, meaning short term interest rates were higher than long term rates. This unusual occurrence has historically been a very reliable indicator of an upcoming recession as it reflects investor sentiment about future economic performance. Since WW2 every yield curve inversion has been followed by a recession in the following 6-18 months, and recessions are naturally correlated with decreased stock market returns.\n\n**Big crude oil price increase:**\n\nIn the past 50 years, every time oil prices, adjusted for inflation, rose 50% above trend, a recession followed. The international gauge for prices climbed well above $110 a barrel this week, crossing that threshold on worries about disruption to Russia’s exports after the country invaded Ukraine.\n\n**Low unemployment rate:**\n\nLow unemployment is like the calm before a storm. The U.S. economy has never managed to sustain a low rate of unemployment without tipping into a recession. Unemployment rates reach their lowest point around 12 months before a recession starts. Unemployment has been low in recent years, currently 3.8%. But it's not actually unemployment that predicts recessions. It's credit growth that is related to unemployment. In short: The lower unemployment, the more credit growth, the more likely a recession will follow.\n\n**Above average growth of the S&P 500 index in recent years:**\n\nEconomic growth always leads to recession. That is how the economy works. We can see this in the S&P 500. For example, before the 2001 recession, the S&P 500 index rose nearly 50% in 2 years. Such a large increases preceded all recessions. We can observe that from March 2020 the scenario repeats itself.\n\nThank you for reading\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts on this topic.\n\nMore here:\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=rocU\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/business/us-inflation-1.6379647\nhttps://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/yield-curve.php\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-04/history-suggests-oil-shock-raises-probability-of-u-s-recession", "id": "tbe1zk", "created_utc": 1646960553.0, "score": 565, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 350, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|6 days ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tbe1zk)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tbe1zk)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "my accounts are already recessed to shit", "score": 661, "replies": [{"body": "For your health!", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "bringo", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "1 of paper = 4 of coin", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "You win every time", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I know.

The late rise in inflation is because of the ENORMOUS amount of money that was printed to keep people alive during the lockdown(s). Now, the market is realizing that there is way too much money in circulation. Plus, there is a major supply chain issue with China still being in major-lockdown, Russia doing an expensive war, people boycotting them, and thus increasing the prices of alternatives. The interest rates were too low during early Covid. They are rising too late. I believe they kept them low during early Covid so as to not bankrupt almost everyone, but now the effect is making a hit, but with a delay.\n\nAll this leads to high inflation and rising interest rates (that are usually an after-effect of an economy that has been booming) except that it has not been caused by a booming economy, but rather by the government paying for everyone's basic needs during the pandemic. I am no economy specialist, but high inflation + high interest rates smells like deep deep shit.

But this week,  bipartisanship has propelled us over the finish line,\" Schumer said on  the Senate floor Thursday evening. \n\nPresident Biden had originally  proposed a 16% increase in domestic spending and just 2% for defense  last spring, but that became unrealistic due to the Democrats' slim  majority and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \n\nMissing from the bill is $15.6 billion to combat the COVID-19  pandemic. House Democrats refused to accept Republican demands that new  funding is paid for with cuts in previously passed pandemic aid. \n\n\"We’ve  got a war going on in Ukraine,\" Pelosi told reporters Wednesday when  explaining the compromise. \"We have important work that we’re doing  here.\"\n\nHouse Democrats plan to hold a vote next week on the $15.6 billion in COVID-19 funds. \n\nCongress was facing a deadline of Friday at midnight to pass the bill or a government shutdown would ensue. \n\n[Source](https://www.foxnews.com/us/senate-sends-massive-1-5-trillion-spending-bill-to-bidens-desk)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all the talk about inflation and interest rates hikes next week.
