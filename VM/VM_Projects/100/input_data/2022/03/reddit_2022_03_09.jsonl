I remember that because it was during my undergrad studies and we spent a lot of time focusing on whether this would motivate Ukraine and other countries to join NATO.  I don't really agree with his interpretation that the West had to \"create\" the narrative that Putin was an aggressor when his actions prove that he was willing to be one.  Also in this interview he fails to mention the threat that Russia potentially poses to other non-NATO members.  He says \"there are people who believe that when he is finished conquering Ukraine, he will turn to the Baltic states. He’s not going to turn to the Baltic states.\"  1) I can't find many experts in the field that truly think that the Baltic states are going to be invaded (at least in the short-term) and 2) in my opinion it's convenient that he doesn't mention countries like Moldova who at least on paper are at much greater risk of being attacked and have been brought up repeatedly by the media and policy experts.

The Foundry platform shows initial signs of being sticky with commercial customers.  [P. 16 of the Q4 2021 report](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20FY%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf) shows how groups of customers who bought Palantir Foundry continued to spend $ on the product going forward.  2019 was the first year that Palantir delivered their modern Foundry platform to customers in the U.S.   The customers who spent 19 million in the first year, spent 69 million the next year and 102 million the year after that.   It'll take a few more years to show how each of the annual cohorts of Foundry subscribers either expand or don't expand their use of the software, but the indications look good so far.  Prior to Foundry, Palantir's commercial products weren't good, and the company actually scrapped its entire previous generation commercial codebase as a result.  \n\nPalantir's revenue for 2021 was just under 1.542 Billion dollars.  If they maintain 30% YoY growth for 2022-2027, they'll be at 9.675 Billion by 2028, but it's possible that the company may be sandbagging guidance.  As the initial hit from stock-based compensation slows, profitability should rise.\n\nThe primary impediment to Palantir's historic revenue growth has been reliance on manpower (Forward Deployed Engineers), but the company has been working on a lot of automation technologies that are only now starting to come into use.  \n\nBasically, I couldn't tell you based on today's numbers alone why I think PLTR will be very valuable in the future.  It was the same way with TSLA 5-10 year ago.  Nobody could have known for sure that Tesla would get the profit margins it does today.  The stuff that Tesla was working on in 2016, aka \"the machine that builds the machines\", were unproven concepts at the time, but built the basis for unprecedented productivity at Fremont, Shanghai, and beyond.\n\nWhat I do know is that Palantir's business is cash flow positive, they have an enormous war chest, and they have the determination to work on hard problems that aren't apparently profitable.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don't get too far into the weeds on numbers.  In my experience, most models beyond 2-3 years out tend to fall apart because there are too many factors that are unknowable. \n\nThe basic questions I ask:  is the business survivable today?  Tesla survived 2014-2019 because its products were amazing and attracted investment dollars (from many secondary offerings of stock).  Palantir is survivable because it is cash flow positive, has no debt, and substantial liquid capital on hand.\n\nIs the business potentially a game-changer?  For Tesla, it was clear to me that they were possibly going to change the entire physical landscape of modern civilization.  Palantir is similar in that I think their software will radically improve the efficiency level of organizations in the U.S. and allied nations. \n\nObviously, there is risk.  Palantir might not achieve the projected levels of growth and the stock valuation could stagnate as a result.  \n\nHowever, the Palantir leadership team, and the kinds of people they hire, are mission driven and highly capable.

{"title": "🎇 The End of Markets: The Fed Cannot Control What Has Already Begun 🎇", "selftext": "Evidence shows that the P.P.T. (U.S. Gov't's Plunge Protection Team)'s trading desk is working behind the scenes to attenuate the rate of decline of global markets.  Even with this support, all markets are plummeting, and commodities markets \\[and nickel, and wheat, etc\\] are being prevented from free trading across droves of brokers and other exchanges.\n\n*When you were a kid, bartering and trading little cards and toys with other kids, what did you do \\[or what would you have done\\] if a desperate kid is coming after your nicest little cards and toys?  Yes.  You quickly* ***retracted*** *your little cards and toys, making a swift pull-back action as you hoard your toys - thereby protecting those assets from them being taken away.  If everybody - if every kid - did this at the same time, this is what is called a liquidity crunch.  No buyers.  Only sellers but nobody to sell to - The End of the Market - where those still trying to sell set their own outlandish prices because there are no market transactions - there is no market data.    Only retraction of the assets that you like.  The few kids who were lucky enough to hold the nicest assets were the most envied.*  ***They just liked the 'stocks'.***\n\nEvidence also reveals that the Federal Reserve has acted \\[albeit indirectly\\] to soften the blow to Citadel Securities (and company) by way of the Federal Reserve Overnight Reverse Repossession Program, which Citadel Securities prominently listed on their annual report.  Yet, the securities held as 'assets' rather than shorts held as 'liabilities' on their annual report have indeed undergone an interruption in the past handful of business days.  Global equities are in a top3-historic downfall (first 44 trading days of 2022 is in-line with Great Depression levels of declines).  Therefore, Citadel Securities is now clearly in the negative (right now as we speak) when you analyze their long holdings and further estimate what their short holdings are (40% meme-stocks).  The good news right now is that the Federal Reserve Overnight Reverse Repossession Program is now in a consistent decline.  Money is being actively pulled back, thereby placing further increased pressure on these funds on top of the already-dangerous market backdrop of declines.\n\nHowever, one thing that a lot of analysts are missing is that Citadel Securities holds both long positions (calls, shares) as well as short positions (puts, short-sales) on the same securities \\[as well as those short positions not disclosed via: ETFs, Swaps, and those unreported \\[naked\\].  So, there is some crossover as Citadel has been trying to abuse the low-borrow-fee \\[0.5% to 1.75%\\] to take advantage of historic inflation \\[8%\\].  The longer this goes on, the more they are \\[printing free money\\] based on the long term inflation-caused arbitrage of their owed-back amount (similar to the benefit of sitting on a long term mortgage while the U.S. dollar dilutes in value).\n\nEssentially, Citadel Securities has attempted to pin meme-stocks, via outsized positions on both sides of the trade, in order to \\[in their last ditch hope\\] benefit from this inflation gain at the same time as writing out-of-the-money calls and puts on these meme-stocks while pinning the price \\[still while egregiously managing order flows between their own off-market exchanges AKA dark pools where they do reroute buy volume, and the lit pools AKA 'the dump' pool AKA NYSE where they do reroute sell volume\\] - all to allow relatively small gains to trickle in so that they can slowly shift their position \\[in the meme-stocks\\] from net short to net long over many years.  It appears, however, that the historic market backdrop right now proves that their long-term hope is untenable: they cannot control the Fed pulling back, just as they cannot control raw company fundamentals, just as they cannot control new SEC and DTCC passages on disclosure of shorts and swaps, and just as they cannot control demand for the meme-stocks while the DOJ and FBI watch hedge funds' every move mid-crack-down on short-selling abuses.  Nothing can stop the unstoppable.\n\n'Long story short' (no pun intended), as Citadel's cash balance becomes dwarfed by their liabilities (shorts) exceeding their assets (longs), and as the Fed pulls back their resources from their most-exploited \"overnight\" repo program, there is the highest likelihood right now of a historic unwinding of leverage across global equities markets.  Standby for historic volatility, and pay attention to meme-stock winners.\n\nI cannot stress this enough:  long-term confidence has gone up with these safe-havens (long term share ownership in the meme-stocks).  Next to gold, these meme-stocks are, in my view, the only lifeboats in this volatile market.  This is clearly not financial advice - *these meme-stocks are simply the nicest little cards and toys out there, and valuable enough to retract, or safely-pull-in-to-own, during this global liquidity crunch that is now coupled with the historic unwinding of global credit.*", "id": "t9vtyw", "created_utc": 1646787893.0, "score": 1918, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 399, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|55|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|14|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkii5c/state_of_affairs_deep_dd_dive_into_gme_and_amc/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qusafe/its_beginning_to_look_a_lot_like_christmoass_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhzzq9/gme_be_prepared_for_an_increase_in_volume_any/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnb0qo/market_crash_of_2021_and_the_greatest_depression/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qva87b/dwac_donald_trumps_truth_social_announcement_is/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t9vtyw)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t9vtyw)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I need to call my mom…", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Can you call mine too, please?

Right back at you :)", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "worker productivity relative to wage has drastically diverge since h 1970 hyper inflation era. Implicitly this mean technology and automation has taken a greater % of the total cost in producing a goods/service relative to labor cost now compare to before.  \nThe wage/goods inflation spiral only holds true in industry where labor still contribute great % of total cost compare to capital equipment. Remember machine can't ask for higher wage while people can.  \n\n\nBut automation has their own sort of disadvantages, high initial capital investment would require high volume production amortize the cost. So for low value service job, the return on investment can be longer than the life time of the business. Which is why you barely see any automation in service industry. Or low volume production industry.  \n\n\nIf labor cost keep going up along with goods price. The return on investment period for automation will get pull forward since the variable cost saving between machine and labor is widen. At some labor wage point, it won't make any sense to hire labor when the automation ROI become so short, that it make back all the initial cost in a month of a labor's wage.  \n\n\nCase in point, in Netherland, where minimum wage is extremely high (kind of mirroring our wage inflation phase), super market just cannot afford to hire cashier and grocery bagger. Most supermarket is self check out with a few security guard at the entrance. While most of their goods and service have slightly higher cost than us. They didn't suffer hyperinflation because of the high labor cost. It merely put certain type of jobs become automate-able from investment ROI point of view. Further widen the labor productivity divergence.   \n\n\nSo while in in the short term, labor get to enjoy the wage inflation. In the long term, it paints a big red target on their back from automation industry. Which will ultimately lead to lower variable unit cost compare to pre-inflated wage cost.   \n\n\nI see more likely scenario is that business will start replacing people with machine if inflation/wage spiral reach a certain price point then never look back even after inflation has went down. I don't see inflation/wage spiral continue unchecked unless the wage/productivity divergence decreases, which is unlikely to happen unless people start to abandon technology and starting doing thing the hard way.  \n\n\nThen there is immigrant migrant worker side of labor supply. Paradoxically even in this labor shortage situation, many of the trump era migrant worker restrictions are still in place. When the labor cost reach a critical point, farmer and business owner will lobby the government to relax immigration rule to increase cheap labor supply. Thus breaking the goods price/wage spiral. Given greater labor supply decrease bargaining power of labor.  \n\n\nLastly there is tariff side of foreign import. Once again, despite shortage of everything like fertilizer, steel or other raw material. Trump era tariff still haven't been roll back, thus adding to the cost of goods. Removing these will have greater effect on inflation reduction and actually increase net system output of goods and service instead of just crushing demand while not increase the net system output. These will act as a cap for goods. Honestly, USA still have sht ton of raw material tariff on metal, lumber and plastic, not to mention farm subsidy to keep land fallow and not farm. You would think policy maker will remove these subsidy and tariff temporarily to alleviate supply issue. But i guess not only the public is drunk on low interest rate, farmers are also drunk on farming subsidy. Domestic raw material producers are drunk on tariff protection.  \n\n\nToday's market is more internationally connected compare to the 70s, on both the goods and labor supply front. The goods price/wage spiral only makes sense if the country is completely isolated from the international market. Since you're at the mercy of domestic labor supply/producer. If immigration policy is relax so labor supply is increases, and tariff is reduce on raw material, then foreign import goods will prevent local producer from rising price in fear of losing market share.  \n\n\nSo I don't see the same positive feed back loop mechanism that lead to the 70s price/wage spiral.

Someone please explain to me why s&p 500 is going up like crazy without any major catalyst? Dead cat bounce?\nI get that almost everyone is feeling their tanks yesterday and the demand today is probably much lower than it was before but could it be that Saudis are also lowering the price to exit the market maybe? \nSorry for the low effort post but I am trying to make sense of everything\n\nEdit: Okey, tomorrow before the market opens we will have the CPI report. Because my knowledge is very limited and I know that there are other supply issues that need to be taken into account (plus many other inflation catalysts such as money supply)  I will just focus on the crude oil prices compared to the increasing CPI. \nIn January the price of oil increased by 15% and we had ATH CPI of 7,5%. In February, oil prices were not surging as much as before and only increased by 6% till the 24th (start of war) after that, the price jumped by 13%, closing a 19.5% increase in just February. \nBecause the crude oil price was rising a lot slower in February you think we should be safe from high CPI reports, however, we mustn't forget that the peak of covid-19 was on the 14th of January and many businesses suffered big losses in that period. I remember that UBER and LYfT employees were complaining a lot back in January that they can't find any customers.

{"title": "Oil Tumbles as U.A.E, Iraq Signal Ability to Raise Output", "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-08/oil-pushes-higher-after-u-s-escalates-russia-sanctions-with-ban\n\nCrude futures sank after U.A.E. and Iraq signalled OPEC may have greater willingness to raise output and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reiterated that he’s prepared to make certain compromises with Russia to end the war.\n\nBrent crude fell as much as 17% and West Texas Intermediate dropped more than 16% after a confluence of headlines sparked a selloff. United Arab Emirates said it will call on its fellow OPEC+ members to boost oil output faster. Iraqi Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismaael meanwhile said at an oil conference in Houston that OPEC+ will aim to make the market balanced. Meanwhile, Zelenskiy reiterated to Germany’s Bild newspaper it was ready to make compromises to end the war. \n\n“The oil market will remain persistently volatile and crude prices will remain supported until a major de-escalation in the war in Ukraine occurs,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\nThe U.S. and U.K. decided Tuesday to halt Russian oil imports after Shell Plc and BP Plc said they are stopping new purchases, but other European nations have been reluctant to commit to similar action. The International Energy Agency said a recently announced stockpile release will amount to almost 63 million barrels of crude and products, but it has done little to cool prices.\n\nAgainst the market’s fast-moving backdrop, OPEC+ is sitting on the sidelines sticking to its 400,000 barrel-a-day production increase. Russia is one of the key leaders of the cartel, along with Saudi Arabia and a major producer of crude and petroleum products such as diesel. \n\nRussia is a major supplier of refined products to Europe and the threat of fuel supplies drying up in the region has sent diesel markets into a frenzy. U.S. distillates inventories fell to the lowest level since November 2014, dropping 5.23 million barrels, according to government data.\n\nOil imports from Russia made up about 3% of all the crude shipments that arrived in the U.S. last year. When other petroleum products are included, such as unfinished fuel oil, Russia accounted for about 8% of oil imports. A planned House vote on the legislation to ban imports was delayed, even as Biden moved ahead with executive action amid growing political pressure to do so.\n\n “The market is awaiting the domino effect of mainland Europe announcing a ban, however, with oil majors announcing that they won’t touch Russian oil, there is already a de-facto ban,”said Keshav Lohiya, founder of consultant Oilytics.\n\nShell and BP said they won’t make any new purchases of Russian oil and gas, but they can’t immediately disentangle themselves from the country in part due to long-term contracts. It’s a dramatic U-turn for Shell, which faced heavy criticism for its purchase of Russian crude last week, and could have a huge impact on the region’s oil refining.", "id": "tafdmf", "created_utc": 1646853805.0, "score": 413, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|3 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tafdmf)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tafdmf)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "i took profits on monday after reading about Carl Icahn selling $OXY.\n\nBuffet bought $OXY that day.\n\none of these old bastards is going senile.", "score": 155, "replies": [{"body": "I bought OXY too.

That on top of climate/energy transition narrative, there has been severe under investment in developing new sources. Companies are focused in reducing debt and capital discipline, even as exploration and development costs are only going higher year by year, because everyone thought and still some extent thinks \"oil is dead.\" Almost all the growth in production last year was due to drilled but uncompleted wells, that were drilled but shut off or never started pumping because then price of oil was too low. They are bringing those wells online faster than they are drilling new wells. It also means each new well is less and less productive because they start with the best ones first. There is no growth in sources outside of US shale and even in the US it is only in the Permian Basin, the other major areas Eagle Ford and Bakken are declining. With supply chain and labor issues hitting oil industry as well, there just isn't the capacity or incentive to rapidly increase production. It is going to take massive amounts of capital just to keep production flat for the next few years - capital that will be extremely limited because of \"ESG.\" And yet because almost all growth in demand comes from developing countries, where the demand is extremely inelastic, high prices are not going to check demand for most of the world.

Many here are likely weary of the constant spreading delusions of a mega-squeeze, getting up the hopes of those who are desperate to get ahead in this rat race of life. I am coming to you with an opportunity to make truly remarkable returns and restore your faith in internet strangers. Behold, System1 (SST).\n\nSystem1 (SST from this point forward) is a deSPAC in whom I am highly confident that we may see the most absurd price action of our times. Since going public on Jan 28, SST share price has increased over 75% in value. This play, to the outsider may seem too late to jump into but I can assure you that it has yet to even get started.\n\nSetup\n\n* Micro Float: SST is a high redemption deSPAC ([98.5% redemption rate](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1805833/000119312522025942/d222372d8k.htm)) with a float of 705k shares. If it seems like I made a typo, I didn't. This alone should get any degenerate's attention in a 100 mile radius, but I'm only just getting started.\n* Short Data: The current Short Interest for SST is a 974k shares ([per Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/sst)). Again, not a typo, the short interest is **138% of the float.** The borrow fee is steadily increasing, currently at **64.14%,** nearly double what it was March 1st, barely over a week ago.\n* Options Chain: Yeah, there are options and guess what? [The chain is JUST as loaded](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SST/options?p=SST). Almost all of the ITM options are from MMs and short sellers delta hedging because they know they are in an extremely dangerous spot. Currently as I'm typing this the stock price is **$17.20** with over **1M** shares claimed by the 3/18 $12.5c, **300K** shares claimed by the 3/18 $15c\\*\\*.\\*\\* April is just as loaded with **1.1M** shares claimed by the $12.5c and **443K** shares claimed by the $15c. Giving us a grand total of ***2,800,000 shares claimed by DEEP ITM OI capturing 403% of all shares available***. Yeah, read that last sentence a second time\n* Price Action: Since I entered in this stock, soon after [Repos39's initial tweet](https://twitter.com/Repos_39/status/1489297463731429377?s=20&t=mj7UCbcsEUOc2s2Q9nahVw), SST price per share has increased 43%. Consistently, this stock KEEPS climbing off of no volume besides that of market makers and shorts exercising deep ITM options and selling them as fast as they can. Seriously, I'd bet there are more 10 minute candles evenly divisible by 100 than there aren't since January 28th. Despite my efforts on Twitter and Reddit, I can't get any momentum building.\n* Catalysts: Recent price action has been heavily driven by the acquisitions of RoadWarrior and Coupon follow (see Fundamentals). Due to the acquisitions, this play itself is the catalyst. MMs and Shorts lose ground every day despite trying every trick in the book to keep price suppressed. The average daily volume (30 days) is a measly **800k** with the highest volume since I entered the play being **2.1M**. Every day with significant volume, another ATH is hit. Imagine if this were to hit front page? Imagine if retail generated a volume of even 10M.\n\nFundamentals\n\nI know some of you all actually care about such things and believe it or not, SST has a [pretty great spreadsheet](https://s27.q4cdn.com/320020032/files/doc_downloads/2022/02/Q3-21-Supplemental-Financial-Information-(1).pdf). Q3 2021 they posted EPS of \\~$2.8. SST has also made some pretty big moves over the past year, [acquiring RoadWarrior](https://ir.system1.com/news/news-details/2022/System1-Completes-Acquisition-of-RoadWarrior/default.aspx), [acquiring CouponFollow](https://ir.system1.com/news/news-details/2022/System1-Completes-Acquisition-of-RoadWarrior/default.aspx), and [winning Microsoft's \"Advertising's Supply Partner of the Year\" Award](https://ir.system1.com/news/news-details/2022/System1-Wins-Microsoft-Advertisings-Supply-Partner-of-the-Year-Award/default.aspx).\n\nDisclaimer: I wouldn't invest in this company until the water settles down, its going to be VERY choppy for the foreseeable future.\n\nRisks\n\n1. Warrant Unlock:\n\nAs with any high redemption deSPAC, once shares (Restricted Stock Units) become unlocked, there is a huge sell off over time and any play on the low float subsequently dies. While SST doesn't have a PIPE like many other deSPACS in the past, once warrants unlock, the play isn't viable anymore. I have spoken to SST Investor Relations department about the current situation regarding the S-1 filing and warrants unlocking and their response was:\n\n*No issues.*\n\n*We need to have an effective S1 on file for you to exercise your warrants on a cash basis through DTC. We are working diligently to do that, but have not provided guidance publicly.  We have to file a 10K and audited financials for S1 and Protected by 3/31, which are all pre-requisites for an effective S-1 if that's helpful.*\n\nMy interpretation here is that they aren't close to having any warrant unlock any time soon. I've been seeing chatter around SPAC communities that the SEC has a severe backlog with paperwork, which if true, plays HEAVILY into our favor.\n\n2. VWAP Clauses:\n\nThe Form-4 of the [CEO](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001805833/e9b7eb3d-57ad-44ee-805e-eedab9b93e0c.pdf) and and [SST subsidiary \"Just Develop It\"](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001805833/8f89646c-23cd-4b20-9018-6155872e0706.pdf) contain clauses that allow their shares (\\~10M total) to vest and become sellable after the VWAP is above $12.50 for any 20 days for 30 consecutive trading days. If my calculations are correct, this puts the date at exactly March 18th as the 20th day. Meaning we have UNTIL OPEX for something to happen. Is it possible that 10 million shares are dumped on the 18th? No. It is possible that enough shares could be sold between the CEO and Just Develop It to kill the play. However, by the 18th this play should have already exploded so I'm not terribly concerned here.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis play has shown incredible resilience despite minimal volume. All indications are showing that MMs and Shorts are absolutely desperate for unlocks. Retail has the power to make a legendary play and completely destroy MMs and Short sellers. I wouldn't be surprised if this thing goes $100+. Seriously.\n\nDisclaimer: I currently own calls in SST with plans to make more purchases in the very near future.\n\nEDIT: Short Interest has been updated to 1.37 MILLION from 974K.

If you're talking about Valhalla, I'm fairly sure they were the ones most pissed off and losing the most unrealized gains when ESSC knifed on 2.0.\n\nAnd if you recognize the risk that a 1.2 million float can easily be snapped up and dumped by any Discord server, aren't you a little worried that the same thing could happen on a 700,000 float? For all you know, any particular server could be holding a play-killing amount of shares that, if dumped, takes the 12.5c out of the money and kills the play during the week of opex.\n\nI won't argue that ESSC was a dogshit company.

It could always turn into another IRNT. But it has many of the problems of other failed plays. The microfloat cuts both ways.
