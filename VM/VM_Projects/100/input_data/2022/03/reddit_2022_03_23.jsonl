Read This First\n\nAs gas prices surge, here are some tips for shopping for electric vehicles.\n\nMarch 23, 2022, 8:48 a.m. ET\nElectric vehicles  at the East Crissy Field charge station in San Francisco earlier this month.\nElectric vehicles at the East Crissy Field charge station in San Francisco earlier this month.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\nThinking more seriously about buying an electric car now that gas prices are revving up? You and everybody else.\n\nE.V.s are hard to find, especially now. The war in Ukraine hasn’t just caused gas prices to soar. It has also disrupted car production in Europe, which sends exports to the United States. And U.S. companies like Ford “basically got blindsided by how many people want to buy their cars” and can’t make E.V.s fast enough, Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports, told me.\n\nWhen my partner and I moved to Los Angeles last year, we knew we would need to shop for a car, and we knew we wanted it to be all-electric.\n\nAfter a lot of research, we managed to test all the cars we wanted to see in a day and drive home that night with our top pick.\n\nHere’s what we learned:\n\nPlan ahead.\n\nElectric cars are in such high demand, few dealers are keeping vehicles around for test drives — we had to drive an hour to find one model. (Oh, and make sure to specify whether you want all-electric, so you aren’t surprised with a hybrid like we were.)\n\nWe made our appointments the day before. On the day of, we called ahead to make sure the car hadn’t been sold. A car being listed on a dealer’s website is no guarantee it’s on the lot.\n\nBe ready to wait, or to pay extra.\n\nWe saw a handful of cars, but we ended up buying the first we test drove, the Kia Niro.\n\nThe markup on the Ford Mustang Mach-E, was an eye-popping $15,000. If we had wanted the Volkswagen ID.4, all we had to do was wait up to six months, our salesman said. The Chevrolet Bolt has been out of production for months, and a lot of the other models were nowhere to be found, either.\n\nBut because we didn’t buy the Niro as soon as we saw it, the salesman was unwilling to knock off a $5,000 price increase over the manufacturer’s suggested retail price. C’est la vie, we thought, and moved forward anyway.\n\nThe E.V. credits are confusing.\n\nWe were dreading redeeming the incentive of up to $7,500 the federal government offers to E.V. buyers. It’s not an instant rebate; you have to wait until tax season.\n\nWe were prepared to finance the purchase, but the dealer talked us into a lease, which included the full government incentive as a rebate, plus a little extra rebate that covered the lease’s administrative fee. Our contract allows us to buy the car for whatever cost remains at any point during lease period, plus a $300 fee, so we’ll do that in a few months to avoid the pricey lease charges. We calculated we may come out a few hundred dollars ahead, but the real value was that we got the credit right away.\n\nThat was a risky move though. Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports, told me there could be a lot of gotchas. “I would definitely not do it without very closely scrutinizing all of the paperwork,” he said.\n\nCalifornia’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Project is confusing, too. First, the program, which offers rebates of $2,000 or more if you buy an all-electric vehicle, is funded and there is no wait list, despite outdated messages on its website.\n\nBut the income cap recently changed: If you make more than $135,000 (or $200,000 filing jointly) you do not qualify — something your dealer may not know or tell you. And the cap on the manufacturer’s suggested retail price changed, too, to no more than $45,000 for sedans and $60,000 for S.U.V.s and trucks. That means newly purchased Teslas are not eligible. And those figures could change again.\n\nThere are other breaks out there, including a $750 credit that California dealers apply at checkout and incentives from electric companies.\n\nA row of 2020 Kona sport-utility vehicles at a Hyundai dealership in Littleton, Colo.David Zalubowski/Associated Press\nForget buying used.\n\nWe looked. There are exceedingly few used electrics unless you want to buy older models with lower ranges.\n\nThe Hyundai Kona we test drove was the cheapest late-model used electric we found — and was listed at more than $40,000, thousands over its original suggested retail price. And used cars aren’t eligible for the federal tax credit.\n\nBe realistic about your savings.\n\nGas isn’t cheap, but neither is electricity.\n\nAt about 18 cents per kilowatt-hour, it will cost about $11.50 to fully charge our car’s 64 kWh battery. That’s a lot better than the $70 it costs to fill our Subaru Forester to get about the same distance. But factoring in the cost of the car, particularly with the markup, we may not really be saving much money over a conventional vehicle.\n\nThat isn’t the only reason to buy electric, which we were reminded of during a particularly smoggy day last week. And we expect to save on maintenance: no oil changes or spark plugs.\n\nCompare the price per mile when using gas and electricity. The Department of Energy also has a good calculator that shows you the lifetime cost of various cars.\n\nAn alternative: Hybrids are in a lot less demand than full electrics. They’re also a lot cheaper; you can save as much as $10,000 to $15,000 at the dealer. Depending on your driving habits, you may still save a lot on gas.\n\nIn the end, we were happy we had been able to make it all happen in just one day. And as we drove the new car into our neighborhood, we were vindicated further: The price of gas on the corner had ticked up another 10 cents.\n\nFor more:\n\nThe average price of a gallon of gas in Los Angeles County has surged past $6, NBC LA reports.\n\nElectric cars for everyone?

{"title": "💲 G M E 💵 Giveth Us More Technicals, they said", "selftext": "# Edit: 10:19am EST - Macro Market Trends\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Macro Market is coming off a short-term \\(and historic last week\\) fibonacci retracement in the upwards direction, on a clear overall macro downtrend - This is also known as a 'bear market rally' - We can see that it was perfectly rejected off of the 50 Day SMA - Signifying that risk-on assets could unfortunately eventually become entrained in an overall bear market downtrend -  G M E  stock has a 'negative beta', meaning it has historically been inverse with the market - so this week and next week we get to observe if that negative beta 'holds up' as it did during the market phenomenon of January 2021, when G M E  'broke' the market](https://preview.redd.it/y8hsox4c65p81.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=371346861ca63588c7d8125b4b42d81dfb17dc2a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# G M E - specific:  Analysis of Net Volume\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Analysis of Net Volume reveals that no notable jump in volume occurred yesterday, even though the share price jumped about 50&#37; - revealing that the stock price is now overly sensitive to even the smallest increases in Volume.  We will revisit this idea later.](https://preview.redd.it/i2he1fqvu2p81.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=7594ebd4b89b195e70e285aa0004defa65d42a3b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Rapidly Ballooning Short-Borrow Fees\n\n[Ortex's tweet](https://twitter.com/ORTEX/status/1506331956379750402?cxt=HHwWhMCs3d67yOcpAAAA) shows that short-sale interest did not decrease in yesterday's 50% price increase.  Instead, it went up to 24% of the free float.  Some would ask how the short increase from 21% to 24% in one business day is possible on an already-capped-out-for-31-days 100% utilization?  I digress - and we already know the answer as to why: they somehow obtained more shares to short with, as unreported, and clearly have not even begun to buy to cover their 'current plus new' short-sales yet.  Either way, these shorting-hedge-funds, nevertheless, are now facing elevated capital requirements.  We know that Ortex shows that max cost to borrow just jumped to over 45%, but let's take a look at Interactive Brokers borrow fee:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[IBKR's short-borrow rate has jumped above 12,000&#37; \\(after hours\\).  This is statistically significant, as you can visually see the range breakout in the chart.  Pre-market and nominal open borrow rate may indeed be sustained above 100&#37;, which implies an immediate, newfound demand for collateral for those with outsized short-borrows](https://preview.redd.it/0azs5d2bu2p81.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c75056fd43e3b460fcd69bac80a9a777bf5ca1c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Half of  G M E  Shares are now 'locked' and not transactable\n\nContrary to what was implied about me [by mainstream media yesterday](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-shares-soar-30-and-take-other-meme-stocks-on-a-ride-after-reddit-poster-touts-shares-at-a-58-2-discount-11647988145), my fundamental technical analysis was not the primary catalyst of the immediate supply-and-demand-based 50% rise in the share price.  I don't suspect that a billionaire, or anyone really, analyzed [my TA yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tjw86u/g_m_e_where_we_stand_with_the_technicals/) and decided, \"Oh, Thump4's TA shows that the stock is heavily discounted, so I must buy it.\"\n\nThe real catalyst seems to have been from raw demand, and most notably by G M E's chairman, who independently bought 100,000 more G M E shares in the morning, making his total ownership of the company 11.9%.  Although we have no data on what insiders are buying until SEC 13F forms are filed, insiders may indeed be continuing to purchase more raw shares since they are now able to 2 days after earnings.  Yet, this brings up an interesting technical topic: insider ownership shares are 'locked,' meaning these shares are *not* freely traded on the market.  Therefore, when we combine G M E's Directly Registered computershare total (10 Million shares registered with the transfer agent - 8.9M as noted from the [F-17 Page (page 10 on the pdf of last week's annual report)](https://investor.gamestop.com/static-files/71e30d98-2102-4bdd-b0b8-eb151e09f803) and 1M+ estimates thereafter) with 23 Million shares institutionally owned ([as shown from fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)) and thereby restricted, then we have a *past-looking sum* of 33 Million.  We can safely assume that 3 Million more shares will be either bought by insiders and/or directly registered with computershare this week (provided the newfound demand for the stock), so we are at 36 Million shares 'locked'.  Since the shares outstanding total is 76.34 Million, then that means that ***47.2% of the tradable shares outstanding are currently 'locked' and not able to be transacted on any market exchange, regardless of whether that market exchange is 'dark' or 'lit'****.*  This inherently implies that any movement in G M E 's  market price is about twice as sensitive to normal economic demand-vs-supply forces than a typical stock, because the float is literally cut in half.\n\nThis leads to a G M E stock price that is now hypersensitive to any demand for the stock, or net volume.  That was shown above, and a two-fold increase in nominal pressure on short-sellers who must fold their poker cards and buy-to-cover their egregious ([and some would say illegal](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-prosecutors-explore-racketeering-charges-short-seller-probe-sources-2022-02-18/)) short-borrow liability position.  Them not doing so would technically lead to a [London-Metal-Exchange-like](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-chinese-nickel-market-mystery-london-metal-exchange-tsinghsan-11647982954) scenario, where in this case the entire global stock market would have to be halted for days for the NSCC to theoretically but illegally allow Citadel Securities, Point72, and other hedge funds to somehow maintain their shorts, similarly to the Chinese nickel short-selling 'tycoon.'  This scenario would permanently destroy faith in American markets for decades.  Them buying to cover now, while the price is still so discounted is safer for them, more responsible for the safety of American markets, and would allow for them to possibly survive this and be able to happily talk about how they got beat (kinda like the Citron Research guy who loved to claim afterward that he was so handsomely defeated by a bunch of reddit 'kids' in this generationally-dynamic market).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Astronautical Fundamentals - the new digital-asset Marketplace\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[G M E 's non-fungible-asset marketplace is now out in 'beta'.  This being released in the evening, could serve as a new catalyst of buying demand for G M E stock, in that it will lead to a new revenue stream on sales of virtual art and gaming skins, worldwide](https://preview.redd.it/8ypcg42693p81.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a05ad79bfa9e563e115ce9bb63d0bfb5c041050)\n\n# TLDR:\n\nHalf of  G M E 's shares are locked and not able to be further transacted.  This has caused an economic shortage of available supply of the stock - and this available supply clearly is rapidly diminishing.  Ortex max cost to borrow just ballooned above 45%, and IBKR's borrow fee rate just ballooned above 12,000%, marking a serious collateral demand and high probability of margin calls of short-sale positions: those short-sellers who now stand to face unlimited economic loss based on the elevated risk they fairly took by shorting this stock.  On Company fundamentals, the[ beta N..F..T.. marketplace website is out](https://beta.nft.gamestop.com/), implying the additional revenue stream from virtual art and gaming skin collectibles [is now live and powered on the backend by loop-ring L2](https://medium.loopring.io/gamestop-nft-marketplace-powered-by-loopring-l2-6cdb9289d937).  Technicals reveal that G M E 's Net Volume, from yesterday's 50% increase in share price, was paltry.  Volume is about 85 Million away from even being classified as a historically-noteworthy day for G M E.\n\nEdit: I am not considering fiddling with my DRS'd shares, nor am I closing [any of my call options positions](https://imgur.com/a/e5upBh9) at any point, even though I am up about 1000% yesterday.  I am upset that my transfer of my tax return into this account did not lead to a successful execution of my order for new call options.  But, I am confident that my new market order for them - yes, I know - for today will be executing at these prices that are clearly so discounted to the real net asset value.  When G M E 's return on their investment is realized, the stock could be worth $1,000.00's of dollars per share, but as a newer, sleeker, Web 3.0, block-chain-backed, highly-sophisticated Amazon-killer.\n\nEdit2 10:19am EST: Macro markets are down, and investors should watch G M E 's notable negative beta to see if that negative beta will 'hold up', or if the stock could become 'entrained' in the macro bear market as noted with the falling dow jones and nasdaq today.  It'll be interesting to observe.  (In January 2021, GameStop's rise did technically 'take down' the market on the beginning of hedge-funds' closing of other long positions that served as liquidity to support their egregious short-borrows - all until the removal of the buy button for  G M E  of course - in violation of securities laws \\[FINRA\\])", "id": "tkp1x9", "created_utc": 1648022922.0, "score": 4746, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 237, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|57|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|16|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkii5c/state_of_affairs_deep_dd_dive_into_gme_and_amc/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qusafe/its_beginning_to_look_a_lot_like_christmoass_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhzzq9/gme_be_prepared_for_an_increase_in_volume_any/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnb0qo/market_crash_of_2021_and_the_greatest_depression/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qva87b/dwac_donald_trumps_truth_social_announcement_is/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tkp1x9)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tkp1x9)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Damn this would be interesting if I knew how to read, but I enjoyed the pics!

While it's being touted as a 30% increase in order to sound more dramatic, it's actually a pretty small increase of 1.5%\n\n\\- Amazon charges anywhere from 8% to 45% depending on the category you're selling in. eBay is around 12% for most categories and even has banded fees based on final sale value (i.e. they take more money the higher the price you sell the item for). By comparison even at 6.5% Etsy fees are super cheap.\n\n\\- If you're selling on Etsy and your profit margin is drastically effected by a 1.5% inrease in seller fees, then you should reevaluate your business - your profit magin is FAR too low. I run a business that turns over $300k and if I lost 1.5% of that during the year I wouldn't even notice it. I increase my prices every year anyway, to cope with the ever-increasing cost of doing business.\n\n\\- A small, vocal portion of the community don't reperesent the entire community. I can't see any evidence of a mass revolt against Etsy. Someone started a petition and it's only got like 5,000 signees (Etsy has 3.14 MILLION active sellers). People will bitch and moan for a bit and then raise their prices slightly to compensate for the fee increase. Inflation is basically causing this across the board anyway so customers will adapt like they do for everything else.\n\n\\- A reddit post with 22k upvotes means nothing.

We're talking about Etsy shops with thousands of sales each.\n\nYes, Etsy has millions of shops but nobody will show you how many of them are pushing dropshipping or cheap crap. The whole idea of Etsy and what this brand has been built on, was handmade. Unique, laborious stuff you could buy only there, as opposed to Amazon or AliExpress.\n\nFast forward to 2022, now we have loads of potential clients asking \"How can I find actual HANDMADE there?\", \"Where is Etsy, why is this all dropshipping?\" On Etsy-themed subreddits, for example. We have aggregators for things that are actually handmade. We have lots of solid craftspeople leaving Etsy as it has lost its appeal. I've read today that people are just clinging to the idea of a company that no longer exists and it strikes me as accurate.\n\nI don't know if they will pivot or what they will do but if nothing changes, clients will one day wake up and see yet another Amazonoid and that will be it. They were coming there to find an alternative to mass-production. It's a very specific group of people, akin to folks that went berserk when last year's Cricut bulshit has materialised.\n\nAnd when it comes to Etsy vs. inflation... One would think that if your fee is x% and the cost of labour, materials, shipping and whatnot goes up steadily, sellers will keep raising their prices (otherwise they'll starve and/or go bankrupt) and your money will go up as well in the process. Etsy's fee is inflation-proof by design. It's not greed-proof though.\n\nAlso, people are not raising their prices by 36% after this change in fees. Their goods have to be 36% more expensive in comparison with their own prices in 2018.\n\nAnother thing is that this fee is not the only fee Etsy charges but other people have explained this already.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

The move will indeed cause the ruble to either stabilize or perhaps even have a somewhat slight gain. This is already evident in todays trading on the market. But, even still we are talking about the whether the ruble is worth 1 penny or just 95% of 1 penny.  And for how long does this provide such stabilization? \n\n2. Considering the German minister came out and said this would be treated as a breach of contract, that can operate as a two-way street.  Let’s say right now Russia has several EU companies locked in to buying their gas for the next 5 years.  If you change this aspect of the contract, what’s to say it doesn’t allow companies to void the length of the contract.  So maybe, they decide to end the contract after one year instead of paying for the full 5 years. \n\n3. Russia already demanded, when the markets were hit by sanctions and the ruble was free falling, that all corporations and entities within Russia trade in 80% of their foreign currency to rubles.  This was to create artificial demand for the ruble to try to stabilize it.  That didn’t work the way Putin or the central bank thought it would.\n\n4. With sanctions in place, it’s hard for Russia to be able to obtain foreign currency which it desperately needs to keep the flow of imports coming from other countries.  If you do this, you’re further depleting your supply of foreign currency which you need to complete those transactions.  I’m not sure what all Russia imports, but I know a large part of it is machinery and equipment needed to keep their oil and gas industry alive.  \n\n5.  The EU already announced a plan to cut Russian gas imports by 2/3rds this year alone, which is no small feat (Qatar just recently signed a deal).  Even if you are successful in making people pay for your gas in your currency, it would be offset by the drop in transactions taking place. \n\n6. And finally, let’s not forget that it can be a double edged sword when you’re relying your entire economy on the success of one major industry.

It ain't much, but it's honest and easy money.\n\n3. It will decrease ruble's volatility. \n\n4. London makes a shit ton of money because the whole world trades commodities and metals there. Russia has it's own commodity exchange. Next possible step can be to link Gas prices to that exchange and get a small piece from London's pie.\n\n5. Russia has positive trade balance. It means it has a lot of money which it doesn't spend. Instead it buys US  and Europe debt. Now it's not possible, so the move seems logical. Who the fuck would put money in a bank, which has robbed you?\n\n6. In the worst case scenario. Europe needs minimum 3 years to build LNG terminals, then in 10 years it can almost completely remove it's dependency from Russia's gas with green energy and LNG. Not much to lose in a long term, so why shouldn't Putin solve short term problems and get some small bonuses and advantages. \n\n\nShort term it's a smart move, let's see how Europe and US will respond.

Thought the same thing you did a few weeks ago, went in on calls. Then came rumors that truth social wasn’t gonna be launching on feb 21, and the stock tanked. Lost 10%-15% of its value in a matter of minutes. I got crushed, and sold for a massive loss. When it actually did roll out, all we saw was a modest gain. Then it plummeted again, and now we’re just seeing another modest rise.\n\nI think you’re being WAY too optimistic about their MAU growth. Obviously fitting an e^x is ridiculous, but I think even that x^2 polynomial is a big overestimate. Yes, truth social has seen impressive growth in its 1st month. But as you yourself said, this is an information **BUBBLE**. Bubbles have a way of popping\n\nLook at comparable platforms like parler and gettr. Certainly not competing with facebook or twitter. Yes, truth social benefits from the trump effect. But let’s be real: how long does trump really have left? Dude’s already pushing 80. Your graph extends out into 2026, but I wouldn’t be surprised if trump dies before 2026. Once trump’s no longer posting, truth social is essentially just another parler/gettr \n\nAnd you know as well as I do that truth social will be fighting an uphill battle against the media. They’ll face FUD (some true, some false) from all sides. I could even see google de-ranking them, stuff like that happens. \n\nSome corps WILL be hesitant to advertise there. Especially when, inevitably, qanon extremists gain traction. “We don’t support the beliefs of this platform, we just wanna advertise there” isn’t bound to go over well with the cancel mob\n\ne^x is a comical overestimate. x^2 is probably an overestimate as well. Again, in your own words, this is a bubble. Getting in on shares and cashing out later for a 10% gain might be a sensible play. But you should stay the *fuck* away from the options chain.

Feel free to criticize the counters, not restate what I've heard 1000 times already.\n\ne\\^x you're probably right (as I said already) and the polynomial is emerging data constantly picking up with new infrastructure as they roll out to more people and open web browser, android, and non-usa (also leave limited access period) but my point was the hard data will build confidence in these models and that will shock the markets imo", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It said “feb 21 expected launch date” on the app store…was apple a “short”? And then it did launch on feb 21! The “fake news” was the delay until end of Q1. Upon hearing that fake news, we saw a legendary drop of 10% within minutes. \n\nWhich again substantiates my main point: this stock is volatile as hell. Mere rumors can wipe your position out, especially if you’re on the options chain. And with a controversial stock like this, again, rumors will be flying left and right. \n\nI did criticize those counters. Much of your post is well-researched, but many of those “FUD counters” are not. You just kinda said questionable things without much backing\n\n> “Corps will just use the excuse of ‘we don’t support this platforms beliefs’, then proceed to advertise away”\n\nAgain, that’s just not how it works in the modern age. I think we can both agree the cancel mob is ruthless, right? Any corp who advertises where qanon is vocal risks bad press. That’s a deterrent for advertising on truth social\n\nThe very fact that you had an entire section dedicated to “FUD counters” means you know…*there will be a LOT of FUD going forward*.   That FUD could dramatically affect the stock price. I again refer to the fake news “end of Q1” announcement; caused some of the most legendary red candles I’ve ever seen. And this is already priced into the options chain. 110% implied vol\n\nAnd to reiterate, donny doesn’t have much time left. Trump’s age: 75. Average US male life expectancy: 76.
