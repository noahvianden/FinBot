My guess—it’s a guess— is at worst we’re looking at a dotcom style crash, which would put the bottom at around 135. Bad! That would mean another 30-40% drop from here. \n\nAgain looking at the dotcom crash, if you bought SPY at the absolute peak in 2000–and never bought again—you’d be even again 7 years later, just in time for the Great Financial Crisis. \n\nFour years after that, in 2012, you’d be back to even again—But if you held on after that, you’d be up 185%, plus whatever dividends you got. \n\nMy point? Investing once, at the absolute worst time in 2000, you’d be up nearly 3x your money after 22 years. Again, this is 3x your money for doing nothing. If you want to include inflation, you’ve still more than doubled your money, investing at the worst time and doing nothing. \n\nSo how does this help you? Well, simply, if your goal is long term, you don’t have to worry so much. Because you’re not going to invest just once and then never again. And because you’re investing again and again over time, you don’t have to worry that every time you invest will be the worst time. Some of those times you invest will be better than others, but over the decades—as history shows—the good times should outnumber the bad. \n\nIf your time horizon is shorter, you should consider the dotcom crash scenario, and think about how much it might hurt to be down another 40% and possibly not recover it for several years. If you have something you want to spend big on in the next year, two years, you want to be cautious in any kind of market, bull or bear. \n\nThe caveat here is I’m talking about broad index funds. Stocks are a different story. At the bottom of the dotcom crash and on the way down, and at the bottom of the GFC and on the way down, plenty of individual companies failed, went bankrupt, or limped along for years never to recover their former glory. This is why now, in what looks like the beginning of a bear market that could last a while, you see more speculative stocks and stocks of companies that don’t make a profit or have strong cash flows selling off. Investors are ditching these stocks and moving safer places because they can’t with high confidence bet that these companies will survive a downdraft in the economy. I would be careful about pouring money into any stock where there aren’t really great cash flows. If your ev stock hasn’t sold a single vehicle for example... may not be a great bet to reach lofty valuations again, even if it survives. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe you’re investing in the next amazon. It’s a crapshoot. \n\n**Bottom line, for a long term investor, the best tip is to keep investing.

Truth is, no one knows the future and investing is never guaranteed to yield any particular return, and indeed can create a net loss. The S&P 500 return for the past 40 years has been significantly inflated by the Federal Reserve constantly lowering interest rates and doing QE. Businesses still did well regardless but you have to account for that. \n\nAnd perhaps the most important thing for any investor to consider is whether or not they have a source of income that will remain stable even during a significant economic downturn, as that's the main way you're going to get good returns on your index fund investing. Everyone is eager to jump in during a bull market when jobs are plentiful and it's easy to make money. But during a crisis such as 2008 when stocks become dirt cheap, will you still have a steady paycheck coming in? Because many people will not, and that's a primary reason why most investors do poorly. They buy high and sell low. \n\nSo in summary I would say that index investing is still the best strategy for the average person but only if they are able and disciplined enough to buy when it's low.

Companies really didn’t have paths to monetize, and some changed their name to “___ Technology” and their share price would go up 2-5x. It made no sense… the internet was so nascent that I really do stress these companies didn’t have paths to monetize.\n\nOk, so in fairness, in some ways the fundamentals of this recent sell-off overlap *at least a little bit*. Certain companies (let’s take EVs as an example, sup Rivian, Lucid) rose to crazy levels only justifiable if these companies had 4-5 years of solid growth and execution already under their belt.  Except these companies hadn’t even sold a car… and there are other industries where this dynamic was repeated, again where companies got credit as if they were already 3-5 years ahead of where they were today. \n\nNow bake in that the cost of debt is theoretically more than 2 years ago (any more recent DCF model uses a higher discount rate) and it only made sense for these companies to sell off tremendously and come back down to earth and actually a fair valuation.\n\nBut the difference? The world is way “smarter” than it was 25 years ago.  While these companies were overvalued, they still have viable paths to execute and at this stage of the internet it’s hard to see a situation where an absurd number of companies just go belly up.\n\nI do think in 2-5 years there will be some losers, and yeah some of these companies will be bankrupt because they clearly misrepresented their growth to investors.  Thank SPACs for that, which allowed a disproportionate amount of shit companies to go public.\n\nBut outside of those, I will buy into steady growing companies that trade at like 2-4x their current annual revenue guidance all day. It’s very easy for “growing” companies to flip the switch and start aiming to become profitable, if that’s what Wall Street really wants to see. Part of the problem was Wall Street conditioned early stage companies to prioritize growth at any cost and they would be rewarded, but now the narrative has shifted slightly to “we want companies that are actually profitable”… a lot can happen in a few years, but we will see.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "thx for such a quality advice!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is a really good explanation of the r/bogleheads philosophy", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "DCA", "score": 22, "replies": []}, {"body": "If you're a long term investor, then just do what you've been doing.

Given enough years, you have an *outstandingly* good chance to do just that. The trick is to adjust your idea of how long that takes.\n\nThe stock market slowly rises over the long term - something like 8% per year if you reinvest your dividends. So here's a little math exercise. Take 1.08 and multiply it by 1.08. That represents two years of gains. Keep multiplying by 1.08 and you see that it doubles in 9 years. In 18 years it doubles twice. 27 years, three times, 36 years four times etc.\n\nHere's the thing though : three doubles is not 2+2+2; it's 2x2x2. So three doubles multiplies your money by 8. Four doubles multiplies your money by 16. If you are young enough that you can invest for 45 years, you will multiply your money by 32 times!\n\nYou don't have to hit home runs to make a lot of money in the stock market.

As FANGs and Semis reached their high point in 2021 I began selling FANGs and Semiconductors and moving into Financials and Energy.

It's basically a game of musical chair to see who is left standing when the music stops.\n\nIt's hard mentally to not FOMO when it continues for 2+ years to not buy in, since there's nothing else to invest in because interest rates are at zero, and cash is basically being eaten away by inflation.\n\nThere is something I can say though, is that I would have never touch certain stocks when their P/E is sky high or market cap is large but continues to make losses every year, and be wary of companies that issue so much stock-based compensation that the GAAP and non-GAAP valuations are so far apart.\n\nYou entered at the wrong time. Accept the loss and move on. You don't have to sell on the ones you think will do alright, but don't expect a quick recovery. The best way to move forward is to continue to invest. How you want to do that is up to you -- you can wait until the rate hikes are ongoing, or just invest every time you get paid, and you can pick individual stocks if you think the companies are good or simply buy index funds to avoid picking stocks.\n\nIndividual stocks are more volatile and you should focus on the ones you are familiar with. In your list, the companies you invest in spans media, home improvement, consumer finance, online gambling, internet technology, healthcare and so forth. I can barely understand one segment of technology which is semiconductors that I focused on, specifically AMD, Intel and Nvidia.\n\nI doubt that you can actually understand all those industry that you're invested in. Thinking you understand just because you've read news releases and you've read the companies' financials is dicey at best. You also have to look into competitors and the general marketplace etc, as well as leadership, but even then it is still only an approximate at best because you are many miles removed from the companies.\n\nEdit: Also valuations are important. When PE is sky high, a lot of the future earnings expected is already account for. So when a hyped company merely meets expectations of great growth, instead of accelerating even more, their stock price falls by 10+%, as has recently happened with a lot of the high flying stocks.\n\nMy recommendation is to stay involved. Continue to follow the companies you've already invested in and see how they develop. Continue to invest. Invest in index funds for now if you are a bit wary of picking individual stocks. Then later, a smaller portion of the money can be used to invest in individual stocks that you feel strongly about.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Do your DD, and if you consider it a good bet, put your remainig funds into ticker UAN.\n\nFor starting your research look up Publius on Seeking Alpha.\n\nIf it works out, you may recover all your funds, and more......\n\nThere is also a recent aricle on WSB you could look up.....\n\nStill very under the radar......", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Keep buying.

You can expand on data analytics, watch trends, look at statistics, and compare stocks against the market.  For example, i like to weight stocks against an index that's representative of the market.  The whole market pulses up and down, so it's rough to watch just one stock and know if it was ok or natural for it to go down.  If the index went down but the stock went down less, it's actually doing better than the broad market.  You can also look at statistics like standard deviations.  Is the stock change natural?  Or is the jump or drop far outside of the norm? Then it's important to check why.\n\nStocks almost always follow the greater average.

This is different from how the market values a company.  When there is a disconnect between your valuation and the markets valuation, this is when you should buy a stock.  \n\nMy recommendation is either to stick to ETFs (which is a fine option) or spend some time (at least several hours) learning to create Discounted Cash Flow models.  Once you do that, you can value companies and decide if they're good investments.  A company can be quickly evaluated in 15 minutes and if you see a promising option, spend about 10 hours researching the company to ensure you've done your due diligence.

Having Apple as a competitor also worries me and I suspect they'll keep squeezing market share from SPOT over time.\n\nAnother problem I have is that I don't know how much money there is to be made in music streaming. When it's possible to listen to music for free on YouTube what's the most someone would pay for a service like Spotify? Could Spotify realistically raise prices significantly without people just listening to music elsewhere for free or downloading their music illegally? And even if they could raise prices they have so much competition providing basically exactly the same service why would someone pay more for Spotify? If Spotify ever got much more expensive I know I'd switch to a cheaper service. As much as I like my playlists and the UI, it's not worth a huge amount to me and would be worth even less to new users.\n\nIf they can't increase prices the only way they can grow is by growing their userbase which is already pretty saturated, and as I mentioned, I worry Apple will continue to eat into their market share long-term. I like and use the service, I just don't see a strong bull case for the company. If I were going to buy it I would like to see a large margin of safety which SPOT doesn't have.

If it is, then maybe they are waiting to train it to read no turn on red signs. This would eliminate maybe 5%-10% of my disengagements. \n\nAnother is speed bumps. 17 mph is way too fast. Slow that sucker down more. Such an easy fix. That is another 5% of my disengagements.\n\nAnother is not always aiming for the left-most or right-most lanes when doing left or righthand turns, respectively. This is a weird one that I think is more path planning than map data, but they go hand in hand. That is another 5%-10% of my disengagements. \n\nA big one is staying close to the center lane when on streets that have bad lane lines. I understand this involves the vision neural nets,  but honestly when looking at the visualizer, it often has the road visualized correctly, and just needs to hold a lane rather than swerving around like it does. This is probably 20% of my disengagements, since Chicago has absolutely shit lane lines.\n\nOf course, there all the interventions I do with the accelerator. I get the feeling that FSD has been made a bit slower or more cautious as they roll it out to more people. I am using the accelerator often to go through stop signs faster ( it can be done very efficiently, even without rolling, in fact a computer should be able to come to a complete stop for a fraction of a second, then accelerating through at a brisk pace).

I really do want to say it's a great film, but it's really fucking goddamn long and there is too much tendency on the DC side to try and cram 2 movie's worth of content into 1. At least they gave Matt Reeves the chance to make it long enough to tell it's entire story cohesively, which is a luxury WB never afforded to Zack Snyder.\n\nThe film itself is quite unique in that it's basically not a superhero film at all. There's no reason to retread old ground already covered by Christopher Nolan, and so this film really goes back to Batman's roots as a guy who has no super powers but is really fit and really well trained and really smart and figures shit out. This is The Batman before he was The Goddamn Batman. It's also a refreshingly gritty and bleak take on a comic book superhero after endless identical glossy formulaic colorful generic boring Marvel films for the past what feels like 496 years.\n\nThe Batman spends the majority of the film **not** fighting, driving, chasing, or being chased. In fact, most of the film unfolds like a neo-noir detective thriller, with deliberate pacing, lots of shadowy glamour shots, and The Batman investigating things and uncovering clues and solving puzzles alongside an intense and serious incarnation of Commissioner Gordon. The movie's atmospheric, it's got a pounding and dynamic soundtrack contributed by Michael Giacchino who frequently collaborates with Matt Reeves, the new Gotham City looks amazing, and it's obviously intended to establish a new continuity that already looks really promising.\n\nLeading glowy vampire Robert Pattinson is an unexpected brilliant casting choice who puts together a wonderfully angry and moody performance as a younger Bruce Wayne still early in his career as The Batman. The supporting cast were all outstanding, including Andy \"Gollum\" Serkis as a great new Alfred and Jeffrey Wright as the new more diverse Commissioner Gordon but he does just a fantastic job in this film. Zoe Kravitz was somewhat disposable as Selina Kyle, unfortunately the focus of the movie was clearly on The Batman and she felt like an afterthought through most of the film. The villains were all great, especially >!The Riddler!< who was updated into a modern social media cult leader who used his Twitch streams to recruit his radical followers for his master plan.\n\nI really liked this film. It was excessively long, and it wasted a lot of time on the obligatory Batman-Catwoman love story that kinda went nowhere and then just suddenly ended.
