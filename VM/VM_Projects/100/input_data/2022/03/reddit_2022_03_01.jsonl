The market has a fractal pattern that works on a monthly cadence. It doesn't always happen exactly the same, but it will follow a general pattern because of the fact that algorithms/traders trade against these patterns.\n\nWhat you're seeing this year is a pretty normal looking head and shoulders top pattern supported by a Bearish wedge. That pattern has already played out to the normal extent of double the trough.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's over. There are a series of factors driving the current downtrend, including:\n\n* Fed uncertainty.\n* Inflation uncertainty.\n* Rising bond yields (people debate this by trying to pattern match and come to one conclusion or another, but they're missing that the pattern is around exhausting demand for bonds at certain interest rates... this will NEVER be a 1:1 match, it will always be around gapping up as bond yields find new highs and down as they drop as bond interest rises.)\n* Geopolitical news (short moves, mostly)\n* Institutional buy/sell patterns based around repositioning.\n\nPick your poison here. I'm not here to argue which are the more dominating factors, but these are all negative factors freaking people out.\n\nOne mistake people make is assuming that there's this big, grand pattern in the market playing out over decades, which is the root of application of the larger Elliott Wave pattern to the market, but the problem when you go back to back-test this is that while you definitely see patterns over years, anything larger tends to be subject to chart-reading biases. People contort charts to make them fit patterns they expect and this becomes problematic.\n\nUltimately the market moves based on macro factors that are based around liquidity and macroeconomic growth patterns, and those change pretty much every decade... so if you're expecting a pattern from the 1980s to play out, there's a problem with that method. That pattern was exhausted. Over the past years I've seen really egregious examples of that where people draw fuckin' trendlines and patterns going back to the 1950s and were really surprised when they didn't realize.\n\nWhat separates corrections from crashes is liquidity crises and divergence events that create them. 2000 was a bubble collapse as capital that came into the market had to leave because of lack of confidence in the market combined with increased consumer costs without prior accommodative monetary supply policy.  2008 was a financial system meltdown. 2020 was liquidity collapse around the idea that the pandemic would kill economic rotation.\n\nThe Fed upping rates won't actually significantly reduce the addressable capital in the market. People are over-estimating the liquid effects of this Fed meeting. So you're missing the primary catalyst for an actual crash.\n\nHowever, we can't write off the psychological impact of what's happening now, so can I write off a short panic crash? No... but people thinking there's suddenly going to be a big reduction in capital liquidity in this country on March 16th need to seriously learn about how the financial system works because most of the capital the Fed put in the system is there to stay for a LONG time and it will, by design, slowly leak out of the bank reserve system in the form of expanding debt offerings.\n\nBut can people panic crash the market? Maybe.\n\nThe chart catalyst you're looking for isn't a matching head and shoulders fractal top pattern (which is all that's really in the OP's image) but rather a significant break down below the 200 day SMMA.\n\nIf SPY drops below $410, that'd be a break of the 200 day SMMA and then you have to start considering a potential psychological event. Below that you have support at 390 and 370... if you start getting in that territory now you have a potential for a technical and emotional crash condition... but in the backtest it shows you can trade a support level or so below the 200 day SMMA before this realizes.
