Options are super hard to trade and make consistent profits. \n\nNo joke, it's much easier to do what everyone suggests and move on to simple DCA into SPY.\n\n================\n\nBut if you still really want to go down that route, here are a few of my recommendations:\n\n1) Use a tiny size of your account for Options No more than 5 to 10% for beginners total.\n\n2) Until you are very comfortable and have been consistently not losing money, stick to spreads to reduce costs/losses to time decay.\n\n3) Do not get greedy, take profits up 40, Hell even 20% in some cases. When in doubt, close it out. Especially if you can walk away green.\n\n4) Position size. Remember that 5 to 10 percent? Divide that up by another 5 to 10. Until you are really comfortable and making consistsnt profits, Stick to 1 to 2 option plays per week max.\n\n5) Before you open a position, consider the market conditions. Is it super volatile with uncertainty? Is it super stable? How fair of a price are you paying for an option play?\n\nConsider selling Options during high IV.\nConsider buying when low IV.\n\nSince it's hard to get Options price fairly, spreads can again, help mitigate this.\n\n6) Have an exit plan, whether in losses or gains. Ask yourself why you are playing this and if you actually have a goof enough reason to enter. Afterwards pretend it's a million dollar position. Would it still be acceptable? If yes, Consider going ahead.\n\n7) Above all protect your precious capital and take breaks when things haven't been working for a bit.\n\n8) In the end, don't forget to breath, it's just money after all, not your health, or your life.\n\n9) Make sure to not skip the exit plan and understand what the risks are for holding till expiration.\n\n10) If all else fails, consider taking an option trade a day on a PLAY money account. Keep in mind that the options prices that fill, will likely not ever be as lucrative in the real world. However, this does not invalidate the experience that one gains here.\n\n11) Bonus, Don't be afraid to admit you are wrong or know much less than you think. The quicker one sets their ego aside, the less likely they are to hurt their exchange account over silly moves that \"literally can't go tits up.\" Never stop reading/watching helpful videos and practicing your trade.

A 7% discount (approx 0.12 delta) would be a strike of 420.  Looking out two weeks to Apr 8 you would receive approx $177.   \n\nNow **$177** ***premium*** **/ $42,000** ***money held as collateral for assignment*** **= 0.41%**  Repeat it every **two weeks** and you get:  **0.41% x 26** ***trades*** **= 10.6%** for the year.\n\nIf you get assigned you simply sell the call for whatever amount you like above the strike you were assigned on.   I usually aim for about a 3% capital profit.

{"title": "HMHC - Do NOT Tender your shares and buy OTM calls", "selftext": "Here‚Äôs the greatest play you‚Äôre going to find this morning. HMHC management has made a shady deal and agreed to be acquired by Veritas for $21 a share via a tender offer.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. The shareholders must decide if they will tender their shares or not on April 1st. They require 50%\\~ to tender for the merger to complete. Only 50% must not tender and they will not be acquired for $21.\n\nNow here‚Äôs where it gets juicy and 100 bagger opportunity arises. Several of their larger institutional share holders have wrote letters saying they will not be tendering their shares as this is undervaluing the company. Several large shareholders believe the fair acquisition price is $28+‚Ä¶ (see sources below)\n\nAssuming only 1/2 shares aren‚Äôt tendered then that will force Veritas to either increase their cash offer to get a deal done or back out. However, either should boost the share price as this proves to the market $21 is undervalued.\n\nTo make a great play I will be buying shares and will not tender. But if 51% are tendered then I make my $.10 a share in a month and go about my day. BUT the HUGEEEE upside is in the OTM call options. I am buying May calls with a strike at $22.50. These can be picked up for $.05-$.10‚Ä¶ IF shares aren‚Äôt tendered and Veritas ups the offer to $24+ then you‚Äôre looking at massive returns. Retirement type returns within a month so strap in.\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220306005045/en/Significant-Shareholder-Prasad-Phatak-Sends-Letter-to-Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt-Company-Board-of-Directors-Opposing-Veritas-Capital-Transaction](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220306005045/en/Significant-Shareholder-Prasad-Phatak-Sends-Letter-to-Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt-Company-Board-of-Directors-Opposing-Veritas-Capital-Transaction)\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220309005441/en/Engine-Capital-Sends-Letter-to-the-Board-of-Directors-of-Houghton-Mifflin-Regarding-its-Intention-to-Not-Tender-its-Shares-into-the-Veritas-Offer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220309005441/en/Engine-Capital-Sends-Letter-to-the-Board-of-Directors-of-Houghton-Mifflin-Regarding-its-Intention-to-Not-Tender-its-Shares-into-the-Veritas-Offer)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2394232/0/en/Laughing-Water-Capital-Issues-Public-Letter-to-Board-and-Employees-of-Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/01/2394232/0/en/Laughing-Water-Capital-Issues-Public-Letter-to-Board-and-Employees-of-Houghton-Mifflin-Harcourt.html)\n\nTLDR; buy shares and don‚Äôt tender and buy Short term OTM calls in hopes the offer gets bumped to get the deal done for massive returns.", "id": "tk3prl", "created_utc": 1647957762.0, "score": 174, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 234, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|15|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|35|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pwirgo/baba_mondaytuesdays_trade/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pszuav/ajrd_aerojet_cash_our_arbitrage/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pul2zl/voyager_digital_stock_valuation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ptfcf1/voyager_digital_vygvf_the_best_vd_youll_get_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r7pmpu/western_union_call_options/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pwizrr/baba_mondaytuesdays_trade_for_nonjabronis_leaps/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tk3prl)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tk3prl)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 126, "replies": [{"body": "Haha well with several major shareholders issuing written public opinions I think there‚Äôs a good shot 1/2 don‚Äôt tender and that Veritas will up the offer to close the deal.\n\nIf so then it‚Äôs easily a 10 bagger if they up it like 10%‚Ä¶ but if they up it like 20-30% then we are rich.", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Or.....

Yes, a lot of farmers buy fuel by the semi-load and have storage for basically a years supply.  The problem is that there hasn't been a clear bottom at which to buy.  As a beef producer, we've been hearing \"oh, once the new crop of corn and soy are in, the price is going to go down.   Our cost all this year has been 150% or more of what it had been the year before and I honestly didn't see how it could get worse, but it is getting worse.   My point is, at some point the cost of the inputs due to scarcity will drain all profit out of an even astronomical grain price.  Last year one of my suppliers tried to stack the deck in his favor.  He bought horribly expensive (market price) fertilizer for his fields.  Everything was planted.  Then the rains stopped a month earlier than they should have.  So he turned on his irrigation pumps.  Then we ended up with a hot spring like we have never seen.  The cool season grasses that are a staple in this area basically shut down over 90 degrees.  Despite doing everything correctly, he ended up with a crop yield about 50% of an average year with fixed costs (not based on yield) of almost 140%.  The only thing he saved money on was baler-twine because he had half the bales.   My whole point in this is that a farmer knows that sometimes it's better to mitigate your risk.

Wouldn't most farmers work this into a crop rotation (obviously not being brought to market instantly but depending on if you plant cuts instead of from seed im sure there are ways to expedite bringing it to market which would obviously add to overhead though so maybe that would be an issue with it being worth doing?)

In our state, if you want to move meat in commerce it needs to be slaughtered and processed under USDA inspection.   Access to nspection is not really a barrier, as many mom and pop shops can meet the standards and come under inspection.  But those places are slaughtering 10-20 head per day as opposed to a large commercial plant that can do 1000 head in one shift and can run 2 or 3 shifts if they need to meet demand.   Once the animals are slaughtered, you then have to have infrastructure to market the product.  That sounds simple, but while it's easy to move steaks, you also have to sell the short ribs, and all the trim that's used for ground beef, offal or that stuff just piles up in the freezer.  I know of one midsized independent plant that slaughtered 6 days a week to fill a contract for certain cuts for a large retailer that sounds similar to \"tall-fart\".

However in killing and processing enough cattle to meet that contract, they ended up with over a million pounds of product in the freezer for which they didn't have an immediate buyer.

Yes meat will go up in price because herds will be reduced due to high cost of grain, which will do what? Lower grain prices due to reduced demand. The last big grain price run up was 2011/12 (drought) and it hurt everybody. Fertilizer, seed, rent everything shot up because  that‚Äôs what suppliers do when grain price goes up. Livestock margins were hammered which shrunk the herds which reduced grain demand which accelerated the price decline in the following years which put cash grain farmers in a bind because the costs did not go down at the same rate. \n\nThe market corrects these things.

I now plan on holding my position until expiration and/or until a deal is formally announced and the price converges toward the buyout value.\n\n# KEY POINTS\n\n* SIMO is THE BEST way to play secular memory demand\n* Under the radar stock in the memory supply chain, a derivative play with massive upside\n* MU makes up 25% of revenues, followed by other major memory & semi companies; recovery = SIMO alchemy\n* Cheap Calls = Massive Upside on semis price recovery\n* Consensus Price Target: $110 (>50% Upside)\n\nSections\n\n1. Company Description\n2. Thesis\n3. Current Valuation & Financials\n4. Technicals & Market Mechanics\n5. Upcoming Catalysts\n6. How to Play\n7. Appendix\n\n# Company Description\n\nSilicon Motion is the leading maker of controllers in the memory, storage markets, and specialty RF. Their chips power data centers, mobile devices, SSDs, autos, and multimedia hardware (video walls, tablet tech, medical equipment, etc). Their customers are key members of the supply chain (i.e. Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, etc) and supply some web service providers directly (I.e. Alibaba). All of their customers are ramping production, further accelerating demand for SIMO‚Äôs products. Micron accounts for 25% of SIMO's revenues.\n\n# Thesis\n\nSIMO is significantly undervalued at current levels, getting caught in the indiscriminate market-wide selling over Q1 that has brought semis in to bottom barrel valuations.\n\nThis has created an AMAZING opportunity to not only double dip, but also enjoy even stronger tailwinds from even better fundamentals than we had in Q4!\n\nI want to expedite the delivery of this DD, and I'll be beefing this section up throughout the day. For now, let me reiterate my Q4 investment thesis:\n\nThis is a derivative play on memory (Tip: supply chain stocks always have more leverage) and a superior play for cyclical upturns (we are now entering).\n\nWhat do I mean by derivative play? Imagine Micron is a SpaceX rocket taking off. Close your eyes and feel the experience of starting the boosters, lifting off, and gradually accelerating to space. Now imagine SIMO is a monkey strapped into a shopping cart connected to that rocket by a long chain that suddenly goes from 0 to 99,999mph. Get it? Got it? Good.\n\nMore importantly/hilariously, management has continued to keep racking up sales from strong demand all year which has proved resilient despite memory market softness and all while gaining new production capacity. Somehow, analyst estimates reflect neither of these factors. Mgmt guided $1.5B in backlog being pushed into 2022, yet according to analysts $1.5B in future sales is only worth $1B in sales on their estimates. Also worth considering, if this year was a FUD cyclical trough, and next year is a reacceleration period into a decade of increasing memory demand, then 2021‚Äôs $1B in sales probably wasn't \"peak\", was it? I'm no rocket scientist, but I'd say no.\n\nIn other words, EPS estimates and valuation expansion are heading SIGNIFICANTLY higher.\n\nLuckily, Needham modeled this for us. With shares at their target P/E of 16x with sales of $1.2bil has their target at $150. Sales of $1.5bil ups their target to $185.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5x7v56ta0kp81.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ea5b727421a32b75ae7f4916736f48b0aee9460\n\nBottom line: SIMO is a monkey in a shopping cart about to be jerked up significantly by the recovering memory cycle during another decade of secular, exponential growth in memory needs from datacenters, EVs, consumer tech, mobile, and literally every facet of human life. This is a real stock that attracts real hedge funds. Get in early or forever hold your peace.\n\nAlso, at an almost 3% fwd div yield vs the S&P's 1.3%, you and every dividend-loving Boomer PM can even get paid to hold shares <3\n\nMy post from November 2021: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle\\_me\\_simo\\_mega\\_memory\\_upside\\_v2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r25o8a/tickle_me_simo_mega_memory_upside_v2/)\n\n# Current Valuation & Financials\n\nFwd P/E '22: 8.66x\n\nEarnings Growth Est: +41% '22\n\n* Remember last quarter when Fwd P/E was 11.6x before its big run? Well now it's cheaper thanks to the market-wide selloff. Thanks to fundamentals continually above analysts' admittedly conservative estimates, my target multiple for SIMO given their growth and secular tailwinds would be 15x P/E. If semis have an incredibly strong showing industry wide, that target would be 20x, justified by the above market growth. However, the historic cyclicality of the industry likely keeps the lid around 15x-17x. At current estimates, this would put the stock at $120-130 fair value.\n\nFwd P/S ‚Äô22: 2.11x\n\nRevenue Growth Est: 24% '22\n\n* These are conservative according to the analysts that provided them in January. This is simply based on the expectation of incremental foundry supply from TSMC, which was expected to come online in Q1 & Q2. Analysts described Rev growth as \"baseline\", with upward revisions expected as capacity is expanded \"materially higher\" (Needham), further accelerating rev growth through '22. Last month (Feb) additional foundry capacity expansion for SIMO was reportedly a sizeable amount. For reference, the last capacity expansion for SIMO was 1Q21 which contributed 30% toward Rev growth.\n* This will be further boosted by product mix as legacy controllers are phased out in favor of PCIe Gen4 controllers, a strong growth area in SSDs. But wait! There's more! PCIe Gen 5 enterprise controllers (think hyperscale, servers, etc) are ramping in 2H22, and present another colossal growth opportunity for SIMO. According to Needham, \"We expect SIMO can generate $50-$100 ASP \\[in PCIe Gen 5\\] vs $4-5 for client SSD controllers in the enterprise market‚Ä¶ estimated TAM $4-5Bn\". Not bad for one segment of a company with a (now stale) guide of $1.15bil '22 revs.\n* Keep in mind, upward Rev growth revisions flow through to all other financial metrics listed.\n\nEBITDA Growth Est: +111% '22\n\n* You read that right. Driven by efficiency gains and major continual product mix optimization over the past few quarters (prioritizing capacity for most profitable product).\n\nFree Cash Flow Generation: +46% '22\n\n* Management has expressed that FCF will continue to grow and be allocated toward increasing shareholder returns (i.e. buyback budgets). Their strategic focus is maximizing FCF to maximize returns for everyone. What a concept!\n* Latest buyback budget was $200m announced in December '21\n\nAnalyst Price Target: $110\n\n* Current analyst price targets range from $88 (Morgan Stanley of course, the perma-memory bears) to $135. Median PT is $120.\n\n# Technicals & Market Mechanics\n\nSIMO is currently rebounding after being caught up in the indiscriminate selling of the Q1 correction which drastically displaced it from underlying fundamentals. This is precisely why this oppty exists. It's currently exiting a downtrend and seeing strong relative strength gains vs its industry & sector. (See Appendix for charts)\n\nSIMO has a higher beta to the semis & memory group, so moves in both directions for that group can be amplified. The company also has a $200mil accelerated buyback budget (announced in Dec) that is a nice forced buyer for this stock.\n\n# Upcoming Catalysts\n\nOnce again, a long list of event catalysts around the corner.\n\nSIMO\n\n* 3/23 Bank of America APAC TMT Conference 2022 (SIMO; potential pre-guide and/or capacity updates)\n* 5/5 SIMO ER\n* Now - 4/5, 5/6 - SIMO has expressed desire to accelerate their buyback program. Outside of the 30day pre-earnings blackout period, buybacks should kick in big time\n\nIndustry\n\n* 3/23 U.S. Senate hearing on semis supply chain \"Developing Next Gen Tech for Innovation\", featuring execs from MU (25% revs) & INTC ($8.65% revs). Discussions will revolve around investment in Federal investment in semi mfg supply chains & America COMPETES Act 2022 & CHIPS for America Fund (potential $52bil to support US semi mfg fabs).\n\nKey Supply Chain Ers (\\~50% of Revs represented)\n\n* 3/29 MU (25% Revs); this is THE biggest catalyst for SIMO, and thanks to current memory market dynamics, MU should have a total blowout\n* 4/7 Samsung (3.3% Revs)\n* 4/28 INTC (8.65% Revs)\n* 4/28 Fujitsu (1.2% Revs)\n* 4/28 SK Hynix (4.89% Revs)\n* 4/29 WDC (4.23% Revs)\n* 5/6 Arrow Electronics (2.2% Revs)\n\n**How to Play**\n\nTargeting a range of prior highs $97 to technical breakout to $110. Using ASK prices for returns (you likely get improved pricing, meaning higher final returns). Profits = % Gains - 100% (ex: if you double, that's a 1x profit).\n\n*Gen X/Boomers:* Buy stock! No brainer. Likely **40-50% upside** from here\n\n*Risk-Averse:* June C75 returns profits of **3.5x-6.5x**\n\n*Quasi-Risk Averse:* June C85 returns profits of **5.6x-11.5x**\n\n*Pump It Up!:* May C80 returns profits of **6x-10.5x**\n\n*Super Pumped UP!:* May C85 returns profits of **8.5x-17.5x**\n\n*WSB Delight:* This is why you come here. If the conference acts as strong a catalyst as they did in Dec & MU earnings are enough to rocket this thing back to $85-95 (entirely possible), the best way to play is... April C80. These are trading so cheap, that a sprint back to $85-95 (15-30%) in the next 4wks would return **7.5x to 24x.**\n\nI'm continuing to buy all of the above. Be sure to use limit orders as SIMOs spreads tend to widen. Also, SIMO has a higher beta to the semi group and spreads are also wider than a company like AMD, so moves in both directions can be exacerbated. Don't plan on trading in and out, as liquidity is not favorable for that; buy with the plan of holding for a few weeks to a few months.\n\n# Appendix\n\nRequired Daily Avg Moves through Exp For Target Ranges\n\n* April $85-95: +0.88% to +1.5%\n* May $95-110: +0.61% to +0.95%\n* June $95-110: +0.42% to 0.65%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Moving averages & Q1 downtrend line from market-wide indiscriminate selling.
