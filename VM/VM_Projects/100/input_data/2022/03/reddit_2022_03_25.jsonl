I said last year that 2020 was the best period for growth since the dot com era but that it would not be sustained.  2021 you saw a large rotation out early in the year, but people piled back in in the Spring when it became apparent there was another variant.\n\n That said, if you look some growth names (generally lower quality) did peak in February 2021 (incl ARKK) and were left behind when it took off again. Later in 2021, growth started to gradually crumble and then as the year came to a close, the erosion accelerated. The last 6 months have been dot com bust-esque for a lot of names; I thought that 2020's growth performance was unsustainable, but I didn't expect the kind of obliteration that has been seen in recent months. Growth isn't over, but for all the people looking through the rubble, I think you have to be extremely selective. It's not no growth, it's what are your best, highest quality growth ideas?  Going forward, I think that people have to have some allocation towards real assets/inflation protection; the era of \"the best game in town is a portfolio that looks like a hyper growth fund\" feels like it's over/regime change.\n\n Some things got left behind when growth took off again in Spring 2021. I think there's going to be a lot more things that ultimately are left behind next time and some talked up names from 2020/2021 will probably never see highs again. If this environment goes on long enough, there's probably going to be a few 2020/2021 ipos that are 0's at this rate.\n\nKKR's recent 32 page macro outlook is imo, a worthwhile and interesting read in terms of their views on positioning going forward.

Equities,\nin particular, are a good inflation hedge, and companies with\nhigh cash flow conversion and rising dividend yields should\noutperform in the environment we envision.\"\n\n\"Given these views, we think that in many instances, portfolio\nconstruction and asset allocation need to be rethought. In\nparticular, we believe that the recent success of the traditional\n60/40 asset allocation benchmark will be seriously challenged\nin the macroeconomic environment we envision. As such,\nwe advocate shortening duration, leaning into collateral-based\ncash flows, and overweighting opportunistic vehicles. We\nalso suggest increasing diversification by allocating across\nmore strategies, including some non-correlated ones. At\nthe same time, we continue to directionally steer away from\nhigh beta growth equities with low cash flow conversion\nprospects. Ultimately, though, we believe investors need\nto remain flexible. As author John C. Maxwell wrote,\n‚ÄôBe stubborn about your vision, but flexible with your plan.‚Äô\"\n\n\"Looking at the bigger picture, we think we are entering\nanother uncertain period, driven by tightening financial\nconditions, a new form of war that includes both military\naction and unprecedented ‚Äî for an economy of Russia‚Äôs size\n‚Äî economic sanctions, and more supply chain disruptions,\ndriven in part by a surge of Omicron cases in China. The\ntechnical picture too is also important, as many investors\nare still overweight high beta growth and tech stocks\n(which remains one of our Pans; see Picks and Pans in\nA Different Kind of Recovery)\"\n\n\"As such, we continue to advocate that asset allocators\nprioritize inflation protection by overweighting collateral-based cash flows, including\nInfrastructure, Asset-Based Finance, and Real Estate. We also expect high cash flow\nconversion Private Equity and Opportunistic Credit to perform well.\"", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Any reason the 10-year is up 5% (even though oil is down)?

I don't know what the climate is like in Spain, but I generally follow the US, Canada, and Germany.\n\nThe US' current political map is one that I'm sure you're familiar with. Democrats talk about issues such as the cost of university, which some have proposed solving by cancelling student loan debts. Republicans complain about dying industries, and the lack of options for workers expelled from them. Corruption and inequality has led to episodes such as drinking water chock full of lead, an overused and abused prison/criminal justice system, predatory loans and insurance systems of several types, and virtually every other social problem you can think of.\n\nIn Canada, there's a lot of fresh bitterness because they're suddenly in a position where a lot of industries are either oligarchies (such as their telecom industry) or have been protected too much for too long with no way out (such as the dairy industry). They have a prime minister in a minority government who is unpopular and seen as corrupt and unwilling to tackle those problems. Canada recently had an election where the results were almost identical to that of the previous election, and it was bemoaned as an election with no good candidates to vote for and thus a complete waste of time and money. The healthcare system, which is heavily valued by many people in Canada, is utterly incompetent in some parts of the country - it can take months to see a doctor and over a year to see a specialist - and some provinces are quickly headed towards privatization, which I'm sure is about to be met with the fiercest opposition (and yet no good solutions) in the coming year. Housing costs are insane as a % of income (see: [https://www.imf.org/external/research/housing/images/housepricesaroundtheworld\\_lg.png](https://www.imf.org/external/research/housing/images/housepricesaroundtheworld_lg.png) and https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-the-countries-with-the-highest-housing-bubble-risks/), particularly in the two largest cities, Toronto and Vancouver, and the government has done very little to curb foreign or investment ownership.\n\nThe situation in Germany is a bit better. The issues that exist in the US don't exist nearly to the same degree there (though issues such as housing for the high percentage of renters are certainly also present). The recent election was a moment of optimism for most of the country, in which a lot of people felt represented (the governing CDU was left out of government while the progressive Greens, center-left SPD, and free-market/socially liberal FDP now make up a coalition government). This alleviates the frustrations of people who felt a lack of progress under Merkel. Notably, the alt-right AFD has lost significant ground. However, current events in Ukraine have given way to a moment of reckoning, in some ways at the perfect time given the fresh government, and have pushed dependence on Russia, stalled progress on clean energy, and other root issues to the forefront. It is a moment of national embarrassment for a country that already experiences chronic historical embarrassment which is entrenched in education and pop culture. There is significant desire to welcome refugees and to become independent on Russia, but the latter in particular just isn't a quick fix and would require a transition that will take several years.\n\nThis all to say that the discussion is happening, in fact it's the discussion and one that will dictate the next decade, perhaps the next century, of western politics. But political unrest often starts with polarization and deadlock (as the Germans can tell you). In these situations the problem is clear and there is a common desire to fix it, and yet society is so broken into factions that nobody gets anywhere. The US is the strongest example of this - I don't think there's any lack of desire for change, but getting conservatives and progressives to present a united front, particularly in a pay-to-play system where politicians openly receive donations and privileges in exchange for their adherence to the interests of the ruling class, is nearly impossible.\n\nWhat breaks that deadlock is either a) one side getting enough of an edge to break the deadlock, which the Republicans seem to be much better positioned to do right now or b) a full-scale political overhaul where the powers that be are overthrown. Things don't always go down in flames the way we imagine revolutions and uprisings.

I live in a state (California) with high taxes that says they support helping people and promoting equality and they tax me oodles but for the most part my taxes don't seem to solve the problems they say they are going to fix. My taxes go up the problems get worse. We have crime, homelessness, pollution, and corruption of our politicians. Three of my city council members have been indicted on federal corruption and bribery charges in the last 3 years.\n\nInteresting take.  I too wonder if such a thing is even feasible.  But I think it's worth considering alternatives, no?  Scandinavia is famous for having a more equitable and well-functioning \"welfare state\".

And farm subsidies won't help either because we already have those. Housing? Well, here in California we have streamlined the permitting process to get more housing built but for the most part it's just more luxury housing that most people can't afford. I do think supply chain issues will resolve but I don't think it's something the government can fix.\n\nUnfortunately, it's my understanding that a lot of these subsidies are politically motivated.  The politicians are under the control of the lobbies.  You don't want blanket subsidies motivated by special interest, but rather you want investments in the future drivers of growth in our economy.  Semiconductors is a great example.  Renewable energy would be another.\n\n>Of course, these numbers are pre-COVID which only exacerbated our debt problems. I hope and think you agree that these types of budget deficits and our debt are a threat to the long term stability of the United States and the global economy.\n\nYes, I agree that it's a problem.  Here's a good (albeit old) article from Joseph Stiglitz:\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/07/deficit-fetishism-government-spending](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/07/deficit-fetishism-government-spending)\n\nYou don't want to slash social spending across the board, because at the end of the day that leaves us worth off.  What you want to do is slash spending on useless subsidies for special interest.  Even if you don't radically cut into the deficit, you can eat into it slightly, or at the very least slow it.  Also, you want to raise taxes more than what Biden has proposed:\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/17/economists-stiglitz-and-piketty-us-needs-a-wealth-tax.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/17/economists-stiglitz-and-piketty-us-needs-a-wealth-tax.html)\n\nAs for defense spending, I would not be an advocate of slashing it completely.  But you'd have to question some of our decisions to be the \"world police\" and what not.  In that regard I think Trump (not a fan of him in most areas) was on to something.  I can't really elaborate on this area more than that.\n\n>I'm not too terribly worried about inequality being a structural issue of the economy. It seems to me it always has been a part of the economy and only begins to become a problem when people start revolting en masse. Over-qualified workers? The main issue at my work is finding enough qualified workers. More immigrants please. Skill-set mismatch? I don't see how structurally that is something that could take down the economy. And easy monetary policy, well, we are tightening that up right now and I am thankful for it.\n\nBut I don't know if you understand the issues that inequality poses.  It's always been a part of the economy, but it's getting worse, and unequal countries tend to be worse off.  Think Mexico and Brazil.  There's a reason for that.  When much of the country is poor, aggregate demand falls.  People spend less.  And what's more, innovation stagnates.  Part of the reason the US has been responsible for driving the world forward in terms of technology is because it has the best educated population in the world.  But with inequality on the rise, that could change.  Finally, there's always the issue of social unrest.\n\nOver-qualified workers means people who should be working at a firm or other more serious job are working at Starbucks.  That's not the kind of employment we want.  Actually, I just looked at some sources and it's not that big of an issue in the USA right now, apparently.  In Spain where I live, however, this is most certainly the case.  As for skill-set mismatch, this is the whole reason that Trump won in 2016.  The old skilled laborers who used to be able to make a decent middle class living in auto factories and the like have been replaced by globalization.  These people haven't been properly trained for new forms of employment, and their standard of living has gone down while their unease with the current situation has gone up.  This makes a candidate like Trump ripe for an election victory, and also generally means our economy is operating less efficiently than it could.\n\nEasy monetary policy is no free lunch.

What is it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great questions - they show you're on the right track.\n\n**First**, the 666 is simply Tesla's 2021 earnings per share growth over 2020.\n\n* 2020 EPS (GAAP): 0.64\n* 2021 EPS (GAPP): 4.90\n\n4.9 / .64 = 7.66\n\n2021's EPS therefore 766% *of*, or 666% *greater than*, 2020's total.\n\nSuch a large EPS is a one time event (unless Tesla has an EPS of $37.51 in 2022 which of course they won't).\n\n**Secondly**, the thing about PEG Ratio is there are many ways to calculate the growth rate. Using [CAGR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp) is probably the most appropriate way to calculate the growth rate. For back of the envelope PEG ratio math, it doesn't always make a big difference since your other inputs are often estimates and PEG ratio is not a terribly precise metric (it's most useful to know whether the PEG Ratio is \"less than one\", \"around one\", or\"more than one\").\n\nYou can also just use one year's total to let you know what the growth rate was for that specific year. But if the year is a one off (like Tesla in 2021, increasing 666$), it's not necessarily a good indicator for the future.\n\nMany people will determine the PEG Ratio using the current year's expected growth. For Tesla (my rough estimate is 9.8 GAAP EPS - 100% growth in 2022) that would be\n\n$1010/$9.8/100 = **1.03** PEG Ratio\n\nYou can also, however, use expected growth over a few years to calculate the PEG ratio. In my example I was calculating the PEG Ratio from 2021 - 2023.\n\nAs for averaging the values, that is up to you to some extent as well. You can also do a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) calculation based on your expected start and end values.\n\nI was using the growth rates of:\n\n* 2021 - 666%\n* 2022 - 100%\n* 2023 - 83%\n* AVG Growth Rate = **283%**\n\nInstead of that AVG, you can do CAGR:\n\n2020 EPS: 0.64\n\n2023 EPS: 18.00\n\nCAGR = (18/0.64)\\^1/3 = **204.11%**\n\nSo not terribly different in this case than a flat average - given the inherent lack of precision in estimated 2023 numbers.\n\nIf we assume a 2023 share price of 1400, the PEG Ratio would be:\n\nCalculated with flat average: $1400/$18 EPS/283% = **0.27**\n\nCalculated with CAGR: $1400/$18/204.11% = **0.38**\n\nSo bottom line: PEG Ratio is a good tool to baseline a P/E ratio BUT you have to really understand the inputs and methodology.

Tesla is involved in energy storage, owns mining fields, software expertise, robotics, energy generation, insurance, data research, and many other aspects. So to even understand this, you need to realize Musk's end goal is to reach Mars. Tesla is used to fund his imitative to Mars. This is why Musk is heavy in energy storage and generation. When you get to Mars, you need to find a way to store energy. Traditionally, your car company that you are thinking of, Ford, GM, etc., are legacy automakers only concerned with selling vehicles to dealerships. Tesla operates in a completely different scale. AI also plays a role which is why robotics is of huge importance to Tesla. Btw, Tesla changed their name from Tesla motors to Tesla. Selling vehicles wasn't Musk's only intention. When he became the CEO of the company, he wasn't just interested in selling vehicles.\n\nEnergy storage = battery packs. Harvest solar energy and then store it in battery packs. Tesla actually plans to be a distributor of energy as well. They are investing heavily into acres to store their battery and connect it to a grid in Austin.\n\nRobotics = Tesla plans to build robots designed to help with tedious tasks. Which auto company is doing this, tell me? Even if you disagree with the future of robotics (which you are wrong, tons of money being poured into researching robotics), the fact Tesla even has the capability to do something like this should tell you that they are far more sophisticated than your traditional car company.\n\nMining deposits = Tesla owns mining deposits with lithium in several fields.

Tell me, I want to know. Can they program their software inside their vehicle to play songs and control the lights to sync with those songs? Silly to you but again, they don't have the software capability to do something like that. Hence, tech.\n\nInsurance = Tesla is involved in the insurance business in states that allow it. This means no more Geico or Progressive (charging insane rates and profits). Tesla monitors your performance via your vehicle through data that they recorded through software. They charge you based on how safe your vehicle is. Pure profit for Tesla using data that they harvested from the vehicle. Again, does your auto company, Ford or GM, whatever you have, know how many miles you have driven and the accidents you have been involved in? Why don't they? Oh, that's right, they don't have the software to process any of that info.\n\nData research: Tesla harvests billions of miles of data when you drive with your Tesla due to their cameras. This allows them to continue developing their FSD and effectiveness of their vehicles over time. Every Tesla vehicle is programmed with cameras of every angle. This data is much like what Google maps gets from you. \n\nYour traditional car company isn't involved in this type of shit because they've been pumping the same ICE vehicles making record profit instead of innovating anything.

Are they more than a car company and adding recurring revenue from their loyal customers in some facet?\n\nYes, you're on the right track. And it's already evidenced by current margins compared to Toyota. Tesla's gross margins in 2021 were 25%(27% in Q4!), and net 10%. Toyota's were 20% and 10%. But Tesla, unlike TM, is improving margins at a rapid pace generating operating leverage. Look at Tesla Q3 revenue and EPS growth vs Q4, you'll see that for \\~28% revenue growth their EPS increased \\~40%. Tesla is further increasing efficiencies through the use of revolutionary  manufacturing technologies (single piece front and rear castings, structural batter pack, 4680 cells, automation, etc), so their margins will continue to improve and they'll also benefit from larger economies of scale as production ramps. Margins will also improve due to logistical reasons now that they have a factory in Europe (no more import duties and shipping costs). Also, the battery providers Tesla works with (CATL, LG, Panasonic) are all looking to localize manufacturing and have announced plans to build factories nearer to Tesla's factories which will further reduce costs, not to mention Tesla will be making their own batteries. All of this combined, in my opinion, means that when/if Tesla reaches Toyota's scale it will be vastly more profitable. Oh! and also i would point out that while TM's market cap is $242B, it's *Enterprise Value* is actually $387B. It's also imortant to mention growth when talking valuations, and TM revenues and income have been flat to down over the last 4 years and this is the case for most mature legacy ICE auto OEMs. That's the biggest reason they all have low PE multiples - most of them have low or negative growth. We'll see where Tesla is in 2030, but i'm personally of the opinion Tesla will still be growing well in excess of its peers in the industry which would warrant a higher PE multiple.\n\nAll that said, it's worth noting that the above only discusses the automotive segment in Tesla's business. And i didn't even mention the software and potential for recurring revenue which is likely as long as they can solve FSD. Even if you're skeptical about FSD, I would suggest Tesla's software (UX) which is designed in-house, alongside their proprietary network of Supercharges contributes significant intangible value by creating stickiness and desirability much like the Apple ecosystem. But there's still more. Perhaps most significantly is the battery storage business. Tesla have acheieved significant wins with their Megapacks in Australia and the US. The demand for stationary battery storage is absolutely immense, and will probably far exceed Tesla's supply of batteries for years to come. The virtual power plants they're able to create have tremendous value and this will probably be a growth business for decades. Tesla themselves estimate it will be as large as their automotive business in terms of revenues, to give you an idea of their ambitions. And there's plenty of research and evidence to suggest this is the very likely outcome in the distant future as the world increasingly favors renewable energies instead of coal and natural gas.

You guys make it seem like it was smooth sailing all the way through. Average out those gains and it's not as ridiculous as you guys are making it seem.\n2. \"But Tesla is valued more than the next whatever auto companies combined.\" Yeah, because traditionally, auto companies are boring to invest in. Before Tesla showed up, how many posts did you read about for auto companies? How many times can you talk about Ford's new truck having brighter headlights? It was boring. And the markets valued it as such because vehicle sales were predictable and linear. Tesla changed how vehicle companies are valued because of the amount of tech and software they are bringing into the industry. When you invest in Tesla, you'll realize just how much new shit they are involved in. You guys are so used to legacy automakers pumping out the same garbage with zero innovation which is why it's unimaginable that Tesla can do something spectacular.

Yet, they plan on going fully EV by 2030-2040 while spending upwards of $40 billion. When you compare ICE sales to EV sales, realize that Tesla has been working on EV's for over 13 years. Comparing ICE to EV sales negates the fact that Tesla has been putting in serious work for 13 years. Why do you not put any value into that? Tesla has a first-mover advantage that needs to be considered here. If you measure every EV sale = one ICE sale, you're also confused about the industry and thus, your opinion is highly questionable. I keep hearing about GM. Do you guys not know GM's only EV, Chevy Bolt, has been halted from production for over six months because of exploding batteries? Again, so easy, right?

That would make them account for about 25% of global EV sales, which in and of itself would be astounding. However I find it extremely unlikely for such a scale to be reached without a steep loss in margins simply for the fact that as of now, their cars are definitely on the high-end/somewhat luxurious side of things. So without introducing more mainstream models (which naturally come at lower margins) they will not be able to achieve the market penetration they are currently valued for, but even if they do, they won't sustain the margins they are valued for.\n\n2) I'm having a hard time buying the narrative of insane demand for Tesla cars.  \na) There has hardly ever been any real competition for the majority of their presence as an EV maker, which is definitely beginning to change. b) I recently went on Tesla's website to order a car for fun's sake.

{"title": "Amazon vs. Tesla - what are your thoughts?", "selftext": "Over the past 5 quarters, Amazon‚Äôs operating income has been getting decimated by inflation. The share price has been range bound for the past two years. Meanwhile, Tesla‚Äôs operating income has exploded. They‚Äôve been range bound while their PE has compressed from over 1000 down to 180. In other words, through their impeccable execution, they‚Äôve delivered unbelievable margins while continuing to scale. Amazon and Tesla are two companies that have been range bound for roughly the same duration. That sometimes means they‚Äôre about to make a swing in either direction. I‚Äôd put a spread trade on the two (Tesla up and amazon down) for the following reason: Tesla‚Äôs operating income has exploded sequentially for the past 5 quarters while amazons has done the exact opposite. I also think amazon is going to take a -$9 eps hit in Q1 driven by rivian and continued operating expense inflation. In Q1 ‚Äò21 amazon hit $16 eps. This is a negative differential of -$25 eps out of the total $67 eps they made in all of 2021. And that's after only one quarter! That means their PE ratio is set to sky rocket with limited upside growth on top line revenue. Tesla on the other hand is just starting this journey. They built the infrastructure during a period pre-inflation and are flooded with cash. In an inflationary environment, you want/need improving margins. Tesla is delivering on that while Amazon is not.", "id": "tndnwh", "created_utc": 1648181238.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|7|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tndnwh)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tndnwh)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "My dad told me Amazon would go broke when I wanted to buy some shares.

{"title": "A Bear Thesis on GameStop's Fundamentals", "selftext": "As most of you know, the main draw for investing in GME is the MOASS. This post will not be addressing the MOASS. Nor will it be addressing the potential this stock has for swing trading, nor any of the other factors that can inflate a stock's price beyond its fundamental value. What it will address is the group of people (most of whom have already put most or all of their life's savings into this stock) who would like to believe that GME is bound to be a rock-solid investment even without a MOASS because of its strong fundamentals, which position it to become the next Amazon.\n\nThis is somewhat of a cross-post from a post I made in the meltdown DD sub, though I have made a few edits.\n\nFirst, let's consider GameStop's starting point. GME is worth over $150/share primarily because it's being held up by swing traders and apes who are invested not primarily because of fundamentals, but because of its high volatility and perceived squeeze potential. Prior to retail becoming so heavily devoted to the squeezing the shorts, GME was being traded for about $4/share. Even before the pandemic, GME was being traded for less than $6/share. We commonly think of GME as a stock that jumped from $20 to $483, but it actually started much lower. Even at $20, it was being held up by investors who were more interested in short squeezes than the company's fundamentals. Of course, there are many apes who believe that GameStop was being shorted into bankruptcy by hedge funds at this time, and that the stock was worth well more than its price even in 2020. The truth, though, is that GameStop was very much a dying brick and mortar company in 2020 and early 2021. That being the case, I'll very generously say that GME was genuinely worth $20/share on fundamentals alone and that it truly earned its market cap of $1.3 billion in early January, 2021. Of course, GME is currently trading for much more than that. At $150/share, GME's stock price is up about 650%, and that's not even taking dilution into consideration. So has GameStop done enough since January 2021 to justify such an extraordinary jump in its stock price?\n\nWell, the short answer is no. Anyone with any experience in valuing stocks can tell you that, based purely on fundamentals, GameStop hasn't even come close to justifying its 650% increase in stock price, let alone its even larger increase in market cap. It hasn't made any major changes, it's struggling to adapt in its rapidly-changing industry, and it's continuing to lose millions of dollars each quarter. But some people (or, more accurately, some apes) don't see it that way. They'll tell you that GameStop has been undergoing a massive turnaround that easily justifies a stock price in the high triple digits, with many even arguing that the price of a single share should be well into 4 digits. Again, these valuations are given by apes who are supposedly ignoring any squeeze potential and focusing exclusively on fundamentals. They justify these massive valuations with the following:\n\n\\- Over a billion dollars in cash and no long-term debt\n\n\\- Positive earnings reports\n\n\\- Executives leaving companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, etc. to join GameStop, which is paying them exclusively with shares\n\n\\- New leaders including Ryan Cohen\n\n\\- Transition to e-commerce\n\n\\- NFTs\n\n\\- Expanding to sell more than just video games\n\nThere are of course many different apes with many different beliefs, but these 7 points seem to be the main justifications for their extremely bullish arguments. That being the case, I would like to talk about each of these points and why they're not nearly as bullish as apes think they are.\n\n* **Over a Billion Dollars in Cash and No Long-Term Debt**\n\nIn today's economy, taking on debt is almost the same as accepting free money. Yes, you'll have to pay that debt back with interest, but with inflation and interest rates where they are, inflation will likely offset most of the interest anyway. Essentially, if I borrow $10 and have to pay back $11, I can rest easy knowing that by the time I pay the $11 back, it will be worth about what $10 was worth when I initially took out the loan. As such, taking on debt isn't particularly bearish, nor is eliminating debt all that bullish. Likewise, since taking out loans is so easy, having cash on hand isn't all that valuable, either. Granted, having excess cash was never that valuable for major companies--most issues can't be solved by simply throwing money at them, so it's no surprised that countless companies have failed despite having enormous amounts of cash on hand--but it's even less valuable now.\n\nMoreover, most successful companies never keep cash on hand and deliberately take on billions in debt because this gives them what they need to push the envelope and be the first to come up with major innovations. Anyone who sees GameStop as a massive growth tech company should see the fact that its still holding onto a billion dollars that it raised over 9 months ago as a major red flag. A company being unable to invest its cash in the pursuit of major innovations because it needs that money to cover its operating costs is¬†**not**¬†a good thing. If $20 is GME's starting point, eliminating debt and gaining $2 billion in cash would increase its fundamental value by no more than a few dollars per share. Or at least it would, if not for the way the company made that money.\n\nDon't forget that GameStop didn't eliminate that debt and gain that cash by selling more games and generating more revenue; it did so by offering more shares and diluting its stock. When a stock is diluted, the supply goes up while the demand remains the same. Moreover, each share is now worth a smaller portion of the total company. As such, offering more shares tends to make a stock price go down. That tends to be true even when the money gained from the dilution is being used to finance significant innovations, but it's especially true when the money is simply used to pay off debt and generate excess cash. Realistically, if GME was worth $20 in January 2021, diluting the stock to clear debt and gain cash may make the stock worth less than $20 now.\n\n* **Positive Earnings Reports**\n\nThis is a funny one because GME's last few earnings reports weren't remotely positive. On the contrary, they show that this company is continuing to hemorrhage money. The Q4 2021 report showed that GameStop lost $150 million (nearly $2 per share) in that quarter alone. If you're new to earnings reports, that's **bad**. And that's in Q4, a quarter that historically has been by far the most profitable quarter of the year. Many retailers, including GameStop, frequently lose money the first three quarters then cover their losses with big profits in the fourth.\n\nOf course, earnings reports are very long and measure companies in many different ways. Naturally, most apes ignore the bad numbers (i.e.: almost all of them) and latch on to the few good numbers. After the Q3 report, the most notable of these was net sales compared to the previous year. They made a big deal about how GameStop's net sales went from $1 billion in Q3 2020 to $1.3 billion in Q3 2021 (a 30% increase). However, that's mainly because people were still staying home, quarantining, and avoiding public spaces in Q3 2020 to a much greater extent than they were in Q3 2021. Nearly every brick and mortar retailer (whether it is now or will be in the future, GameStop was definitely a brick and mortar retailer in 2020) saw massive improvements when comparing 2021 to 2020, and many did so without losing over $100 million in a single quarter. Macy's, for example, saw net sales increase by 35%, and it did so while making over $200 million in profit. Furthermore, GameStop's net sales were $1.44 billion in Q3 2019, and $2 billion in Q3 2018. So net sales, the one \"bright spot\" in GameStop's otherwise abysmal Q3 earnings report, are actually down from where they were 2 years ago, and way down from where they were 3 years ago. And note that while COVID is still a factor, it's not nearly as significant as it was in 2020. Many brick and mortar companies have rebounded in 2021 back to where they were in 2019 (Macy's is right back to where it was in 2019), yet GameStop, despite its supposed turnaround, hasn't.\n\nAfter the Q4 call, though, even apes haven't had many positive things to say. Other than getting hyped about the NFT marketplace (which I'll address later), they've mostly just been finding excuses for GameStop's horrible losses. Remember how after the Q3 report, apes dismissed *that* $100 million loss by saying that it was due to increased spending on an aggressive expansion (new call center, new fulfillment center, etc.) that wouldn't hurt future earnings? Well, that's out the window, because now they're saying that the Q4 earnings were affected by more spending on their expansion after all. What exactly was GameStop spending so much money on in Q4? Apes can't tell you, but they're sure that it must be something amazing, and that this $150 million loss must actually be incredibly bullish.\n\nAnyone who looks at the quarter objectively, though, will realize that the loss was caused more by the cost of sales increasing more rapidly than the sales themselves (the former increased over $200 million from Q4 2021 while the latter only increased by about $\\`130 million) and by GameStop's inability to sell a huge portion of its holiday inventory.\n\nIf GME¬†was worth $20 in January 2021, the most recent earnings report puts its fundamental value well below $20, and its negative impact is far more significant that the slight boost it might have gotten by gaining cash.\n\n* **Executives Leaving Companies Like Amazon, Apple, Google, etc. to Join GameStop, Which is Paying Them Exclusively with Shares**\n\nOne would think that these GME apes, with all their talk of being the most educated investors in history, would know how common this is. Like all employees, executives frequently leave companies to join other companies for a plethora of potential reasons. I recently left a job at a major company to join a much smaller company. Is that because I think this smaller company is going to take off and leave companies like my previous one in the dust? No, it's because this smaller company was offering a higher profile job with better pay and an easier commute. Likewise, there are many reasons that an Amazon executive may begin looking for other jobs at other companies. Most such executives don't end up working at GameStop, but some do. It's also worth mentioning that many of GameStop's executives have left to join other companies. Apes who present it as though executives are fleeing their high profile jobs to flock to GameStop are simply being disingenuous. In reality, employees (including executives) are just being shuffled around as they always are. Some are leaving GameStop; some are leaving other companies. Some are joining GameStop; most are joining other companies.\n\nPaying executives exclusively with shares is also extremely common, bordering on ubiquitous. Nearly every major company does it. It incentivizes the leaders to improve their company, and it's desirable for tax reasons. Frankly, if GameStop didn't pay its executives exclusively with shares, it would be a huge red flag.\n\nThese factors don't affect the stock's fundamental value at all. Again, nearly every major company can say that people from other major companies are coming to them to be paid only with shares.\n\n* **New Leaders Including Ryan Cohen**\n\nLet me tell you a story about a company called Quibi. Quibi was a streaming service founded by¬†Jeffrey Katzenberg.¬†Jeffrey Katzenberg is an incredibly successful movie producer and media proprietor¬†who was the chairman of Disney from 1984 to 1994 before leaving to become the co-founder and CEO of DreamWorks. Katzenberg oversaw the production of movies like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin (the original one, not the Will Smith one), Honey I Shrunk the Kids, The Mighty Ducks, Kung Fu Panda, Megamind, How to Train Your Dragon, and Shrek, among many, many others.\n\nAnd Quibi didn't just have a successful founder, either. Its CEO was Meg Whitman. Whitman was the¬†president and CEO of eBay from 1998 to 2008. She saw eBay's annual revenue jump from $4 million to $8 billion, and eBay's stock rose as high as 2900% during her tenure.\n\nQuite frankly, Quibi had an all-star lineup from top to bottom. There were successful producers, ex-Netflix executives, prolific digital marketers, and many others eager to take Quibi (a company that, coincidentally, also had about $2 billion in cash to work with) to the stratosphere.¬†\n\nQuibi shut down in October 2020, merely 6 months after its launch. It became one of the many companies that have been run into the ground by successful, proven leaders. Great leaders with amazing track records don't make companies immune to failure. This is true for companies like Quibi that are founded by their incredibly talented leaders, but it's even more true for a company like GameStop that's asking its current leaders to undo years of business mistakes made by the people who had been running it. According to apes, since Ryan Cohen was able to beat Amazon within the small niche that is the pet food market, it should be taken as a given that Cohen will beat Amazon at everything forever and eventually create a giant corporation that overthrows Amazon entirely. Unfortunately, that's just not how things work.\n\nRyan Cohen is a brilliant businessman, and he's surrounded himself with many other talented businesspeople. But that doesn't guarantee growth or success. A solid plan from GameStop might guarantee growth and success, but GameStop hasn't announced any plans. Of course, I can respect keeping a plan close to your chest and away from your competitors, but we shouldn't blindly assume that the plan is golden just because Cohen and co. are the ones coming up with it. If GME was worth $20 on fundamentals in January 2021, the mere addition of Cohen and his team does make it more valuable, but only slightly (likely not enough to offset the dilution and poor earnings). The claims that Cohen's presence alone is enough to justify a $100 billion market cap for GameStop are just ludicrous (which makes sense, considering these claims come exclusively from people who have no experience with stock valuations and lots of experience trying to figure out what \"eew eew llams a evah I\" means).\n\n* **Transition to E-commerce**\n\nApes love sarcastically referring to their favorite company as a \"DyInG bRiCk AnD mOrTaR\" as a way to poke fun at those who don't realize that GameStop is moving toward e-commerce. But GameStop being a primarily brick and mortar company wasn't its main issue. Its main issue is that people have less and less need to buy physical games. Nowadays, people download games straight to their hard-drives. Buying a game online and having GameStop deliver it to you is definitely more convenient than having to go out and buy the game at a store, but it's still less convenient than simply downloading a digital game. And a third-party distributor like GameStop is nothing but an irrelevant middle man when it comes to digital games. It used to be the case that Microsoft (a company without many retail locations) needed to sell games to companies like GameStop, who would in turn sell those game to consumers. Now, though, Microsoft can sell to gamers directly. This is more efficient for publishers and consumers alike, so why would either group want to involve GameStop or any other third party?\n\nWhether online or at brick and mortar locations, GameStop's primary source of revenue has always been physical games, and the demand for physical games is continuing to plummet. That is by far GameStop's biggest obstacle to becoming profitable. Moreover, in 2022, transitioning to e-commerce isn't that bullish. In most cases, it's just the bare minimum necessary to keep afloat, and in GameStop's case, it might not even be that.\n\n* **NTFs**\n\n\"But wait!\" I hear you say, \"What do you mean GameStop can't sell digital games? Don't you know that Ryan Cohen is creating an NFT marketplace that will allow people to buy and sell digital games in the form of NFTs? This will open the door for the resale of used digital games! Gamers will flock to this new marketplace in droves, and it will make GameStop billions!\"\n\nOh boy... Please enjoy my 4 part counterargument.\n\n1. Digital resale does **not**¬†require NFTs. If you've ever played Team Fortress 2, you know that it's already possible for players to trade digital assets for other digital assets or money. This has gone on in many games for many years, and NFTs have never been necessary. Of course, these trades only involve in-game items, not games themselves, but that's because...\n2. Publishers will never allow their games to be sold on a platform that allows players to resell them. Video game resale has always been terrible for publishers. If 3 people buy a game, publishers will want to claim the profits from all 3 sales. But imagine if 1 person buys the game, then sells it to his friend, and then that friend sells it to another friend. Now the game has been bought 3 times, but the publisher only benefits from the first sale rather than all 3. It's even worse if the company distributing the games (in this case, GameStop) can buy the game back and sell it to someone else. With this kind of system in place, hundreds of people could end up playing a game that the publisher has only sold once. Even if the publisher gets a cut of the resale profits, they would still be taking a huge hit. And publishers aren't the only ones who would take a hit...\n3. Game distributors (like GameStop) would also take a hit from digital resale. Gamers selling used games to their friends hurts the bottom lines of publishers and distributors alike. It always has. With physical games, though, it at least made sense for GameStop to buy a copy of Halo from little Timmy rather than Microsoft if Timmy was willing to sell it at a lower price. But with digital games, supply never runs out. Distributors with the rights to a game effectively have an infinite supply. If GameStop already has an infinite supply of Halos from Microsoft, they have no need for Timmy's copy. Of what benefit would it be to have infinity plus one copies of Halo? This is likely why...\n4. GameStop has made no announcements regarding digital game resale. This 4 part counterargument almost seems like a waste of time because, honestly, this is the only point I should need to make. Do you know what GameStop has done with NFTs? It hired an NFT team and launched the beta for an NFT marketplace. That's it. Many companies have NFT marketplaces and even more have NFT teams, so why should we blindly assume that every major innovation even tangentially related to NFTs will be spearheaded by GameStop? GameStop didn't invent NFTs; it doesn't have a patent on them. Even if digital resale or replacing the NYSE or creating a \"Ready Player One\" style Metaverse (all of which are things that many apes genuinely expect GameStop to do with NFTs, mind you) really were made possible with NFTs, why should we assume that GameStop will be the company to do these things?\n\nIf there are any apes reading this, please let me know why you expect with near certainty that GameStop will beat everyone to the punch with all of these massive innovations because, for the life of me, I can't figure out why anyone would think that. My best guess is that it basically revolves around GameStop being an established brand with existing infrastructure, a talented chairman, and over a billion dollars in cash.\n\nI've already explained why some of those advantages aren't as important as apes think they are, but it should also be noted just how unpredictable companies can be. For example, if I told you 15 years ago that a single company would account for nearly 50% of all online sales, you would probably guess Target, Walmart, or eBay. You likely wouldn't guess Amazon (a company that basically only sold ebooks¬†at the time). Yet here we are. Target, Walmart, and eBay had incredibly talented leaders, established brands, massive infrastructure in place, and they were still beaten by Amazon.\n\nAnd, as I'm sure you all know, Amazon is far from the only successful underdog in the American economy. Hell, if you're an ape, you already expect GameStop to be a successful underdog. You already believe that a company can go from a dying brick and mortar on the verge of collapse to a powerhouse overthrowing Amazon itself. The point is that no matter what advantages a company has, competitors are always plotting their next move, and some will come completely out of left field. Even if in a year we really are buying all of our games on an NFT marketplace, this marketplace could be started by Toys R Us, for all we know. It could be started by some random guy currently working in a garage. The idea that GameStop's few advantages guarantee its victory over all of its competitors (many of which have formidable advantages of their own) in every endeavor is just juvenile.\n\nIn summary, a marketplace that allows the resale of digital games does not require NFTs. Even if NFTs did open the door for this kind of marketplace, publishers wouldn't allow their games to be sold on it. Even if some publishers did want to sell their games on it, digital resale would hurt GameStop. And even if GameStop wanted to do this (which they haven't indicated in the slightest), there's no reason to assume that they'd be able to do it ahead of their competitors.\n\nI'm aware that apes have countless theories about how GameStop will do everything from selling mortgages to curing cancer with their NFT marketplace, and I can't possibly address all of these outlandish claims. But most of these theories are 1) theoretically possible without NFTs, 2) impossible because of other forces in the market, 3) not profitable for GameStop, and/or 4) not an innovation that we can blindly assume GameStop will spearhead.\n\nRealistically, GameStop's NFT marketplace will probably be like the NFT marketplace that Ubisoft recently created. Maybe if you pre-order Call of Duty at GameStop, you'll get a golden P90 that's functionally identical to every other golden P90, but you'll get a link confirming that your golden P90 is the *original* golden P90. Activision might even allow you to sell this P90 to someone else (though, again, Activision can already allow this without NFTs). You'll likely also be able to buy \"original\" pieces of concept art or something, which isn't that great considering you can already do that on existing NFT marketplaces. NFT marketplaces are usually profitable, but GameStop may have trouble standing out from the crowd, and they're sure as hell not going to do so with used digital games.¬†\n\nThe NFT marketplace raises the fundamental value of GameStop, but only by a small amount. This might have been different if GameStop wasn't so late to the party or if it had a clear way to distinguish its marketplace from other NFT marketplaces, but that's simply not the case at this time, nor is there any indication that it will be the case in the foreseeable future. Don't expect this marketplace to cause some massive revolution.\n\n* **Expanding to Sell More Than Just Video Games**\n\nBut even if demand for physical video games is dropping and GameStop isn't able to sell digital video games with or without NFTs, surely we should be bullish about how quickly they're expanding into new markets, right? If you've been on any GME-related sub recently, you've no doubt seen apes cheering about how PC parts, plush toys, and board games are now being offered at their local GameStops. In reality, though, this isn't so much of an expansion as it is a desperate attempt to stay afloat as GameStop becomes increasingly unable to sell video games, physical or otherwise. A pizzeria expanding their menu to include burgers, hot dogs, and salads may seem bullish, but only until you realize that they're only doing so because no one wants their pizzas anymore.\n\nI admire GameStop's willingness to try new things, but at the end of the day, chess sets and graphics cards just don't sell nearly as well as video games. And this is reflected in GameStop's consistently poor earnings and its inability to sell so much of its holiday inventory. The expansion into these new markets is more bullish than simply throwing in the towel would have been, but it's ultimately indicative of something very bearish.\n\n* **Recap**\n\nTo summarize, GameStop was (if we're being generous) worth $20/share in January 2021. Since then, a few mildly bullish things have happened, which have been largely offset by the many bearish things that have happened. If you wanted to buy GameStop right now at $20 for its fundamentals, it may be a reasonable investment, but at $150+, it's almost certainly not. Of course, that's not to say the company can't succeed. Ryan Cohen might be able to turn the company around and bring its fundamental value to $30/share. Maybe he'll be incredible and bring its value to $60/share. If he's able to triple the company's fundamental value in his first year as chairman, that will be amazing, and as unlikely as it may be, it is somewhat possible. But if you're buying in at $150 thinking that the value will easily increase fifty-fold, without a short squeeze, simply because Ryan Cohen has cash, an NFT team, and some Pok√©mon cards, you may be disappointed.", "id": "tnphqo", "created_utc": 1648225124.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.35, "num_comments": 561, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|170|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tnphqo)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tnphqo)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "On the contrary,  what happened this week is your average GME investor had to update their discounted cash flow model and realized the expectation for future returns was in fact 68.8% better than prior valuations would suggest hence the corresponding increase in the share price.

Let me copy and paste from a post I made over a month ago.\n\n>SEC Report October 14th 2021, Pages 25. 26\n\n\"In seeking to answer this question, staff observed that during some discrete periods, ***GME had sharp price increases concurrently with known major short sellers covering their short positions after incurring significant losses.*** During these times, ***short sellers covering their positions likely contributed to increases in GME‚Äôs price***. For example, staff observed that particularly during the earlier rise from January 22 to 27 the ***price of GME rose as the short interest decreased.*** Staff also observed discrete periods of sharp price increases during which accounts held by ***firms known to the staff to be covering short interest in GME were actively buying large volumes of GME shares, in some cases accounting for very significant portions of the net buying pressure during a period.*** Figure 6 shows that buy volume in GME, including ***buy volume from participants identified as having large short positions***, increased significantly beginning around January 22 and remained high for several days, corresponding to the beginning of the most dramatic phase of the run-up in GME‚Äôs price.\n\n[Figure 6](https://i.imgur.com/j6dbuH4.jpg) shows that the run-up in GME stock price coincided with buying by those with short positions. However, it also shows that such buying was a small fraction of ***overall buy volume*** [buy volume was 1 billion shares, look at Figure 6 and get a clear view of how many major short sellers exited], and that GME share prices continued to be high after the direct effects of ***covering short positions*** would have waned. The underlying motivation of such buy volume cannot be determined; ***perhaps it was motivated by the desire*** to maintain a short squeeze. Whether driven by a desire to squeeze short sellers and thus to profit from the resultant rise in price, or by belief in the fundamentals of GameStop, it was the positive sentiment, not the buying-to-cover, that ***sustained the weeks-long price*** appreciation of GameStop stock.\n\nTldr: retail bought a lot and pumped the price for weeks, short sellers covered incurring huge losses throughout this time, but mostly at the end.\n\nThe data supports this.\n\nIt technically never was a squeeze.
