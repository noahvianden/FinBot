Google's third-party reseller attach rate goal is around 90%, whereas AWS is around 25%.\n\nBelieve it or not, I think that that structure - heavily relying on third party resellers - is what's causing the lag in the ceiling for them on Cloud, too.  The reseller ecosystem started in the MS-Office to Google Apps days, margins are thin on licensing so integrators had to spend time + resources chasing SOWs for things like migrations, etc., to make up the difference.\n\nNow, as Google has pivoted more heavily towards Cloud + trying to make that inroad, there's a bit of an educational challenge where there's a dearth of knowledgeable talent that can deploy, manage + service G Suite, but not so much GCP.  It's going to take them a bit longer to gain market share, but ***market share is the goal***. \n\nMeanwhile - AWS had the earliest lead-in time (having no other core products to focus on), the best 'early story' (\"It's what [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) runs on\"), and the most aggressive tactics (don't involve partners, grab every workload you can)\n\nMS also had / has the strategic advantage of just so -- much -- legacy.

I'm baffled how people still continue to buy Tesla, my brother, my friends, etc, people who just started investing in 2020. They see Tesla go from $800- $900 and think \"wow, I could've made so much it went up $100!\" Meanwhile, I'm making even more from other stocks based on % ROI, this shows you how dumb retail is. I have a lot of friends who buy Tesla and think a $50 gain is good from their initial amount invested, rather than actually considering the %...\n\nI personally think Tesla as a stock is a beast, but the company doesn't reflect the stocks price or the company's future prospects. So while I am an early investor, I admittedly take profit and invest in NIO, BYDD, Honda, AMBL, Uxin, mining companies, etc. The reason is because these companies either provide more stability, diversification, exposure, etc. I've considered heavily reinvesting in UBER and maybe even DiDi because I do think data collecting is important and could be sold, but UBER does not at these prices, DiDi perhaps. I think you're all clowns for buying Tesla and the risk versus reward is just not worth it. There is so much downside with Tesla as a stock, but the company will continue to do well. My average is low so even if it were to come down, I would still be green and not care.\n\n**THOUGHTS ON OTHER EV**\n\nI don't particularly care for a lot of charging stocks, and I think most American companies tend to be overvalued. Rivian and Lucid are terrible excuses for stock and ride the American hype train circle jerk. This means that despite these companies having questionable performances, lack of actual credibility to justify the stock price, and lack future prospects, people want an American EV they can go to, I get it. But that doesn't mean I would invest in these companies, especially at their evaluation based on those things I consider along with the market being the primary U.S., which isn't all that great and being niche.\n\n**Chinese EV**\n\nI'm a China BULL, I don't believe the FUD.  Common arguments are:\n\n1. Chinese stocks get delisted. It will never happen unless the world were to end. Wall Street wouldn't allow it and definitely have control over the SEC, we already saw how corrupt Wall Street is and how little they care about morals or ethics just in 2020/2021 alone. Too many people would lobby for Chinese stocks. But not only this, if it were to happen because the U.S. is so reliant on China, the U.S. would crumble. But here's the thing, China owns the means of production, is a creditor nation, has its own network of providers of goods, is owning the resources, owns real goods, has a government and stronger control over its people, along with stronger unity. This means that China can always navigate through obstacles and complete a task as a country, substantially better than the U.S., which is divided and is on a path towards much slower growth. The U.S. cannot be stressed tested as much as China can, which is why the delisting would never happen. The U.S. cannot afford to create any social disorder because the country socially, economically, politically, geopolitically, just isn't as strong as it once was. Americans do need a reality check.\n2. China is focusing on selling EVs primarily in Asia and Europe. I don't even care if Chinese companies come to the U.S. and neither should you. The only reason I would want NIO or BYDD to come to America is for brand recognition and the forcing of more intertwining of supply chains, goods, and services. But besides that, the U.S. is not a favorable market for EVs compared to China and Europe. If the U.S. did not have control over the largest stock exchanges, no one would care if EVs were sold in America or not. If China or Europe held the largest stock exchanges, no one would care what the SEC or perception of American retail investors think along with any other voice, which makes sense. \n\ntldr; if all Chinese stocks get delisted, the U.S. will suffer more and have much more to lose. The U.S. cannot afford to delist Chinese stocks. I also know the U.S. is the king of the deficit is on the decline, loves to use its status as the reserved currency, loves to take advantage of the world's financial regulator, the bigger picture is, the U.S. has been losing leverage over the global financial system. So these problems and FUD with China become less probable each day that passes. A big problem is that U.S. politicians, retail investors in America or who own U.S. stocks, U.S. economy, all rely heavily on U.S. stocks performing well, so there will always be unfair rhetoric in favor of U.S. stocks, this is despite U.S. being over valued with less future prospects.\n\nIf China and the U.S. were viewed as companies. The U.S. is an old dinosaur company that pays dividends but has no future prospects, has bad management, the employees want to quit and constantly fight, its management from the top to bottom is corrupt.\n\nChina is a strict company with many future prospects, starting to realize its profitability, re-invests its income, has great management (idc what you think, it's different but this is just a company view), employees despite having a lower standard of living that's rising to have much more social unity and hope along with social order and better social constructs.\n\nCharlie Munger acknowledges these things and doesn't really care about your virtue signaling morals and ethics.\n\n**NIO, BYDD, Xpeng**\n\n**Chinese EVs have substantially more value than U.S. EVs and offer better ROI % and better future prospects.**\n\nAnother problem with EVs:\n\nIt costs $7,000-$14,000 to replace a Tesla battery, not even to upgrade it. Due to more money flowing into R&D towards battery tech, the batteries are rapidly improving. So when we shift from Lithium-Ion to Solid-State or partial, this raises the standard substantially for EVs from the top to bottom. So early adopters of EVs that have terrible range are stuck with their junk EV with low range, this is despite the shell of the vehicle being firm, the battery sucks and it would cost half or so for a newer EV with a better battery and similar shell. This will lead to a few things once we start raising the standard in EV batteries in leaps such as lack of vehicle retention value/ resale value being hit, more waste due to people opting in to dispose of their EV for a new one (which is against sustainability and net-zero carbon emissions), and lack of vehicle relevancy. These problems won't be realized until a couple of years though. This is why China is standardizing battery swaps because they recognize these problems.\n\n**Robo Taxi:**\n\nSo there will be a point when a lot of EVs meet a point where not only Tesla will have robo-taxi. Companies such as NIO, mobileye, google, Baidu, and more will have Robo-taxi capabilities. The problem is, even if robo-taxi were to become normalized, Tesla would not have a monopoly over it. In fact, I would argue NIO has set up the infrastructure to accommodate robo taxi. This is due to battery swap stations being placed strategically all along with China, this could also be replicated in Europe/Norway, and even the U.S. \n\n**Battery Swap Stations:**\n\nWhile battery swap stations and battery swap station infrastructure is a nice convenience for fast charging, it's not the true value. The true value is the infrastructure and technology. This is because when EVs become fully autonomous along with robo-taxi fleets become more prominent. Battery Swap Stations will one day be able to swap the battery out, vehicle maintenance, vehicle inspection, vehicle cleaning, etc. All which is necessary for robo-taxi and EVs working 24/7 without the need for any worker. \n\nTesla cannot do this because it takes over one thousand steps to grab a Tesla charging cable, plug it in, and there are too many variables such as theft, vandalism, and it's just not cost-efficient. But battery swap stations are affordable and this is why NIO wins robo-taxi, customer satisfaction, the approach towards net-zero carbon emissions, vehicle retention, vehicle sustainability, etc. China has even less red tape which allows for these types of technologies to advance much faster.\n\n**I don't care about virtue signaling or your false sense of morals and stuff that you probably don't even live up to, you're not altruistic. IMO, most people are greedy and just want to make money, I don't care personally, and I am here to make money. NIO is a better bet along with Chinese EVs, the FUD is fake and has no real sound validity behind it. The U.S. keeps losing its leverage which is why nothing will ever happen.

The purchase price is at a 15% discount of the lowest price in the offering period (6 months). Again, you can only buy whole shares so if you are left with $999 in collected from your payroll and 1 share purchase price is $1000 (lowest price in the 6 month period after 15% discount) you won’t be able to buy it and will simply have the $999 returned to you.\n\nSo yea, mechanically having a lower unit price per share is better for the company and employees (even if it didn’t increase the share price)", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "thank you! i have been trying to find out the details of this espp for months. i wonder what the take rate is; does everybody do it? if somebody isn't, i would be willing to fund them to do so and split the profit 50-50, instead of buying my shares on the open market. unless this would be against the rules.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Awesome details, thanks for sharing.

The printing presses were running and prices are catching up.  None one here has ever seen expansion of the money supply quite like this before.  Sure you could look at bolivars or zim dollars or post war Germany but none of those compare to the expansion of the petrodollar world reserve currency that’s happened in the past 5 years.  Anyway that’s a long tangent discussion but the relevance is that you’re right the 4% rule needs some updating.  Basically you can’t just take that money stick it in a CD and hope to live forever on it.\n\nSo on to your position.  I’ve been in a somewhat similar situation.  A few months ago my cash trading account was over $4m balance I could have easily lived off it for a long damn time.  Then after delta variant and the Fed got to doing their thing I’ve had an utterly demoralizing 72.8% drawdown.  TSLA is a great company and can weather storms but I was also in great companies that just had major drawdowns as almost everything did in the last few months.  Add a “little” margin in the mix and the daily 5-10% portfolio drops and margin calls forcing me out of positions at the worst possible time was crushing.  Looking back now To me the number in my account didn’t seem real and I didnt really comprehend it and what it meant.  I understand it better now.  \n\nSo If you’re thinking $270k lets you take a year off work then you’re probably in a somewhat “regular” job which means you’re not pulling in $500k plus in a year and you’re also not just doing your job because you love it so much and it’s so fulfilling or else you wouldn’t be talking about a year off.  You also probably live within your means and don’t have the propensity to just utterly fuck your life up because you have some money and some time on your hands (cocaine and hookers are nice but at some point they can wind up being a problem).  You need to take some time to internalize that The number in your account is real and think about what it really means.   It makes sense to shift your thinking and consider the strategy for defending it against whatever may be coming because as great as things seem now there’s a good chance we’re all fucked.  You know they say the best defense is a good offense… but that doesn’t mean you take your team off the field when the other team has the ball.  You still play offense because many times that’s what actually wins the damn game.  Maybe the more appropriate cliche here is that it’s not how much money you make… it’s how much you keep that matters.  \n\nSo If it was me in your position Id be thinking IV is high right now so it’s a nice time to be selling options as premiums are up.  Fortunately for tsla there is a fairly recent history to look back on and see what happened to the IV around the last split.  Instead of selling all 46 contracts now it may be better legging into it.  As for the strike I’d be considering what % of capital I’d be wanting to pull out and put in other places (crypto, gold, land) or even just putting aside in a separate account and keep selling options (this is theta gang after all). Even with just $1mil in an account you can easily pull $5-10k per month selling options with minuscule delta that presents 90% plus probability of profit.  That’s pretty safe even in a shit market especially if you’re ready to close out those contracts at a small loss to protect capital of the market just goes tits up.  \n\nThen with the amount I decided to pull out of Tesla then I’d look at just slightly OTM or even possible ITM options.  The premium juices your position a bit and an option close to the money will provide some insulation against downturns in the underlying.  $1100 Jan 23 calls are going for $250.  $1200 Jan 23 calls are going for about $210.  Provided Tesla stays above the strike it still takes advantage of some further upside and protects about 20% if it drops and the calls expire worthless.  You should also look at less DTE.  You need to figure what is best for you.  Also Even ITM options might be a good move to provide more downside insulation and still provide some upside if tesla keeps on trucking by actually releasing a truck - semi or cyber.  I’d do this with just a portion.  With the rest of the position I’d definitely start legging into OTM CC positions to take advantage of the IV now.  \n\nOne note of caution… it really sucks ass seeing CC positions go deep red even though it’s good for you.  You still have 4611 shares and say Tesla goes up $100 in a day.  It’ll show a nice fat $460k gain on your shares and a less nice $100k loss on a 10 contract short calls already ITM and probably another $100k loss on 36 OTM short calls.  Need to be able to stomach looking at that without doing something stupid (now rolling those calls out isn’t necessarily stupid either - it’s a viable strategy to milk some more gains with extrinsic time value when  you now have more information than you had on the initial trade).  I mean without doing something stupid like closing the covered calls at a huge loss and yolo-ing into OTM long calls 11 DTE with margin thinking you’re going to buy a $40 mil mansion when Tesla hits $5000 next week.  Newsflash to your hypothetical future yolo-ing degenerate WSB self… you’re not buying a $40mil mansion and 10 lambos… your hypothetical future self needs to just stay focused make a plan and don’t fuck it up.  \n\nSet yourself up to protect your account and take a year off.  Take a real break and don’t just waste your time obsessing over tsla share price.  Time is precious and you can use use it well by figuring out what you really want to do.  That’s what that money in Tesla means to you now.  You can go do whatever the fuck you want to do for the rest of your life (within reason ofc) whether it pays you or not.  \n\nObviously this is just an observation and not financial advice.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I really appreciate you taking the time to comment, thanks.

This is Thetagang so the standard answer is the wheel.  It’s not without risk but staying way the hell OTM reduces the risk… reduces the gains but 0.5% to 1% per month is small enough.   \n\nTake Microsoft.  The IV is low so the premiums are small but if you sell a CSP at a price 15% below current about 30 DTE it’s about 0.5% in premium with about 95% probability of being profitable.  Of course there there are always black swan events and there can be some rapid downturns even for companies like Microsoft.  March 2020 it dipped about 20% in a month but it’s the bluest of blue chips and a market overreaction.  still if you watched your puts going against you then you could close out half of them at 50% loss letting the rest ride hoping for recovery before expiration or you could just dump it all and be out 1 month of your profit target.   \n\nAnother example ENPH.  IV is higher so better premium.  Right now the 29DTE $120 put is selling for $0.98 per share so about 0.8% and the delta is a tiny -0.03.

Not a hugely profitable trade but running in the 95% + probability range of being in the green at expiration.  the risk is owning shares of a good company if the share price tanks in the next 30 days or buying to close for a loss if the puts run against you and the market is looking overall bad and you just want to steer clear of holding anything.  \n  \n\nOr you can do credit spreads still way otm to limit full exposure to those black swan events.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I get your concern but i think you may be a little short on how much the us really printed.

GlobalX and Nationwide currently are the biggest players in the non-traditional income ETF space (anything that isn't a bond or dividend ETF). If QYLD doesn't match your goal QYLG might or QCLR or QRMI. Each has a different value proposition and use case in the income space. Nationwide's offerings are NUSI, NDJI, NSPI, and NTKI and they are collars vs. CC ETFs\n\nAs for risks, Income ETFs have their own risks compared to growth or value ETFs. Tesla is a pure growth play and the primary goal of investing into Tesla is to watch the account number get as big as possible same with every growth account. The primary goal of value investing is to grow the account balance while minimizing the risk that the account value goes down. Income investing doesn't care about total return, it attempts to maximize the amount of real returns regardless of market movement. Real returns are dividends/coupons/etc. minus market losses minus risk premium minus inflation. \n\nSo money you invest into income funds (QYLD, RYLD, XYLD, etc.) you won't expect to grow in in stock price over time, and the YLD funds are expected to slowly decrease in stock price over time due to US tax law. However, they pay out 100% of the growth and profit in the form of the dividend instead of holding it within the fund and growing the fund. An imperfect analogy would be if Tesla paid out 100% of it's gross profit every quarter and sold stock to cover its expenses. Not the best analogy because these are ETFs not companies, but gives the right idea. As a side note, QYLG only pays out \\~50% of the growth and profit if you would like something that is expected to grow over time but are ok with a lower dividend. Because of this you'd want to add in a percentage of the dividends you receive back into the fund to keep up with inflation and counteract this decline in value from taxes.  pre-empting a question, holding the stock in an IRA doesn't matter because GlobalX has to follow the tax codes for a S-corp which is what causes the lowering share price not your personal taxes. \n\nSCHD is a traditional income fund that focuses on dividends and has none of the above risks and has generally tracked the S&P 500 in terms of total returns with DRIP turned on. This is why I said I'd put the lion share of the money into SCHD so I can retain some amount of growth in my account. If I could live on SCHD alone I would do so, but the dividend is so much lower than the YLDs that I would need 6x the amount of money in order to live off the dividend. \n\nfinal \"risk\" is none of these will grow anywhere near as dramatically as Tesla over the next 10 years so you'd miss out on the potential upside of tesla (or any other growth stock) and if you try to compare your performance in growth stocks to what tesla did 10 years from now you'll be disappointed.

I did a lot of short term put selling, picking up a few hundred bucks for way OTM puts, several times a month, earning a few k every month. In July and August, the put premium was great, even for way OTM puts that I legitimately would have loved to have been assigned (500's). As we crept up, the premium dried up, and I was forced to get riskier with my puts if I wanted to keep making a couple k per month. \n\nI believe it was the Afghanistan withdrawal dip that wiped me out. I had like seven margin-covered puts I had written, and none of them were at strikes I was willing to buy in 100-share chunks. I think I lost about $20k buying them back, which was most if not all of my options profit up to that point.\n\nAll of that put-selling was dozens of trades, for pennies, to ultimately get wiped clean.

We ended up soaring to $1200's, and I sold them all the bloody day Elon started selling.

{"title": "💲 G M E 💵 Overcoming Routine Technical 'Technicalities' to Remain 'Jacked'", "selftext": "# Market Price Action\n\nIt's just a Tuesday, yet today's Market Price for 💲 **G M E**  touched upon $448,950.00 per share according to a screenshot of the highest 'last' price (2 shares), at least $510.00 per share according to options triggers, $370.00 per share according to some charts, $275.00 per share according to a transactional verification, while only obtaining $200.00 per share according to nominal 'lit' exchange data.  Let's analyze today's activity:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[💲 G M E Price Action from this morning reveals outsized, acute demand for the stock - Although separate evidence suggests that $448,950.00 was obtained today per share \\(2 shares\\), this move triggered in-the-money notifications for what were out-of-the-money options, with investors with call options as high as $510.00 - Note that the 15-month high from pre-market on 28JAN2021 was $508.04 \\(moments before the buy-button was removed that morning\\), indicating that 💲 G M E is 'seeking' its free-economic-market price which may be above $508.04 or $510.00 per share](https://preview.redd.it/ifov1cwc4dq81.jpg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46735e04aa9b732a880e7eebe797625e8d097949)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n![img](gq2197to4dq81 \"Further, evidence shows that there were 💲 G M E  market transactions significantly above the current 'lit' price : in this case, $275.00 per share today. \nMany investors are sharing screen shots of extreme prices above $510.00 in-the-money shortly before facing a downward [as opposed to an upward] limit halt\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Technicalities\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ This morning, 💲 G M E experienced a \\\\\"routine\\\\\" volatility trading halt - The ticker ran up in the first five minutes after the open, before being brought down, in an orchestrated fashion that was likely designed to 'attempt to induce panic selling' - At 9:37:30 a.m. EST the stock was hit by a mysterious onslaught of superhigh-frequency 100-share-block-short-sells - One can observe the mass-coordinated 182.79 share sales, the next order a few pennies below this coordinated wall triggered the limit-down halt - This NYSE halt for a few minutes removed investors ability to freely invest. The fact that this same price action with exact timings took place with 💲 A M C reveals that this was an ETF-induced maneuver via the 'Meme-Stock' basket - The halt was followed by some consolidation - Contrary to the likely intent of the maneuver, 💲 G M E 'overcame' with a price recovery in less than one investing hour](https://preview.redd.it/r9cuito1wfq81.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=671c5df378cb65f70d45c1506284d9158dc9bd56)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs displayed above, today, Hedge Funds abused their market function to purposefully and successfully *exploit* the Limit-Up-Limit-Down ([LULD](https://www.luldplan.com/)) protective-feature of the New York Stock Exchange.  This created a few minute pause in investing that served to attenuate investing.  The original spirit of that rule is to serve as a 9:45 am EST market halt feature that mitigates volatile and disorderly investing.  There was nothing disorderly about a 7% increase in the 'lit' exchange price.  But, the halt mysteriously took place earlier than it's supposed to: at 9:37 a.m. EST.  In speculation of their motive and technique, by Hedge Funds assisting the 5-minute rise on the buy side (thereby dragging up the average price), they then forced the price down with high-frequency short-sales (thereby quickly triggering the 5% volatility down limit).\n\n💲 **G M E**  investors who owned the stock through January 2021, when mainly limit-up halts were experienced multiple times per trading day, have classified this price action as '*routine*' and '*part of the game*.'  Investors should be aware, however, that Hedge Fund(s) intentional manipulation of a security like this - in order to force a market halt - does constitute a gross violation of securities laws, as it is arbitrary and capricious behavior within markets, as well as abuse of the good-faith market function of a Hedge Fund.  On the other hand, for the rightful investors of this company, who intend on long term company ownership, these minute-long declines could be viewed as 'acute discounts,' allowing for faster ownership of the company per dollar.  This is especially so, theoretically, if the investor then utilizes those free discounts and is more readily able to remove the earned share from DTCC market 'lending' and 'locates' circulation by registering their newly-acquired-artificially-discounted shares directly with the transfer agent.\n\nThis pause did prevent investors from being able to freely transact for a few minutes, and may have been a technique for the Hedge Fund(s) involved to not only \"buy more time,\" but to make a quick jolt of profit.  It is also possible that these funds were well aware of the timing of such a manuever, and were perhaps given a 5-minute window to make transactions before they manipulated the price downward (creating a short duration but high magnitude 'pump' and 'dump').  Similar 'short-ladder attacks' also occurred today at 2:56 p.m. EST and 3:37 p.m. EST.  Performing three outsized 'short-ladder attacks' in one business day, while unable to harm the price nor adversely attenuate the natural demand for the stock, in-all-likelihood has even further substantially increased Hedge Funds' short-borrow liabilities.  We would be able to observe this using tomorrow's live Ortex data.  But, let's look at today's available data:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Short-Interest Data\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short-Borrows against 💲 G M E have only increased \\(including from today's action\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7xc6jcjv2dq81.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=04a90b8e383b80a8d99b95bfcb26fabdeae6b181)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[With now 22.6 Million Shares on loan, and a 135.44&#37; increase in Cost to Borrow \\(an interest rate fee on these borrows\\) Hedge Funds continue to incur outsized risk \\(a risk now faced by their clients directly, who have been restricted from recalling their investments by some hedge funds\\)](https://preview.redd.it/jacqy8pu2dq81.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=e24c2e283c80ee1d68775c5a297dafff0a67ae62)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ 💲 G M E trends reveal an 'Ascending Wedge' chart pattern as well as a sustained price 'departure' above the 50 Period Simple-Moving-Average \\(30 Min Periods\\) - This chart is of the regular 'lit' exchange, which does not show the $510.00+ per share nor the $448,950.00 per share from today](https://preview.redd.it/3cu6l48x2eq81.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=429881daf47f25d73667b0476f75fe7f5dcfe75b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mentioned previously regarding today's Price Action, in-the-money alerts today were triggered for share prices above $510.00 - This image shows January 28th, 2021, when 💲 G M E was transacting at $508.04 per share just moments before the removal of the 'buy' button, indicating that true-economic-market-price discovery may very well require market prices above $508.04 or $510.00 per share](https://preview.redd.it/m6f9h9t7req81.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=4de4bb91b93e6c5b583b0508ead8ac7cacf97a39)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[💲 G M E  remains undervalued according to its 15-Month Historical Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/tjfz3gq56dq81.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=764f410954f1e419175a1ab7453445f69e9bf298)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Recent Fundamental Developments\n\nIncreased demand seems to be growing for 💲 **G M E**  based on new fundamentals, as listed below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 💲 **A M C**   CEO Adam Aron has expressed interest in expanding the company to be more of a global investing company, with intent to expand further, and having recently acquired a major stake in Hycroft Gold Mining Company\n* 💲 **A M C**  experienced success with the movie 'Batman,' and showed success not only with its digital-asset payments for movie tickets, but with dynamic pricing\n* 💲 **G M E**  Chairman Ryan Cohen, among other insiders, have purchased daily droves of raw shares of the company.

Data shows that 💲 **G M E**  touched upon $448,950.00 per share, $510.00 per share, $370.00 per share, $275.00 per share, and $200.00 per share today.  This may seem confusing, but in reality, there are two types of exchanges: those we can see ('lit') and those we cannot ('dark pools').  It appears that off-exchange ('dark pool') prices went \"to the Moon\" today before a down-limit volatility halt was purposefully-induced (via an orchestrated maneuver by hedge funds where shares were expelled onto the market in superhigh-frequency block trades, 52,200 of which were of the same exact price of $182.79).  💲 **G M E**  investors referred to their observation of this type of attack as '*routine*.'  Just prior to this maneuver, in-the-money notifications of significantly out-of-the-money options were triggered above $510.00.  Nevertheless, 'lit' prices then stabilized, consolidated, and resumed an upward trajectory. 💲 **G M E**  thereby recovered, contrary to the designed-intent of hedge funds' short-selling maneuver, thereby placing even more short-liability risk onto hedge funds tomorrow.\n2. On the technicals, the true economic market price is clearly being sought somewhere above $510.00 per share, and to note - the previous high was $508.04 per share on 28JAN2021, moments before brokerages' removal of the 'buy' button.  Today's chart does reveal a favorable ascending wedge chart pattern, as well as a sustained and elevated price departure above the 50 Period Simple Moving Average (30 minute price box-plot durations).  The short-sale interest only grew - now to 22.6 Million shares for short-borrow, now at January 2021 peak levels.  Utilization for shorting is still 100%, and the interest rate to short-borrow with some brokers has ballooned to 85%.  There are three additional investing days in this week.\n3. This evidences an outsized risk to any institutional-class client who has investments managed by a hedge fund who may be over-shorting this stock, as hedge funds are now 'in duress' with likely only several business days remaining until this type of price action reaches 'lit' exchanges.  Continued price action now paints a bona fide Bankruptcy risk (upon margin liquidation forced-buy-ins) to these shorting-hedge-funds, while the FBI, DOJ, and SEC continue to hawk their every move for evidence of naked shorting.  Lending counterfeit shares, for selling a company's stock short, is a Class C Felony - it is punishable via 20 Years Prison Sentencing.  Fundamentals for 💲 **G M E** reveal that insiders are continuing to buy raw shares of their company in droves, daily.  Officers of victimized-companies do retain the right to file a multi-company civil suit against wrongdoers in U.S. markets, and in conjunction with criminal charges.  Any and all awards earned via litigation have positive, material effects on company financials and shareholder net asset value.\n\n# TLDR\n\n💲 **G M E**  is 'freely seeking' its true, economic, market price.  On 28JAN2021, the price was $508.04 moments before removal of the buy button.  Today, $510.00 call options were triggered as being 'in the money.'  Charts displayed transacted prices up to $370.00 per share, and logs displayed 300 shares transacted of $275.00 per share.  Further, ask prices, during a temporary halt, indicated 💲 **G M E**  was worth $448,950.00 per share on the ask.  Bloomberg terminal data too evidences these prices.  On the 'lit' NYSE, the price after the open rose to about $200 per share.  Then, as purposefully-orchestrated \\[via superhigh-frequency block short-sale orders at 9:35 a.m. EST\\], the price was short-laddered down for a few minutes. 💲 **G M E**  investors faced a few-minute halt at 9:37 a.m. EST that \\[as evidence suggests\\] was engineered by Hedge Fund(s) in order to stay ahead of the trade, perhaps profit, while halting investment opportunities.  Yet, on natural demand for the stock, the market price recovered within the hour, retesting previous highs on the day.  Adding to Hedge Funds' risks of liquidation of their clients' assets, short-borrows have now further increased.  This was even more so accelerated, provided today's 'absorption' of three rounds of short-selling in the same business day (and on a relatively high 17M volume).  Interest rates to borrow are now up to 85%, Short Interest is 25% of the float, there have been 35 days of 100% Utilization, and January 2021 levels of shares on loan (22.6 Million) are now present.  💲 **G M E**  investors referred to their observation of this type of investing day as '*routine.'*  Owners of company shares, who invested through January 2021, experienced multiple limit-up halts *per day,* and at least one 'neutral' day was anticipated.  There are three additional investing days in this week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Edit: [I am long GameStop and Tilray](https://imgur.com/a/Z3XYsGE) with play monies and DRS.  I did invest my tax return.

You're either woefully naive, or being deliberately obtuse. The evidence is already out there. There is, without a doubt, a group of powerful people on Wall Street that manipulate the prices of stocks for personal gain, at the expense of the retail investor.\n\nIt has been proven that these firms short sell stocks, often naked, of companies they believe are destined for bankruptcy. They use the financial news outlets that they own to promote negative stories about these companies, they use payment for order flow data to determine weak points in investor sentiment, and *regularly* ignore the \"hard locate\" rule to gain the ability to sell short the *same share* over and over again. \n\nLiterally *all* the big financial firms have been fined for not locating shares. They've *all* been fined for marking short sales as long sales. They've all been fined for lying about their short exposure, marking hard-to-borrow stocks as easy-to-borrow, and in some cases, even programming their algorithms to break these rules *automatically.*\n\nSome of these firms work together to decimate a company's share price, while at the same time, promoting negative stories through the news sources they own, in order to scare retail investors into selling their shares, either to establish a long position at a deep discount, or to inch closer to the ultimate goal of bankrupting the company. This is their ultimate goal, because at that point, they never need to cover their position, and the stock gets moved to the \"expert market\" where it becomes what is referred to as \"cellar boxed.\"\n\nThis is what Wall Street wanted to happen to Gamestop, and that's why they shorted *more than every share that was ever issued by the company,* and constantly promote negative articles on the news outlets they own.\n\nIt's all *very* real, and these firms *definitely* are stealing billions of dollars every year off the backs of people saving for retirement, and regular retail traders. Yes, it's nice to pretend like this is just the free market, and everybody has an equal shot, but it's not true, and you'd have to have a blindfold on to believe it. 90% of trading volume is done by computers, and the laws put in place to protect retail investors are ignored the vast majority of the time. The SEC does nothing but collect small fines that do nothing to discourage the law-breaking.\n\nSo in conclusion, you're wrong as fuck.\n\nAnd as far as GME goes, it is definitely overpriced right now, when compared to its earnings, but it's drastically undervalued when compared to its potential growth over the next few years. Ryan Cohen is a fucking beast, and the team he has surrounded himself with are all A-list talent. He plans to transform Gamestop into a leading Tech company, and his track record is unblemished. Dozens of GME executives quit their jobs at huge tech companies (Amazon, Meta, Apple) to join Gamestop and be compensated by GME shares. There have already been several insider buys at current prices, so they all believe Gamestop will increase in value over the coming years. Oh yeah, and fucking DFV bought 50k shares at $155. If Ryan Cohen, DFV, and Larry Cheng all believe GME is a good buy at $150, I'm gonna believe them much more than I would believe some WSB tard who hasn't even researched the company, and doesn't even know about corruption on Wall Street.
