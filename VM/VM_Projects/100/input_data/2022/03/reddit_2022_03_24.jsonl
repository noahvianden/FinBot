{"title": "Stocks are rising despite US durable-goods orders sink 2.2% and break the winning streak...Are we missing something here?", "selftext": "Orders at U.S. factories for long-lasting goods fell 2.2% in February to break a string of increases and business investment fell for the first time in a year, suggesting manufacturers are still struggling mightily with supply shortages. Orders for U.S durable goods — products meant to last at least three years — shrank for the first time in five months, the government said Thursday. Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal had forecast 1% decline.\n\nThe dropoff was concentrated in passenger planes and autos, two volatile categories that can swing sharply from one month to the next. Yet bookings were soft in every major category except for computers. A more accurate measure of demand, known as core orders, slipped 0.3% in the month. The core number strips out transportation and military hardware. It was first decline in 12 months.\n\n**Big picture:** Businesses still have plenty of demand for big-ticket items despite high inflation and disruptions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Orders for durable goods have climbed 10% over the past year. Headwinds are growing, however.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine could tax already strained global supply chains, as could a coronavirus outbreak in China. At home, the Federal Reserve is moving to raise interest rates to try to bring down high inflation.\n\nEconomists predict U.S. growth will slow this year, but keep expanding at a steady pace.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-durable-goods-orders-sink-2-2-and-break-winning-streak-11648125604?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-durable-goods-orders-sink-2-2-and-break-winning-streak-11648125604?mod=home-page)", "id": "tmcf28", "created_utc": 1648130925.0, "score": 922, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 407, "comments": [{"body": "Inflation - where else do you put your money", "score": 248, "replies": [{"body": "If you think a market collapse is coming, then gold.", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "and for how long are you going to hold that gold", "score": 78, "replies": [{"body": "Material and energy stocks", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Depends on your conviction level that the market is going to crash.

I consider this Q1 \\~40% pullback to be a correction rather than a crash. It's pedantic but it is beneficial to distinguish between the 2. \n\nWhile Q1's pullback is a big one, it's a fairly normal flushing of the market as it's been seen that big institutions are reaccumulating. This suggests this is a correction rather than a \"crash\" by my interpretation. \n\nIn the cycle-ending crash scenario, big institutions are dumping on the markets signaling the emergence of a long-term bear market. The price drop may be similar to that of our correction, but the fundamental drivers of price action have changed behavior, with dramatic consequences for market valuations.\n\nIn these conditions, institutions exit risky positions in favor of risk-off investments like Treasuries, gold, etc. But with Treasuries offering real negative rates, what investment company in its right mind would buy those? They'll likely go to gold/precious metals, or maybe crypto. Couple that with the fact that the majority of global central banks have been accumulating gold in record amounts for the last few years and I think there's an excellent case to be made for a gold bull market. \n\nThere is evidence to suggest that precious metal prices are manipulated via futures, which could be a contributor to its poor performance for a while. I'd argue gold's performance for the last few decades are because the roles it traditionally filled were usurped in large part by the petrodollar, with gold just kind of keeping up with inflation on the sidelines. But we are witnessing the end of the petrodollar system (Russia selling oil in Rubles, Gold, friendly national currencies, Saudi Arabia selling oil in other currencies, emergence of bilateral trade agreements among BRICS and other nations). Gold may have a bigger role in the new financial system to come.\n\nAnyways I digress.

They buy their favorite stocks or index funds that are overweight growth stocks right now.\n* **[US stocks look better than Europe's](https://www.reuters.com/business/global-markets-flows-urgent-2022-03-18/)**. European countries (as are all oil-importing countries who are shunning Russian energy) have a worse near to mid term outlook than we do, on account of the sanctions. This leads to liquidity flows into USS capital markets as US stocks & investments always greatly benefit from foreign turmoil due to the deflection of investment capital away from weaker/disrupted economies into our investments. This week, the catalyst for more EU downside is Europe developing an agreement to boycott Russian oil. The Russian-Ukraine conflict is a huge stock pump for US equities and the US is creating liquidity flows into its capital markets by persuading other countries to climb onto the sanctions & boycott bandwagon. \n* **[End of Quarter Window Dressing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/windowdressing.asp)**.

Powell & the others performed another bait-and-switch, talklng really hawkish and then delivering another inflation-supporting, stock-pumping interest rate decision, that delighted investors.

And Apple will legally have to tell them how to fix the devices rather than rn where they figure it out on their own and bumping into copy write law.\n\nLike you understand a 20% reduction in iPhone sales YOY would mean a decrease of $20billion in revenue but a 66% decrease in net income?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wow. You're the first to ever claim that Apple is one bad quarter from having to worry about bankruptcy. If I were you, I'd be buying puts. You'd be rich. No one in the industry is even worried about Apple being bankrupt. What info do you have?\n\n1. Their financial statements do show that. Marketable securities. They have nearly $60 billion in unrestricted cash if they needed access to it but they don't. Another $120+ billion in long-term securities that again, they have no reason to sell. Why do you focus solely on their liabilities and not their account receivables, then, of which other companies owe them nearly $30 billion? Same concept here.\n2. \"Only made $34 billion.\" 2020, their net income for Q1 was $29 billion. 2019, it was $22 billion. \"Only $34 billion\"? They just recorded their most profitable year of $95 billion in net income last year. Previous high was $60 billion. $275 billion in revenue for year 2020. $365 billion in revenue for year 2021. This is a company that continues to grow.\n3. Maybe you want to look at why Apple's debt is high. Hint: It's a strategy. They leveraged low interest rates much like U.S. bonds to finance their business. Because these rates are so low, they earn more $ off their marketable securities than the rate of the interest on their debt. Also, their money is mostly overseas so they avoid paying U.S. corporate taxes by doing this. It's artificially high because Apple was able to get basically low-interest $ to use. They have nearly $70 billion in debt that is costing them less than what inflation is charging. Imagine a scenario where you can either use $100 of your own money and earn 5% of interest on it or you can borrow $100 and only pay 2%. You pocket the 3% difference. Why wouldn't you? Apple uses this debt to finance their R&D, structure buyback on their shares, and pay dividends to investors. Again, when used correctly, debt is actually a GOOD thing.\n4. Companies already repair iPhones all the time whether it is small businesses or some established iPhone resellers online. That isn't news. I had my iPhone repaired five years ago with generic parts. You're making seem it seem as if this is new and will be a huge issue for Apple in the grand scheme of things. Very few individuals are going to repair their own iPhones.\n5. You keep ignoring the services side of business that will eventually be Apple's most profitable segment. $68 billion in revenue with margins reaching 70% last year. By 2025, it is expected to be Apple's most profitable segment and reach $150 billion in revenue. Apple is diversifying away from their iPhone hardware and are making significant R&D improvements to wearables and AR technology.\n\nBtw, if Apple was worried about their short-term debt, they would decrease or eliminate their dividends. They have been increasing it yearly. They spent $86 billion to repurchase shares last year and paid out $15 billion on dividends in that same period. Since 2012, Apple has spent nearly $500 billion buying back shares. Does this seem like a company that is worried about liquidity? Your concerns are not valid.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "1. I said they have 148 billion in current assets this has all of those number you are talking about so I am not ignoring them. They are called current assets because they can be converted to cash within a year. That's why you can't use the non-current assets for current liabilities which are at all-time highs. Non-current assets are too illiquid to use within a year. So assuming they maintain income levels, they are left with less than 10 billion in the tank.\n2. Oh congrats, their physical inventory increased in value last year due to inflation. So did every other companies' physical inventories last year. And wow, no change to any other segments just iPhones which match the same pattern as every previous year. So Q2-4 inventory will be much lower. Even now I can see the price of the iPhone increased from 2019 to now. \n3. I agree debt can be good in high inflation environments, but this debt will not be refinanced which is what they have been doing for years and why financing operations has only increased from $18 billion 5 years ago to $96 billion last year. The past 4 years have all been about $90 billion. They refinanced this year too but only $28  billion. So we confirm these payments will only increase as they refinance if they refinance. They may make money off marketable assets but they only have $26 billion to access this year. This is why they'd restructure if needed. They'll have it in the future but not this year. \n4. Apple has been against these shops for years. They do everything they can to make it hard to impossible for them to repair iPhones. From proprietary adhesives to software only they have. This will change when they are made to share information with the shops.\n5. Services may be growing but it's not their most profitable segment, iPhones are, and by a long shot. Maybe they can pivot into just services, but I highly doubt it alone will generate more revenue than all segments combined currently make while iPhone regresses.\n\nBecause dividends keep investors in the boat when the water is rocking it. Every company increases dividends to entice investors to stay during times of turbulence. Hint: JB Hunt increased dividend 33% but cut forecasts and bonuses for the company this year. Banks increased dividends heading into 2008 crisis. Oil companies increased dividends while the price of oil per barrel decreased (exception is the events in recent weeks). Maybe they sell authorized shares to come up with cash but all of this still means the stock is overvalued and due for disruption.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. Numbers move around the balance sheet which is why you focusing on current assets makes no sense. It's literally a planned reallocation of money. Liquidity is not an issue.

A big portion of their long-term marketable are on U.S. bonds. It doesn't have to be held until maturity....\n2. IDK what you're talking about. You're making up data.\n3. They locked in their interest. It's not adjusted. Net income was $95 billion last year. They spent near $90 billion on that on buying back shares. If they don't buy back any shares, they would have $90 billion extra in cash. Cash sitting idle does nothing for them so they opted to increase dividends and buybacks to create shareholders value. What are you specifically claiming here? That Apple doesn't have the cashflow to pay off their liabilities? \n4. Such a small part of their business it's not even worth mentioning. The underlying point is people wanted the right to fix it on their own. Not a huge issue monetarily.\n5. By profitable, I meant for every $ in sales, 70% of that is profit. This is why services has quickly become Apple's new golden egg. It's easier to piggyback off their services than to depend on new hardware sales.\n\nYou don't make sense. You're claiming Apple is having liquidity issues but no company having liquidity issues increases their dividends. If their liquidity was becoming an issue, they would decrease or eliminate dividends, grow their cash stack even more, and problem solved. The fact they are distributing cash to their shareholders means they aren't worried about their liabilities impacting their business in a tangible way. You also ignore that Apple spent nearly $90 billion last year buying back outstanding shares. Why? If they have short-term liability issues, why buy back shares? They spent $500 billion the past decade buying back shares. Again, $500 BILLION. If they wanted and truly had liquidity issues, buying back shares is the worst thing they could do as their liquidity issues would hurt the operations of the company and devalue the shares they just bought.\n\nStop.

A potential path is for skins/outfits in games like Fortnite to be able to be purchased through NFT marketplace, and traded amongst players (while EPIC Games may enact a trading fee for trading their in game skins). This allows gamers to have more flexibility with their in-game purchases since now they can sell skins they've purchased to other players and recoup some of the money they spent on the skin. Some rare skins might even sell for more than it was originally purchased. I could go on and on.

They already have their own marketplace and are better off making their virtual items non-resellable, so players need to buy from them for every purchase of a skin. What incentivizes game companies to integrate this open market approach to their items when a closed system operated entirely by them is better in just about every way?", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": ">My biggest issue with people giving this thesis is what incentive does Epic have to sell their skins on an NFT marketplace?\n\nSimple. You can track every transaction on the blockchain. Because of that, you can guarantee that a 2% fee goes to the publisher every time that item is traded. This creates a revenue stream that wasnt there before and has no sunset in site. You think publishers will pass on 2% fees that last forever?\n\nAnd it works out for the customer because they actually have ownership of an item and can trade them as they wish. This is literally win-win for publishers and users. You can keep being blind, but it wont make you any money.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "great question! You’re absolutely right that companies like fortnite already have marketplaces for their games. Who sees their marketplace? Well, mostly just the people who already own the game. If the NFT marketplace has a front page, Fortnite could pay money to have some of their new skins (like a deadpool skin for deadpool 3 for example) be on the front page, so someone like me could see it and be like “damn they got deadpool skins in game? that’s cool, I like Deadpool and I just sold my old skin from cod, the proceeds from that can go towards the deadpool skin”. So in my example the marketplace functions as a way to market the skins and the game to users who weren’t playing the game before. Also, in my example I demonstrate that a user can use 1 currency to buy content for any game. No need for v-bucks or warzone dollars. 1 currency, easier to buy. I don’t have to go to playstation network and buy v bucks packages to buy a skin. Making the purchase easier, which should mean more purchases in general if it’s easy to do. Also, in this example Epic games can charge a trading fee if someone wants to buy someone’s skin. \n\nSo let’s say it’s season 1 of fortnite, they release the john wick skin and it’s popular but they only released in season 1. Now it’s season 20 and the john wick movie is coming out and you want that skin. Originally, Epic only made money off the transactions for the purchase of that skin in season 1, now they profit during season 1 and season 20 when you buy that skin off of someone and epic charges a fee.

You have no interest in multiplayer after the campaign, so move onto another game but there are many people who like multiplayer, so you check the market before you move onto another game.  Turns out that Fortnite made the same skin exclusive in their game (to drive Halo players to play their game), and so those same 5000 NFTs are exclusive in Fortnite and they have it so if you hold it, you get that same skin in theirs.  It isn't magically compatible with all games, just the select developers who think up creative ways to cross platform.\n\nPrior to Fortnite doing this, your skin was only 1x, but because Fortnite is popular, its now 5x the in market currency, so you finally sell it or trade it for something in another game you want.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> The games that have the most continual support and content will have the most popular items (NFTs) which will encourage the players to keep participating.

What incentive do trading card companies have to move to NFTs so that 3rd parties can recreate their own game and allow customers to move to the 3rd party platforms?\n\nOkay sure, let's say Pokemon can now be traded through NFTs.

Right there alone that added revenue stream should make up for however much protest and dropped users you can imagine.\n\nThere's also the fact that it opens up entirely new gaming loops revolving around scarcity.  In the simplest use case, if you can look at the contract and see that new NFTs for that card cannot be minted you then have a guarantee of scarcity and might be willing to spend more on it when it's cheap so you can use it (or trade it).  You can't get that without NFTs when your game always has the possibility of item duplication glitches/hacks being found and the dupes or IRL fakes being traded to innocent people, so people can be a lot more confident in a card's value.  Also let's be real, people will always fund gold farming black markets anyways if a game allows you to just create supply, NFTs at least ensure the devs (and affected players too depending on the smart contract) will always get a cut of that.\n\nOr, you could allow minting NFT cards as a prize for tournaments, maybe have an entrance fee/ante where everyone has to stake a card.  This could even be completely automatic as say an off-the-cuff Discord tourney thanks to smart contracts (with diminishing better prizes if more people play or something).  You could allow tracking to see which regions have a high amount of players with Charizards or uranium reserves, or only allow birth-death processes with realistic mutation and evolution (data-intensive from tracking/non-fungibility) naturally taken care of by the NFT metadata and smart contracts.\n\nIn fact, with smart contracts you can go further than regular games since nothing's stopping other people from creating new smart contracts on top of the game's, adding functionality or new minting procedures of their own NFTs to the game's assets, so long as they aren't affecting existing NFT scarcity or rules.  \n\nYou'd have the world's first online mods that can add layers of interactability around existing NFTs (without taking years or needing the game's files) but not affecting anyone else's experience.  You could have items or whole tokenized systems be a part of multiple games.  You could have EVE-style shareholder voting on changes to the game where the top players/certain (elected?)

{"title": "Article: “These 3 Charts Strongly Suggest the U.S. Stock Market Has an Invisible Hand Propping It Up” By Pam Martens, March 23, 2022", "selftext": "[**Link to Article**](https://archive.today/qfEff)\n\n# ============\n\n# “These 3 Charts Strongly Suggest the U.S. Stock Market Has an Invisible Hand Propping It Up” By Pam Martens: March 23, 2022\n\nAs someone who has watched trading screens for the past 36 years, it’s pretty easy to spot a fake market. As the charts below indicate, there is an invisible hand (or hands) pushing this stock market up when it should be plunging. The likely suspects are U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s Plunge Protection Team, known as [the Exchange Stabilization Fund](https://archive.ph/9NWoh); foreign central banks that are aligned with the U.S. position on Ukraine and want to help stabilize financial markets in the West; hedge funds and [Wall Street’s Dark Pools](https://archive.ph/f2Pin) owned by megabanks that are net long the market; or a combination of all of the above.\n\nOne thing’s for sure, the stock market is not responding in a normal fashion to soaring inflation, a hawkish Fed, spiking interest rates, and military aggression by an out-of-control dictator with 6,000 nuclear warheads.\n\nConsider the chart below: since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has skyrocketed by 20 percent, currently reaching 2.38 percent. That was a correct and normal reaction since inflation is already soaring in the U.S. and the military aggression is going to disrupt oil and gas supplies from Russia via sanctions, thus likely pushing commodity prices even higher. In a normally functioning stock market, an increase in yield of that magnitude on the 10-year Treasury note would have caused the stock market to plunge. Instead, per the chart below, the S&P 500 stock index has actually risen 5 percent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n[Yield on 10-Year U.S. Treasury vs S&P 500 Since Russian Invasion of Ukraine](https://preview.redd.it/xbv9tduqzdp81.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=068c0bb077701262987ff0b646cd0e5200a7b98b)\n\nThe stock market’s bizarre behavior is further evidenced by the chart below. It shows how the S&P 500 stock index has performed in relation to the S&P GSCI commodity index since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Notice particularly how the dramatic spike in commodity prices between February 24 and March 8 was not met with a dramatic plunge in stock prices during that same period. It should have been. Then there is the equally important fact of a big yawn from the stock market as a nuclear power invades a sovereign nation of 44 million people, bombs its cities and towns to rubble, and persists in making threats against the U.S. and allies that are supporting Ukraine. Commodity Prices vs S&P 500 Since Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\n[Commodity Prices vs S&P 500 Since Russian Invasion of Ukraine](https://preview.redd.it/hwmsc28vzdp81.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=da96f6ed1248fbe6e58f21e6881ce80955b0fb68)\n\nAnd, finally, there is the disparate reaction of the stock market versus the correct share price reaction of the global banks that will be impacted by the Russian invasion. The chart below shows the radically different response from the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500 index, versus global banks since February 1, 2022. We selected the date of February 1 because that was the point at which Russia had amassed 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders, backed up with tanks and artillery. The global banks shown on the chart below are those with significant exposure to Russia. The worst performing of these, Austria’s Raiffeisenbank, has lost 50 percent of its value while the S&P 500 is down less than one percent from February 1 as of yesterday’s market close.\n\nThe stock market is supposed to be an efficient pricing mechanism. When it stops efficiently pricing risk, it loses the public’s confidence. Those invisible hands should think long and hard about that reality.\n\n[S&P 500 Stock Index vs Global Banks Since February 1, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/ahi2uacxzdp81.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=914900ba2c9e720507be381c1ccc020df6fb59c2)", "id": "tlxrkw", "created_utc": 1648096570.0, "score": 242, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|24|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|180|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tlxrkw)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tlxrkw)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Calls it is.", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t get the inflation argument.

The stock market loves wars. Granted wars are inflationary, but the stock market also likes inflation when it comes with demand. \n\nRate hikes? Do a study on the history of rate hikes and track small hikes, particularly at low rate levels, and then correlate them with market declines. I already did the work on this... they don't correlate. The market, rightfully, doesn't care very much about small rate hikes.\n\n2018? The declines there were due to government shutdowns and debt ceiling crises, which we've memory holed because it conflicts with the completely made up narrative that small rate hikes hurt the market. In truth, during most of the rate hikes and between the two larger governmental macro crises, the market increased by a fairly solid 20% for the 6 months through to September, when the market typically breaks down due to repositioning which also coincided with the start of the government shutdown fear. \n\nBasically, \"the market's not doing what I want\" is the oldest complaint in the world. We've all been there.. but it's a bias that ignores the mechanics of what the market is: A fuckin' money machine that takes money from some pockets and puts it into others... all movements of the market feed that monkey, and the rationales are just a justification and a motivating factor for the state of play.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

But, they won't, because the more decay there is, and the less miles, the more revolutions of cycles are created, decaying the batteries further, requiring more purchases.

We’ve gone from electric cars having a range of less than 50 miles to over 500 miles. \n\nSecond, charging at a place with a supercharger, today you can go from <10% to >80% usually in less than 30 minutes. \n\nThird, solar panels are not the godsend you might hope for. The best panels today, generate 400 watts, and that’s at peak conditions (basically noon on a cloudless day). In real world scenarios, that panel is likely to generate about 1200 wH (watt hours) of electricity in a day (my math is you get roughly 3x the wattage as watt hours on a good day). By way of comparison, a model 3 (without the HVAC turned on) drives at roughly 240 wH/m (watt hours per mile). So, the best panel on the market, on a good day, will only generate 5 miles of range for you on a Model 3. I don’t have any idea what the wH/m on these vans is, but based on weight alone I would guess significantly higher than a Model 3. To get 500 miles of range from solar panels in a single day, you would need 100 panels - and that’s just for the Model 3. \n\nSo, battery capacity and the ability to fill it quickly are not major problems today, and the rate of progress on both of these fronts is astounding.
