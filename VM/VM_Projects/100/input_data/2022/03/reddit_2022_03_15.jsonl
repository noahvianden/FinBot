{"title": "Barclay's Suspended VXX ETN Share Creation - Implications and Trades?", "selftext": "Yesterday Barclay's announced that they are suspending any further sales from inventory/issuance of VXX shares.  This is the ETN that holds the front two months of /VX VIX futures contracts.  Since the announcement, VXX has become decoupled from the VX futures prices, and is trading at a massive premium over NAV.   \n    \nVXX implied volatility also spiked to >200%, as there is anticipation of a short squeeze.  However, there is some historical precedence of this occurring to TVIX and once share issuance was resumed the price cratered.   \n   \nAnyone considering trading this ticker?  Lots of premium on the table to sell calls; however, if they go ITM I don't know what share availability will be to short VXX.  There also seems like there is an arbitrage opportunity here, by going long the front month(s) VX futures contracts and shorting VXX.  Again if a squeeze occurs and the share HTB rate skyrockets or becomes not available to borrow, that could be problematic.  \n   \nWould love to hear others thoughts on this situation.  \n  \n**Update: VXX trading halted multiple times on circuit breaker.**\n    \n    \n\n\nHere is a link to the article: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220314005483/en/Barclays-Suspends-Until-Further-Notice-Further-Sales-and-Issuances-of-Two-Series-of-iPath%C2%AE-ETNs-the-%E2%80%9CETNs%E2%80%9D", "id": "telo0o", "created_utc": 1647339164.0, "score": 164, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "\nBarclays Suspends Creation Units for VXX   \nBill Luby   \nVIX and more blog     \nhttps://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2022/03/barclays-suspends-creation-units-for-vxx.html  \n\nQuotations:  \n\n>As for VXX, the reasons for the halt in creation units are not exactly clear.

{"title": "Putin Signs Law Allowing Russian Air Carriers to Seize Western Jets Worth $10B", "selftext": "https://www.thedrive.com/news/44754/putin-signs-law-allowing-russian-air-carriers-to-seize-western-jets-worth-10b\n\n**The Russian government wants to allow for the repurposing of more than 500 jets for domestic travel.**\n\nWith the Russian invasion of Ukraine now about to enter its third week, cascading impacts across global commerce are cropping up by the day. This trend continued Monday, as state-owned media agency TASS reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed an order allowing for the seizure of over 500 commercial jets that Russian airlines have leased from Western companies. It is an unprecedented move for the global aviation industry.\n\nThe law comes after a period where the future of the jets was unclear. With many countries banning flights from Russia, including the entirety of the European Union and the United States, many Western aircraft leasing firms sought to repossess the jets, with the EU providing a March 28 deadline to any European firms to recover their property. Russia's airlines reportedly operate 728 Western-made aircraft in total, and it's believed that 515 aren't owned by these air carriers—instead, they are leased from other companies. The foreign airplanes are primarily made by either Boeing (332 total planes) or Airbus (304 total planes), and both companies have announced they will not be supplying parts or technical support to Russian carriers until further notice. Now, the Russian government has allowed domestic airliners to keep the planes—valued at a cumulative $10 billion dollars—and break lease agreements.\n\nThis leads to further logistical problems for Russia's domestic airliners. All planes have to be certified as airworthy by their country of origin, and most of Russia's leased fleet has lost that certification. The planes primarily come from Bermudan and Irish companies, whose governments have already revoked the planes' ability to fly under international law. As a result, the seized planes will not be allowed in international airspace until those certifications are reinstated. The Kremlin is seeking to change Russian airworthiness certification laws to allow for domestic agencies to certify foreign aircraft as safe and worthy for travel, which would allow them to be flown domestically. Without a supply of fresh parts for maintenance and repairs, though, it's unclear how long carriers can keep the planes in the air. \n\nEven more critically for the country, registering an airplane in two countries at once is not allowed by rules defined by the United Nation's 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, which set international standards for airspace. If Russian airlines decide to take advantage of Putin's new law and seize the jets, re-registering them in Russia, they risk destroying relationships with manufacturers and lessors and may be disallowed from international airspace going forward. If they let the planes sit indefinitely, it could spell financial catastrophe as significant portions of their fleets stay grounded. Aeroflot, Russia's largest air carrier and a state-owned company, has already flown most of its foreign-owned planes back to Russia ostensibly to prevent repossession, but it has not re-registered any of the planes yet. \n\nIt is hard to determine how, exactly, this affects global travel and aviation companies. The Russian breach with decades-old international law hasn't been done before and threatens the very model of the aircraft leasing business, which depends on allowing international owners to repossess unpaid airliners. With that standard upended, even if the invasion is withdrawn and sanctions recede, it could be quite a long time before the dust settles and the fate of the trapped airliners is clear.\n\n**A Lousy Offer from the Start**\n\n\"It's a lousy offer coupled to an even worse offer,\" said last week Eddy Pieniazek, head of analytics and advisory at aviation consultancy, Ishka in the United Kingdom. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, the roubles has dropped by roughly 30%. Leasing contracts are valued in US dollars, which is the currency that the leasing business acquires and purchases planes. With Russia expelled from the SWIFT system, hindering its ability to conduct financial transactions, it becomes\nincreasingly difficult for Russian airlines to make\npayments at all.\n\nIf contracts are canceled, the Cape Town Convention\nrequires airlines to return aircraft with little intervention,\nwhich Western sources claimed as of last week was not\nhappening, despite Russia's insistence that the sanctions\nare unjustified.\n\n\"Cape Town should be involved, implying a smooth\naircraft recovery operation. What they're proposing is that\nall of the aircraft's contracts be broken\" Pieniazek\nremarked.\n\n**Global Leasing Mass Default**\n\nSanctions have blocked off Russia's procurement of most aircraft and parts, which forced international flights to be canceled for fear of their aircraft being confiscated by foreign lessors or banks. The sanctions have also frozen a large portion of Russia's foreign reserves, forcing authorities to explore measures to halt withdrawals of foreign cash.\n\nIf the dispute threatened the world's biggest mass default for the global leasing business, which possesses over 50% of the world's airliner fleet, the leased aircraft law signed by Putin complicates the situation further. Experts fear the subsequent wave of claims might spark a decade-long court struggle between lessors and insurers over whether or not war-risk insurance will payout.", "id": "teip65", "created_utc": 1647326125.0, "score": 870, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 272, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Saudi officials have said they were shocked by the precipitous [U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/last-u-s-troops-leave-afghanistan-after-nearly-20-years-11630355853?mod=article_inline) last year.\n\nChina buys more than 25% of the oil that Saudi Arabia exports. If priced in yuan, those sales would boost the standing of China’s currency. The Saudis are also considering including yuan-denominated futures contracts, known as the petroyuan, in the pricing model of [Saudi Arabian Oil Co](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SA/XSAU/2222). , known as Aramco.\n\nIt would be a profound shift for Saudi Arabia to price even some of its roughly 6.2 million barrels of day of crude exports in anything other than dollars. The majority of [global oil sales](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-markets-dow-update-03-15-2022-11647333255?mod=article_inline)—around 80%—are done in dollars, and the Saudis have traded oil exclusively in dollars since 1974, in a deal with the Nixon administration that included security guarantees for the kingdom. \n\nChina [introduced yuan-priced oil contracts in 2018](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-attempts-to-supplant-dollar-face-historic-difficulties-1522063947?mod=article_inline) as part of its efforts to make its currency tradable across the world, but they haven’t made a dent in the dollar’s dominance of the oil market. For China, using dollars has become a hazard highlighted by U.S. sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program and on Russia in response to [the Ukraine invasion](https://wsj.com/livecoverage/latest-updates/russia-ukraine-latest-news).\n\nChina has stepped up its courtship of the Saudi kingdom. In recent years, China has helped Saudi Arabia [build its own ballistic missiles](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-begin-making-ballistic-missiles-with-chinese-help-11640294886?mod=article_inline), consulted on a nuclear program and begun investing in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s pet projects, [such as Neom](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-crown-princes-vision-for-neom-a-desert-city-state-tests-his-builders-11619870401?mod=article_inline), a futuristic new city. Saudi Arabia has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping [to visit later this year](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-invites-chinas-xi-to-visit-kingdom-amid-strained-u-s-relations-11647284211?reflink=mobilewebshare_twitter&mod=article_inline).\n\nMeanwhile the Saudi relationship with the U.S. has deteriorated under President Biden, who said in the 2020 campaign that [the kingdom should be a “pariah](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-urged-to-penalize-saudi-crown-prince-over-khashoggi-killing-11614546231?mod=article_inline)” for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Prince Mohammed, who U.S. intelligence authorities say ordered Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, refused to sit in on a call between Mr. Biden and the Saudi ruler, King Salman, last month.\n\nIt also comes as the U.S. economic relationship with the Saudis is diminishing. The U.S. is now among the top oil producers in the world. It once imported 2 million barrels of Saudi crude a day in the early 1990s but those numbers have fallen to less than 500,000 barrels a day in December 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nBy contrast, China’s oil imports have swelled over the last three decades, in line with its expanding economy. Saudi Arabia was China’s top crude supplier in 2021, selling at 1.76 million barrels a day, followed by Russia at 1.6 million barrels a day, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs.\n\n“The dynamics have dramatically changed.

So here's Part I:\n\nTo understand why your post is incorrect, you have to first understand the truly fucked up history of the gold standard; Monetary rules were not regulatory laws, the gold standard was never adopted for very long and the gold standard was a loose rule based on an \"accident\" by Sir Isaac Newton when he was Master of the Mint (more on this in a second). \n\nSilver was used by almost all of human civilization as the main currency and backed what are called \"commodity currencies\". Gold became used as a standard first in England in the early 18th century and it is deeply tied into the insane historical saga that is the South Sea Bubble, that basically forced the world's entire economic system to be restructured overnight and involves a diverse range of extremely famous historical figures, most central of which is Sir Isaac Newton. We know Newton today as the brilliant mathematician and physicist he is today, but he was an intensely controversial figure during his day, in court, society, science and economics. The reason gold ever became a standard is because Sir Isaac Newton - whom was Master of the Royal Mint - set the price of gold to 15.5 times the price of silver at a fixed rate. \n\nSee historians like to try and avoid casting aspersions on Newton, but the reality is that he lost a substantial portion of his fortune in the South Sea Bubble (he was still quite rich mind you, but he was immensely humiliated by the extent of his losses as he communicated to his contemporary (and totally not long-term boyfriend) Fatio de Duillier) and - as Master of the Royal Mint - he received a small percentage of each coin minted, giving him very serious motivation, means and access to his coincidental \"mistake\" where he priced gold at 15.5 times the price of silver. Any new addition of minted coins to the treasury would mean that Newton would amass significant wealth and following his \"accident\" new coins had to be minted for the entire British economy as silver coins were washed out in favor of gold, increasing Newton's wealth substantially, but this was largely buried under the fury of the public controversy between Newton and Leibniz over who invented calculus - and by extent the mathematical foundations for the principles of gravitational force.\n\nThe shift was so sudden and unstoppable, that subsequent Chancellors of the Exchequer and Masters of the Mint were unable to reverse the \"mistake\" and Britain's massive colonial influence resulted in the introduction of the gold standard to the international markets, which may have also been partially due to Prime Minister Walpole intervening and replacing the Chancellor of the Exchequer shortly thereafter with someone that was more politically friendly to the Whig party (totally not to save face for the party and avoid another controversy as it was rising to absolute dominance in British politics, largely off the back of Walpole's admittedly genius political machinations during and after the South Sea Bubble).\n\nSo yeah, that's how gold - a religious metal for the entirety of human history - supplanted silver as the \"standard\" currency of the British empire (which to this day still refers to the Pound as a pound sterling, as in sterling silver). The British government would go on to force trade in gold and silver, creating the complicated economic trade system that is the hallmark of post-bubble mercantilism. Unsurprisingly, the gold standard was a political firestorm and was never truly enforced as a \"gold standard\" due to silver still being more plentiful a resource and lighter (therefore more manageable logistically). The British government often played fast and loose with gold values to manage financial issues in the Empire, most often defaulting to equivalent silver value by tonnage (again, because silver was more manageable logistically).\n\nThis remained the status of gold and silver until the introduction of bank notes and speculative markets in the early 19th century and the popularization of fiat currency (they really originated in the early 16th century, but there's plenty of hairs to split there and arguments you could make about the first \"true\" futures markets, but that's all scholarly noise where you could credibly even argue that the South Sea company's stock was a form of fiat currency). These concepts arose with the industrial revolution, that resulted in the period of modernization that led to the 20th century, when fiat currency became the dominant form of currency. There's a lot of complicated reasons why fiat currency supplanted gold standards the world over, but it's tied closely to Britain's pressuring of gold use for the global market and the absolute clustefuck that was French governance for the latter half of the 18th century. Coin shortages were routine in France, meaning their colonies couldn't get coins (specifically Canada) and their dealings with the colonial America were often conducted on bills of credit. This paved the way for the dual currency system.\n\nMost countries in the 18th and 19th century had two forms of currency. A deflationary \"hard currency\" that was a commodity currency (usually a specie) and a form of paper money that served as a notice of debt owed to the owner, which was backed by the issuing treasury. This was pretty much the modus operandi of the colonial powers up until World War I, when the supply of metals was fucked up the World War, along with a giant pile of debt accumulated by Europe, which was owned in no small part by the United States (the collection on this debt was what fueled the roaring 20s in the United States). However, because the United States had made the gold standard official in 1900, it was required by law to maintain and distribute this gold to people. Because the US was a mix of agrarian and industrial economies, there was a major problem during farm harvests where people would essentially make runs on the bank to get the gold value for their crop out of their local bank before it was gone. Because gold is logistically difficult to transport and manage - and was transported primarily by train - banks would often run into issues where they be forced to issue IOUs when they ran out of gold. Mind you that we're skipping over the entire Coinage Act controversy from the late 19th century here in the interest of expedience, but understand that IOUs and paper notes were *massively* controversial in the United States up until World War II due to a lot of Americans getting *majorly* fucked by the switch off of silver minting.\n\nAll of this is important to know, because the US was forced to leave the gold standard in 1933. The collapse of the stock market, the runs on the bank and the beginning of World War II had created a situation in which commodity currency was no longer viable and too volatile to manage a modern war effort (as the Weimar Republic learned the hard way). This switch to fiat currency ended up being a masterstroke by the United States, leading to the creation of the modern stock market and debt lending system that would eventually take over the entire world. The only real problem was getting everyone on board with the same system, which would not have been possible if it weren't for World War I and World War II absolutely devastating Europe while colonies in Africa and Asia got massively fucked by a combination of apathy in their colonizer's home countries and bitter sabotage by colonialists losing grips of power over those countries and the civil wars that ravaged countries like China and Vietnam/Laos/Cambodia (this gets into a whole other thing about territorial borders and the absolute inanity of colonial land division).\n\nSuffice it to say, fiat currency would go on to supplant all commodity currencies in the aftermath of World War II, allowing much more structured methods of debt consolidation and brought the world together to agree on a number of treaties. The most important of which for the purposes of this conversation is the Bretton Woods Agreement. It's kind of hard to really properly communicate the ramifications of the Bretton Woods Agreement, but put very simply, the Bretton Woods Agreement is why the dollar is the world's reserve currency. It basically established that all countries would pay within 1% the gold value of the agreed upon exchange rate (then around $28) and the Agreement established the US-funded International Monetary Fund to handle any disparities in payments. This means the United States took on immense financial risk (because the gold standard is insanely volatile due to it being an unstable commodity), but that all practical international business in America, Japan and most of Europe would require the US dollar. Since all of those economies exploded after World War II, the dollar became the default world currency.\n\nPart II starts below.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Part II:\n\nThe petrodollar is a separate concept (it's a bunch of concepts, but we'll just settle for the one that specifically talks about the exchange of the US dollar for a barrel of petroleum). When the Nixon Admin oversaw the US leaving the Bretton Woods system and abandoning the gold standard, the United States opened relations with China and negotiated with OPEC the creation of the petrodollar. This was largely founded under the principle that US contracting and technological resources would be used to help OPEC member states find and exploit oil fields in their home countries, along with concessions in political support for certain situations like in Palestine (which we are not fucking discussing here). The end result was that the world's most valued resource now required dollars and the price of oil was stabilized. This also directly caused the inflation crisis in the 1970s, which would eventually leave Carter with the unenviable task of releasing oil reserves owned by the United States for nationalization to OPEC member states, which ultimately fueled OPEC member investment in the United States that would characterize the \"oil boom\" of the 1980s, but destroyed Carter's legacy.\n\nThis created the modern US economy. No longer a manufacturing economy like it was the 1960s (and virtually the world's sole manufacturing superpower for nearly a decade), the US transitioned to an investment and speculation economy, that complimented the system of USD confidence commoditization completely. Through much of the 1980s, the stock market became the central fixation as the marker of economic success in the United States, which it is, though not the daily exchanges, but more the trends the exchanges evince, which has only gotten exponentially moreso the case as humans have been supplanted by trading automation and much greater economic focus shifted toward hedging in the mid 80s and especially with the emergence of the pretty much entirely speculative .COM economy in the 90s.\n\nWe're now at the modern day. Oil can't move off the dollar, because literally all energy investment is tied to USDs. Any real attempts to move off it would collapse the petrodollar overnight, dragging the entire world into recession and rendering trillions in OPEC investments valueless, along with Chinese-owned American debt. Threats to price oil at other currencies have been made by OPEC since the establishment of OPEC (indeed, the ability to leverage this threat is part of the reason OPEC exists and predates the \"petrodollar\" itself as we know it by 11 years).\n\nIt's also not just that all petroleum production is tied up in USDs, it's that *every single industry* connected to the petroleum industry is tied up in USDs. Shipwrighting, refinement, surveying, security, contracting, grading, commodity production, speculation, securities, stocks, bonds, debt - everything is tied up in infinitely printed USDs - meaning that it's literally mathematically impossible to supplant the USD without creating the worst economic collapse in human history.\n\nThis is an especially important point to understand because people think that OPEC has leverage because they produce a lot of oil. This is incorrect. The Middle East has geological characteristics that - again oversimplifying - make its sweet crude much, much cheaper to refine for plastics and fuels. The grade of oil you get out of a country like Saudi Arabia or Oman is so conducive to refinement for plastics and fuels that it is cheaper to ship a container of it to a refinery off the SE coast of Texas than it is to ship US-exploited oil pumped right outside of Galveston. This is why despite the fact that the United States is a net exporter, it still purchases massive amounts of oil from OPEC and why OPEC will maintain political influence over the world as long as people still need plastics and gas - and also why OPEC will always be dependent on the petrodollar.\n\nAlso, just as a side note, plastics make up 70% of the petroleum industry. Gasoline/Petrol are a tiny sliver of the petroleum market. Sweet crude is more complicated, as that includes natural gas and is skewed a little bit because the United States has pretty massive natural gas reserves (that can unfortunately only be exploited through fracking and Russia's in the same boat with the exception being that the North Sea reserves are a long-term plan for Russia (and are now a focus of US and European exploitation, though Russia has a head start on the tech to exploit a melting arctic), which includes purposefully allowing global warming to happen to give Russia access to arctic sweet crude reserves).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's not.

There's no reason for this to happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChina is getting dirt cheap oil from Russia.. it's a captured market. So they have oil, more than they've had. Any orders to Saudi Arabia will be a Russian market size smaller. It's the same with other resources that Russia sells. They're now at a super discount for China. China could insult Russia, and Russia would have no choice to but to sell to China at the price that China dictates. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSaudi can only spend yuan in China because only 3.2% of the world market uses Yuan. So Saudi might as well be accepting Canadian Tire money as well. There's nothing in it for Saudi Arabia. What's the point on accepting a currency that is only good in 1 spot?  There is no point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if China makes many goods, the fact is that Yuan is only good in China. Remember what makes a currency.. it's universally accepted. The Yuan is not a world currency. USD, Euro, Gold, Bitcoin, Ethereum are.  Saudi can get everything in USD, the majority of the world trade is based on USD, all of the goods available are in USD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Yuan has food, and cheap goods. There's some potential use there, but not enough to destabilize a market that both Saudi and China depend on, especially considering China's current situation. China would have to be paying much more for the oil in order to get Saudi on board. And they don't have too, because they just got Russian oil at a discount for the foreseeable future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is most likely a Putin driven campaign using it's OPEC ties with Saudi Arabia that has been assisting Russia over the last couple of weeks. It's a bid to get Trump back in office due to his ties with Saudi Arabia and Russia. It's a power play by Russia and Saudi Arabia to change the power in the US as midterms approach for Biden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll G7 nations currency are traded in relation to the USD. So you'd have to add up all of that buying power, plus any other nations that do the same, like Mexico, most of S. America. It would destabilise world trade with the result that less trade goes to China (because China is devaluing their currency to support trade with the US).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe goods that come out of China are not the goods that Saudi's traditionally buy. They buy ultra-luxury goods (BMW, Mercedes, Porcha, jaguar, ect.. ) , which in China and Saudi are sold by the EU, the US, and Japan. China doesn't sell any luxuries that provide any sort of status on the world stage. Saudi's like bling and to show status. They buy the top names, of which none are from China, even though some are partially sourced in China. So it's not about goods that nobody is interested in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Sanctions on Russia also mean by definition that more oil will be purchased from Saudi, from both the US and the G7. This is more reason not to upset the status quo. Less purchases would occur from China.. because they have Russian oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere's the point of Saudi juggling the price of oil in two currencies that could see discounts in one of the other based on fluctuations.. especially since the Yuan (newly released from being pegged to the dollar) would result in compounding a Chinese recession currently in full swing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now, at this moment when Russia is loosing the war and within 2-3 weeks won't even be able to wage it as they're unable to replace lost armor and aircraft and the public is becoming more aware each day. It's a meaningless baseless threat that was likely initiated by Putin based on promises to Saudi Arabia and China in order to get Trump back in office or weaken Biden. Biden is a huge issue for Putin. Putin desperately wants the US to join the war to force China to go in, even though China is going through a Covid crisis and a recession based on the collapse of it's housing market.. which was triggered by Xi's changes in policy. And all this during a re-election year for Xi.\n\nIt's political pressure and FUD.\n\nRecessions are a reorganization of trade. When you change trade practices it triggers a recession. This would trigger a world recession which would result in a massive diminishing of Chinese power over a resource that China doesn't really need, thanks to Putin's mistake in attacking Ukraine and his inability to see the level of Sanctions placed upon it, even though they were clearly warned.\n\nIf Saudi is trying to get military equipment, than that would technically be a trade of goods, but it would still be based on the USD, as the Yuan is a derivative. They value would be used to gauge the equality of the trade.

Methods vary greatly, and different technical analysts can sometimes make contradictory predictions from the same data. Many investors claim that they experience positive returns, but academic appraisals often find that it has little predictive power.\\[48\\] Of 95 modern studies, 56 concluded that technical analysis had positive results, although data-snooping bias and other problems make the analysis difficult.\\[6\\]*\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical\\_analysis#Empirical\\_evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis#Empirical_evidence)\n\nI think it's possible that there is some positive predictive value simply due to the number of traders who *believe* it will work and therefore use it.  But, as shown in even the studies that found technical analysis to have some value, the effect of this is rather small.\n\nOn the second paragraph: I disagree that the only way to keep the market going up is to create more inflation.  I have no idea where you got that.  S&P 500 PEs are a bit above historical averages, but not wildly so.  Most of the 1960s and 1990s were around where we are now, and our low rate environment should make us expect higher-than-normal PEs: [https://www.macrotrends.net/assets/images/large/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart.png](https://www.macrotrends.net/assets/images/large/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart.png)\n\nThere are pockets of the market that I wouldn't touch.  But there are also parts that I think are looking somewhat cheap.  There's a lot of fear present, and sentiment is rather low.

Which should be easy! \n\nI previously ran, for >10yrs, a VW diesel repair shop on my own, out of passion for the (at the time) unparalleled efficiency of those special engines. The atrocious, terrible, UNBELIEVABLE, experiences that some of those owners went through at the hands of the VW dealers left me with practically no choice but to offer a better alternative. It wasn’t isolated, rare malcontents. It was real incompetence on a national scale that somehow was not conspiratorial. They all just sucked as a coincidence. And “sucked” is putting it lightly. I do not want Tesla to be like that. It can’t be like that or it will wreck the mission. I have a great job right now but I want to throw that away so I can help Tesla not suck at service. It’s super important to me. I follow it closely on TMC and I assure you it is a real concern.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Need timing help because I truly suck at it.

Therefore, any purchase of the ETNs in the secondary market may be at a purchase price significantly different from their indicative value. In particular, paying a premium purchase price over the indicative value of the ETNs could lead to significant losses in the event you sell your ETNs at a time when such premium is no longer present in the marketplace or if we redeem the ETNs at our discretion. Investors should consult their financial advisors before purchasing or selling the ETNs, especially ETNs trading at a premium over their indicative value. Furthermore, if you sell your ETNs at a price which reflects a discount below the intraday indicative value, you may experience a significant loss.*", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Look and compare the volume in the first few minutes today, that should give you an indication.\n\nBut nobody here knows, it could literally go anywhere as explained in the DD.\n\n[Here’s an attempted analogy](https://twitter.com/thelastbearsta1/status/1503500723962658818?s=21) of what happened yesterday.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, that analogy really helped. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Any idea what happens after Friday, after the expiry of the futures?
