If you only had a reasonable amount in it and you really believed the fundamentals are strong, you wouldn’t be here looking for reassurance. In the future, make sure you diversify when investing or use stop loss if you’re trading. \n\nWith that out of the way, the market is in a total risk off mode right now. Everyone has been rotating out of growth and tech in general for a while and now financials too (so triple whammy for PYPL). I think it might take a while, but the market will eventually go risk on again and inevitably rotate back into growth and tech, and financials will recovered too. \n\nIf you have a long time horizon and really like PYPL as a company, you can ride this out. On the other hand, some companies recover better and faster after a market down turn. So if you think there are better companies out there, it could be worth selling all or part of your PYPL shares for a loss and moving that capital into those better companies. Just as an example, if you think putting money in companies A,B, and C will let your portfolio recover faster than staying with PYPL, then that’s what you should do even if it’s painful to take the loss from PYPL right now. \n\nIf you decide to move your money around though, really think about what percentage of your portfolio each company deserves at what price and wait patiently. You don’t have to redeploy all your capital right away. Wait for the right prices on the right companies.\n\nAnyway, my personal thought is: PYPL got a big boost from the pandemic lock down, easy monetary policies and tech/growth hype. But now the pandemic is easing, fed is about to start tightening, and tech/growth hype is down. Worsening  inflation could also lead to less transactions, further slowing down its growth. So in an environment where many companies are going on sale, PYPL won’t be at the top of most people’s shopping lists. And even when tech starts rallying again, I don’t believe PYPL will be one of the bigger winners. I do, however, believe it will recover to your buy price, because you bought low enough. I don’t know for sure if it will be by the end of this year, but it is very possible as long as they show good numbers. I don’t expect all time highs any time soon though, especially with so many bag holders just waiting for a chance to exit, unless PYPL does something amazing. \n\nI do hope you feel better soon, you sound too stressed.

Equity futures earlier were already pointing to declines in Japan and Hong Kong and a muted start in Australia. \n\nThe dollar was mixed against key peers in early trading. Demand for havens has taken a greenback gauge to the highest since 2020 and spurred a rally in sovereign bonds. Yields retreated in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe Swiss franc, another bolthole in times of stress, slipped after a governing board member of the Swiss National Bank said it’s ready to intervene to tackle rapid strengthening. \n\nOil has topped $115 a barrel, climbing along with grains and metals on concerns of supply disruptions due to Russia’s military action, ensuing sanctions and a reluctance to trade with a resource-rich nation that’s becoming a global pariah. Traders are also assessing a drop in Libyan output.\n\nAn index of commodities jumped the most last week on record, raising the specter of escalating price pressures. The global economy was already struggling with high inflation due to pandemic-era snarls. \n\nThe Federal Reserve and other key central banks face the tricky task of tightening monetary policy to contain the cost of living without upending economic expansion or roiling risky assets.\n\n“For the U.S. economy, we now see stagflation, with persistently higher inflation and less economic growth than expected before the war,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note. “For stock investors, we think 2022 will continue to be one of this bull market’s toughest years.”\n\nFed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Friday the central bank should increase interest rates to close to its “neutral” setting this year, implying as many as seven quarter-point hikes.\n\n“Central banks are facing an exogenous stagflationary shock they cannot do much about,” Silvia Dall’Angelo, senior economist at Federated Hermes, wrote in a note.\n\nIn Russia, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree allowing the government and companies to pay foreign creditors in rubles, seeking to stave off defaults while capital controls remain in place. Sanctions will determine if international investors are able to collect payments, the Finance Ministry said.\n\nChina signaled more stimulus is on the cards by setting an economic growth target above forecasts. Premier Li Keqiang vowed at the opening of the National People’s Congress, the Communist Party-controlled parliament, to take bold steps to protect the economy as risks mount.\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/stocks-face-oil-risks-amid-talk-of-russia-embargo-markets-wrap-1.1733378\n\nLive oil quote: https://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil", "id": "t8b03s", "created_utc": 1646608017.0, "score": 395, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 177, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

All of this has been very predictable. Personally, by mid-Q1 of this year I was in over 60% in old energy and minerals, mining & metals. Also defense contractors. My sector allocation charts are extremely lopsided. I’ve been watching in disbelief as ESG investors keep piling money into new energy tech, led by people like Cathy Woods, while energy prices approached a point of no return.\n\nEnergy prices have been steadily rising for months because chronic low investment in the oil, gas & coal sectors means low capital investment, which means few new reserves and limited equipment & labor. OPEC hasn’t been able to meet its quotas because of these production limitations, even as oil prices rise. And instead of funding energy production adequately, investors are heaping trillions onto companies like TSLA for ridiculous things like luxury EVs that don’t actually reduce carbon footprint or energy consumption much, meaning most of the low carbon investing culture does very little to reduce dependence on oil, gas & coal while starving old energy of the minimal investment capital needed to avoid energy shocks. On top of that, while OPEC can’t meet production quotas and the industry overall is suffering production contractions due to chronically low capital investment, the Biden Administration is doing its best to limit US old energy production. And this is all occurring in a market environment where energy consumption is still rising and whole industries haven’t even fully gotten out from the pandemic yet. So anyone who takes a moment to think about the energy market could have predicted energy shocks in 2022 or 2023.\n\nIt’s been obvious for months that oil, coal & gas prices would blow up. \n\nAnd all of that makes war even more inevitable, because every time oil prices get high enough, crazy stuff starts happening in oil producing countries. You can time most of Putin’s most aggressive autocratic actions by looking at a chart of Lukoil’s prices. That also applies to Mideast violence & terrorism. Around 20 years ago, Putin was jailing the leader of Russia’s biggest oil company, Yukos, and Saudis were flying into the world trade center twin towers.And a decade after that, the last time oil was this high, it gave birth to almost a decade of petro state Jihads and Islamic state violence. \n\nI’ve been watching all this poor planning, unrealistic ESG investing cults, and poor energy policy unfold in disbelief, loading up on energy stocks & defense stocks, since Q3 last year.\n\nCathie Woods is the voice of the popular movement to transform the world’s climate problems by investing in next-gen technology while not cutting material or energy consumption at all. It’s a fundamentally lazy system of false belief in the idea that by investing in tech rather than changing behavior, you can change the world, because (here’s the lazy part) all human problems can be solved by some new technology that (here’s the greed part) someone is trying to get others to buy. But environmental problems are caused by consumption and waste, and there’s no solution to environmental destruction, climate change and high energy utilization that doesn’t involve people cutting their own personal consumption of material stuff and energy. What Cathy Woods sells re: climate change is snake oil that some people are making a lot of money from. Thus time around, it’s ESG investors & ESG voters who claim they can solve the world’s environmental problems simply by buying next-gen tech and doing nothing else to reduce consumption, who are responsible for these energy shocks and this current round of petro state violence.\n\nLiterally anyone who learns to stop turning down their thermostats below 76 degrees Fahrenheit in the Summer and above 65 degrees in the winter can do more to help mitigate climate change and prevent petro state violence than Cathy Woods.

{"title": "Blackrock Crisis part 2", "selftext": "TLDR: Blackrock Crisis is going to be the face of the current bear market and the 2022 market crash.\n\nHere is some chart work to follow up on a post I made last night about how Blackrock is not only already tanking due to its assets shrinking in value across the board, but also as its position in international equities put it in a precarious position with the ongoing international financial disruptions. Here is that [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7qm7s/blackrock_crisis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nRecently Blackrock has been behaving like a leveraged S&P500. I'm not a TA guy but here are some lines on a chart that you can decided it you think are real or not. The better info is coming after this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1a5bd1sjsl81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d01e05be5d0373eb51d522b3638963dd11ea284\n\nHere is Blackrock vs S&P 500. As you can see Blackrock outperformed in the low interest rate environment, but has started dumping and is about to cross SPY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghk21zlyjsl81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb3911567ed17f802623e13e6b96ad88ced8395d\n\nOkay, so a lot of people are comparing our current bear market to the taper tantrum in 2018 which I think is a great comparison. Here is how Blackrock did against Spy in 2018. It looks like we had a pretty sustained down trend leading up to the Spy correction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/una5dtv5ksl81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=996ce969ded828749c8e4504d1db1f45d80dfa70\n\nHere is what mortgage rates were doing at that time. Mortgage rates rose steadily for the couple years leading up to the correction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icjyryr9ksl81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f4ed9ddc2c0fb2073f1844cf585096328b45c73\n\nHere is what mortgage rates are doing right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/io5z5pwqksl81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb5fc0338a2d3d78e56237e0b172eedd9908f3db\n\nTLDR but at the end: Mortgage rates are skyrocketing right now and will bring about the next big correction/crash in the markets. Even without the black swan event that I think Blackrock is particularly exposed to due to its international holdings Blackrock has a ways to go yet in its current down trend due to these rising rates.\n\nPosition:  BLK Apr 14 $630puts\n\nAccumulating more over the next couple weeks.", "id": "t82pod", "created_utc": 1646585093.0, "score": 551, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 193, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|11 months ago\n**Total Comments**|4079|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7qm7s/blackrock_crisis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t82pod/blackrock_crisis_part_2/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mp6wu9/leveraged_index_etfs_as_longterm_holds/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t82pod)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t82pod)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Plot twist- blackrock owns half the world", "score": 545, "replies": [{"body": "Plot twist: Blackrock is the fed, or just the entity the fed used to directly meddle in the stock market", "score": 263, "replies": [{"body": "The FED has lost control.", "score": 124, "replies": [{"body": "The Fed never had control", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "You’re right.

{"title": "Mental Gynamstic: Russia is winning", "selftext": "This is my attempt in trying to figure out the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nYes, we've seen video of incompetence from the Russian side but some things feel off.\n\nHow is it that power and the internet remained uninterrupted throughout the war?\n\nYes, Musk provided Starlink satellites but there were still a good few days since the war started and before those arrived. You'd think same goes for the power. Cut off electricity and life gets way harder for the enemy.\n\nNext, why is Ukraine heading to the negotiation table so soon? 4 days into the conflict. Sure, it might be because the Zelensky is a great human and wants to minimise the cost be it human lives or damage to properties. Alternatively, it could be that the Ukrainians really aren't doing that well.\n\nI'm worried that the humanitarian passage is really just so that Putin can go hard.\n\nThe stuff above are some of the suspicious points but the important and interesting things are the interests of the parties involved.\n\nRemember, I'm referring to the leadership not the general populace. \n\nTo Russia, Ukraine's membership into NATO is a security issue. Sure NATO is a \"defensive alliance\" on paper but the weapons avaliable can be used for offensive attacks. Treaties have been broken before and we all know there are a whole bunch of ways to start false flags attacks, so from Russia's point of view, they can't have their enemies right up at their border. It's the equivalent of the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nTo the United States, do they REALLY care? Hong Kong happened and what good did that do? The United States will only act out if it is in their interest to do so. Optics don't matter as much as people hope they do. So what vital strategic interest does Ukraine pose to the United States? Not much really. The US cares about the Middle East because of oil and East Asia because that's the defensive line keeping China in their own seas. Ukraine? Not exactly crucial since there is still the entire of NATO between Russia and the US.\n\nZelensky's position is the simplest, he has to fight or he will die. He is doing a great job shaping up the optics to make Ukraine an international favourite and keeping the attention on Ukraine.\n\nHere comes the issue. Russia's interest is in keeping NATO out of Ukraine and clearly we're seeing that NATO doesn't actually dare to set up and help Ukraine in any way meaningful. So why keep the war going on?\n\nCommodities prices, specifically fossil fuels.\n\nWe get fed news everyday that Russia is getting sanctioned in every way possible, but the important thing is to keep an eye on the energy export to Europe.\n\nWe're seeing prices spike as they should but the real question we should be asking is, can Europe actually survive without Russian energy? I have serious doubts. If we are to bring oil to Europe from the US and the Middle East, there has to be infrastructure in place and the fastest way is to redirect bunkers. This basically throws what supply Russia was providing onto the US and the Middle East overnight, causing huge bidding war with the rest of the world. But money won't be enough to fix it because all of a sudden you need the capacity of that many extra tankers that simply don't exist. Meaning that demand has to get cut globally and we'll see a recession.\n\nIs the world really going to choose recession over Ukraine? Hopefully I'd be proven wrong but I think nations are far more selfish. So in this case, Europe will have to continue buying Russian energy.\n\nKnowing that Europe has their hands tied, it would then be in Russia's interest to keep conflict going on in Ukraine, enough that global outrage continues but low enough to not suffer too much loss. That way, energy prices remain high and Putin gets to line his wallet.\n\nSo that's Russia's side, what about America? Believe it or not, it is also in America's interest to keep the conflict going on in Europe. High oil prices reduces Europe's financial competitiveness due to higher costs and the US can start up their own oil supply to both profit and protect America's cost. Even better, if Europe actually gets pulled into the war with Russia, America throws their military in, end the war and sell Europe everything they need to build back their devasted nations. Sounds familiar? It's WWII all over again.\n\nAnd if you think that MSM always has an agenda, then ask yourself, why are they giving Zelensky the platform to rile up the citizens of the Western nations, getting them to pressure their governments to intervene? Do we really think that the world's leaders don't know that an oil embargo on Russia will hurt them the most? Nah, they know but they also can't stop using Russian oil. Why give Zelensky the platform to pressure Western governments into joining into the war? That's because what Zelensky HAS to do actually coincides with the US agenda.\n\nWe can all identify cases of other people getting brainwashed, but it's much harder to see if we ourselves are playing into the trap of other people.\n\nI think the odds that the world's leaders are playing some multi-dimensional levels of chess is much higher than \"Russia bad, we fuck them up\".\n\nNow, this is just a brain dump of my thoughts on the war. \n\nWill the world's economy die or not? That really depends on if Europe actually decides to cut Russian oil. It's not a wise move, but the citizens might just get loud enough to force them to do exactly that.\n\nI'm not saying that the morally right thing to do is to throw Ukraine under the bus but it's likely what many of the nations' leaders will choose to do to protect their own interest.", "id": "t8354d", "created_utc": 1646586248.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 185, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|21|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|229|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t8354d/mental_gynamstic_russia_is_winning/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qy4gpl/426_dte_and_weaponizing_uranium/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6ra26/politics_cant_stop_gme_and_math_says_pt_1000/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l17qso/lemons_were_meant_to_be_squeezed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6qwu3/confirmation_bias_on_the_squeeze_pt_way_over_1k/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo38ap/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3avs/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3da4/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3g44/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t8354d)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t8354d)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wartime propaganda has been a thing forever. \nIn the US all our news and twitter are western sources..\n\nCrazy that people in the US are dumb enough to believe that that Ukraine (alone too) is beating Russia.

This is what I've pieced together from the various intel that's been flying around, and it meshes with a few of your points:\n\n* Putin has wanted Ukraine back ever since the fall of his puppet dictator. He didn't invade because NATO and the rest of the old satellite republics were too many wild cards. The most he could get away with was annexing Crimea before the new democratic government could get setup.\n\n* He prepped for this invasion by stockpiling gold and currency in the Russian national coffers, plus he had the Russian-backed separatists taking a bite out of Eastern Ukraine.\n\n* His game plan was to wait for the right time, which according to rumor would have been during Trump's second term when he was planning to take the US out of NATO. In that case Putin would have even been able to go after Poland, which he has also been itching to grab in order to reform the old Soviet Union.\n\n* He never expected the sanctions to be this bad. Putin expected some embargoes, frozen bank accounts, etc. But according to more intel he had no idea that the whole country would be squeezed like a stress toy until all it's cash started falling out. Uncle Joe has done great work hitting Putin and his rich cronies right in the wallet.\n\n* Ukraine was expected to fall in 48 hours. It's been a week and not only have the Russian incursions been stopped but local forces are taking back conquered cities. Putin sent in forces with top-of-the-line equipment first, and apparently it was massacred by Ukrainian battalions tempered by 8 years of fighting separatists armed with literally tons of US Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stingers. \n* All Russia has left is their class B and C units, which apparently are using Cold War era gear. They've barely achieved air superiority, let alone supremacy, and with convoys being trapped, stuck in mud, abandoned by their conscript drivers, or even destroyed by Ukrainian forces, all the Russian military can do now is bomb from aircraft, and that's no way to defeat land forces.\n\nSuffice to say, this conflict won't be ending any time soon. The longer it goes on, the worse the sanctions will get, and the longer it will take to get Russia, not to mention Ukraine, glued back together and producing economically.

They are pissed off b/c they could do nothing against him in 2014 (remember: he was screwed then, too!). They use the Ukraine to do that; to push, push and push. Basically, they push Zelensky forward to poke the bear. I don't know what promise they make to him, but Zelensky is totally pissed off that they didn't go in, so they must have been robust ones, like air protection or the like.\n\nWith the (alleged) NATO backing, Zelensky gets cockier and cockier. When Putin (who isn't stupid and, like it or not, will not allow the Ukraine to be used in any anti-Russia function) warns that either they back off or shit is going to get real, they (Zelensky + Nato) did what they always do: underestimate Putin.\n\nPutin goes in, something he had carefully planned for a year or more for the case the Ukraine does not back off from its NATO plans. This is where the Ukrainians get royally screwed, because they discover that they are, in the end, alone.\n\nHow Zelensky could be so stupid as to think that NATO would risk a nuclear war for \\*him\\* is beyond me, but this is where he is at. Still, Zelensky has made an excellent job at mobilising his country and the West's solidarity, at least until the day he started to insult them, too. He is very good at forcing the Western government to damage themselves more and more with sanctions that will certainly backfire in the middle and long term (see oil prices for starters), but I still doubt he will get the total war he seems to crave. He is good at Twitter-ing the West, though, where millions are now hysterically calling for an extremely dangerous escalation, as if the atomic bombs would fall on Botswana.\n\nThe US are in a fairly comfortable position, as far as this can be reasonably demanded. The war has killed the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, and they don't have many factories in Russia and the Ukraine. They can (and will) increase their oil production and reasonably insulate themselves from the energy dependency and the high oil prices. Germans, though, are in a different position, because they have \"globalised\" themselves into cheapo Europe, nor can they avoid the full brunt of the big energy bill that is coming their way. The same is true, in lesser measure, for other European Countries (Italy is also in deep doo doo; sad, because I am Italian).\n\nWhy is Zelensky negotiating?

How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they are handing over to the Ukrainians?\"\n\nTranscript: Secretary of State Antony Blinken on \"Face the Nation\" A White House spokesperson told CBS News the Biden administration is evaluating the capabilities it could provide to provide jets to Poland if it decided to transfer planes to Ukraine but noted there are several questions that arise from a decision to do so, including how the jets could be transferred from Poland to Ukraine.\n\nOksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., told \"Face the Nation\" she hopes Ukraine will receive fighter jets from Poland \"as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"We are working with our American, especially, friends and allies, on the steady supply of all the ammunition and anti-air, anti-tank and planes to be able to effectively defend our country,\" she said.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked worldwide support for the Ukrainian people and a united response from the West. The U.S. and European allies have provided military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia's biggest financial institutions, Russian oligarchs and top officials in Moscow, including President Vladimir Putin himself and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, as part of efforts to cut the country off from the global financial system. Putin on Saturday said the sanctions are \"like a war.\"\n\nBlinken, who was in eastern Europe meeting with U.S. allies, said NATO countries and members of the Group of 7 are \"working together\" to raise the pressure on Russia, including through additional sanctions, which will be implemented in the coming days.\n\n\"The impact of the sanctions is already devastating,\" the secretary of state said. \"The ruble is in freefall. Their stock market's been shuttered for almost a week. We're seeing a recession set in in Russia. Consumers aren't able to buy basic products because companies are fleeing Russia, so it's having a big impact.\"\n\nStill, Blinken noted that Putin is \"doubling down and digging in on this aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\n\"I think we have to be prepared, unfortunately, tragically, for this to go on for some time,\" he said.\n\nMarkarova said Ukraine is thankful to the West for its continued support but suggested the international community needs to respond quicker because the Russians are \"escalating\" their attacks.\n\n\"It's clear after 11 days that we also need all of us to move faster,\" she said. Ukraine, she continued, did not provoke an attack from Russia.\n\n\"We were not a threat to Russia unless being a peaceful democracy and just peacefully leaving in your own country is a threat,\" she said. \"And if it's so, then it's not only about Ukraine, then Europe and the whole world is not safe.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky participated in a Zoom call with U.S. lawmakers on Saturday, during which he urged them to provide his country with military planes and impose an embargo on Russian oil. He also reiterated to lawmakers it could be the final time they see him alive, echoing a warning he has issued to European leaders.\n\nAsked whether the U.S. is working on a contingency plan to support the Ukrainian government should something happen to Zelensky, Blinken praised his leadership and indicated Ukrainian officials are prepared.\n\n\"The Ukrainians have plans in place, that I'm not going to talk about or get into any details on, to make sure that there is what we would call 'continuity of government' one way or another,\" he said. \"And let me leave it at that.\"\n\nThe secretary of state was steadfast that even if Russia's war in Ukraine continues for months, the Ukrainians will prevail.\n\n\"Winning a battle is not the same thing as winning a war. Taking the city is not the same thing as capturing the hearts and minds of Ukrainians,\" he said. \"What they've demonstrated with extraordinary courage is that they will not be subjugated to Vladimir Putin's will and be under Russia's thumb. So whether that takes another week, another month, another year to play out, it will, and I know how this is going to end. But the question is, can we end it sooner rather than later with less suffering going forward? That's the challenge.\"", "id": "t85i04", "created_utc": 1646592694.0, "score": 1922, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 501, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|32|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|2909|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t85i04)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t85i04)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is a clickbaity title.

Premium octane gasoline was about $7.26 a gallon.\n\nElectric-vehicle penetration world-wide will be 60% by 2030, Black estimates. Tesla (ticker: TSLA) will have 20% EV share.
