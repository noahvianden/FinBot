Oct-Dec will probably see the worst of it since I'd guess that is when companies will enact their reorgs/efficiency cuts for the new FY. I think this will happen because businesses can't get near free debt anymore which affects available funds for personnel and also lowers demand from customers (individuals and then later B2B).

The current crash is due to inflation (much of it due to Oil exacerbated by the war in Ukraine) and QT popping the everything bubble created by QE and low interest rates targeting growth/tech stocks. In short, the GFC was caused by *malpractice.*\n\nThe GFC happened due to the housing bubble that was artificially created from egregious mortgages being given out to people who couldn't actually afford buying these houses. There isn't really an equivalent form of malpractice to the extent of the GFC. You could loosely argue the Fed pumped the markets through some bad decisions. The max pain was experienced in the real estate and the financial sectors more so than growth stocks/Nasdaq like we see today. The federal funds rate was above 5% in 2007 and the Fed had been raising interest rates from 2004 to 2007 versus the 0% we had (before the Fed starting raising rates in this crash) and the Fed cutting interest rates from 2019 up to the Covid Crash in 2020, while keeping them at 0% until 2022. The Fed had paused raising interest rates in 2006-2007 before the GFC. QE/QT in the form of the Fed purchasing assets did not exist yet. The Fed start buying assets for the first time in 2009 and sold assets off for the first time in 2017. So this aspect has actually never happened before in any prior crash in history besides the Covid Crash of 2020.\n\nPrevious bear markets more similar to what we're experiencing now would be:\n\n1. Bear Market of 1982: bear market caused by high inflation and skyrocketing oil prices, very similar to today. The last time inflation was as high as it was today was at this time in 1982. Fed had raised interest rates aggressively as high as nearly 20%, famously done by Volcker. The market bottomed out at -27.1% after 6 months. I think this is the most similar bear market to what we are seeing today.\n2. Early 1990s recession/bear market: where oil prices skyrocketed due to oil price shock from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and similar inflation concerns. The Fed was also enacting restrictive monetary policy as it is today. Similar to today, this recession was preceded by robust job growth and low unemployment. There was a relatively short bear market in the Nasdaq that started in July 1990 and was over by Jan 1991.\n3. The Dot Com bubble: Similar bubble popping in the Nasdaq, although this may be more applicable to the crypto markets than the Nasdaq today. We know that this was incredibly terrible with a multi-year bear market in the Nasdaq bottoming out at -80%. While I don't foresee anything similar to the DCB as the bubble leading up that crash was far greater than what we saw from 2019-2021 and far shittier companies than we saw in the past couple years with 0 business plans were getting crazy valuations. Companies like FAANG at least have some form of earnings. Similar to today, there was low unemployment and the Fed had started raising interest rates. On the other hand, interest rates were still pretty high compared to today.\n\nIf I had to guess, based on how the market has reacted to the Fed's QT and the bear markets in 1982 and 1990, I don't think the bear market will be anywhere near as long as the GFC. Once inflation dies down, which the core PCE is indicating, and many believe will happen towards the 2nd half of this year, the Fed will signal at least pausing QT if not QE again. CPI/inflation is measured by the *rate* of rising inflation, not how high it actually is. With the calculation being YoY and oil prices being the main culprit likely slowing down, it seems mathematically logical that inflation will slow this year. 11 out of the past 17 bear markets ended as soon as the Fed started QE.

They are building up more personnel to create shortest path to helping people in need, way harder than you think to give money away and *actually* help\n* XPrize stuff, would consider doing another one after this one finishes. Always looking for highly effective ways to spend money on general social good\n* Most proud accomplishment of Musk Foundation: doesn't think they've done enough to be singing their own praises. Mentions education XPrize for the best way to improve literacy. Thinks Starlink will have a really positive effect on raising peoples income and raising their standard of living. Starlink can provide connectivity for a village of 200 people for 50¢ per person a month.\n* What actions can be taken to reduce poverty: literacy and access to the internet are fundamentally helpful. Generally education is obviously good. Can learn almost anything online. MIT, other universities have their courses online.\n* Population decline: nothing noteworthy, don't feel like typing it out. Bit on the cross-sectional areas of human.\n* Shadowbanning on Twitter, really sounds like someone at Twitter is doing something shady. Not cool.\n\n___\n\nTesla stuff\n\n* On dealership lobbying: It is to be expected that incumbents will oppose new entrants to the market. Will continue to see opposition to Tesla, but with Tesla owner support, thinks they'll will win most battles.\n\n* Plaid is designed to be the most amount of fun you can have in a car.\n\n* Tesla insurance: Regulated at state level. A lot of barriers to entry. Some regulations are fine, but some feel like they are there to protect incumbents. Generally a very slow process. Paperwork insanity. Intend to be in all states, Canada, and hopefully the world. Discriminatory pricing on new drivers, insurance should be based on the individual.\n\n* Mining: We don't *want* to go into the mining or refining industry. The limitation on lithium is more on refining. I hope we do not need to get into the mining business. There is a limited number of smart, hard-working people. Must focus resources on things that make a difference. Whatever the limiting factors are. [Sounds like they will have to eventually]\n\n* Stationary is ramping and will be a very big part of the business long term. Our estimate is that you need about 300 TWh of storage to fully transition earth—electricity, heat, and transport. If you assume 20 year battery life, need 15 TWh production per year. \n\n* Master Plan Part 3 is how do we get to that fully sustainable energy economy, and what tonnage do we need of what materials, and what is best way to get those materials and turn them into batteries. The fundamental governor of the transition is the rate at which we can grow the output of lithium ion batteries.\n\n* Virtual Power Plants at ERCOT: The batteries are helpful even without sustainable energy thanks to load balancing. In terms of batteries, there will a combination of large scale utility installations and then at the local level a collection of Powerwalls that stabilize the grid within the neighborhood. That combination can have a very positive effect on making sure the power stays on. Energy is the foundation of the economy. \n\n* Litigation team: A lot of really talented lawyers have sent in resumes, will be hiring. The FUDsters really have to twist themselves into a pretzel, the short sellers tried to say Giga Shanghai was fake. \n\n* Making like a thousand cars a week at Giga Berlin.\n\n* Prototypes are easy, profitable production is hard. In general, manufacturing is underrated. Especially in the US. I sure hope a lot more talented people get into manufacturing. There are too many smart Americans in finance and law.\n\n* What is the next step in EV tech to make it better for environment: I think it's really about scaling up. Right now we cannot make enough cars to satisfy demand. [**Bullish.**]\n\n* AGI: Not there yet, but trending that way. Hope it is nice to us.

Don’t brigade but this post is worth reading. Lmao.\n\nA note from an anonymous Cruise employee\n\nIn light of the coverage of dozens of vehicles being stuck on the roads of San Francisco on June 28 (now on [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/30/cruise-robotaxis-blocked-traffic-for-hours-on-this-san-francisco-street/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31939983)) I wanted to share that I wrote about this in an email to the CPUC in mid-May, a couple weeks before their vote on allowing Cruise to charge fares within a limited area of San Francisco.\n\nAs of now, I have not received any response from the CPUC except for an auto-reply indicating that my message was received. I am not sharing the full message here because outside the original context of communicating with a regulatory agency it may violate the terms of my NDA to share some of the information in the message.\n\nTo summarize the message, it specifies the nature of \"Vehicle Retrieval Events\" such as the ones that occurred on June 28, June 20, and multiple times before then that may result in dozens of vehicles blocking public roads until they are physically retrieved, and why I believe these events will occur frequently for the foreseeable future including when hours of operation of the driverless fleet are expanded to include morning and evening rush hour times. Aside from the obvious problems with large numbers of vehicles blocking traffic, one of the more concerning possibilities is these vehicles blocking emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks.\n\nI subjectively find Cruise to be a highly chaotic environment where safety related discussion is routinely discouraged because it contradicts the leadership's narrative, \"is a distraction\", and \"lowers morale\", the second two being direct quotes I have heard spoken by management and leadership at the company.\n\nI'm glad that this issue is getting more attention, and for the sake of the safety of San Francisco residents, I hope that Cruise and regulators such as the CPUC both take the appropriate steps to  ensure public safety.\n\n*Note: I am not going to verify my employment status because I don't have a good way to do that without doxxing myself and risking being fired and possibly facing legal action.

I also trained some BJJ because Judo and BJJ complement each other well. A good friend is heavy into Muay Thai and he is a monster. I might be biased.\n\n1. You are sadly \"old\". It will be hard to fight professionally. Not impossible but very hard.\n\n2. Grappling is always the best base. A grappler can learn decent striking in 1-2 years. A striker can get decent at grappling in 5 years. Start grappling (Bjj, Judo, Sambo, Wrestling) for 1-2 years and aim for a brown belt in Judo or a purple belt in BJJ.* I don't know how hard it is to start wrestling outside the college setting. Find a grappling gym where you spar every training (rolling in bjj, or randori in judo).\n\n3. Then add striking into your training (Muay Thai, Kickboxing, Boxing). Learn the base of grappling from a grappler and striking from a striker. Most MMA gyms are jack of all trades, master of none. You want to master all trades if you want to get successful.\n\n4. MMA has a metagame. Don't start Taekwondo or Aikido for example. Thoose a great sports to keep fit and fight against drunken normies, but they have too many panel gaps in a professional setting. Stay away from bullshido like Krav Maga!\n\n5. Stick to one grappling and one striking style, train both every week and later (3y) switch out your striking stlye with MMA and keep the grappling. I'm convinced that Grappling + Striking -> Grappling + MMA will give you the best results.\n\n- Grappling: BJJ, Wrestling, Judo, Sambo\n\n- Striking: Muay Thai, Kickboxing, Boxing\n\nI hope that helps. Good luck.\n\nEdit: You obviously won't get purple in BJJ in <5 years. I expressed it badly.\n\nEdit2: If you just want to learn how to protect yourself start BJJ. It is very rewarding!

The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $6.14 billion, $974 million, and $150 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to additional U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year. We have $417 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions. We did not have any material releases of valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We continue to monitor the realizability of the U.S. deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors. In completing this assessment, we considered both objective and subjective factors. These factors included, but were not limited to, a history of losses in prior years, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, future reversal of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. After evaluating all available evidence, we intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. **Given the improvement in our operating results and depending on the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future, we may release the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. deferred tax assets in the next few years.** Release of all, or a portion, of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.\"", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I would imagine when they become net profitable as a company (over entire corporate lifespan) then they will recognize enough as needed to avoid paying taxes on profits that quarter until it runs out.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "makes sense", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "how has the lounge missed this up to this point?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "There's nothing missed.

This is based on information from two well-informed sources that reached teslamag.de in the past week. According to this, only 86 Model Y Performance are currently produced in the German factory per day, and the work at the individual stations takes about twice as long instead of the planned 90 seconds. The vehicles then also have to be intensively revised. However, local production of drives is scheduled to start in June, and a significantly increased pace is planned from the second half of July.\n\nGerman Tesla launch slower than China\nThe new Tesla factories in Germany and in the US state of Texas would increase production faster than those in China, CEO Elon Musk said in late April. At the beginning, the ramp-up always looks slow, but then it enters an exponential phase. But at least the German factory is currently lagging behind the Chinese in their early days. For February 2020 as the second month of the Tesla Gigafactory in China, a good 3900 Model 3s were reported to have been produced. For those in Grünheide, which officially started at the end of March, with 86 Model Ys per day and 21 working days in May, there would only be about half in the second full month.\n\nOn the one hand quality and on the other hand personnel problems seem to contribute to the German lag behind China. For example, Model Ys produced in Grünheide are currently not driven straight to the collection areas on the Gigafactory site, but are initially parked in a cordoned-off area of ​​the factory. There is rework to fix ill-fitting sheet metal, paint defects or scratches. In addition, Tesla is not progressing quickly enough in the search for personnel: teslamag.de was told that there is currently a lack of employees for the commissioning of a second line in the Gigafactory. Brandenburg's Economics Minister recently mentioned a current level of a good 4,000 employees in the German Tesla factory and a second shift from the next quarter\n\nIt was also confirmed to teslamag.de that drives and batteries for the German Model Y are currently still being supplied entirely from China. Last week, energy storage was already running out, probably because of the lockdown in Shanghai since the end of March: There should still be batteries for about 14 days in Grünheide. At least for the drives, however, local production is planned from June. The outbuilding for this was not even ready when Tesla production started at the end of March, but now the necessary systems have been installed there and the first parts are to be produced next month.\n\n2 weeks break at Giga Berlin in July\nThe exponential development mentioned by Tesla boss Musk could then start at the end of July. Because at the beginning of the second quarter, German production should be on hold for two weeks for major changes. The new goal is then, among other things with more staff, 30 seconds per station instead of the currently planned 90 seconds and achieved 180 seconds. The final inspection should be distributed to the individual areas, so that rework on actually finished Model Y is no longer necessary. When particularly unsuccessful specimens arrive on the line, they should be taken out of the ongoing process.\n\nAll in all, this does not sound like the hoped-for smooth ramp-up, but it also does not sound like devastating problems in the German gigafactory. In any case, the plan remains ambitious. Even with just one shift per day, reducing the station time to a sixth would mean six times the production volume, i.e. around 500 Model Ys per day or almost 11,000 per month. Customers may still have to wait a long time for the Model Y Long Range from the German factory: In Grünheide, there are rumors of 2 million orders for the Model Y Performance from markets that are to be served by the electric car factory in Brandenburg .

Now even production in Brandenburg is to be paused. But that is for growth*\n\nIn the future, Tesla wants to produce 500,000 electric cars every year in Grünheide, Brandenburg. But contrary to what the self-advertising designation \"Giga-Fabrik\" suggests, we are currently still a long way from gigantic figures. Most recently, 1000 vehicles were created from the Model Y - not a day, but a week.\n\nBut it shouldn't stop there. Tesla wants to quickly expand the capacity of the plant that opened on March 22nd. At the beginning of July, production should even be completely suspended for two weeks. As the magazine \"Teslamag\" reports , the processes are to be changed so that a vehicle then only has to stay at each production station for 30 seconds instead of up to three minutes. That would even undercut the originally targeted 90 seconds per station.\n\nAccording to the magazine, this should also be made possible by more staff. According to Brandenburg's Economics Minister Jörg Steinbach (SPD), a third shift is planned soon - more than 500 new employees will be hired per week.\n\nAs reported , there is one hurdle: According to IG Metall, Tesla pays up to 20 percent less than its competitors in the region who adhere to collective agreements. In order to actually have 12,000 people on board by the end of the year, Tesla would have to \"step it up a notch,\" says the union.\n\nFrom the second half of July production according to a new model\nAccording to \"Teslamag\", the changes also include carrying out the final inspection in the individual production areas, so that time-consuming rework can be dispensed with. From the second half of July, production should then run according to the new pattern.\n\nTesla has been in turbulence lately. Production had stalled worldwide due to interrupted supply chains as a result of the corona pandemic, and a lack of batteries was particularly noticeable. The founder of the US group, Elon Musk, had therefore repeatedly warned of an economic downturn and announced job cuts. 3 to 3.5 percent of jobs will be cut in the coming months, but the number of factory workers will increase in the long term.\n\nAgainst the background of these difficulties , Musk called the new plants in Grünheide and Austin, Texas \"giant money incinerators\" . You would lose in \"billions of dollars\". He described the past two years as an \"absolute nightmare\" in view of the supply chain problems in the auto industry.\n\nBut that's not all: It was only announced this weekend that Tesla had to recall around 60,000 vehicles worldwide due to software defects. The Y and 3 models are affected. This could also involve vehicles from Grünheide, because that is where the Y model is produced.

There are efficiencies on ramping like supply chain logistics but depreciation is not one.

But they then make upgrades so it never gets to a zero state.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Most of depreciation is charged evenly on cogs because it’s a cost you incur regardless of output. That’s what a fixed cost is. That’s why you have to include the ‘depreciation’ of it regardless of output. You incur the economic loss irrespective of that variable and so it’s accounted for in the same way. \n\nMost of the costs Tesla has in their factories are similar costs, hence will be incurred per Q regardless of output. Because output doesn’t impact their recognition. \n\nRivian is less efficient, but they still follow the same accounting rules. “The fixed cost advantage is labour efficiency” - sure, but this isn’t really relevant. Whether something is labour or not doesn’t determine it’s character. It’s based on accounting standards and it’s almost always substance over form. If you have wages you must pay regardless of output that’s a fixed cost and will be split across units. If it’s linked directly to output, it’s a variable cost and will be included when the effort is rendered. \n\nDepreciation is most definitely one. Tesla’s depreciation per vehicle has been declining steadily as they have increased fixed asset utilisation.\n\nTake a thought experiment: imagine a company who has one factory. They have a capacity of producing 100 units, but they only produce one. Based on your logic they should be able to present the income statement as pro-rata of the 1% of costs of the factory, because they’re only utilising 1%. This is problematic for two reasons: \n- you can’t trust managements idea of ‘max output’, no one knows\n- the income statement will be lumpy as once the company ‘reduces their max output’, they will have to restate all prior years, or include an accrual in that year.\n\nIt’s a much better system to be conservative in the accounting for costs, and so even from first principles you would defer to including more costs.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with you and appreciate you typing this all out.

With you sitting alone at home priced in, we can focus on something you did not do for a long time now: **Make some fucking money.**\n\nBefore I share the trade of a century with you, we need to squeeze in a little history lesson. As your frontal lobes probably only fully developed in the last 12 months, you would not know what the fuck I am talking about otherwise. A word of caution tho: **this post is longer than the night you had to spend in daycare because your parents forget to pick you up.**\n\nSo get comfy, grab your favorite pacifier and let’s go.\n\n# Part 1: The lore of the electric Käfer\n\nSpool back to the start of 2018. A blissful, maskless world. The worst geopolitical issue anyone can remember was some tariffs on Chinese imports. A much less famous Elon Musk was in the middle of completing phase 3 of the “(not so) secret master plan” of building an affordable ($35k) electric car for the masses. After its introduction in 2017, the initial production ramp turned out to be a lot **harder and more complex than initially thought**. Plans to fully automate the production line were scrapped and human workers were allowed on the factory floor.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l65x5ou4bx891.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e48e58b1063e751f302da29331d3970773987c\n\nYou know what else was on the factory floor every night? Elon Musk himself. He deemed it necessary to be there 24/7 to micromanage the production ramp. Later accounts of line managers suggested, that he was told to “fuck off” more than once when he started herassing sleepless workers with questions about production efficiency and workflows. He really, really wanted it. How much of that was for show? We‘ll never know but it's damn clear that he was hustling hard. Years later he gave a late praise to the people that made it all possible by tweeting\n\n>“Humans are underrated”.\n\n**Heartwarming**.\n\nMind you, back then he was not in a position of strength and accomplishment. Not the richest man in the world. People were betting he was going to fail, and fail hard at it.\n\nTesla was called a fraud, subsidy abuser, unsustainable and vaporware. Short sellers were pouring in and CNBC was readily giving them a stage.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6e1ykqmpax891.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=f258dbbe09bcef58c6f58d154ccb7533b21007a5\n\nWhen things started to look better, Musk went on an acid bender with his new girlfriend Claire Boucher a.k.a Grimes and Elizah Banks. Apart from some embarrassing leaked tweets that I will spare you for reasons of decency, **this bombshell hit the wire:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/naua05dsax891.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b3f816b65fa17d6679f8689f76dd6ee767feb5b\n\n**If you are looking for the exact point in time where EM decided he will not have any more of the short seller bullshit, this was it.**\n\nOur good friend Jim Cramer was also starting to take a closer interest in Tesla. It will take a couple more months before he flipped to one of the most jacked up [TSLA](https://markets.sh/symbols/NASDAQ:TSLA) bulls only seconds to Cathie Wood, but it should eventually happen.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62esvsptax891.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=1423b742449a10251d3ae1477b6df34cf8b5d7d3\n\nThe deal fell through and Tesla did not go private.. After a volatile and largely range-bound start we have the company at a relatively stable valuation of around 50 Billion USD.\n\n# Part 2: Short shorts for the Shorts\n\nWe have already established that Elon Musk is a hustler and will follow his lofty goals relentlessly. If the “funding secured” tweet was the first battle against the eclectic clique of short sellers, known as TESLAQ on Twitter, **we are now going to war.**\n\nAs you might have heard already, valuations are all about future expectations. The bull case for Tesla was to become a really successful “luxury” car maker. They are dabbling with energy and driver assist but with the seriousness of Google with their chat products. Maybe something with Solar panels. About that. As you may have also heard, cars are a notoriously shitty business to be in. **They combine everything MBA’s are afraid of.**\n\n* Insanely capital intensive\n* Very elastic demand, sales drop right when you need them most (Looking at you ford, GM in 2008)\n* Humongous unionized workforce\n* Stiff competition\n* Razor thin margins\n* Stupid amounts of regulation (and lots of markets with diverging regulation)\n* Supply chains longer than the river Nile\n\nYou get the point. Compared to most other industries, except maybe pharma or aerospace (like SpaceX, you know), car companies are just bad businesses. This is the reason why before Tesla there was not really any new major car company for 100 years.\n\n**No wonder shorts are piling in. If car companies are hard, startup electric car companies are near damn impossible.**\n\nAs you probably learned in business school, no company is really in one industry and most companies consider their products a temporary solution for an ever evolving need.\n\nFamously, Railroads are really “Transportation” companies, Postal Services are actually banks, and prostitutes are really just mental health workers.\n\n**That being said, some industries are just so damn profitable that they really don’t need to play these charades.

Autonomy day 2019 was the birth of the grandiose vision. Full Self Driving was going to work next year and don’t bother trying to buy your leased model 3, we need it back and will pimp it out to drunken teens for 95% profit margins.\n\n**Combine that vision with one of the most public product launches of the last decade.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1g24y5zyx891.png?width=2373&format=png&auto=webp&s=aba28abe9b87c212b0db605dfef3cd33258caa7b\n\nAdd a vertically integrated battery and insurance company and you have that.

After a short rally into February, **a now famous virus from china sent futures worldwide into perpetual limit-down**. The shorts finally got their big drop but could not celebrate.

Having engineered both rockets that fucking land themselves and electric cars that people actually like, doing some financial engineering to fix the valuation should not be too hard.\n\n**Remember Kids**: Financial engineering is like real engineering. Except the only resource you have is money. This is why it drives such perverse products. What comes out of Goldman Sachs, is not unlike something that comes out of a prison cell after someone spends 12 months weaponizing instant coffee.\n\n**So how do we fix the valuation?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzq5kf7ubx891.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1c622bf951276c25ac19a9a9d945d94e896b2c3\n\nAfter we have got the foundation laid out and the media finally acknowledging the electric car revolution is actually happening, we just need the basic ingredients for any  good bull story.  **Hype, momentum and FOMO.** Combine this with the infinite gamma from a wall of call options, shorts trying to cover desperately, FSD just months away now, positive earnings surprises and a nice 1:5 split as kicker. We should get that sleepy stock started, no?\n\n**You bet!** Tesla valuation did not only reach escape velocity, it was the centerpiece of the most violent and relentless bull since at least two decades. This was not a bubble. **Bubbles burst at these G-Forces.**\n\nThis market had the energy of someone in the club, at 4am, almost blackout drunk, finding a **baggie of uncut coke in his pocket and deciding to have a last dance.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kybobaavbx891.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae58e006a733b8ec9aab967aae15a42d50c74c50\n\n**Everyone, EVERYONE** was buying calls, **WSB** was buying tech calls, your mom was buying calls.\n\nEven **Softbank** bought calls.

The short the short shorts short\n\nI am really surprised that you are still reading these ramblings, but it's your time after all. So before we jump right into the trade recommendation let me speak a word of warning.\n\n**What I am going to  suggest will go against one of the axioms of the post-pandemic market: “Never short Tesla”, especially if you use options the chances that you will lose all your money are close to 100%.**\n\nAs you know the market as a whole did not have a great start into 2022. Tesla lost about 40% of value already. Are we not late to the party? Hell, no! The thing is, Tesla's bull story is still largely intact. The company is still priced around incredible growth in the next few years with little headwinds, and a late but ultimately successful completion of the FSD project.\n\n**And as we have learned, the market really can’t stomach any cracks in pristine growth stories right now. With rates on the rise like this, the moment you have to tweak the growth slider on your fancy little DCF model, the bullish hockeystick projection goes all limp. And right quick.**\n\nFor reference please have a look at a recent example of a swift valuation change.\n\n[Lets look at the growth rate again. ](https://preview.redd.it/ltesnjnjsx891.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f49f1ebb746f2cd305807ce55821c15d9fc4a5f)\n\nI am not saying that Tesla will have a similar fate as SHOP, it is truly a different ballpark of a company all around. What I am saying is, that Shopify, Netflix, Meta, Amazon already had a reality check on their growth stories while Tesla's remains largely intact. If you factor in the beta of 2, it moved more in line with the rest of the market.\n\nSo, what happens next? I would say that there is a reasonable chance that Tesla will also have a checkup on their current valuation. I see it at a more reasonable market cap of 300-400 Billion. Which is still factoring in a lot of growth and success. This is NOT a doomsday scenario, where Tesla goes bust. No. This is purely a little gamble that there will be some adjustments based on some upcoming catalysts. Tesla is currently playing high stakes head-up poker against the market.\n\n**This is one of the last hands as deliveries will be released tomorrow and the earnings call is coming up next month. So my guess is, that whatever happens now will happen quickly as Tesla is still the vagus nerve of the tech market.**\n\nThey know that we know. And just as in 2018-2021 they are trying to prime the public to what will happen next.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e26zxgjayx891.png?width=1509&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fc399243c95a7f9cb32988a2b27aa2c37c6e8bb\n\n**Let’s try to read a bit into the recent clues.**\n\n1. Scaling car manufacturing is hard. Judging from Elons recent tweets, that the new factories are “Giant Money Money furnaces” we could be looking at higher cost or projected capital needs.\n2. Elon did not not Tweet for nine days. I am not sure if this happened in recent history. What is the message here? Twitter is overvalued? Belly ache? Who knows.\n3. Layoffs, layoffs, layoffs. Everyone is doing it so it is not unusual per se. Combined with the recent work from home and union debacle, it indicates that there might be cost pressures, greater than anticipated.\n4. Laying off a big part of the FSD labelling team in California is also interesting. Move. First of all, you are insane paying california salaries for data entry if your tooling is good, so that means nothing really. However, considering how important and shaky the FSD story is, the timing is curious.\n5. Elon wanting to buy Twitter can mean a lot of things. I would say after Tesla and SpaceX are not going anywhere, he is striving more towards self actualization. Also media influence becomes important when you want to go to mars.\n6. FSD is coming. But not with the current hardware and not within the next 12 months.\n7. Lets see how the infinite demand story plays out once people have to make some tough choices with their discretionary spending.\n8. Tesla makes great cars, I have a model 3. I love it. The issue is, now for the first time the competition looks really nice. When the lease ends it will be a BMW i4.\n9. The forbidden fruit on the balance sheet is priced in of course. But let’s see what happens when the mark to market loss on that risky alternative asset class, weaker revenue due to closed factories and rising costs from Texas and Berlin hit at the same time. If we not only have an earnings miss but also a surprise loss, people will lose their shit.\n10. The market is shit and people are just waiting to turn their back on investments to get a bit of liquidity back. All the STANS that have 110% of their net worth in Tesla? Watch them keep their cool when the stock hits 550.\n11. There are rumors that we are tyring the 2020 playbook once again. A ⅓ stock split and yet another AI day with the mysterious Tesla Bot are coming up. Do we need to pump the stock urgently now?\n12. The market is closed on Monday. If tomorrows numbers are bad, people might freak out as they can't get out anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This all leads me to the conclusion that a drop to the $200-$400 range within the next 6 months is a real possibility. Why now you are asking?**\n\n* Delivery numbers are released tomorrow\n* Earnings are next month\n* In between we will get another fucking scary inflation reading.\n* Market is closed on Monday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Due to how shit the market is and the potential of bad news tomorrow and next month, shorting TESLA might get a haircut just like SHOP, AMZN and NFLX. It migth be a good way to make a quick buck now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I am in. How are we playing this?**\n\nIf you believe there is some merit to these rumblings, **you buy puts.** Depending on your personal risk tolerance **300 strike puts with 1 month DTE** look about right. If you want to play it safe, L**EAP puts for January ‘23 should get you going**.

{"title": "Breaking: Voyager temporarily suspend trading, deposits, withdrawals, and loyalty rewards.", "selftext": "Email Statement:\n \nToday we made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend trading, deposits, withdrawals, and loyalty rewards. The app will be down for a short transition period. After that, you will still be able to view market data and track your portfolio, and you will receive rewards payments for the month of June.\n \nWe understand the significant impact of this decision, which is why we tried hard to avoid it—including by securing a credit facility from Alameda Ventures and lowering daily withdrawal limits. But the failure of a borrower, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), to repay a substantial loan from us means this was the right path forward. Voyager is actively pursuing all available remedies for recovery from 3AC, including through the court-ordered liquidation process in the British Virgin Islands.\n \nAs a result—while far from optimal—this decision gives us time to strengthen our balance sheet, a necessary condition to protect assets and preserve the future of the Voyager platform we have built together. We are exploring a number of options and hope to have more to share soon.\n\nMore details can be found on our blog. We know it does not answer all of your questions, but we are working diligently to get you those answers and will continue to keep you updated.\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/cryptocurrency-platform-voyager-digital-temporarily-suspends-trading-other-functions-271656702906", "id": "vp8lej", "created_utc": 1656702917.0, "score": 307, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|18|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vp8lej)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vp8lej)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> And another one\n \n\\- DJ Khaled", "score": 177, "replies": [{"body": "Another one bites the dust!", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "And another one gone\n\nAnd another one gone", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "I dont think thats dj Khaled...", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Voyager is unique in that they’re a public company.
