Musk’s team’s doubts about the spam figures signal they believe they do not have enough information to evaluate Twitter’s prospects as a business, the people said.  \nNow that Musk’s team has concluded Twitter’s figures on spam accounts are not verifiable, one of the people said, it is expected to take potentially drastic action. The person said it was likely a change in direction from Musk’s team would come soon, though they did not say exactly what they thought that change would be. If Musk pulls out of the deal, it will potentially trigger a massive legal battle.  \nThe terms of the deal say Musk must pay $1 billion to break up the deal, but legal experts have said that Twitter could try to force Musk to go through with the purchase if his reason for scuttling it is not based on the company’s fundamental business. When he made his offer in April, Musk waived his right to take a deeper look at Twitter’s finances. Twitter spokesperson Trenton Kennedy declined to comment. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \nMusk shook up the social media world earlier this year with his unprecedented offer to take the company private, arguing he would be able to grow Twitter and make it more open and, in his mind, politically neutral. He said he would let former president Donald Trump back on the service and argued its content moderation practices infringed on free speech. But soon after, questions arose about whether he would actually follow through. A global sell-off in tech stocks deeply cut into his personal net worth, which he had leveraged to get commitments for the debt he needed to buy Twitter.  \nMusk’s enthusiasm for following through with the deal has been under question since at least May, when he said the deal was “on hold” until he could ascertain whether Twitter’s claim that fewer than 5 percent of accounts are bots or spam was accurate. He accused Twitter of withholding information, while the company said it was acting in good faith and providing everything the deal’s terms required it to.  \n“Twitter has not been cooperative,” said a person familiar with the discussions, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the talks.  \nThe debate over bots on Twitter isn’t new. The company has long said around 5 percent of its accounts are bots or spam, while outside researchers have sometimes said the number could be much higher. Because of how quickly the tactics for creating and concealing the nature of fake accounts change, it is difficult for even experts to make strong pronouncements on who is right.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Best news all month", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "UPDATE: Former Japanese leader Shinzo Abe was shot in the chest during a speech and was rushed to hospital, reports say.

This isn't a great method because it ignores a lot of costs that it takes to run the business that contribute to the profitability of the factory, so it will usually over estimate profitability.

{"title": "PSA: GME stock dividend will not force shorts to cover", "selftext": "A stock dividend is treated differently than a cash dividend. When a cash dividend is paid on a stock, anyone who has a short position against those shares has to pay that dividend back to the holder they borrowed it from. This is because a cash dividend is real economic value that the lemder is entitled to.\n\nA stock dividend, however, does not require the shorts to do anything because it doesn't represent missed economic value from the lender's perspective. If I lent you one share of GME representing 1% equity ownership and it does a 4:1 stock dividend, you now owe me four shares conveying 0.25% ownership each. There's no economic value being accrued to the shares the lender owns, so there's nothing the short seller has to pay to make them whole. The short seller does not have to return the share to the lender then re-borrow the four shares. \n\n**Here's the most analogous example I could come up with**\n\nPretend you're renting a four-room house (represnting GME pre-stock dividend) from a landlord (representing the lender of the shorted shares). you only rented this house because you believe it will decline in value. Once your lease started, you secretly sold the house to some sucker who buys it because he wants to live there and is confident that the housing market is artificially depressed by fake houses listed on zillow in the area. He also heard rumors about a new law coming into effect soon which will expose this fraud. You're secretly planning to buy it back once the market value plummets, then terminate your lease. This isn't meant to be realistic so please don't nitpick at things like home ownership titles.\n\nCash dividend:  the landlord has a magical marijuana plant which requires no care yet yields exactly one ounce of mid-grade weed every quarter like clockwork. As a tenant, it's your contracted responsibility to mail him this weed every quarter. Once you sell the house, the new homeowner is legally entitled to the quarterly ounce of weed from this plant, so you cant mail your landlord his weed anymore. Instead, you buy identical mid-grade weed every quarter from a dealer and send that to him. Landlord is happy to be receiving the mid-grade weed he's entitled to, and can't tell the difference bc shitty mids is shitty mids.\n\nStock dividend: a pointless new law is announced: all four rooms within this house now have a different address, and represent four distinct properties. As a result, your lease is changed to four separate leases, each at 1/4 the monthly rent. Your total monthly rent hasn't changed, and your landlord's house hasn't either. In other words, your monthly rent has not changed, and you don't owe your landlord anything. You don't have to move out of his house at 11:59 pm on the last day of your old lease and then move back in 2 mins later when the new 4-room lease kicks in.\n\n**TLDR and TDDU (too dumb don't understand)** - If that's still too complicated for you apes. The dildo I use on your wife breaks down into four stackable pieces of increasing girths, like those Russian matreyshka dolls. If I lend you that dildo and It comes apart while you're thrusting it into your dumb ass and can't figure out how to put it back together, you now owe me the four pieces of my dildo that add up to the whole dildo I lent you. That's it. You don't have to return the 4 shit covered dildo components to me then re-borrow them.\n\nI look forward to seeing where the next goalpost is placed.", "id": "vt5j7f", "created_utc": 1657154998.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|56|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vt5j7f)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vt5j7f)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "OP been real quiet since this…", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Honestly I skipped over his question at first because I had just answered about 20 questions in a row asking the same \"but what about the naked shorts?!\" \n\nThere aren't any naked shorts.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "there’s the difference i suppose, a difference in speculation", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "you did NOT just come back 6 months later without even a remind me 🤣 hope you’re doing well.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "To answer your bolded question - nope. Let's pretend there actually a massive conspiracy to take down GME via fake shares (there isn't).\n\n\rA stock dividend is not passed through the short seller to the lender of shares, unlike a cash dividend. This is because the stock dividend increases the number of shares outstanding by 4x, while simultaneously decreasing the equity ownership conveyed per share by 1/4. Even if a bunch of GME short sellers were shorting fake shares (they're not), this still would not be a reason that they'd have to buy back shares to repay the lender. It's just not how this works.\n\nPretend you have a one dollar bill which is sitting on your desk and you had no plans to spend it. Pretend you lend me this dollar bill, and I agree to pay you interest while I'm borrowing it. If I take this dollar bill and convert it into four quarters, would you demand that I repay you three of those quarters? No, you wouldn't, because I still owe you a dollar. Also, making me return three of my four quarters would cost you money, because my future interest payments to you would be 75% less, and those 3 quarters would just sit on your desk doing nothing.\r  \n\r  \nThis is why this stock dividend is such a non-event.

Is that value just $120 or is it 400 shares. \n\nIt sounds like from your past work experience with shorting a stock that goes through a stock dividend that the lender doesn't recall their shares. It sounds like there is no benefit to the lender because they are still collecting the fee, is that right? Did the cost to borrow increase during that time? Was there and difference during that time pre/post stock dividend split? \n\nIt sounds like you don't believe naked shorting is a thing or you just haven't experienced it.

It's the equivalent of me owing you $1, and paying you back in 4 quarters.\n\n>So at some point the shorts will have to deliver shares right? Is that value just $120 or is it 400 shares.\n\nThe value is $120. At some point the shorts will probably deliver shares, but they don't have to. A stock dividend doesn't force short sellers to return shares to the lender.\n\n>It sounds like there is no benefit to the lender because they are still collecting the fee, is that right? Did the cost to borrow increase during that time? Was there and difference during that time pre/post stock dividend split?\n\nCorrect, there is no benefit to the lender from a stock dividend. The amount of the loan is unchanged. If I was paying him $5 per month in interest on the loan, I will continue doing that both pre- and post- stock dividend. I don't recall any noteworthy changes in borrow cost between pre- and post- split/stock dividend.\n\n> It sounds like you don't believe naked shorting is a thing or you just haven't experienced it. \n\nBoth are correct - never seen it or heard of anyone doing it.

This cost him $200 dollar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now, change it to stock dividend.\n\nA get 1000 stock as dividend from GME\n\nS borrow 200 share, sold it to B\n\nB now own 200 share. and need to receive 200 share in dividend from S\n\nS need to pull out 200 share from his ass to give to B. His ass doesn't have any. he can't get it from his ass. So he goes back to his buddy A, and say he you got some extra share, I need to borrow it also. A goes what the hell? when money was given, you pull it out of your ass, but now it's shares, your ass don't have it huh? and you want to borrow it from me? ok, but it will be 1 million ok? you know, supply, demand, times are changing, inflation, i need to pay my wife's BF??\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT EDIT EDIT: WTF you all are still here? price has gone from 127 to 135 now. ok fine fine, i agree with you all that i am wrong, you are right. That's definitely why price is going up, just stay out and watch it moon!! happy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "vtn2u4", "created_utc": 1657212447.0, "score": 453, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 442, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|226|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vtn2u4)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vtn2u4)\n    \nHey /u/Pristine-Square-1126, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 470, "replies": [{"body": "Free eye cancer.", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "Seriously, my fuking eyes hurt…I need a doctor.", "score": 15, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Im only here for the memes and let me tell you 📉", "score": 26, "replies": []}, {"body": "Well to my understanding, for example there 2x the float of shares, 50% is legit and 50% is synthetic, well the 50% of shares will be quadrupled and price go down 4x, from 120 to 30.

After investing heavily in personnel, technology, inventory and supply chain infrastructure over the past 18 months, our focus is on achieving sustained profitability. This means eliminating excess costs and operating with an intense owner’s mentality. Everyone in the organization must become even more hands-on and embrace a heightened level of accountability for results.\n\nWith that said, I’m getting in touch today to share three organizational updates:\n\n1.  After making more than 600 corporate hires in 2021 and the first half of 2022, we have a stronger understanding of our transformation needs. This has positioned us to right-size headcount across several corporate departments. Today, we’re making a number of reductions to help us keep things simple and operate nimbly with the right talent in place.\n\n2. We’re going to be making a significant investment in our Store Leaders and field employees, who play a critical role fulfilling the needs of our customers. These individuals are, in many respects, the heart of GameStop. We’ll be sharing details regarding this investment in the coming weeks.\n\n3. Mike Recupero, who has served as our Chief Financial Officer since last June, is departing. Diana Jajeh, who has been our Chief Accounting Officer and possesses strong institutional knowledge of the business, has been appointed Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThese changes will enable us to operate in a profitable manner as we execute against our strategy of pursuing sales growth in our commerce business and launching new products that empower customers within the digital asset and web3 gaming verticals.

After investing heavily in personnel, technology, inventory and supply chain infrastructure over the past 18 months, our focus is on achieving sustained profitability. This means eliminating excess costs and operating with an intense owner’s mentality. Everyone in the organization must become even more hands-on and embrace a heightened level of accountability for results.\n\nWith that said, I’m getting in touch today to share three organizational updates:\n\nAfter making more than 600 corporate hires in 2021 and the first half of 2022, we have a stronger understanding of our transformation needs. This has positioned us to right-size headcount across several corporate departments. Today, we’re making a number of reductions to help us keep things simple and operate nimbly with the right talent in place.\n\nWe’re going to be making a significant investment in our Store Leaders and field employees, who play a critical role fulfilling the needs of our customers. These individuals are, in many respects, the heart of GameStop. We’ll be sharing details regarding this investment in the coming weeks.\n\nMike Recupero, who has served as our Chief Financial Officer since last June, is departing. Diana Jajeh, who has been our Chief Accounting Officer and possesses strong institutional knowledge of the business, has been appointed Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThese changes will enable us to operate in a profitable manner as we execute against our strategy of pursuing sales growth in our commerce business and launching new products that empower customers within the digital asset and web3 gaming verticals. I’m confident in the team we have in place going forward, and thank you again for your continued dedication and focus.\n\nRegards, Matt", "score": -2, "replies": []}, {"body": "There are 6 repetitive accounts in here commenting on everything.
