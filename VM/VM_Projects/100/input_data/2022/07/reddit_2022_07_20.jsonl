New cars, I believe we could be in the 80% area by 2030.  Sure it's ambitious but we have many catalysts lining up.  But guessing at timelines is pretty pointless.  At this point it's clear EV's are far superior tech and in 20 or 25 whatever years most all vehicles on the road (personal and transport) will be EV's.  The tech and cost savings is just that good.  \n\nHow to play this is another matter since quite a few people see the same trend emerging, obvious stocks like TSLA are quite overpriced while traditional automakers like Ford (the best positioned) are still going to be dealing with significant headwinds from the chip shortage, a recession, a largely unionized workforce and a dying network of dealers.  \n\nOne interesting area that stands to grow significantly is EV charging infrastructure.  If you look at the growth of Tesla's supercharging network along side their growth in vehicle production, and then you extrapolate that now that we are actually just starting to see non-tesla EV's go mainstream, there's going to be a huge demand for national networks of fast chargers.  Where Tesla customers overwhelmingly use Tesla superchargers, nearly every customer who buys a ford or gm or rivian is going to signup with chargepoint, blink ect.  \n\nWe're also already seeing a huge push from governments and companies to partner with these companies to install charging stations across the country.   Just think, nearly every parking garage and street parking location is going to need to wire for charging for people without a garage.  \n\nThinking longer term 10-20 year timeframe with bi-directional charging Utility companies will essentially get millions of free load stabilizers plugged in all over.  Instead of having build out peak power capacity, all the EV's in a particular city (or even down to the street level) that are plugged in can just offload 1% of their battery to the grid.

Many people don't realise yet that a brand new $70K Tesla Model Y is cheaper to own and operate over a 5 year term of ownership than a $20K second hand ICE vehicle, assuming average mileage per year. If you're able to afford the sticker price of an EV (or second hand models become affordable), it's a no brainer already today. And EVs are only becoming cheaper over time while ICE vehicles are becoming more expensive.\n\n100% is a bit extreme, but in 90% of the market (NA, EU, CH, JP and KR), car sales will be 80-90% EVs by 2030. The sales trends, demand for EVs ([already around 50% globally according to latest polling](https://electrek.co/2022/05/27/52-percent-global-car-buyers-want-to-purchase-ev/)) and the order times for EVs are demonstrating this very clearly.\n\nPersonally, I think lithium miners are too difficult to pick and the only logical option is Tesla. If EVs are indeed ~80% in 2030, Tesla could easily do over 10% of that. Assuming the car market recovers to pre-pandemic levels as EVs become available, that's ~10M sales per year.\n\nEven if Tesla's ASPs come down a bit to ~50K as they have to introduce a cheaper model, and if margins stop increasing, they'd be doing roughly 10M * 50K * 19% = $104.5B in net income from cars alone by 2030. With a conservative PE of 20 (seeing as they'd be growing earnings roughly 45% annually throughout the decade), that's around $2T in market cap.\n\nRealistically I think their margins will continue to increase with increased scale, ASPs will not decline, the PE will not be below 40 and they'll sell 20-25% of the EV market instead of 10%, so I think the potential market cap from automotive alone is at least $6T by 2030.\n\nAnd then there's everything else they're doing that's just a bonus.

Buyers have been contending with high prices all year, but with rates almost double what they were in January, they‚Äôve lost considerable purchasing power.\n\n‚ÄúPurchase activity declined for both conventional and government loans as the weakening economic outlook, high inflation and persistent affordability challenges are impacting buyer demand,‚Äù said Joel Kan, an economist for the MBA.\n\nWhile buyers are less affected by weekly moves in interest rates, the broader picture of rising rates has already taken its toll. Mortgage rates moved higher again last week after falling slightly over the past three weeks.\n\nThe average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) increased to 5.82% from 5.74%, with points increasing to 0.65 from 0.59 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was 3.11% the same week one year ago.\n\nDemand for refinances, which are highly rate sensitive, fell 4% for the week and were 80% lower than the same week last year. Those applications are also at a 22-year low, but the drop in demand from homebuyers caused the refinance share of mortgage activity to increase to 31.4% of total applications from 30.8% the previous week.\n\nMortgage interest rates haven‚Äôt moved much this week, but that could change very soon due to increasing bond market volatility. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates by another 75 basis points next week, and other central banks are taking similar action against inflation.

What is your source for the 2021 median wages? I think it is probably irrelevant anyway since your sources for mortgage rates and home prices show that houses were significantly cheaper in price and the rate was roughly the same or better in 2020 Q4. Unless the median wage in 2021 jumped a good amount between 2020 Q4 and 2021 Q1, it would seem 2020 Q4 was the best time to by (recently).\n\nUsing your sources:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2012 Q4: house prices - 251, 700, interest rate December 2012 - 3.35%, Median wage - $51,017\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2020 Q4: house prices - 358, 700, interest rate December 2022 - 2.68%, Median wage - $67,521\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2012 home purchase/conventional loan/20% down/no PMI: Payment - $887.42, Total interest paid - $118,111, Payment % of monthly income - 20.87%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2020 home purchase/conventional loan/20% down/no PMI: Payment - $1,161, Total interest paid - $130,955, Payment % of monthly income - 20.63%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2012 home purchase/conventional loan/10% down/0.5% PMI: Payment - $1,187.12, Total interest paid - $132,875.41, Payment % of monthly income - 27.9%\n\n  \n2020 home purchase/conventional loan/10% down/0.5% PMI: Payment - $1,575, Total interest paid - $147,325, Payment % of monthly income - 27.99%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe difference between the two is pretty marginal when comparing the payment as a percentage of your monthly income. If you had 20% to put down in 2020 then it was a better time to buy, marginally. If you had to pay PMI, and only could afford to pay 10% it was cheaper in 2012. Note that the less you have to put down, the more it tilts in the favor of 2012 over 2022. Also, note that these figures do not include property taxes which are higher in 2022 or home insurance which would be higher in 2022. I don't really feel like looking for sources for these, so I just excluded them but they would be in 2012's favor regardless and might even show that 2012 is still cheaper in the 20% down category.\n\nI can't find any official source that shows how many people put 20% down. If you have one, please share it. However, according to the survey by the National Association of Realtors, 73% of people put less than 20% down in November of 2020 (this excludes cash buyers).  I think it would be very difficult to say that for the average person it would be better to buy in 2020 vs 2012, but it is very close to where it is almost insignificant.\n\n[https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-11-realtors-confidence-index-12-22-2020.pdf](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-11-realtors-confidence-index-12-22-2020.pdf)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "This.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "So like buying 2017 and refinancing in 2020?

Tough stuff but we all figure it out.\n\nInterest rates are mostly driven by politics these days. But they should be driven by capital scarcity.  When lots of people want to borrow money the interest rate rises.  No crystal balls to be had and I suspect, though I can‚Äôt be sure, that the Feds memory will be long on this inflationary period and resist cheap money again.  A huge economic downturn might inspire other choices.  Hard to say and I probably shouldn‚Äôt have given you the impression that it‚Äôs fast or guaranteed.  In the 80s people bought houses for a 1/5 of what we pay today with 13% rates.\n\nMy advise is buy what you need when you need it and accept the circumstances of the time.  Prices might be high and rates low or vise versa; maybe you find exactly what you want or you might have to make compromises (I wanted a garage and didn‚Äôt get one).  You can time the market here a little but not much.

The high albedo of fresh snow helps get a little more light to the solar panel for the period between it coming off the panels and melting off other surfaces.

Second problem is that their current margins are exceptional, as they took advantage of the car shortages to jack up prices massively (Model Y went from $47,000 to $62,990 for ex).

On the EC they mentioned they made a slight profit, but it was offset by their impairment.\n\nAs for that, the way BTC accounting works is that you are not allowed to recognise any profits until you sell. So if you buy at $10k and BTC goes to $100k, the profit in your books is $0. Once you sell, you are allowed to recognise that profit.\n\nOn the other hand, if it drops below your \"carrying value\", you do need to recognise that impairment. So if you bought for $10k and it drops to $5k, you need to take a $5k loss on your earnings. If after that it goes back to $10k, you're still \"carrying\" it for $5k until you sell. You're not allowed to recoup your losses in the books until you sell. If at any point it goes below the lowest it's been while you were holding it (so $5k in this example), you again need to take an impairment in your books.\n\nSo in short, they made a small profit on the 75% they sold this quarter, but because the other 25% dropped roughly 30% below their carrying value, generating a $100-130M impairment (again, can just calculate this based on the earnings report), that offset the gains from the other 75%.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Dang, thank you very much for clarifying, it makes sense as I can see the reasoning, but this is just awful haha. \n\nThank you very much for taking your time and stress clarifying!", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "No worries!

What we need to set up as a society is make the validators that run the network be people from all over the nation/world and not just the big banks, then crypto will surely be used in a dystopian way. I also have concerns with money use during a blackout. \n\nOnce regulations are set though the scammers in crypto are DONE. NFTs, stablecoins (except usdc), and shitcoins will basically get shut down. \n\nThere are coins that actually **produce** small amounts of energy per transaction, have **instant liquidity**, hard capped supply, fair node systems, etc. People need to start reading white papers. It‚Äôs the best way to educate yourself rather than reading articles written by people who do little to no research and use Buffet as their source. \n\nPeople in here act like crypto ain‚Äôt it but probably only understand bitcoin and ethereum. Maybe tether. Which I personally think all three of them will fail. Bitcoin - 7 transactions per second, lmao only a small population of the world uses it for trading but imagine how poorly it would scale if the whole world went to using bitcoin. Ethereum is a shady organization that has deep ties to legacy banking. Nobody knows who the whales are for their IPO (very problematic). Costs $3000 to buy a $200 NFT, ok lol. \n\nBut check out the technology and read the white papers of Algorand, Hedera Hashgraph, XRP, XLM, XDC, Vechain, etc. and you start to get clarity on how the future will be. These are the tokens that actually save our economy and have known respected people in tech working on them. To those that want to downvote this, let me just say that we have to resort to one or few of these tokens because our current system is literally collapsing in the next few months. We will need currency that provides instant liquidity.\n\nBanks will use the coins that make their systems run better.

So if a stock has 1 bid at $1 and 99 asks at $10 based on RH stupid fucking calculations the quote on screen might look astronomical.

He eventually suggested having a gang bang with his friends and they all laughed at how pathetic I was while they all took my hole and some of their cocks were so big that my asshole was destroyed and had fissures and tears. I cried while getting raped and hated myself for crying because the sadistic bastards got more excited and went harder. I was in school getting extra shame piled on because the teacher would give me a hard time for taking extra time in the washroom because it hurt so bad to go after what he and his friends had done to me.

It very succinctly describes the problems with off-world colonization and why it‚Äôs an absolutely infeasible proposition given our current technological capability.\n\nThe main argument is that no environment in the solar system is better suited to human life than Earth. And this is going to be the case no matter how bad the climate crisis gets. Earth would be more hospitable than Mars or the moon no matter what happens. Even a supervolcanic eruption that caused a decade long volcanic winter would be more ideal conditions than trying to survive off world. First of all, the most vital resource to biological life is a plethora of other biological life nearby. Living lifeforms provide us with food, dead lifeforms provide us energy and nutrients for growing food, and organic compounds in general have a large degree of complexity that allows for a wide array of chemical interactions, many of which serve crucial roles in medicine, scientific experimentation, etc. The only source of these compounds in the solar system is Earth. This means any off-world colony would be reliant on a supply chain with Earth for centuries if not millennia. Even if a successful moon/Mars colony were to be set up within the next century, if society on Earth were to collapse, the colony would ultimately be doomed.\n\nAnother main issue is gravity. We know people in microgravity exhibit loss of muscle and bone mass at an incredibly unhealthy rate. We have absolutely no idea how gravitational fields other than Earth‚Äôs would affect a pregnancy/fetal development or even healthy adult individuals subjected to long-term exposure. The only gravitation field strength healthy for Earth-evolved lifeforms is 9.8 m/s^(2), and again, the only place in the solar system where that exists is Earth.\n\nThen there‚Äôs the ultimate nail in the coffin argument: any attempt at setting up a self-sustaining colony off-world would be insanely more expensive than simply fixing the problems we‚Äôve caused on Earth. What‚Äôs better: a completely hospitable world that‚Äôs been thrown a little out of whack, or a totally uninhabitable wasteland that has never supported life over billions of years of existence. Living on Mars would be true hell even in an established colony. We have no idea the kind of mental insanity it would cause a person. There‚Äôs a pretty solid postulation that suggests we would find living on Mars undesirable, and it goes as follows: even though people have had knowledge of and access to the continent of Antarctica for tens of thousands of years, it remains uninhabited and no one has ever attempted a long-term colonization effort of the continent. Why is that when we‚Äôve conquered every other corner of our planet? Put simply, nobody actually wants to live there cause the conditions are fucking terrible, and those who have tried either gave up pretty quick or went insane and died out. Now consider this: the conditions of Antarctica are hundreds of times more human-life friendly than conditions on Mars, the moon, or any other accessible off-world location. It‚Äôs simply ridiculous to assume that a colony of Mars colonists would be both safe and happy long term. Keep in mind it only takes one mentally ill individual to use an air-lock improperly, accidentally start a fire in a moment of stress/tiredness, etc, and the entire colony could fail.\n\nNow don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do think we need to establish off-world colonies because it‚Äôs a natural expansion of human nature to explore and understand our universe, and it provides humanity a check against total extinction threats such asteroid impacts. I simply think viewing off-world colonies as a solution to the climate issue is faulty. Even if humanity establishes successful off-world colonies, they will not achieve true long-term sustainable self-sufficiently anytime soon, and are doomed to extinction as well should society on Earth be destroyed.

Every Crypto miner who can GPU mine (vs ASIC mine) will be foreced to upgrade to be competitive. Every laptop, workstation, gamer and server and datacenter (if needed by apps) will look at the option to update. \n\nThe government Silicon Foundry bill will be a couple years before any chips roll off lines in Ohio and New Mexico. Foundries are complex and the construction is not pedestrian. Then of course you need to fill the space with highend machines that are built only after the order from the likes of AMAT, ASML, etc.   \n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is Pelosi has the same data you have for the current market. And the additional capacity will only mitigate supply for the broad range of silicon out there.  The shortage is a combination of events: 1) COVID caused shutdowns thus disrupting supply continuity - 2) There was a geometry transition moving to 5nm - 3) IOT and digitization continues to take off - 4) Non-leading edge geometries used by most chips out there had many of their foundries shuttered and sold off to the likes of Tower/Jazz now Intel. \n\nSo that's the lay of the land. All very well documented. All old news. And Pelosi is just investing like anyone else. Nothing in the bill helps NVIDIA except for eventually more foundries to go to - the same as any other fabless manufacturer.  (Note MOST chip companies are fabless.

Luckily for me, that day is 1 day later. This number has been a dream in my head so it feels awesome typing this out‚Ä¶thanks for reading\n\nTLDR : Turned 6k into over 500k in 2 years while banging you‚Äôre wife on the side\n\nBackground on me: 36/married/1 kid/own home/cars/boat/earn mid 100s/yr\n\n2020 :\n\nI started this Roth account in April of 2020 with 6k with the idea of being risky and turning it into something big. If it didn‚Äôt work out, oh well as I still have other accounts. I have a brokerage, 401k, IRA as well that I don‚Äôt touch all that much (basically it‚Äôs in SPY/QQQ) and has been for a while. I have traded penny/small caps with my brokerage over the years and taken out gains to pay for stuff (home down payment, cars and ect)\n\nMost of my experience in trading up to this point was in my brokerage where I did really well trading penny stocks/small caps during marijuana/internet money boom years\n\nAs you can tell by the chart, I didn‚Äôt make the majority of my $ during 2020 but did pretty well on Covid stocks and tried out options trading for the first time. I didn‚Äôt yolo my whole port into my plays, but I understood the power of options (huge wins/huge losses)\n\nTop 5 gains/losses of 2020 below\n\n[https://imgur.com/PJHF5TW](https://imgur.com/PJHF5TW)\n\n2021 :\n\nEarly part of 2021, I started to get a little bit riskier and got lucky on some of the meme plays. Almost hit 100k due to RKT options in March. Then I hit a patch where I didn‚Äôt really win/lose a whole lot until late in 2021.\n\nFake internet money was going crazy, and I just thought it was unsustainable. I tried to find miners and etf‚Äôs that tracked it and I landed on buying puts on MARA and BITO, which was clutch as that mooned me up to 200k\n\nTop 5 gains/losses of 2021 below\n\n[https://imgur.com/ABJOvmj](https://imgur.com/ABJOvmj)\n\n2022 :\n\nHoly volatility‚Ä¶in the beginning of 2022 I just played the trend of going down‚Ä¶shorted BITO again and loaded up on inverse leveraged ETFs‚Ä¶I also switched back and forth between bull/bear gang gang multiple times. Lost some on some stupid plays that I was trying to force/chase that brought me down a bit in April, but refocused on the trends and taking profits‚Ä¶nobody ever lost money taking profits\n\nIn terms of what I have been doing lately? Well, kinda what I‚Äôve tried to do all the time, which is play the trends‚Ä¶whether that is meme stocks, short squeezes, inflation downturns‚Ä¶just trying to feel the market I guess‚Ä¶your wife likes it\n\nTop 5 gains/losses of 2022 below\n\n[https://imgur.com/gWDLncx](https://imgur.com/gWDLncx)\n\nI‚Äôve also put picture of my top/bottom plays from over the years in the tax doc that etrade gives me.
