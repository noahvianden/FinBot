When I first started investing in 2021 I was skeptical, but in the end I think the people saying \"you can't time the market\" had some wisdom to what they said.  My portfolio is in the red, yeah, but it's not that bad and meanwhile I'm collecting dividends.  Emotionally speaking it also would have been very difficult to wait, I think.  I think there's some wisdom to \"VTI and chill\".  At some point watching the market go up and down every day takes a toll on you, at some point it's probably better just to get it over with and move on with your life. You can always add more later, and people saying that buying the dip will help you get back even quicker are probably correct.\n\nThat said, I was right about a few things myself. I correctly predicted that the bull market was unsustainable and that the end of QE would be the end of the rally.  I also predicted that QE and the high valuations it causes leave us very vulnerable to shocks and black swan events - ie the war in Ukraine and inflation.  Some people might reply here \"well duh\", but that's not the case.  I remember people vehemently denying that any of this was possible, and taking the opportunity to downvote and dunk on me whenever I brought it up.\n\nIf anyone recognizes my name, I must admit that I myself haven't been perfect at this.  But I have tried my best to keep an open mind. \n\nAnyway, it's not that everyone's perspective is necessarily insightful or valid.  Some people really say stupid things.  Still, it seems our tendency is to always jump to the conclusion that any conflicting opinions are nonsense or garbage.  I don't think this is always the case.  I think people always have a reason to believe what they do, and if we all learned a bit of humility we might be able to learn from them.  I think that makes us better investors, and as cheesy as it may sound, better people, too.\n\nI have a bad feeling that I will receive the normal hate on this post, or even that it will be removed for being off topic.  That would be a shame.  Ray Dalio talked about how important it is, in his experience, to share ideas and opinions with others in order to try to figure out any blind spots.  And I think he's a pretty good investor.\n\nPS: This doesn't just happen here, it's unfortunately a bad human trait that is made even worse by the anonymity of the internet.

Most people have this basic statement level with no particular depth and it creates this perfect storm of \"I told you\".\n2. Vulnerability to shocks was a problem 2 years ago, you're behind, not ahead, and the War in Ukraine is not a Black Swan event because conflict is surprisingly common though major wars that capture the international attention are not, so it's not that war is rare, it's that the attention is rare, and secondly the shock you're talking about already happened in the past where inflation is a by-product of QE itself, it's not that QE made the vulnerability, it *is* the vulnerability.\n\nNow that's the answer to your question.

Ironically, this ethos leads to policies that benefit those who are already at the top, increasing inequality and making the rich richer.  We can verify increasing inequality in the USA:\n\n[https://www.datatrekresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GINI-660x371.png](https://www.datatrekresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GINI-660x371.png)\n\nWe also have some data that, while not conclusive, show that QE may be responsible for some increases in inequality:\n\n[https://www.cepweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Montecino-paper.pdf](https://www.cepweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Montecino-paper.pdf)\n\nNo, I didn't run the tests myself, but have read academic works about it.\n\nProbably in large part due to our 'free market' ethos, our economy has become more and more financialized.  This can be verified by comparing financial profits vs. manufacturing over time:\n\n[https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/mt/business/assets\\_c/2013/03/BEA\\_Corporate\\_Profits\\_Finance\\_and\\_Manufacturing\\_Formatted-thumb-615x421-115012.png](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/mt/business/assets_c/2013/03/BEA_Corporate_Profits_Finance_and_Manufacturing_Formatted-thumb-615x421-115012.png)\n\nProductive investment is set aside over time, with more investment going towards speculation and financial (non-GDP) transactions.  More money is spent on buybacks rather than reinvested into business:\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/MqM9KkiUPJvRoEX63\\_-XhFwor5g=/922x505/filters:no\\_upscale():max\\_bytes(150000):strip\\_icc()/Screenshot2020-04-14at11.17.32AM-6d8cfcd249bd4cfa94ba0343bc2f3426.png](https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/MqM9KkiUPJvRoEX63_-XhFwor5g=/922x505/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2020-04-14at11.17.32AM-6d8cfcd249bd4cfa94ba0343bc2f3426.png)\n\nAs more capital is allocated to finance and non-GDP transactions, productivity slows.  Furthermore, as debt accumulates in the system (thanks in no small part to ZIRP / QE), it becomes necessary to keep interest rates artificially low in order to pay it back.  The problem, however, is what happens if interest rates need to rise, like, for example, in the case of inflation.  In that case, there's the possibility of a debt crisis.\n\nAlso, ZIRP and QE also lead to zombification of the economy.  Businesses that would otherwise go under without cheap access to credit are allowed to keep going.  This hampers adjustment and in the end hampers productivity.  Growing inequality also hampers productivity, as low to mid income households tend to spend more of their money on consumption.  If they have less money, there's less consumption in the economy, and thus less aggregate demand / productivity / employment.  I recommend Stiglitz for more about this.\n\nAll of this is worrying because we have an economy that has a lot of vulnerabilities in the system (increased debt stocks) yet an ever decreasing ability to grow our way out of it.\n\nNot to mention the threat of political instability, which we've seen all over the world what with Bolsonaro in Brazil and of course Trump in the USA.

People who find consistent success in the less conventional strategies will always be outnumbered, called lucky, and/or downvoted, so it discourages them from posting and makes it seem that DCA index investing is the only intelligent way to invest. \n\nThe thing is, DCA index investing is the most intelligent way to invest for *most* people, so that becomes the conventional wisdom. What this conventional group of investors needs to remember is that ‚Äúrare‚Äù doesn‚Äôt equal ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù. The unconventional traders need to remember that unless they have succeeded under multiple market regimes through many years, there is a decent probability their results are mostly attributable to luck until proven otherwise through the test of time.

In the past years the audience diversified, but toxicity and misinformation never ran rampant imo. I'm happy and proud about that in a sense.

I just ignore them in most cases and they hopefully take something from writing their comment and maybe reactions from other users. Comments on macroeconomics, investment strategies or personal experiences usually are about as valuable to me as a statement like buy low sell high.\n\nI do think more humility would be a good thing in general, but that doesn't mean I think it's a good idea in any given context.

Now consider the size of its existing base of users. [Graph](https://i.imgur.com/iyeXdXW.png)\n- Net margins generally stay above 25%, currently in the 30s. This is much higher and more consistent than say Google (around 29 now, but has seen a lot more volatility).\n- Any DCF I've seen shows that it is fairly valued even if revenue grows by 3-5% long term instead of its historic 20-40% growth\n- 5 year return on invested capital is 16%\n\nLet me add some more qualitative remarks:\n\n- It has survived many scandals and will continue to\n- Whatsapp is used around the world by a few billion people and can be monetized (maybe?)\n- Who knows if metaverse works!? I certainly am not interested, it is just a bonus if it works.\n- Reels could displace TikTok especially if there is a ban (see FCC remarks on TikTok). TikTok is spyware!\n- Companies like META have some of the best talent in AI/machine learning, and these skills transfer to a variety of profit-generating services. A similar case is there for GOOG and MSFT. You get high quality employees at companies like this.\n- The uncertainty/fear around META is more than made up for by the valuations.

Here‚Äôs my counter argument. \n\n#The Bearish Case for $META: Put Spreads Into Earnings.\n\n**Brief Bear Case for $META (tl;dr)**: \n\nAfter ER misses from $SNAP & $TWTR, falling FB & IG App Store metrics, and continued dominance from TikTok, $META puts into earnings look like a reasonable trade. However, with an IV rank of 94% (IV has only been higher 6% of the time in recent history), navigating this trade is going to take some nuance. If you don‚Äôt have time to read, that means I‚Äôm arming myself with bearish put debit spreads expiring July 29th ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings.\n\n**First, some facts:**\n\n* $META carries an average single-day earnings move of 10.5% over the last 5 quarters.\n* February 2nd saw a particularly brutal outcome of -26.39% ‚Äî the [largest single day loss of market cap in market history](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-platforms-stock-facebook-market-capitalization-51643908656), -$232.02B.\n* $META shares recently reached a fresh >2-year low of $154.25 during the week beginning 6/21/22.\n* Prior to that, $META reached a brief pandemic low of $137.10 during the week beginning 3/16/20.¬†\n   * How brief? The week prior (beginning 3/09/20), $META closed at $154.34 ‚Äî $0.09 above its most recent June low.¬†\n   * The week following (beginning 3/23/20) $META closed at $156.79 ‚Äî $2.54 above its most recent low.\n   * Outside of the week beginning 3/16/20, $META has respected the $154 level since early 2019.\n* Since reporting earnings in February of 2022, shares of $META have remained in a technical downtrend, with a linear regression rate of roughly 0.758.¬†\n* Despite reporting upbeat earnings and guidance in April of 2022, the stock was unable to escape the downtrend.\n* The bottom of this bearish channel coincides perfectly with $META‚Äôs pandemic low of $137.10.\n* TikTok continues to dominate Facebook, Instagram and Messenger from a growth and revenue perspective.\n   * On a list of the top grossing apps in the US, Tiktok places 3rd, Facebook places 84th. Instagram and Messenger are too low to feature.\n* Lastly, Zuckerberg himself has been blunt about the current state of Meta.¬†\n   * [Meta slashes hiring plans.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-meta-girds-fierce-headwinds-slower-growth-second-half-memo-2022-06-30/)\n      * CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees to brace for a deep economic downturn.\n\n>\"If I had to bet, I'd say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,\" Zuckerberg told workers in a weekly employee Q&A session, audio of which was heard by Reuters.\n\n**Conclusion**: Bearish\n\nIn the wake of $SNAP and $TWTR missing earnings on the top and bottom line, Tiktok‚Äôs continued growth, a firm technical downtrend in $META shares, and a strong propensity for outsized earnings moves, there are plenty of reasons to get bearish ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings this Thursday. However, with a 94% IV rank, strong support at $154, a 10.5% average earnings move, and IV crush to contend with, it‚Äôs critical from a vega and theta perspective to utilize a put debit spread here.\n\n**The Trade Structure**: Put Debit Spreads\n\n**Safe**: Targeting the $155 support level.¬†\n\n**Lotto**: Target the $137 support level if $META breaks below $155 and falls to the bottom of it‚Äôs downtrend, the pandemic low of $137.10.\n\nFor July 29th, **long $170 puts, short $155 puts** ‚Äî Risking $6.00 for a profit of $9.00, breakeven of $164 and maximum value of $15.00 if $META satisfies its 10.5% expected move.¬†\n\n**OR** \n\nFor July 29th, **long $145 puts, short $137 puts** ‚Äî Risking $1.00 for a profit of $7.00, breakeven of $144 and maximum value of $8.00 if $META has another outsized earnings move like it did in February, targeted at the next area of support.\n\n**Alternatively**, you can combine these two trades by running long $170 puts, short $137 puts ‚Äî Risking $9.00 for a profit of $24.00, breakeven of $161 and maximum value of $33.00 if $META falls to it‚Äôs pandemic low.¬†\n\nNo matter which trade you pick, it‚Äôs important to collect at least *some* premium on this. Holding through earnings is risky business, IV crush and theta are going to be very much in play here with these short term, OTM options, which is why we want to target the ATM $170 strike for our long position.¬†\n\n**Trade Headwinds**:¬†\n\n* $META‚Äôs earnings report falls on July 27th, after market close ‚Äî directly in between the FOMC‚Äôs next rate hike meeting (July 26th) and directly before we get QoQ GDP data (July 28th, 8:30 AM EST). That means that the market will be simultaneously reacting to both $META earnings and GDP data. If the GDP reaction is bad, that‚Äôs a big tailwind. If the GDP reaction is good, we could see extra noise on this trade which we can‚Äôt afford from a time basis.\n* Alphabet ($GOOGL) and Microsoft ($MSFT) earnings reports are due on July 26th ‚Äî right before $META. A positive report from either company could prove to be a macro headwind for this bearish trade.\n\nDespite these headwinds, there are plenty of big reasons to make a bearish trade on $META ahead of earnings.¬†\n\n**The Wrap Up**\n\nUse $170/$155 put debit spreads ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings to target the current >2 year low and an average move of 10.5% ‚Äî OR ‚Äî Target the $137 pandemic low if you‚Äôre looking for a larger than average earnings move (and are comfortable with more risk).\n\n**Visual Data Sources For Some of the Facts Listed Above**: [https://imgur.com/a/H6kDc17](https://imgur.com/a/H6kDc17)", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I don't do technical analysis / options trading but I hope your trades work out!", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you my friend!

This would be called \"warm\" or in some cases \"hot\" traffic.\n\nFacebook offers nothing more than reach and targeting in a disruptive experience. This is \"cold\" traffic.

The juice isn't worth the squeeze any longer.\n\nSo, yes. Google will absorb some of the market share, but outside of TikTok there is no real, large volume ad platform that can reach people that AREN'T searching for something.\n\nGoogle's GDN (adsense on websites, YouTube, .etc) is close, but nowhere near the targeting that's needed to acquire customers at +ROI.\n\nIf FB somehow re-enabled their targeting options, allowed 3rd party data and Apple lifted their manual no-tracking opt-out/in implementation, then I believe Facebook would be the #1 advertising platform in the world.\n\nUnfortunately, none of those scenarios, let alone all of them, are likely to happen and for that reason, Google wins again.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your elaborate answer!

However, with an IV rank of 94% (IV has only been higher 6% of the time in recent history), navigating this trade is going to take some nuance. If you don‚Äôt have time to read, that means I‚Äôm arming myself with bearish put debit spreads expiring July 29th ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings.\n\n**First, some facts:**\n\n* $META carries an average single-day earnings move of 10.5% over the last 5 quarters.\n* February 2nd saw a particularly brutal outcome of -26.39% ‚Äî the [largest single day loss of market cap in market history](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-platforms-stock-facebook-market-capitalization-51643908656), -$232.02B.\n* $META shares recently reached a fresh >2-year low of $154.25 during the week beginning 6/21/22.\n* Prior to that, $META reached a brief pandemic low of $137.10 during the week beginning 3/16/20.¬†\n   * How brief? The week prior (beginning 3/09/20), $META closed at $154.34 ‚Äî $0.09 above its most recent June low.¬†\n   * The week following (beginning 3/23/20) $META closed at $156.79 ‚Äî $2.54 above its most recent low.\n   * Outside of the week beginning 3/16/20, $META has respected the $154 level since early 2019.\n* Since reporting earnings in February of 2022, shares of $META have remained in a technical downtrend, with a linear regression rate of roughly 0.758.¬†\n* Despite reporting upbeat earnings and guidance in April of 2022, the stock was unable to escape the downtrend.\n* The bottom of this bearish channel coincides perfectly with $META‚Äôs pandemic low of $137.10.\n* TikTok continues to dominate Facebook, Instagram and Messenger from a growth and revenue perspective.\n   * On a list of the top grossing apps in the US, Tiktok places 3rd, Facebook places 84th. Instagram and Messenger are too low to feature.\n* Lastly, Zuckerberg himself has been blunt about the current state of Meta.¬†\n   * [Meta slashes hiring plans.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-meta-girds-fierce-headwinds-slower-growth-second-half-memo-2022-06-30/)\n      * CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees to brace for a deep economic downturn.\n\n>\"If I had to bet, I'd say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,\" Zuckerberg told workers in a weekly employee Q&A session, audio of which was heard by Reuters.\n\n**Conclusion**: Bearish\n\nIn the wake of $SNAP and $TWTR missing earnings on the top and bottom line, Tiktok‚Äôs continued growth, a firm technical downtrend in $META shares, and a strong propensity for outsized earnings moves, there are plenty of reasons to get bearish ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings this Thursday. However, with a 94% IV rank, strong support at $154, a 10.5% average earnings move, and IV crush to contend with, it‚Äôs critical from a vega and theta perspective to utilize a put debit spread here.\n\n**The Trade Structure**: Put Debit Spreads\n\n**Safe**: Targeting the $155 support level.¬†\n\n**Lotto**: Target the $137 support level if $META breaks below $155 and falls to the bottom of it‚Äôs downtrend, the pandemic low of $137.10.\n\nFor July 29th, **long $170 puts, short $155 puts** ‚Äî Risking $6.00 for a profit of $9.00, breakeven of $164 and maximum value of $15.00 if $META satisfies its 10.5% expected move.¬†\n\n**OR** \n\nFor July 29th, **long $145 puts, short $137 puts** ‚Äî Risking $1.00 for a profit of $7.00, breakeven of $144 and maximum value of $8.00 if $META has another outsized earnings move like it did in February, targeted at the next area of support.\n\n**Alternatively**, you can combine these two trades by running long $170 puts, short $137 puts ‚Äî Risking $9.00 for a profit of $24.00, breakeven of $161 and maximum value of $33.00 if $META falls to it‚Äôs pandemic low.¬†\n\nNo matter which trade you pick, it‚Äôs important to collect at least *some* premium on this. Holding through earnings is risky business, IV crush and theta are going to be very much in play here with these short term, OTM options, which is why we want to target the ATM $170 strike for our long position.¬†\n\n**Trade Headwinds**:¬†\n\n* $META‚Äôs earnings report falls on July 27th, after market close ‚Äî directly in between the FOMC‚Äôs next rate hike meeting (July 26th) and directly before we get QoQ GDP data (July 28th, 8:30 AM EST). That means that the market will be simultaneously reacting to both $META earnings and GDP data. If the GDP reaction is bad, that‚Äôs a big tailwind. If the GDP reaction is good, we could see extra noise on this trade which we can‚Äôt afford from a time basis.\n* Alphabet ($GOOGL) and Microsoft ($MSFT) earnings reports are due on July 26th ‚Äî right before $META. A positive report from either company could prove to be a macro headwind for this bearish trade.\n\nDespite these headwinds, there are plenty of big reasons to make a bearish trade on $META ahead of earnings.¬†\n\n**The Wrap Up**\n\nUse $170/$155 put debit spreads ahead of $META‚Äôs earnings to target the current >2 year low and an average move of 10.5% ‚Äî OR ‚Äî Target the $137 pandemic low if you‚Äôre looking for a larger than average earnings move (and are comfortable with more risk).\n\n**Visual Data Sources For Some of the Facts Listed Above**: [https://imgur.com/a/H6kDc17](https://imgur.com/a/H6kDc17)", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Might as well read tea leaves", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Again, you clearly dont know what a \"headwind\" is and what a \"tailwind\" is, since you mixed up the definitions for both.

She delivered a shocking stat: 79% of U.S. buyers would only buy a car if it supported CarPlay.\n\n* The auto industry faces an unappealing choice: Offer CarPlay and give up potential revenue and the chance to ride a major industry shift, or spend heavily to develop their own infotainment software and cater to an potentially shrinking audience of car buyers who will purchase a new vehicle without CarPlay.\n\n* GM, which wasn‚Äôt listed on Apple‚Äôs slide, already gets revenue of $2 billion per year from in-car subscriptions and expects it to grow to **$25 billion per year by 2030**. \n\n* Tesla, which doesn‚Äôt support CarPlay, recently shifted into selling its ‚ÄúFSD‚Äù driver-assistance features, including auto-parking and lane-keeping, as a subscription that costs as much $199 per month.\n\n* The next generation of CarPlay will need significant buy-in from automakers to give Apple‚Äôs software access to core systems. Apple suggested it secured cooperation from several major carmakers.\n\n* In June, Apple revealed that it has explored features that integrate commerce into the car‚Äôs cockpit. One new feature announced this summer would allow CarPlay users to navigate to a gas pump and pay for the fuel from the dashboard of the car, according to Reuters.\n\nThis sounds like an incredible source of revenue. Of course there will be a lot of push back from car manufacturers who obviously want to keep this revenue to themselves. But Apple has the advantage of offering with integrations such as:\n\n* iPhone obviously.\n* Watch, which I believe will be a lot more popular in the future as more advanced healthcare capabilities are added to it.\n* Apple home IOT networks.\n* Apple's own entertainment content from Apple TV. I would not be surprised if Apple starts a movie studio 5 years from now or form some exclusive partnerships with maybe Disney.\n\nWhile this is all exciting, that 79% sounds very inflated. For those of you looking to buy new cars, is having CarPlay really that big of a criteria when you consider your next vehicle?\n\n*Disclosure I own a lot of Apple.*", "id": "w6gig3", "created_utc": 1658616763.0, "score": 1244, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 631, "comments": [{"body": "Seems like the survey was skewed 100% to iPhone owners", "score": 793, "replies": [{"body": "So um... how did you conduct this survey?\n\n*OH, we were very thorough.

Not like dial up slow or anything, but slow enough that I have to keep my eyes on it much longer than I should while driving. Here's my take on that. (These are just made up numbers that I feel are close to my normal usage) My time using tech that's meant to be used by hands (smart phones, car infotainment, computers etc) is probably split around 50% phone, 40% computer, and 10% car infotainment. The difference in response and speed between my phone/pc and the car infotainment is big enough that I can't rely on my subconscious, thus requiring more attention.\n\nI think auto manufacturers need to either start putting tech on the level of high end smartphones or give it up and put android auto/apple car play in their vehicles. It's why I have a similar disdain for smart tvs. Everyone that I've used is sluggish and doesn't feel optimized for what it's being used for, so it's easier to not use the smart TV interface and just plug a roku/fire stick or pc into it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">But what about navigation?\n\nGoogle maps plays over car speakers via Bluetooth, so does waze and anything else.

The thread is claiming some asinine % of people wont buy a car without this moron feature. This is obviously false and whether or not you take any of this seriously makes absolutely no difference to me. We are on reddit. Its entertainment. You are entertaining me and hopefully vice versa.\n\nYou havent seen the dedicated GPS's because everyone has a phone and normal people only use it a couple of times a year at most. Its not because they dont work nor because people like you think they are old. The truth is, when someone says things like that it reveals more about them than anything else.\n\nAlmost all devices are voice based and professional drivers use them over phones because they are more reliable. I know this because I have family that work delivery routes. I also keep up with companies that make work vehicles. My father in law, in all his wisdom, wanted to cut costs by buying a normal non-commercial van for his work. He tried using his phone and after a disastrous 1st day, went out to buy a Garmin.\n\nIn other words, the devices work just fine. They are, after all, designed specifically for that task. The problem with most people, like yourself, is you shouldnt own electronics. Lets just say, after two decades of working in IT, its abundandly clear that 9/10 people shouldnt be allowed to own any electronic devices for various reasons I wont mention here because it might make your head explode.\n\nAs for morontainment devices being ubiquitous in cars, thats true, but they are still stupid. I have the functionality along with the android version in my cars and after the 1st couple of days we just stopped using them. For music we just use the car app whatever it is, and bluetooth for source. For the phone, its all with a button and voice. The only thing we actually use is energy monitoring screen and sometimes the charge scheduler. The reality is that most people only use the screens when parked anyway. The only other time is to allow a passenger to change whatever is being listened to and they do that with the phone anyway since its mobile.\n\nIn other words, its a morontainment system. Its there to sell to morons who want to do other, less safe things, with their car or for people who are to stubborn to learn a new device because they are stuck in their ways, which is, ironically, something we usually associate with being \"old and tired.\"", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Lol do you not listen to music?

It makes everything SO. MUCH. EASIER.  \n\n\nThe way I see it...  You have these very basic types of \"assets\". \n\ntrades, growth investments, and asset holdings. \n\nHoldings are equity that is leveraged by a bank or lender for liquidity.  Holdings are the opposite of liquid assets.  Liquid assets like CASH travel at the spend of transaction and lust and immediately turn into things and services you want.  \n\nFor the sake of arguement, holdings like like gold bars, land, buildings, or directly registered shares (not in a broker/broker's street name) majorly STABLE companies (Berkshire, coca cola, and I don't want to name any more because I don't want to get yelled at).  You can't easily change these things into goods, services or tradable assets (like stocks). \n\nLiquidity is used to buy things, anything and everything.  Services, Goods, Tradable Assets, Growth Investments and Holdings.  You can increase liquidity buy earning money (selling your own service), having someone just give it to you,  or by selling less liquid assets for more than what you paid for them. If your adept, you could paid other people to do service for you and then collect the profits made from all of the service being done for you. \n\nThis will all come together, I promise. \n\nCash has a certain type of inherent risks, opportunity and opportunity cost.  \n\nInflation (at whatever rate) will ensure your cash is always worth less tomorrow than it is today.  If you only keep your wealth in cash, them you are certain to have less wealth over time by design of the market system and economy.\n\nSomeone can take it/steal it by force.  You could lose on the street or in a fire. Someone could fraud you for it, or hack your banking password/access card.  \n\nBut you can trade it for anything at any time. Super powerful.  If you have enough you can buy a holding (land, company shares in your name, gold bars), a growth investment like SPY ETF or pay an investment firm to manage/join a fund, a tradable asset, like something posted on the bets sub, or hookers and blow.  \n\nHOLDing assets are stable but not liquid on their own.  A nice position of yourname/owned stable company shares (not broker owned shares), gold bars and land (ironically the \"gold\" standard of stable asset) hold value in, traditionally, the most stable way.  Gold bars are hard to steal, Berkshire and coca cola are likely not going anywhere, and land is unlikely to be swallowed up by the sea or become unhabitable.  But these are very hard to trade your hookers, blow, or cereal directly or quickly.  \n\nGROWTH INVESTMENT, like the spy index your talking in between, and the risk/opportunity cost you kind of wrapped that up nicely yourself.  You've got a good idea that it will increase, but it's not a guarantee.  \n\nYou have to manage your risks and divide your wealth amongst those risks.  \n\nIf banks and lenders like you (and your holding assets), you can get great liquidity loans base of your charm, last name, profession and number of gold bars you have. This gives you cash.  If you have enough growth investments generating enough liquidity to pay for your liquidity loans and other liquidity needs, you don't need to actually DO anything anymore really.  \n\nSo...  You want to hold as much wealth that is needed (by your determination) in HOLDing assets that will back enough sustainable liquidty to accomplish the things you want.  Like, retire, pay for your kids' school, generational wealth creation,  world domination - whatever it is that gets you out of bed in the morning. The end of the road is not index funds. \n\nUse cash to buy tradeable wall street bets options and generate profit for growth investments like spy indexes, and then use that profit to organize into holdings that belong to you, like 5 shares of Berkshire registered in your own name, gold bars, and larger and larger chucks of land in your favourite neighbourhood.  \n\nSo you can't get a line of credit with your index fund position (not one worth agreeing to anyways).  You can, however, get a line of credit based your 5 shares of Berkshire and 10,000 shares of coca cola, and probably with more favourable terms and control than what a broker will give you. \n\nThese are easier to acquire and more simple to own than gold bars, or land.  Until, at least, you have enough to trade for gold bars and land. \n\nIn sum.
