Almost every ETF I sell options on are liquid and rolling over in terms of dates/credit has been easy to date.\n\nBut one ETF is looking weird: AVUV. Maybe I shouldn't have sold CCs on this since it is not very liquid. I sold a 74 call for Sep 16 for a couple of thousand dollars for 14 contracts when it was like 69.  The price is now 72 and yet I'm facing a loss on my CC position of -2500 or so (Edit: not anymore, after midnight it is showing a profit of 5% or 100). Does this mean I sold it for too low a price or something happened between my sale and now that caused the cost of the call to rise up? (Sep 16 is my latest call btw, most of the others expire in the next few weeks, which I think makes more sense for a CC - it can't go up TOO high so I can repurchase.)\n\nUnlike my other ETFs, I'm finding it hard to roll it over a month later, there are just no dates available. The next available date is Dec 18  and  unless I go below 74 (ITM?)  I don't get a credit.  But I could raise the strike to like 85 for < $100 which seems like a good deal (and maybe my best option).

I am also sitting on a bunch of cash. Does it make sense to buy 1400 shares at 74  (or even now) just to hold it to cover this CC in case I get assigned? The risk is that the market tanks after my purchase but I was going to buy more AVUV, etc. anyway.\n\nI could also sell CSPs at 69 or some other price and collect more premium but that  creates another option to keep track of and I'm wondering if this is a good idea.

I wasn't sure if it was any different selling or buying a short.\n\nYou've just defined what a market order does. A market order means fill your order \"at any price\". Usually the worst price in the spread. If you are a buyer, you want to pay *less* than the ask, and if you are a seller you want to get *more* than the bid. That is the opposite of what a market order does, which is why our FAQ recommends against using market orders, ever.\n\nAnd that isn't even accounting for the disaster scenarios. Consider this scenario. Suppose you want to buy 1 call for $10.00. The order book for offers has 10 contracts on offer for $10.00 but right below that is a ridiculous offer for 1 contract at $420.69. You enter your market order to buy 1 call, figuring you will fill at $10, but before your order goes live on the exchange, a whale gets in front of you and buys up all 10 contracts at $10. Because you have a market order, which means fill at any price, you will get filled at $420.69, because that is the best offer at the time. Not what you wanted, right?\n\nAlways use limit orders, to buy or sell, open or close. If you want to fill fast, set your buy limit at the ask and your sell limit at the bid.

Nvidia, for example has been trying to negotiate with TSMC for a massive reduction in the upcoming production of GPU dies that they've already paid billions for (TSMC denied the request).

I'd even go further and say that the chip companies *can* keep up with both new and legacy chips *but* the former has simply become way more profitable for them.  It now costs companies more to expedite the product than the actual cost of the product itself (legacy chips).\n\nBefore, it was the auto manufacturers who had the upper hand in terms of who had priority based on shear volume and demand at the time (think 5-10 year cycles).  Now, chipmakers have such leverage with their newer stuff that they can afford to put traditional models on hold or moved to the back of the priority line.  With some graphics cards going for almost the same price of a car, it's pretty easy to see who gets priority.\n\nThis is partly why the cars can't come off the lot fast enough and why demand has soared for new and used vehicles.  Nothing really drastic has changed for even the highest-level sensors and ECU's in cars today (most changes have to do with software rather than hardware).  What's changed is the *amount* of chips that are now in cars (navigation, airbag controls, ECU's, cameras, and sensors are all decade-old tech).\n\nThey've actually gotten cheaper and OEM's are now scrambling to source chips for their vehicles while staying competitive among other manufacturers.  But now, since the OEM's have to go \"leaner\" (aka continue using older or cheaper chipsets) to keep costs down, it creates this loop where demand for cheaper chips increases but the supply on the chipmakers' side is intentionally funneled to keep their production output higher for more profitable chips.  This has created a mess for the auto suppliers as they now have to shop around the entire globe to source chips to continue building cars.\n\nRemember, there are hundreds of suppliers that are responsible for the building of one car.  Engine, windows, paneling, electrical, lighting, speakers, tires, rims, bolts, sensors, airbags, etc.  It seems that the electronics side is the one causing the back up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: The chipmakers are building what drives the biggest profits.

The best point you could make is that the largest shareholders of those public companies are biased and give them preferential treatment via generous evaluations when deciding how much to allocate etc. And then try and imagine how that would even work in practice given that these are major companies and their price is determined by a very large number of participants, across the planet.. through the stock market. \n\n\nFirst off everyone thinks the company they hold is worth more, or is potentially worth more than it is, or that it is at least a good place to store capital. Or they would sell it and buy something else. At the end of the day, the largest shareholders of these banks are funds like Blackrock and Vanguard etc. The banks compete with the other banks, and the funds try to get the best bang for their buck. They are not propping up each other's stock prices because they are buddies. They are more like enemies. The other banks helped short bear sterns to death when they sensed weakness in 2008. If a fund manager thought he would get a better return somewhere else, he would. That's how capital markets work in essence. You could argue the us government fucked that up in 2008, and you'd be right, but that isn't even your point. \n\n\nYour problem seems to be with the fact that growth stocks get beat up after any earnings, and banks don't, and that it isn't fair. Let me help you out. What you don't realize is, that in a raging bull market expectations of new growth companies are almost always overly optimistic. By a lot. \n\n\nSo when the earnings come in, and they 'beat' them, and they go down in price... it's rigged! Well, in reality, the price went down because those investors were not hoping for a minor beat, they wanted it smashed out of the park, and when that didn't happen, they go and look for another hitter somewhere else. Go look up what happened with shop or amd or tsla, amzn or fuck any of the famous growth stocks, over any period in history, as they were coming up, and when they had a KO earnings. The insanity afterwards. The insane runs that followed... Basically the markets since the fiscal/monetary bukkake (which isn't normal). That's the bet you didn't know you were in. That's what the investors risking money in growth wanted to see happen. If it's a bear market, it's the same concept but the assumption is you suck and I'm selling unless you perform a miracle. \n\n\n\nSo yeah, if I'm investing in joe flip flops nft burgers, unless the earnings beat drastically exceeded the expectations, I'm probably not too happy. That's a risky spot to park capital, I want high returns for that risk. Otherwise, I'd put it with fucking Goldman Sachs, which might make less money this year, but it's also a safe business. Banks were already stable well established businesses, before the government fucked everything up, and declared them too big to fail, so they are now even more appealing from a risk perspective. \n\n\n\nAnd that is why, in general, some companies, sometimes drop after an earnings beat, and why banks don't plummet to the ground when they miss. But to prove my first claim, that markets, are well, markets, go look up the charts of $CS or $DB right now or the American banks in 08/09 or 2020. Or *drumroll* Goldman Sachs ($GS)... Today. It's been massacred year to date lmao. It looks like a growth stock ffs. What was your theory again? Because based on that chart, even if you were right, it was irrelevant anyway. \n\n\n\nBanks can and will be sold off brutally if the investors no longer consider them a safe investment. If a bank were risky, I'd rather invest with that stupid nft burger guy because the returns could be far greater than a normal bank stock. If a bank is merely less profitable, it may be sold off as well, but not in a panic generally like with growth stocks. Banks get violently sold off when collapse/credit crisis fears get going. Usually anyways.\n\n\n\nIn this instance, the issue occurred because of the central bankers literally losing their fucking minds. Due to the covid lockdowns, and subsequent prolonged abuse of cocaine, mescaline, cialis, and monopoly, they came to sincerely believe they could mail free money to everyone, without it affecting the value of that money. Then they made the stock market double! For no good reason at all either.

These companies essentially kick started their respective fields and then found that edge that kept them blowing up. \n\nAmazon brought us the online super store, Apple brought the smart phone, Google exploded with the cloud and Android. Tesla with the luxury Electric Cars. So what field is next?\n\nIn my opinion the next thing that needs an industry leader is the space sector. Yes there's Space-X, but that's not publicly traded, so who will battle them? For satellites or Low Earth Orbit launches you have Rocket Lab, Virgin Orbit, and Astra Space. All 3 have contracts in place with various agencies, government and private. The 2 former have been in the $3.50-$4 range so there's the potential to buy a lot for a low price. Astra has been staying in the $1.25-$1.60 range but they come with more risk due to a few failures, including the loss of NASA satellites in their last launch. \n\nThis one isn't a very popular opinion here but if you believe that \"Space Tourism\" has any potential down the road then Virgin Galactic has been trending up. There is a lot of people that are very salty about this stock because they bought at or near the ATH of $55+. It closed today at $7.23 which is almost $3 lower than its IPO. Virgin Galactic hasn't flown since Branson went up, and they've had a lot of delays, but they have a new contract with Boeing, just signed a lease for their final assembly building, and are aiming for 400 flights per year by 2025 which will greatly reduce the cost making the it affordable for the \"average\" person. \n\nJust my 2 cents!", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Hey!

And as far as I can see there is no true pioneer here yet. \n\nPiece of advise though: Don't be fooled by the loss vs. gain when looking at these companies. I don't think a single one has turned a profit yet. Look for who has launch success, who has current and future contracts, and who is expanding.

In my opinion Crypto is far more volatile and risky than anything happening in space. \n\nSpace ventures are all fighting for a piece of the market.

They definitely have a good thing going but high-speed internet isn't new. There's a lot of current competitors, and as more companies continue to develop their rockets, it will only produce more competition in the satellite high speed internet. \n\nThe question is which one will it be? \n\nAnd just for the record, if Space-X or Starlink ever made a public offering can you imagine what it would open at? I doubt it would open anywhere near what would be considered a growth stock to be able to ride the wave up.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The global ISP market size is currently estimated at just over $1.1T, with growth forecasts of as low as 2.5% yearly, up to ridiculous numbers due to the IoT market exponentially increasing. Right now that doesn’t support anywhere close to a $1T valuation for Starlink, I agree. Musk has said they plan to take it public in 3-4 years, and the Starlink division of SpaceX has been given a current valuation ranging from $45-120B. In 3-4 years that valuation will likely be higher as they bring more satellites online and gain subscribers; maybe around $120-150B.  \n\nBut my original comment was looking 10-20 years out, when it’s likely the global ISP market will be worth closer to $10T. Even if Starlink only manages a 5% stake in the market in that time, that’s $500B a year. Easily justifies a 13 figure valuation. A 10x return in 10 years would be considered a growth stock. \n\nYour comment about high speed internet not being new seems fairly ill-informed of life outside developed cities. Even in the US there are large areas where high speed internet isn’t available. Almost 1/3 of the world isn’t connected to the internet. Make no mistake, global internet will be a game changer.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Forgive me, perhaps I didn't word it properly. \n\nWhen I said it is nothing new, I meant that this is already a well established sector with massive amounts of competition. There are currently 1,410 internet providers in the US alone. 90% of homes have speeds of 100mbps and 85% have 250mbps. \n\nYes, just over 1/3rd of the world has never had internet connection. A vast majority of those places are very poor. At a $600 start up cost and $120 a month I don't think those people will be chomping at the bit to sign up for Facebook and reddit lol. \n\nA lot of people will undoubtedly sign up for it in well populated areas because we're a society of materialistic douche bags that have to have the latest and greatest things. And hell if it has Musk attached to it then it must be the best thing in the world. It will also definitely have a market for researchers who are often out in remote areas. \n\nHowever my original argument was that were looking for the next Amazon. This market is already flooded with competition. The remote satellite internet market will also have competition. Starlink will most assuredly have competion in the sky's sooner or later. At even a 5% market share that doesn't necessarily push to be the next Amazon or Apple. Amazon has a 38% market share domestically and 9.2% globally. The iPhone alone has a 62% market share globally with the iPad leading at 31.5% globally.\n\nI can agree with your argument on it paying off to be a growth stock but at the price point it will most likely have at its IPO, I think it will be out of reach for the average person to truly make sense.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Most ISPs are country specific. I don’t think the US will be the primary market for Starlink after it reaches maturity. Also Starlink’s manufacturing costs will drop significantly at the scale of hundreds of millions of units. And the prices they charge in the US are not the prices they charge elsewhere. The sharing of knowledge and information to places that don’t currently have access to the internet will have a big impact. Work that can be done remotely will pay significantly less when companies can outsource to anywhere in the world. \n\nI appreciate your points, and I know what I’ve said is just my opinion. But the speculators are the ones that make money when a company becomes the next Amazon or Apple or Google. \n\nSorry, but it’s past 1AM where I am.
