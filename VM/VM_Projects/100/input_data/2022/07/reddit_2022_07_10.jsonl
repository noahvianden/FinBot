If we do have a recession then in my opinion Disney+ will keep pumping in funds. Current price of $95 and I see it going above $130 by end of December.

The economy will tank by the end of the year and people will flood back to their Netflix accounts. It provides the most content and best streaming technologies by truly having better streaming tech and paying for Internet backbone to ensure fast reliable access to data carriers. Being able to effectively compress and then decompress the data makes the end result so much better than other services. \n\nWhen things get bad in the economy, people stay home and watch TV. It’s just that real. They don’t go out to restaurants, they stop buying crap, they eat cheaper, and they stick with what they know. \n\nI think Netflix doubles in value over the next eighteen months. Sure there is battle for streaming dollars but when people are home with.nothing to do, Netflix provides the most content for the least overall cost for value. \n\nThe PE shows it’s a steal at current prices and if you bought and held the company five years ago it’s worth the same now as five years ago. All due to six bad months? It doesn’t add up. Sure people could move on from Netflix entirely but that’s a doubtful thing they will do. Netflix will come back full force with better more engaging shows because they have to. Is Squid Games 2 going to be on Hulu all the sudden? And there are literally hundreds of shows that are that good and addictive on the others. \n\nDisney seems like a good buy if we weren’t heading full force into a Great Depression of the 2020s. I mean their streaming is great and their PE is way off due to the pandemic making their parks/movies and other revenue streams suffer. If people don’t go to Disney parks, it may be a long game play. \n\nMy real knowledge is in technology equities. I would avoid most of them like the plague right now. Look at the real value of companies like Tesla. They’re overpriced. And now that people are getting other choices of EVs, they’re going with traditional car manufacturers that can actually build cars. Tesla has promised the moon to people with their autonomous driving features and Cybertruck. They’re late to ship or don’t ship at all on most features. To me Tesla would have been best bought by Apple for the battery technology and manufacturing capabilities when Tesla market cap was around $65B. Now it’s insanely overpriced. \n\nApple has been using their sticky products for years to get people to buy into its ecosystem. But the greed of Tim Cook and their failures to innovate anything truly new class defining, will ensure their long-run game plan doesn’t pan out. As governments around the world slam the door on their monopolistic attitudes, AAPL will not rise in value for a long time. My expectation would be until they hire back key tech talent that bring user experience back into the mix. Tim Cook only worries about the stock price so his $100m in annual vesting free stock is his. He is doing nothing for the company in terms of creating real value. The software with great sticky features is great but the company needs to spend a year or two and just fix all the bugs. It’s truly in bad shape. The hardware is top-notch but they went backwards in technology to provide people what they wanted in inferior ports. So people didn’t need dongles when they didn’t need them to begin with they just needed the right cable. A lot of misunderstanding. In the West, people use iMessages but in the rest of the world it’s WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, and worse because those companies are truly tracking the users every move. But Apple doesn’t take advantage of explaining to users in the rest of the world what iMessages can do. So that’s to say Apple Marketing sucks!\n\nThere’s a greedy CEO who cannot deliver new technologies as he doesn’t understand technology. There’s a drain of company resources on things that don’t matter and too much stock is being given to Tim Cook and the other executives annually. It’s truly a place where only the top executives take all the money out of the place by exchanging long-term valuation of the company for short-term gains. \n\nI love Apple products and Steve Jobs was a visionary. Tim Cook got rid of the visionary that was left after Steve passed away. Scott Forstall was the one who was supposed to take over once he realized and learned the role of CEO. Cool fired him because he was a threat to Cook. He was Steve’s chosen long-term successor to Steve after a few years of Tim Cook teaching Forstall the ropes of CEO. With that loss, I believe Apple’s talent level has continually dropped. Former employees want to go work for companies doing more for those other than just the top 20 executives. \n\nNvidia seems like a good buy to me. I think Nvidia is missing out on its real value. It sells these products too cheaply and we know this as people buy them and sell them on secondary markets for triple or more the cost. Nvidia needs a CEO who understands the value of the technology they’re creating. If they can do that, they will be a winner and anyone who owns them will be too. \n\nAMD is a real force and a good solid buy. They’re really challenging on all fronts of technology. They can create literally all the components needed for most tech products. I would like to see them make a push into new sectors and put all their technologies together to create class defining products. They can beat Intel and maybe even Nvidia if they just capitalize on their technologies. Long-term buy for sure. \n\nThe big problem in the whole market right now is what actually works when the economy fails or what will lose the least amount of money for investors. We have to look at gold as a backbone for the dollar. Beyond that, it’s going to be medical services, food source providers, energy providers, health insurance, and I think military contractors. The whole world is sending resources to Ukraine. This will lead to a resurgence of NATO and real 2% required GDP spending by all NATO nations on military technologies and infrastructure. \n\nThose are my thoughts on definitely what will not work and some that should work well. \n\nCheers", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tesla", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Love how this gets downvoted while the spergs here still tell themselves that GME is a good investment lol.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla is still a lighting rod for hate which helps further my belief my money is in good shape there", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Sqqq", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "AMZN at pre-pandemic levels which is insane.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Disney is on its way out.. too SJW.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "PLTR", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "☝️💪", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Palantir.

In 11 days it was up 47%, and it closed last Friday at $14.86, up about 80% since I posted here 46 days before.

All other stocks are either overvalued or risky bets in a frothy market since I started posted about LKNCY on Reddit Feb. 2021 (heck I created the Reddit account because I wanted to share my research with fellow shareholders).\n\nAnd I was right. All high fliers in this market fell this year - wiping out all the gains since I posted on Reddit - including all the tech leaders. LKNCY was up 56% YTD and more since Feb. 2021.

There are few things in trading more painful than thinking you have made a great buy of a great stock, just to watch it plunge even further.\r  \nWhen trying to catch a falling knife, be prepared to be wrong.

They either can't afford the payment and stop, or stop making it out of spite. \n\nI was a credit analyst for a manufacturers finance company (I underwrote car loans). One of most common reasons for default was LTV. We were incredibly cautious about how much LTV we would extend based on credit score and history. Biggest cause of LTV default was when people went to trade the car in, found out they were extremely upside down. They decided to take the trade out of the deal, buy the new car (if they qualified without the trade), and then let the old car get repo'ed. That way they have the new car before the repo shows on their credit history. Even people with good credit make emotional decisions (feeling prior dealer screwed them so they are justified in letting it default, etc...). In the moment they don't realize they are hurting themselves more than the bank. If that new car happens to get totaled (it happens, I've had dealers tell me the stories trying to get me to approve a new loan) and they have to go buy another car not many lenders are going to touch them.

{"title": "$VERU can make you very rich DD/YOLO inside", "selftext": " \n\nWhat's up idiots, strap in for my degenerate biotech ride.\n\nVeru  is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel medicines  for COVID-19 and other viral and ARDS-related diseases and for the  management of breast and prostate cancers. The main short term play here  is their drug sabizabulin. Originally developed for the treatment of  cancer, Veru found that because of the drugs' anti-viral and  anti-inflammatory properties it could also be used as an advanced ARDS  treatment for COVID-19. As of Friday, July 9th the market cap of Veru  was 1.06B and an EPS of -0.18.\n\n**---------------------------------------------------------**\n\n**Degenerate Diligence Below**\n\n>\" [Sabizabulin](https://verupharma.com/pipeline/sabizabulin-for-covid-19/)  is an orally bioavailable bis-indole that binds to the “colchicine  binding site” of alpha and beta-tubulin and inhibits tubulin  polymerization at low nanomolar concentrations. Sabizabulin disrupts the  microtubules, the central mechanism that contributes to both their  antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. Drugs like sabizabulin that  target microtubules have broad antiviral activity by disrupting the  intracellular transport of viruses such as SARS CoV-2, along  microtubules. Microtubule trafficking is critical for viruses to cause  infection. Furthermore, microtubule depolymerization agents that target  alpha and beta-tubulin subunits of microtubules also have strong  anti-inflammatory effects including the potential to treat the cytokine  release syndrome (cytokine storm) induced by the SARS-CoV-2 viral  infection that seems to be associated with high COVID-19 mortality  rates. Sabizabulin provides a two-pronged approach to the treatment of   COVID-19 viral infection and the debilitating and sometimes lethal  respiratory effects of the virus. First, as an antiviral, it would have  direct effects on S protein-microtubule trafficking with the potential  to reduce the production of infectious virions, particularly affecting  viral replication and assembly and virus particle egress. Secondly, as  an anti-inflammatory agent, it may reduce virally induced severe  inflammation in the respiratory system and reduce the incidence of  cytokine storm and septic shock.  \nIn   April 2022, we reported positive Phase 3 clinical study results where   Sabizabulin treatment demonstrated a 55.2% relative reduction of  mortality in hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients (≥ WHO   4-supplemental oxygen) at high risk for ARDS and death. We conducted a   double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 COVID-19 clinical  trial was conducted in approximately 210 hospitalized COVID-19 patients  with moderate to severe COVID (≥ WHO 4-supplemental oxygen) at high risk  for ARDS and death. The primary endpoint was the proportion of deaths  by Day 60. Based on a planned interim analysis of the first 150 patients  randomized, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee unanimously  halted the study for overwhelming efficacy and safety. Treatment with  sabizabulin 9mg once daily, an oral, first-in-class, new chemical   entity, cytoskeleton disruptor that has dual anti-inflammatory and  antiviral properties, resulted in a clinically meaningful and  statistically significant 55.2% relative reduction in deaths. After a   pre-EUA meeting with FDA, the Company submitted a request for FDA   emergency use authorization on June 7, 2022. FDA granted Fast Track  designation to the Company’s COVID-19 program in January 2022.  \nIn  February 2021, we reported positive Phase 2 clinical study results   where sabizabulin treatment demonstrated a significant relative   reduction of mortality in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe   COVID-19 symptoms who were at high risk for developing ARDS.\"\n\nTo put it simply, Sabizabulin can save your grandma and grandpa's lives if they develop ARDS.\n\nEarlier this week, [the (now) peer-reviewed study](https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDoa2200145)  was posted in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine's  \"Evidence,\" where no major issues were found. The peer-review  process  went so far as to say, \"\\[The\\] data demonstrate\\[s\\] that sabizabulin  treatment significantly reduced  mortality with an acceptable  side-effect and safety profile in hospitalized patients with moderate to  severe Covid-19 at high risk for  ARDS.\"\n\nFDA fast-track designation limits the time for a EUA decision to 60 days, making August 5th the last business day for the FDA to announce their decision.\n\nThe  current analog to Veru's treatment is Molnupiravir and Pfizer's  Paxlovid. The main difference between the three is that Paxlovid and  Molnupiravir are similar to Tamiflu in that they are preventative  therapeutics (despite obnoxious [side effects](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/13-things-to-know-paxlovid-covid-19))  rather than the life-saving, side-effect-free drug Veru is offering.  The United States Government first gave Pfizer a $5.3 billion contract  for the first 10 million courses of Paxlovid. The contract alone is  already 5X the current market cap of Veru.\n\nAccording to their most recent [investor presentation](https://verupharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Veru-Jefferies-Presentation-June-2022.pdf)  on June 8th, Veru is predicting a manufacturing capability to treat  \\~55,000 patients in July, \\~100,000 in August, and then upwards of  \\~250,000 patients from September going forward.\n\nAssuming  a treatment price of $3500/patient, this would place Veru's revenues at  upwards of $875 million per month, or $10.5 billion per year. At a  conservative P/E the market cap of Veru would likely reach upwards of  10-15 billion. Earlier this week [Jefferies raised their price target](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/news/basicNewsStory.jhtml?symbols=VERU&storyid=202207071341BENZINGAFULLNGTH27991012&provider=BENZINGA&product=FULLNGTH&sb=1)  to $55, with an upside of $98 upon EUA approval. H.C. Wainwright notes  that \"no current FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 therapeutics in the  hospital setting can achieve over 50% relative reduction in  deaths. Hence, sabizabulin can potentially become the new standard of  care for hospitalized moderate-severe COVID-19 patients if its EUA   application is granted.\"\n\nLeast importantly, [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/veru)  currently shows Veru's short interest is 41.43% of the float and a  62.73% OEX short volume ratio. This is unsurprising due to the high rate  of failure for biotech approvals.\n\nTo  wrap things up, my opinion is that Veru's Sabizabulin will likely be  granted EUA within the next two weeks. An important thing to keep in  mind is the toxicology report and treatment profile of Sabizabulin. The  treatment profile for previous studies for breast and prostate cancers  was that patients were given upwards of 63mg/dose of Sabizabulin for  upwards of **two years DAILY**  and no negative side effects were found. In contrast, the treatment  profile for Covid was a standard 9mg/dose per patient, per day under  treatment. Obviously, no side effects were found at the lower dosage.\n\n**Recent Short Reports**\n\nThe recent [short report](https://twitter.com/CulperResearch/status/1545407496449392641?cxt=HHwWgoC8scP7sfIqAAAA),  written by Culper research is pure FUD, a true case of  short-and-distort. Culper argues that the placebo group was sicker than  the non-placebo group. Basically, the report's key point is that the  placebo group had an unusually high mortality rate compared to other  COVID therapeutic studies, along with the fact that there was a patient  in the placebo group that had 42% oxygen saturation at the time of  admittance and thus throws off standard deviation in the study. These  claims, while true, do not hold any substantiative value. All you need  to know is that the **mean value** oxygen levels of both placebo and non-placebo treatment groups were 91.9% and 92.7% respectively. **This means that the Culper short report is misleading. Both treatment groups were equally sick.**\n\nThis DD is merely my opinion and should not be taken as investment advice.\n\n**Positions**\n\nMy  current position is 275 call options spread over various strikes  between $20-35 expiring anywhere from July 15-August 19 totaling over  $13,375.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/awa8b2yxtra91.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf6c47864eb6e4ccb0ef706a16cfb2bfe9789287", "id": "vvvp3e", "created_utc": 1657472089.0, "score": 229, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 459, "comments": [{"body": "Great DD, just wanted to add a couple things:\n\n1.

Even if you take the most pointed criticism from the Culper short report as true, that 7 of patients in the placebo group had very low O2 and were going to die (Culper itself admits this is conjecture assuming a normal distribution), you can remove those 7 patients from the pool and sabizabulin would have still resulted in a 29% relative reduction in mortality rate.

I would like but you all know about that.  It makes sense.\n\n\" These financial transactions are misunderstood, both here and on the message boards. I will attempt to provide clarity.  \nSince he is a director and therefore insider , there is a limited time window in which he can seek stock. This was done in that window, when all information was made public in the company filings and on the conference call. His holdings are unchanged, he exercised options to buy at prices between $1 & $3 / share and sold exactly the same number of shares. When options that are exercised in the money, taxable income is generated on the difference between the exercise price and the market price at the time of exercise. This the option exercise generated very roughly $1.8 MM of taxable income this year, and this is taxed at REGULAR. INCOME TAX RATES, NOT CAP GAINS RATE. His tax basis for the stock becomes the price when he exercised the options. Assuming he is not extremely wealthy, he needed to raise enough cash to pay to exercise the options, pay taxes this year on the implied income from that exercise , and then also the cap gains tax on the stock he sold, which also had to incur a very sizable gain. Plus any state taxes besides the federal taxes. So my guess is that the net effect is that he now owns the same amount of stock but with a much higher basis in the new lot, and that much more than half the money raised from the stock sale was used for financing it and paying the taxes. This is a very common practice when options way I the money are exercise, and if I were his financial advisor it is exactly how I would have advised him to proceed. And now he has positioned himself so that the stock that he just purchased will not go long term for 12 months +1 day, by which time if the EUA is granted the results of the commercialization should be known.  \nIn the interests of full disclosure - I and my family members have been VERU shareholders continuously since April , 2016 when DR Steiner merged his private company into THE FEMALE HEALTH COMPANY and it was renamed VERU.

Dips happen when the supply/demand curve changes drastically in a short amount of time, due to economic uncertainty that affects more than just housing prices (usually).

This is why it's not advisable to try and time the market if our outlook is long enough and your portfolio is diversified. \n\nYes, you can buy an investment at the peak and figure out you can't support the rising rates and owning it... but that's an investment... all investment involves risk.
