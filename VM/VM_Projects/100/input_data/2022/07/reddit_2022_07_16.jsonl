Mortgages were being given to everyone who requested them no matter what their financial situation was. They were conned into balloon Mortgages and when they could no longer pay their homes were repossessed by the banks. But, the Banks had already bundled those Mortgages into investments called Derivitives and paid people to guarantee that those mortgages were all AAA rated when the fact was that some of them were only B or BB rated. Then the defaults started coming and Bear Sterns and others went bankrupt. Then came Government bailouts. \n\nThat brings us to now 2022. All through the pandemic the Government threw money at Wallstreet. They used that money to make very high risk investments called Short Selling. The Money has now dried up and these Financial Institutions and Banks must buy back those short shares but they don't have any more free money. So they are selling off their prime long stocks to raise cash to be able to continue to pay their premiums on loans and the interest on their borrowed shares that they must buy back. Their backs are against the wall. This will be the trigger for the next recession. It is all about Wallstreet Greed again.\n\nEdit: This is also the reason that the Crypto market is crashing. The Hedge Funds and Banks have been cashing out their Crypto money for cash and numerous Crypto Hedge Funds have gone bankrupt in recent weeks. Unfortunately crypto investors have lost their life savings. Luna Terra in S. Korea is the most notable and the S. Korean Government is investigating the CEO of that company and won't allow him to leave the country. Also numerous other Crypto Hedge funds are facing bankruptcy right now as well.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "A small comment on the crypto part of your post. \n\nYou are likely correct about large funds withdrawing money from risky crypto assets to cover their asses in traditional market. Also the bankruptcy of large crypto funds due to their reckless risk management (they were borrowing like mad and putting the borrowed money in super risky yield contracts).\n\nThe interesting thing to point here is that Luna Terra was taken down through a combination of bad management and an organized attack. Which lead to a domino effect busting other reckless crypto projects. For people who are not following crypto in detail this could be of interest:\n- there was an algorithmic stablecoin called UST. Stablecoin is a token pegged to the value of the dollar for use in the crypto sphere. Algorithmic means balancing its value to be the same as the dollar was done automatically by a piece of code.\n- the parent organization that developed and offered UST was buying crazy amounts of BTC with a lot of publicity. The concept was that the purchased BTC will act as a collateral. If something happens and the price of UST starts to depeg from the price of USD the Terra foundation(or was it Luna foundation… that always made my hear hurt) could sell BTC and keep UST pegged\n- here’s the place to point that the founder of Terra Luna - Do Kwon was a ridiculous asshole who made fun of people on Internet on the basis he was richer. The whole UST thing was obviously super risky as they literally offered a 20% yearly interest on a token pegged to the dollar. I am not sure who in their right mind would believe that’s sustainable but crypto is the wild west. Back to main topic - Do Kwon had publicly stated they’re trying to buy so much Bitcoin that they become too big to fail, in the sense that if Terra Luna collapses it would take the whole market with it because if their ridiculously large Bitcoin holdings \n- And here’s the interesting part - some big boy saw an opportunity here. An attack was orchestrated where large amounts of UST was dumped on the market, taking its value down. In order to keep the peg, the Terra Luna Foundation started selling BTC (I’m not 100% sure how it works here - what was the exact mechanism that selling BTC allowed them to stabilize the UST price but that’s how it worked). \n- so UST is being dumped by malicious (clever)  actor \n- Terra Luna starts dumping BTC\n- this put’s pressure on the market and BTC itself starts dropping \n- the malicious actor starts dumping BTC as well\n- this large double BTC dump leads to a general market crash, which in term makes Luna’s BTC worth less so they dump more\n- at some point the malicious actor starts buying \n- result is UST goes bust and lots of stupid money is now gone. Poof. Billions.\n- the Terra Luna foundation has gone bust. No more BTC in their coffins\n- the malicious actor dumped BTC at something like 26k and rebought at around 20k making a very good buck\n- in the following weeks / months there’s a domino effect of crypto funds and CeFi lenders that belly up because they were stupid enough to put their money in Luna or UST.\n\nThe moral of the story - dunno, it was a crazy thing. I have friends who lost big amounts of their savings.\n\nCeFi proved to be nothing but Wallstreet shit.\n\nDeFi proved to be a lot more resilient in times of crashes.\n\nWho fucked Terra Luna - I don’t know. But there’s been a number of theories. Putting a few here just for entertainment:\n1. The US government because the UST stablecoin was a Korean project. So it was a slap on the hand for people from outside of the US trying to play dollar makers.\n2. Citadel - because they can and it was a god money opportunity. The algorithmic part of the UST was what made it predictable. So the attack could have been tested and analyzed before hand.\n3. The old big BTC holders who care about BTC long term. The fact Do Kwon was a ridiculous ass and ge publicly wanted to make his company literally embedded to Bitcoin introduced a risk for the long term future. So some people believe he was fucked while it was still cheaper and with less damage to the whole crypto world.\n\nMy personal experience with all of this - I managed to dodge a couple of bullets. I was initially very skeptical towards UST because of the large interest. But it kept surviving and growing. At some point I started questioning my view. Then it ded. Phew.\n\nThis was a goos sign to withdraw funds from CeFi’s like Celsius. If UST can die in a day, what’s stopping the likes of BlockFi and Celsius from doing the same? It turned out nothing. A month later Celsius stopped any withdrawals and is now filing for bankruptcy.\n\nThere’s a reason why people in crypto say “not your keys not your money”.

I've only ever been willing to put meaningful money in Cardano. Theirs is the only project that is working heavily against the grain of \"move fast and break things\". Their research-first approach is extremely slow (which most people hate) and careful, because they understand that they need to lay the ground work for handling people's dIDs, money, and privacy and that's just not something you do haphazardly. Charles Hoskinson is also insanely smart and very Elon-esque in the sense that he works out of passion and could have retired in his 20s. I also very much respect their approach of working directly with \"3rd world\" governments who have so many unbanked citizens. Banking the unbanked is the largest area of meaningful near term growth in the crypto space IMO.\n\nAnyway, I've been in Cardano since $0.02 and I didn't sell at $3.10 and don't plan to ever sell. I WILL spend some at some point. I might go spend some in Japan next time I'm there since it's prolific there.\n\nBut yeah TLDR: I don't trust any defi projects enough just yet.
