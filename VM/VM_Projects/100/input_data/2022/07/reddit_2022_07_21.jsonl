It‚Äôs the furthest away from opinions and ideologies you can get.\n\nBanks put out some good data. \n\nFRED is a great source for all sorts of data.\n\nTreasury.gov\n\nDailyFx.com\n\nBLS\n\nRealtor.com\n\ncmegroup.com\n\nYahoo Finance\n\nValueLine and Morningstar for security- level analysis \n\nAll good sources \n\nI‚Äôm going through the CFA exams now and have enjoyed Mark Meldrum (a CFA curriculum educator)‚Äôs YouTube videos for a good video summary of weekly economic and financial data.\n\nBeyond that, podcasts have been an excellent source to hear the thoughts of investors. I‚Äôve come across recent discussions with guys like Howard Marks, Peter Lynch, Ray Dalio, Bill Ackman, Carl Ichan, Jim Simons, and all sorts of top tier investors. Bloomberg has one I like, but there are plenty of smaller ones from asset managers and retail traders, alike.\n\n(Also, to the point of opinion pieces, hearing them thoughts of great investors is very worthwhile, but I tend to find that political and ideological thinking cloud the need to make cold, emotionless, rational decisions in investing. Politics and sociology can be very interesting on their own, but feelings and attachments don‚Äôt blend well with the sort of detachment that serves investors well, so, in financial news they seem counterproductive.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hahhahahanajahanna welcome to the real world!

Tesla Inc. suppliers now have a dedicated lane at the Colombia Solidarity checkpoint to quicken the crossing, said Ivan Rivas, the economy minister of Nuevo Leon.  \n>  \n>‚ÄúIt was a simple incentive,‚Äù Rivas said in an interview. ‚ÄúWhat we want is a crossing that‚Äôs much more expedited and efficient. And maybe there will be a lane for other companies in the future like there is for Tesla.‚Äù  \n>  \n>Tesla didn‚Äôt respond to an emailed request for comment, and Rivas, who didn‚Äôt negotiate the deal, was unable to provide further information. Other state officials didn‚Äôt return calls seeking comment, so it‚Äôs difficult to know what Tesla gave, if anything, for its express lane. The exact rules for usage and who administers any paperwork or passes needed to drive back and forth were also unclear.  \n>  \n>Nuevo Leon borders the US for about 10 miles, and the Colombia Solidarity site is among the less popular crossings. At its busiest point, average wait time for commercial trucks is about 20 minutes. The state‚Äôs border authority is expanding the Colombia crossing to eight lanes from six.  \n>  \n>The state is home to at least six suppliers for Tesla, up from zero companies tied to the electric-vehicle sector before 2021, Rivas said. He expects between 5% and 7% of the investment in the state this year to come from the EV industry.  \n>  \n>The Tesla suppliers include Taiwanese companies EnFlex Corp. and Quanta Computer, French firm Faurecia SE, Germany‚Äôs ZF Friedrichshafen AG and APG Mexico, Rivas said.‚ÄúNuevo Leon is turning into an electro-mobility hub,‚Äù Rivas said.  \n>  \n>As for Musk, he proudly talks up his company‚Äôs factory presence north of the border, tweeting this week that ‚ÄúTeslas are the most made-in-USA vehicles.‚Äù", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "üê¶ earnings tomorrow AM\n\ng'luck\n\n![gif](giphy|KmrpxSVxTB9Ty|downsized)", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|3ov9jN90m9oQmfyGxW|downsized)", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "They'll be like ok elon how about 35b, ok how about 24b, ok how about 10b???ü•πü•πü•π", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "ok we'll pay you, how much you want", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Starts out praising Tesla, then they read the cue cards the building owners told them to read‚Ä¶ üòÇ Skip to 2:18 if you would like to laugh out loud and throw up in your mouth at the same time‚Ä¶  \n\n[LMFAO](https://youtu.be/pYzarIOK5g0)", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "ü§¢\n\niPhone -- boom, I eviscerated his argument with one word", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Not sure if you watched the whole thing‚Ä¶ but they literally said if (Tesla) ‚Äúwants to be the next GM or Ford‚Äù‚Ä¶  \n\nüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ\n\nI think they don‚Äôt understand what is happening hahaha", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "It's beyond parody levels bad", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I know for sure some of the media/news people out there know they're stupid.

Bears (The Kevins) will say, without this, cash flow this Q would have been negative $89M! True. But wait, if we're being fair, when BTC was bought in 1Q21, it reduced cash flow because cash was reduced and reclassed to digital asset.

The TSLAQ conspiracy theorist have to come up with something, and the bitcoin sale is the only thing they can find to spin.\n\n> if we're being fair, when BTC was bought in 1Q21, it reduced cash flow because cash was reduced and reclassed to digital asset\n\nRight, if we want to look at the amount of cash Tesla has on hand, then the purchase and sale of this BTC had a pretty minimal impact. And their total cash reserve is extremely healthy, especially given their low debt remaining.\n\nAnd if we want to go beyond FCF and look at other levels/trends in cash flows, then they really spelled it all out in the update:\n\n> Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities increased sequentially by $902M to $18.9B in Q2, driven mainly by free cash flow of $621M, partially offset by debt repayments of $402M. As of the end of Q2, we have converted approximately 75% of our Bitcoin purchases into fiat currency. Conversions in Q2 added $936M of cash to our balance sheet.\n\nThe major items that effect total cash balance were:\n\n* FCF\n* BTC sale\n* Paying off debt\n\nAnd then there were some other little items that made up the rest of the change on net. If we're going to look at the total change in cash, and not just FCF, then we should include both investing and financing activities. Or to put it another way, they sold some BTC and paid off some debt with $400m of it (and also some marketable securities). \n\nThere's a reason why analysts look at FCF because it tells you about how the business is generating and using cash. Total cashflow isn't as important if the business is just moving cash around in to different kinds of securities/investments/etc. Tesla is generating enough cash to pay all their expenses and have extra left over.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Free the boob.s\n\nhttps://ibb.co/F45Wr3S", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "‚ù§Ô∏è", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Does the lounge deserve the original photo?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "sure,  you have it.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "When asking my gf if she would do a 800.85 pic, she replied \"we'll discuss this when I get home\"\n\nNot sure if boobs or no boobs...\n\n![gif](giphy|zYEg3iFhP7Ily)", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|bEVKYB487Lqxy)", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "lol üé≤üé≤üé≤", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Great way to find out the level of kink in the gf if not already known.\n\nIf already known one would no ask, it's a do or do not scenario.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "And is she home yet?", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "ehehehehe", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|joGUuMFGRwxd6)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "An octane render of a glowing futuristic Tesla factory surrounded by cables, but in ancient Egypt https://i.imgur.com/KpMbL1c.jpg", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "amazing", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "$TSLQ ticker should have been $PEDO instead", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "nah, I want more people buying it.

Don't expect that to last. It won't. As JPOW continues to hike up interest rates, the death spiral will start. More and more companies will have mass layoffs. Unemployment rate will go up higher than most people will expect. People who can't even imagine losing their jobs will lose their jobs. Just like these 8000 salaried Ford employees didn't expect to lose their jobs but they did anyway.\n\nWhat does this mean for regular everyday Americans. Well, apart from the fact that finding a job will become harder than it is now, the housing market may collapse as well. If millions of Americans are laid off, then you can't expect them to continue making their monthly mortgage payments. Foreclosures will rise sharply.\n\n Citi Bank economists have issued a warning that a global recession is a clear & present danger:\n\n[https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/global-recession-clear-present-danger-citi-economists-warn](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/global-recession-clear-present-danger-citi-economists-warn)\n\nThe chances of a recession are now more and more likely.\n\nWhy am I making this post? I'm making it to warn you and to give you a heads up. Don't become complacent because others have reassured you that a recession won't happen or it will be a mild recession. Don't become complacent because of the amazing tight job market. Save your money for a rainy day. Increase your emergency fund. Cut down on your expenses. Pay off your high interest credit card debt.
