{"title": "Pelosi's husband buying over $1 million of computer chip stock ahead of vote", "selftext": "[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/cnn-msnbc-abc-cbs-nbc-ignore-pelosis-husband-buying-over-dollar1-million-of-computer-chip-stock-ahead-of-vote/ar-AAZKFKr?li=BBnb7Kz)\n\nPaul Pelosi, House Speaker¬†Nancy Pelosi's husband, made a stock purchase of over $1 million in a computer chip company just weeks before a potential vote in Congress which would give a massive subsidy to the industry. \n\n Mr. Pelosi made a purchase of between $1 million and $5 million¬†[shares of Nvidia](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/stocks), a semiconductor company, according to a disclosure filing made by Speaker Pelosi's office. He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday.¬†\n\nCurtis Houck, managing editor of right-leaning media watchdog NewsBusters, said it was \"no accident that the liberal media have made the decision to ignore\" the story that could damage Pelosi.¬†\n\n\"For those that are aware of it, they have zero comprehension and/or shame to realize how it's a quintessential story of how the¬†elites work for their own financial benefit, not that of the American people,\" Houck told Fox News Digital.¬†\n\nMeanwhile, Nancy Pelosi's office¬†has attempted to distance the House Speaker from her husband‚Äôs recent stock trades.¬†\n\n\"The Speaker does not own any stocks.¬†As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the Speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked ‚ÄòSP‚Äô for Spouse.¬†The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,\" spokesman Drew Hammill told FOX Business.¬†\n\nIn 2020, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, N.C., and other high-profile lawmakers came under fire for stock sales in the run-up to the COVID-19 pandemic that were suspected to have been made based on confidential information about the pending outbreak. CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC all covered the story. \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" even featured a lengthy commentary about it.¬†\n\n Charlie Gasparino appeared on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on Monday to discuss whether the move could be insider trading.¬†\n\n\"This dude is a rising star on Wall Street,\" Gasparino joked before taking a serious tone.¬†\n\n\"Obviously this brings up the notion, is this insider trading? Is she giving him some tips? We should point out that the SEC and the DOJ have brought cases on insider tips via pillow talk. Trust me on this. It‚Äôs happened,\" he said. \"I don‚Äôt believe this hits the insider trading bar‚Ä¶ a lot of information about this legislation was bouncing around, it has to be material, non-public, stolen, misappropriated. It kind of doesn‚Äôt hit those barriers. But what this does hit is limousine liberalism, arrogance on steroids.\"¬†", "id": "w2x1ts", "created_utc": 1658248545.0, "score": 5795, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 456, "comments": [{"body": "Nothings stopping you from dumping your life savings into nvidia right now", "score": 1583, "replies": [{"body": "$167 all in here we go!", "score": 659, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 220, "replies": [{"body": "So he bought it back in 2020?", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "2021 from what I remember", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "It was never $100/share in 2021", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "He had call options.

Reported Loss of 970,000 versus loss of 2 million users expected", "selftext": "Netflix (NFLX) reported its fiscal second quarter earnings on Tuesday after market close as the company battles ongoing inflationary pressures, increased competition, and an uptick in subscriber churn.\n\nThe streaming giant's Q2 subscriber numbers showed a narrower loss than expected, causing shares to surge more than 8% in after-hours trading. Revenue and adjusted earnings per share were mixed amid the broader subscriber slowdown, in addition to increased pressures from foreign exchange with the dollar holding strong relative to other currencies.\n\nHere are Netflix's second quarter results compared to Wall Street's consensus estimates, as compiled by Bloomberg:\n\n**Revenue: $7.97 billion versus $8.05 billion expected**\n\n**Adj. earnings per share (EPS): $3.20 versus $2.98 expected**\n\n**Subscribers: Loss of 970,000 versus loss of 2 million users expected**\n\nThe streaming giant's anticipated loss of 2 million paying users for the second quarter would have been the worst quarterly decline in the company's history after the streamer lost 200,000 users in April.\n\nNetflix's Q3 subscriber guidance of 1 million came in below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 1.9 million, although analysts have admitted that the second half of the year could see potential downside risks amid macroeconomic concerns.\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-q-2-earnings-170448268.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-q-2-earnings-170448268.html)\n\nNetflix (NFLX) is currently up 8% after market close.
