Delaware courts said “no MAE, you’re honoring the deal.” In fact, I can only find two very egregious instances in which citing an MAE allowed a buyer to back out of a deal and one of those involved the buyer not being able to see a classified process in clean-rooms until a deal was struck and upon entering the clean-rooms after the deal was struck they found cockroaches and other contaminates and were required to report the seller and the factory was shut down...

No way.\n\nFirstly, Musk complained publicly about the bots before purchasing, going as far to say that he was going to get rid of them once he bought Twitter, implying he knew well about the bot issue.\n\nSecondly, in order to win an MAE case, you have to  hit several criteria, including proving the seller lied, and the seller never lied.

For most people working at Amazon, the turn and burn thing doesn't mean the next day you get shitcanned, you can head over to MS or Google and land a job there, because they are, by and large, different skillsets.\n\nAmazon, first and foremost, isn't a tech company. I mean, AWS is small in absolute size (even if their revenue is an outsized portion), but Amazon is a logistics and retail company first. Without it, they can't plow money back into AWS to keep that operation alive. The labor pool that logistics companies draw from are -- and this is my commie jargon coming up -- the reserve army of labor. It's the part of the working class that is used to threaten and discipline the rest of the working class, so there's a functional reason they keep doing hiring drives, even if they're slowing down. They draw people in because it's a paycheck, but if you don't fall exactly in line, you lose your livelihood and it shows other workers to not do that.\n\nBut that's what it comes down to: for manual labor, there's a dearth of quality jobs. Amazon is kinda the last stop in a country that's been deindustrialized. In the absence of any major education push or training program, it's what people have until they're chewed up and spit out on the other side.\n\nYou are correct, though: this will hurt Amazon's ability to keep quality people because they keep firing them and locking them out of future opportunities across all amazon-owned brands. But their culture is very much one of present business and not too much forward thinking. That's why they have a chaotic internal culture, and it's definitely not the best of the best getting moved up.\n\nIt's a side effect of growth at all costs.

We are young(er) and have been talking about how to grow wealth for retirement and for our future selfs. The market seemed to be the best way if we had the disposable income. Biggest goal is to compound our savings with growth over time.

Any term, metric, evaluation, etc, I can search there and they have a really good break down on most of them. I have found some to be lacking but I use google to balance out my understanding of those.\n\nCurrently my biggest problem is evaluating companies who’s statements are up and down and not constant growth. I also don’t quite understand the bigger picture of things, like leverage ratios. I know what is considered good for most but comparing all those to past statements and it’s like my brain blows a fuse. Probably over studied and just need to let all the info sit and set in place.

{"title": "It's Bear Season", "selftext": " \n\nIntroduction:\n\nHello fellow degenerates, I am back after a brief hiatus. I got way too caught up in work, holiday shenanigans, and lots of other BS. However, I am finally back on my horse and I am ready to bring some more smooth-brained DD to you all. I have been on a bit of a cold streak lately with my positions but I’ve got a feeling this is the Aaron Judge 450 foot homer I have been seeking. What I will be doing with this post is simply a general DD on the current state of the market. I am going to present topics and attempt to give as objective a take as one man can. Full disclosure however in that before even diving into any research, I myself am very bearish on the markets in the short term. What I will be taking a position in come market open tomorrow is the SPY ETF. For those of you who have consumed more crayons than myself, the SPY ETF refers to the S&P 500 index and is weighted accordingly to the index fund itself. It is heaviest in technology stocks (24.66%) however it is very diverse also holding healthcare (15.08%), financial services (12.86%), consumer cyclical (10.66%), communication services (9.1%), industrials (8.14%), consumer defensive (7.28%), energy (4.18%), utilities (2.99%), real estate (2.86%), and basic materials (2.19%). Additionally, the top 10 individual holdings within SPY are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Class A), Alphabet (Class C), Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth, Johnson & Johnson, and Nvidia. In total they make up 27.72% of SPY’s total assets. All that being said, let’s dive into this irrational cesspool that we currently call a market. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y2xib5knh1b91.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6645aa1cbf239abdc0b177dc67743bdbaed53d3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsumer Price Index (June YoY & MoM) \\- Wednesday\n\nThe consumer price index is expected to come in at an annual rate of 8.8% year over year with month over month expected to come in at 0.6%. As everyone knows, inflation has been running rampant and crushing economists' expectations lately leading to the current falls in general markets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBull Take\n\nWell, if the CPI comes in at or under economists expectations I believe a massive market rally will ensue on the news that will unfortunately cause some damage to the puts that I plan on partaking in. The reason the market will rally is simply because that would show inflation has possibly peaked and therefore Jerome Powell and our central bank may consider not being as hawkish and utilizing a less aggressive rate hike at their next meeting in a few weeks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBear Take\n\nIf the CPI comes in above already lofty expectations, I expect the market to take another dive back to previous lows set in June, quite possibly surpassing them in the coming weeks. This would be because in addition to the surprise in total nonfarm payrolls smashing expectations, this would show that the U.S. economy is still running hot currently and the 75 basis point rate hike discussed at the most recent FOMC Minutes would be more than justified. In an unbelievably red hot inflation scenario, word could spread of a possible full percent (100 bps) hike which would undoubtedly obliterate the SPY and cause puts to more than print. My evidence for this statement is to look at what the market did in June after ONE 75 basis point hike and high CPI data. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRetail Sales (MoM) - Friday \n\nRetail sales are expected to come in at 0.9% for the month of June. Previously, Retail sales came in at -0.3% which should in theory signal a possible coming recession due to the slower consumption of retail goods by Americans. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBull Take\n\nIf Retail Sales come in below expectations or especially if they come in negative this time yet again, this also will signal an incoming recession and again could trigger the Fed to lighten up on the rate hikes which could cause a bullish bounce of sorts or even a market rebound as investors come to expect the easy money to return to the markets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBear Take\n\nIf retail sales come in above expectations this will signal consumers still have money in which they are willing to spend on retail goods which will incline the Fed to be more hawkish, which again would cause the markets to dump. Should we get a high CPI in conjunction with high retail sales, a 75 basis point rate hike at the next Fed meeting has a much higher probability of occurring. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMichigan Consumer Sentiment\n\nFirst, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment is a monthly survey of how consumers feel about the economy, personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions. The University of Michigan conducts at least 500 phone calls and covers personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions over 50 questions with US consumers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBull Take\n\nIronically, if US consumer sentiment drops to new all time lows this will be bullish for the market as again it will try to lean the Fed into a more dovish position and perhaps only hike rates 50 bps instead of the discussed 75 bps. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBear Take\n\nConsumer sentiment rallies, defying expectations and shows optimism among American consumers. Again, if this and the CPI both follow the bearish take or all 3 I personally believe that this will be too much for markets and puts on the SPY will be in for some tendies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Personal Opinion\n\nMuch of this is crystal ball guesswork my friends. I cannot tell you what will occur and if I could I wouldn’t still be giving dandy handies behind the Wendy’s dumpster. However, I do believe that CPI will come in higher than expected. This is due to past CPI coming in hotter than expected and most importantly this data is for the month of June. Energy prices, especially oil went berserk for the entirety of June which should carry CPI above expectations alone. Not only that but literally anything I have bought has continued to go up in price on a literal monthly basis. While my Hoosier ass is by no means a proxy for the entirety of inflation and the economy it is still telling. \n\nAdditionally, I believe that one of the two following economic indicators (retail sales or consumer sentiment) will also follow a path that makes the Fed have to raise interest rates by at least 75 bps at their meeting in a few weeks. It is this interest rate raise that I believe will crush markets at least in the very near future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExit Plan:\n\nBy all means get greedy if you guys would like but I figured I would post my own thoughts for how I plan to proceed. I am going to buy 3 SPY $380 8/19 Puts at market open tomorrow morning. This is to get ahead of the economic indicators occurring this week and quite possibly make a nice 25% on my investment before the market even closes Friday. Personally I believe these contracts could do so by then and I would be happy with a \\~$750 gain in a few days on a \\~$3,000 investment. \n\nIf I am wrong though and these contracts lose value as the market decides to rally, I will be doubling down on my position, putting all of my capital in and scooping up as many contracts as I can. I will more than likely do so on Friday after Retail Sales and Consumer Sentiment data to hopefully get the best price per contract. \n\nIn a worst case scenario, I will sell at a loss, selling all of my contracts on August 1st before Theta begins to obliterate my sweet cheeks more than it already will have by that point.

And it falls by A LOT.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLand being the capitalized value of rent is shown by the below equation \n\n**L = (r - tL) ÷ d** \n\n( L = r÷d,  if there's no tax)\n\nWhere L is land price, r is rent, t is the tax rate (as a share of land price) and d is the discount rate, usually taken to be ~5%.

And by taxing it 20%, the owner pays 16k per year (which is 80% of rent). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou may notice that in theory, you could have stupid huge land tax rates like 10,000%, and land value still doesn't go to zero.

{"title": "The ACTUAL business model for GameStop & NFT!", "selftext": "Say u bought some digital version of a game, say on PC (steam,etc.) or ps4/5, xbox, wii, etc. and u want to sell the game to someone else when your done or bored of it, like how in the old days with physical games, there was GameStop stores as the middle man (the physical marketplace)… now … with the GameStop NFT Marketplace, if a game developer/studio onboards, they can enable the digital resale of games, and each time a used game trades hand, GME gets 2.5% commissions, like how a credit card company does as processing fees, and the original game development company can get a 10% cut for each and every time a “used digital game” exchanges hands, THEREFORE the used game market is modernized and is brought back to life in the digital world.. now the same thing applies with used digital anything, from movies (like my collection of iTunes movies I’ve paid for) and my selectively paid for digital collection of music albums on various platforms… this is what they’re ultimate plan is, hence they only charge 2.5% commissions because GME plans to be a large volume processor and won’t want to compete with or been seen as a threat to the existing digital distribution ecosystem. Instead they would want to partner with them and enable these companies to make more money from the huge volumes of digital assets people already paid for and eager to make a resale! Knowing that I can resell my iTunes movies will allow me to binge purchase movies!\n\nAnd….\n\nImagine if GTA game started allowing you to actually buy and sell weapons and clothes and etc. for real money on an exchange with other players using a low fee NFT exchange that everyone already knows and trusts! The entire game industry is going cash money! The global games market is NOW over $180 BILLION, which is more than movie and music industry combined!\n\nTLDR;\n\nGME will push forward with … \n\n1) NFT as we know it yesterday… speculative digital art?\n\n2) NFT exchange to facilitate tradable progress/achievements within games (think GTA guns & gear) between players.\n\n3) NFT as a resale marketplace for used digital games/movies/music by becoming a large volume processor like Visa.\n\nThis is like investing in Apple when it was about to go bankrupt and Microsoft had to bail them out!!\n\nTo the moon, and build a base!\nBUY, HODL, DRS!\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nEdit: Just saying…\n\nDo you mean like this one?

That's not bound to happen, that literally does happen. \n\nDevelopers will always look to disintermediate distributors when they're capable of doing so efficiently. Many have. Sometimes they will continue to sell their games on existing distributor platforms, they'll just use the leverage of their D2C channel to squeeze them for more. \n\nConsumer industries are always in an eternal flux across segments - shifting between bundling and unbundling. During distributor ascendancy, more efficient distributors able to access more customers more effectively funnel sales through them. During producer ascendancy, producers disintermediate distributors to go direct to consumers. \n\n> Find me any industry, literally one example, where the producers are also the distributors, but there's still a consolidated marketplace where the products from those producers are sold all together side by side.\n\nAre you stupid or are you stupid? Or are you REALLY fucking stupid?\n\nMan, it really is a tragedy how utterly ignorant of ANYTHING related to business that you GameStop apes are. Just sad really.

Exist.\n\nThat's like saying that doors don't exist. \n\nI don't feel the urge to dispute it, because it's self-evident that doors exist. I'm just thoroughly confused about what life circumstances (or bad bot programming) brought you to the point where you believe something that nonsensical?\n\n> Once a producer figures out distribution on their own, there is literally zero reason for them to go to a third party distributor.\n\nSure there is. Endless reasons. \n\nMaybe the distributor has wide reach and a loyal customer base. The producer would prefer all sales go direct, but they'll still sell through the distributor because the distributor can sell more than they can to customers that they can't.\n\nFor example, you can buy an iPhone at Target. You can also buy an iPhone online from Apple.com. Or you can buy an iPhone from an Apple store. Or you can buy one from TMobile. Or an authorized Apple retailer. Or on Amazon. \n\nAlternatively maybe the distributor can reach customers that you simply can't. \n\nFor example maybe you have a D2C retail presence in Japan, but not in China (or in Idaho but not in Florida). It would be expensive and complicated to gate your China sales behind setting up your own D2C presence in China, so you sell through a distributor or retail outlet. \n\n> I also didn't say GameStop should make a Steam competitor. \n\nYou're effectively arguing that GameStop should make a Steam competitor with all your talk of consolidation and distribution. You're just too stupid to realize that your grand idea is super trite. \n\n> I'm specifically saying they should leverage their brick and mortar infrastructure for something like eSports or arcades or gaming hubs.

Why would a developer use a second hand market for price discrimination where they have to pay out gamestop when they can use their own platforms or even existing platforms like steam to ensure there is no secondhand marketplace?  Introducing a 3rd and 4th party would lose them money.   Why allow people to resell when you can just lower the price to continue getting a revenue stream? Why let someone else take a piece of the 'area under the demand curve' when you already have the whole thing to yourself? \n\n I think more importantly than losing that piece is that the game companies sell a LOT more new games than they would if a secondhand market existed.  People might never know when they will be able to get a game on sale, and that uncertainty leads them to buying the game new. Once a used marketplace exists they will have certainty that they can get the game for cheaper by waiting a short amount of time and they will do so.\n\nAt best you're talking about a competitor to Steam where they attempt to get more traction and generate network effects because market participants would rather make a buck off their old game than nothing, but the AAA developer has absolutely no incentive to join.  They already have markets, they don't need gamestop's new network, and eventually the other side of the platform will collapse because no one is going to want to participate in a platform that doesn't have any of the good games.  It could be a niche market with niche games and it can be a cool little indie platform, but I don't see the benefit to the major publisher, and therefore I don't see the appeal to the average CoD boy or FIFA bro.

Believe it or not, it was almost next to impossible to do % share of resale games with the studios in the time of physical game media. The tech wasn’t capable of tracking all of this, and people just had simple business models. We now live in a even more complex society with social media even toppling governments.

Player is now done playing the TCG and sells their collection = money for devs and the player leaving. Player that left finds a new game and buys in with their newfound ETH\n\nMan, this whole GameStop thing is just a tragedy of ignorance, isn't it?\n\nSo first of all, trading cards are not video games. When you buy a trading card, you buy a physical item which you posses and own. When you buy a video game, you buy a license which grants you the right to play a game which the developers/publishers own. You own the license. Digital downloads are more of a service than they are a product.\n\nIf you could use NFTs to monetize secondary transactions of physically owned items, then the sellers would love you. Unfortunately you can't. NFTs aren't capable of doing that. In that case you would be providing exposure and control of a secondary market for a product that the developers otherwise can't access or generate value from. Of course if you COULD use NFTs for that (you can't), then consumers would passionately hate you. Sellers would love you, consumers would crucify you. \n\nThink of video games and digital downloads in general more like a movie ticket. If you buy a ticket to a movie showing at 7PM, then it would be irrational if you could go in, watch the movie, and then resell your ticket to the 10PM showing to someone waiting at the door. \n\n----\n\nSecond, allow me to educate you on the concept of \"cannibalization\". \n\nIf you introduce a competing product or competing way of accessing a product that you're selling, you risk \"cannibalization\". Which means that you risk your new product stealing sales that would have gone to the original product. Demand is not permanent. People switch what they choose to buy from the options available to them based on price,  \n\nIf you run a coffee shop and offer a bottle of water for $2, adding another bottle of water that only costs $1 will affect the demand for the original $2 bottle of water. It's not an infinite money hack, you won't simply keep selling the same number of $2 bottles and then add completely new demand for the $1 bottles. \n\nIn the video game case, you have #X of people who want to buy and play the game at every given price. Let's say you offer a video game for $50 and exactly 100 people want to buy it. If someone buys the game, plays it, and then sells it to one of those other 100 people for $20, then they've now cannibalized one of your original customers. \n\nSo instead of earning $5000 ($50 x 100), you earn...\n\n- (-)$50 (original game price)\n\n- (+)$2 (10% x $20)\n\nWhich equals -$48.

A large portion of the gaming community fucking hate both the concept of NFTS and micro-transaction based monetization.**With that not said, it is potentially grossly profitable** \\- after all, especially larger mega-corp game developers has more and more been favoring the demographic that are willing to sink dumb amounts of money into either pay-to-win mechanics, addictive casino-like dopamine systems, or because of specific fandom fanaticism for certain games series or brand loyalty.Look at Diablo Immortal for a recent very clear example. People are mocking and scorning Blizzard for the insanely steep pay-to-win mechanic built into the very core of the game, were you'd have to pay astonishing $500,000 to max out a character. What they don't understand is at this point they don't give a single fuck if some of the fanbase avoid it - It takes only 5 retarded Blizzard fanboys with too deep pockets, pay-to-win spergs, dopamine gambling addict or for-the-lulz streamer to max out a character to compensate for 50,000 regular consumers that would have bought it at $50.However, the bottom line is that the concept of micro transactions in games, be it trading or buying assets, advantages, items or whatever the fuck, is in the end a shitty fucking concept. The sole example of a proper implementation of such a system I can think of is DOTA2 were it's 100% purely cosmetic, meaning whale consumers can blow their wads on fancy virtual fashion statements to such a degree that regular players can play the game for free. This also brings me to point two:\n2. The idea of a \"second hand market using NFTS\" is frankly as revolutionary as saying you've invented a small two-wheeled single passenger car.There is literally not a single thing NFTS accomplishes that can't already be implemented on a platform as for example Steam, you can trade your DOTA2 cosmetics just fucking fine using the marketplace. The same goes for trading games you've bought, **except that you can't because why would they?**Sales brings in stupid amount of sales for games, especially because of three reasons:  \n**(1)** Consumers that would never have bought the game at full price are more inclined to buy it at a reduces price.  \n**(2)** Consumers that would never have bought the game period are more likely to buy it because of the to-cheap-to-miss-out effect that is the same as if i offered you to buy my $500 Bonzai tree for $10.  \n**(3)** Second hand sites buy an absolute shitload out of these sales, like stupid amounts of games, because guess fucking what: Games bought on Steam can be gifted=traded in the form of keys until they are claimed. These sites then sell the games at sale price + a small fee for a long period of time. This means that putting your game up for sale on Steam results in an instant profit of an longer sales period. They basically get to sell their games in bulk to a digital discount market.The reason you can't trade your owned games on Steam isn't because they lack the technology to implement it, it would be piss easy, it's because why the fuck would they?\n3. These second-hand prices of getting to sell owned digital games would never get cheaper then the sales prices we already have. Large second hand sites and scalpers would find best possible price point, corner the second hand market for anything below that price and voila - you have normal ass sales with extra steps, minus the bulk buy benefits and limited-time-incentive mass-discount campaigns.\n\n**TLDR:** NFTS and games are retarded because nothing they offer can't already be done and for higher profit because of the controlled quality of regular discount sales. Only reason it might possibly be a thing would be because consumers love getting less for more so maybe I guess.\n\n^(I also wrote this fucking wall of text because I have actual work to get done that sucks serious donkey balls and I needed to distract myself from doing it for a moment.)", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Do the NFT (aka “Used”) games also include the seller’s progress in the game?

I don’t care if its NFT or not, but if it gives some people the satisfaction that this NFT is decentralized to some extent, well be it, a marketing term none the less.\n\nSo why doesn't it already exist? Again, digital resale is already possible and has been for years. You really think that it was just waiting for a good \"marketing term\"? Also, in case you haven't noticed, most people hate NFTs. I'm not sure this is the \"marketing term\" you're looking for.\n\n>I’ve already done the math for why a 10% cut makes sense for “used digital games” after a period of time for maximum profits are reaped using the current methods of pricing.\n\nThat's nonsense. No matter what the price or demand is, the developers/publishers will be better off if they don't have to share their profits with an additional party.\n\n>I have done the math already, hope you can find that comment.\n\nLol, I honestly hope I can, too.\n\n>What’s terrible for developers doesn’t mean its the law to put consumers at a disadvantage. I bought these games fair and square. I demand I enjoy these games as I please, and when I’m done, I want to sell it. Is that too much to ask?\n\nThe seller will always get a say, so maybe. In this case, the answer is probably yes.\n\n>When people demand changes, AAA studios better adopt\n\nWho's demanding these changes?

Sure, in addition to buying JPEGs that anyone can just download for free, you'll also be able to buy TV shows that anyone can just download for free. We'll probably even see people buying free-to-play games on there pretty soon.

It's trying board games, PC parts, Pokemon cards, and now NFTs. Unfortunately, none of those sell quite like video games (hence the company losing hundreds of millions each quarter while being unable to sell its inventory).\n\n>because not all executives are too stupid to understand that their billion dollar company needs to make a profit for the long term.\n\nMaybe some executives understand that, but does Ryan Cohen?

What is very very interesting about this CPI is that this is the HIGHEST level of CPI that the fed has predicted yet. Remember just two months ago they tried to tell us that CPI was peaked yet here we are with a prediction of 8.8%. \n\nMy thoughts are that with the Feds projecting CPI to be 0.5% higher than their last projection which usually misses by about 0.2% at times I suspect we are going to get a reading of 9% CPI. \n\nWhen we get this 9% CPI we are going to see the VIX massively spike which will cause us to dump hard af. We then will for the next 2 weeks while we wait for FOMC, earnings and GDP continue to dump (I made a post last night about going long on VIX/ UVXY calls I definitely recommend you read it as it adds to all of this too). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9jfishi47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1ce646bbdfe5b81247539cc0abdb93511072043\n\nI will be SHOCKED if CPI is anything but 9% but I took profits on almost everything but my UVXY calls cause I don’t trust this market or the fed lol. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/drqk190j47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9b811ecb36df38de701e9ef660dc0f803812893\n\nOverall the daily looks clear as to where we are going… I mentioned last week we looked to be in a 370 to 390 channel and that is exactly what this week has played out as. I would be shocked if we don’t see 370 tomorrow (-2.7% day). If we break through 370 and close under it this week I think we are going to be setting up for 340-350 by EOM. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aaih33lj47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e429b5ba985120726ee44900f825a15aa780105\n\nMonday I called out the 3810 level for ES futures that I expected us to see. Here we are hitting it intraday today. PT for futures is 3675 by EOW (-4% from 3820). Overall we finally see a close below the daily 8ema on ES futures which we were waiting for to have confirmation of down trend. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvzov25k47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6fc1e00bc53da78f0f83ac0b9dff88277ab6ea\n\nThe one weird outlier today was the VIX. Even with that massive 1.3% sell off EOD today from 1pm to 345pm we never saw the vix break 28. Which tells me that the VIX (fear) did not lead this sell off but rather sheer volume. We had some pretty low sell pressure for how strong of a sell off we had though. We only saw -1.5 at the peak when most big dumps see -5 to -10. \n\nI am highly expecting the VIX to finally spike tomorrow when the market get rocked by a 9% CPI. A 25% vix day is likely and would put VIX near 35. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c1x4agyk47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=12bd0b8710ab0331cc1f04d977c82cea0168bdca\n\nOverall the server had a great day today. We definitely took profits too early but hard to say no to 30% and 50% gainers! Great day overall for sure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ht4w0ol47b91.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=b47abe9addc123b95552ba8c4f433de0c3376af3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvcmcv2m47b91.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=733818a597f13c3debc2f3fef92a2ead5ef812a1\n\nMy plan WAS to carry some 5 otm puts overnight. However, I decided to take proifits on everything instead. I also wanted to hold those 3dte puts till Friday but I just couldn’t say no to the gains. While I have high conviction we see a bad CPI and a big dump tomorrow im not chancing gains if I don’t have to.   \n \n\nI decided to hold my UVXY calls as I still have not see the VIX spike that we are waiting for. The fear hasn’t hit the market yet and tomorrow it will. And if im wrong then im wrong but with these UVXY calls in the off chance that CPI isn’t too bad I should be able to get out still with a small loss. It was the smartest play. But if im right and Cpi is trash we are looking at vix 30-35 and UVXY 16-18.
