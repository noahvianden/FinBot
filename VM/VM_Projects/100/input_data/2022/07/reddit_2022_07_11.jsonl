The stock price has risen to 105. I obviously know that this option has made money, but how is the money made exactly?\n\nSome corrections:\n\n* We need to know the premium price (how much it cost to open) to know if it made money or not. If you paid $1 million for the call and it loses $12000 a day to theta decay, it is far more likely to have lost money than gained it to a 105 stock move (assuming it started at 100).\n\n* We also need to know the moneyness of the call at the time it was opened. If the stock started at $42 at open, making the call far OTM, a rise to $105 will make a lot more money for the call than if it started at $169 ITM and fell to $105.\n\n* But if you meant it started at 100 and ended up at 105, the call **may or may not have made money**.

The reason a call contract gains value is *because the market bid the price up*. That's it. That's the whole reason. If the price of the call was originally $2.00 and the stock went up to $105, the market might decide it is now worth $2.69.\n\nWhen the market thinks a contract becomes more valuable, the price is bid up. If the market thinks a contract becomes less valuable, the price is bid down. Price is discovered through trading. That's the beginning and end of it.\n\n> Is the call sold back to a other buyer?\n\nThat is the best way, yes, though who the buyer is doesn't matter. If you buy shares of Apple stock and later sell them, do you think you sell those shares back to the same person you bought them from? No. Your mental model is you sell them on the open market. Options work the same way. So just think of options as stock that has a deadline. You trade them the same way, buy low, sell high at a later date, but before expiration. If you can't sell high at a later date, because the call's value was bid down, you might end up taking a loss. Exactly like shares.\n\n> Or is it exercised and now the trader and buys shares for 100 and then immediately sells it?\n\nThe big bold advisory at the top of this page is basically never exercise your option contracts and don't hold option contracts to expiration.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "How do you choose a strike price for an option?\n\nIs it based on the options breakeven and you want your entry price to be that b/e price\n\n or \n\nbased on if you want to be itm or otm when the option expires?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "*Introductory Trading Commentary*   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;**[Monday School Introductory trade planning advice (PapaCharlie9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool)**  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;*Strike Price*   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;[Options Basics: How to Pick the Right Strike Price (Elvis Picardo - Investopedia)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021014/options-basics-how-pick-right-strike-price.asp)  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;[High Probability Options Trading Defined (Kirk DuPlessis, Option Alpha)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcWHh2co80M)   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;*Breakeven*  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;[Your break-even (at expiration) isn't as important as you think it is (PapaCharlie9)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m0m7at/monday_school_your_breakeven_isnt_as_important_as/)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "There is no sweat spot with strikes, unless you are selling. \n\nBuying ITM, ATM, OTM, and far OTM have their list of pros and cons", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The market index has been showing declining trends since January, and has not shown an upward trend, on a daily candle basis when looking at a three month period.  \n\nIf the market stays down, or resumes down trends, you may be losing on a long call or short put at 400.  \n\nAre you prepared to lose on the trade? \n\nCash can be a useful and strategic trading position.  \n\nThere are no medals given out for calling a bottom.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Options amount to a rental of a position.   \nEventually the lease is up, and if the underlying fails to gain, you have a loss.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "CONS:\n\nSmaller profit", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "What expiration? \"LEAPS\" doesn't tell us how long to expiration, only that is might be more than 1 year.

I don’t have enough money! :(\n\nEnter the option ;)\n\nA call option gives me the “option” to buy Amazon at a certain price (the strike). I also can decide how long I want to have this “privilege” to buy the stock (the expiry). Since this “contract” isn’t the actual stock, it is much less be valuable—but to my advantage, (depending on the strike and expiry I select), it allows me the ability to purchase using my $5k. Now, I don’t “own” Amazon stock, but as the price moves up (or down), I enjoy the benefits of ownership in the short term as the value of my option contract increases (or decreases) along with the value of the stock.\n\nOne very important thing to remember about Index options in particular is that they are cash settled—\n\nWhereas if, let’s say, I really wanted to own a certain company’s stock I could buy an option and exercise it, with an index option there is no stock for me to “own.” So when the expiration comes due, I will have to either close my option position or roll it to a future expiry. I won’t have the ability to say “I think I’ll just buy the SPX and wait to see how it goes.”\n\nThis is why most people prefer ETF options (SPY), because it trades along with the SPX but gives you a little more flexibility.\n\nOne thing that’s important to remember is that these are all financial derivatives and, by their nature, involve higher risk than other investment vehicles.

I'll check out the resource you linked.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yes, you’re right about several things—SPY is widely traded, so there is incredible liquidity, and VOO has a (generally) lower expense ratio. Now, having said both of those things, I’ll add the following:\n\nMarket markers in VOO typically provide ample liquidity for you to be able to execute your trade at an efficient price. While it’s not as heavily traded (volume) as SPY, the market will still meet your needs as a retail investor. The kind of liquidity that someone trading with $10M USD is different from someone trading $1,000 or even $10,000. So I wouldn’t necessarily let liquidity be something that determines whether it would be SPY or VOO that you focus on, since for your order spread and size, there will be plenty of MM liquidity to absorb whatever you want to enter into or exit out of in terms of a trade.\n\nThe second thing pertaining to the expense ratio is related to your long term objectives—remember, if you own a call option (or a put option), you do not own the underlying security (VOO in this case) until the option is exercised. So the expense ratio will only impact your position in terms of how the market prices that ETF based on the ongoing carry cost of the buy and hold investor. For example: Suppose VOO is trading at $100, and the expense ratio is 2% (using simplistic example here, not reality, just to make the math easy); In a perfect world then, if absolutely nothing in the universe changed, after 1 year the theoretical price would be $98. Now, of course nothing in the universe is perfect, and things change very much over the course of a year, but for an options investor who owns calls in the ETF, typically if the options are short maturity (a few weeks to a few months away from expiration), then the carry cost/expense ratio isn’t perfectly factored into the ETF price, and becomes almost negligible (especially with very small expense ratios), in comparison to underlying economic factors and metrics that have a greater impact on the underlying securities that are shelf by that fund. So, expense ratio is something to consider as an options trader, but isn’t prevalent in your calculation unless you are looking at long dated maturities.\n\nIf, on the other hand, your intention is to eventually own the actual ETF (VOO) as opposed to the options, then the expense ratio has to be something that is central to your calculation, because by definition it is telling you how much money will be used by the fund each year for administrative and management costs.\n\nToday VOO closed at $349.99, so to my point earlier, if you wanted to buy a call option at the $350 strike, you are essentially controlling $35,000 worth of the index fund. Without the option approach, if I wanted to buy 100 shares of VOO, I would require $35,000. Obviously the options would be cheaper, but there is a substantially higher risk that the 350 calls will be worthless in a few days, in which case the entire value of my investment in the 350 calls goes to $0. It’s one of those dangerous things about options. If it’s even a penny below the strike at expiry, it’s worthless.\n\nThe more dangerous thing you have to be careful about is if it’s in the money and you’re close to expiry but it’s still slightly below your break even. Your broker will margin call the position and you’ll be forced to sell without any choice, even if the value jumps in the last few minutes on expiration—you’ll miss out and take the L.\n\nOne thing you may have already noticed is that on options expiration, the last hour is when everything gets hot. Positions are being closed, spreads are being rolled into the next expiration, volatility spikes and volume increases SUBSTANTIALLY. These are the times when directional trades that are close to the money either become very profitable or very costly, mostly because they’ve lost all of their time value (theta), and are trading purely on the value of the underlying (delta).\n\nDefinitely a great idea to get in the habit of practicing placing orders and monitoring your position. Paper trades are useful, but when you start doing the real thing just remember to keep your stops tight. Have discipline. Try to follow a rules based strategy as much as you can. Get out of positions that are losing, even if they might turn around. Trade often but don’t over trade. It’s probably one of the most common reasons for failure. Don’t be afraid of failure, it will be your best teacher and it will happen. Just don’t let the same failures be your common mistake. Learn and adjust. Learn some more and adjust some more.\n\nHave fun, and believe in yourself!

Like I said, I could be totally off but the P/E for Netflix shows a company that could lose a lot of subscribers and still be as valuable as it is today. Let alone a real depression that make people reduce costs and stay home. They’re all ready not buying gasoline. It’s a sign they’re staying home. I see Netflix as a winner.

He's kind of a big deal in the investing world. He's written hundreds of papers for professional and academic publications. He's the head of Research Affiliates, whose index strategies are used to manage tens of billions for companies like Schwab and Invesco. Arnott also personally co-manages several gigantic funds for PIMCO. He made probably the most accurate prediction of any major commentator for overall market returns before and during the dot-com bubble. \n\nHe co-wrote a paper called \"the Big Market Delusion: Electric Vehicles\" which calmly and rationally explained why Tesla is not a good investment and the entire EV sector is in a bubble. For example: \n\n>As of the end of January 2021, Tesla’s market capitalization had risen to $752 billion, placing it in the top 10 companies in the world by market value. At that market capitalization, Tesla accounted for about 75% of the total EV group’s market value and 35% of the market value of the entire auto industry. Such an immense market capitalization makes sense only if the expectation is that Tesla will come to dominate the entire auto industry, not just the EV market. **Such an achievement requires that both Tesla’s brand and technology become so dominant that the company can earn profit margins that exceed those of Ferrari on a level of production exceeding that of Toyota.** If that is the scenario reflected in Tesla's price, it should also be reflected in the falling valuations of its competitors, including competing EV specialists, whose market share will presumptively decline in favor of Tesla—however, the reverse is true. While Tesla’s stock price has been skyrocketing, the prices of competing EV firms have been too. [...] \n\n>Tesla led global EV sales in 2020 with 15% of EV market share. In China, the world’s largest EV market, the Tesla Model 3 topped the 2020 sales list with a 6% EV market share. Even so, its sales remained small compared to the major traditional manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Toyota. **To justify its current valuation, Tesla must grow by an order of magnitude (or two!), while increasing its margins at the expense of competitors.** As we noted previously, the market is projecting a similar growth rate for most of Tesla’s EV competition.\n\nread the paper here: https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=127087120097028125078087106082006030022041017031027078099094026106009073127119012030001121005122042126107026093095103027017065046034013064088072021071092105019023100086036012093025020110088031127066106085117127121027025031089069092005116077076028093095&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": ">Allow me to introduce Mr. Rob Arnott.

For example, a corporation may have one or even several ERP systems to manage different manufacturing operations, a cloud-based CRM solution to keep track of customers, and yet another system to manage payroll and HR.  All of these systems produce and store a huge amount of data.\n\nDecisionmakers in complicated organizations often do not have a clear picture of what is going on within those organizations.  It may be difficult to know:\n\n* What areas of the business need further investment?\n* Are there potential problems somewhere?\n* How do problems in one area of the organization affect other areas?\n\nPalantir Foundry can install as a layer over existing IT infrastructure as an \"Operating System\" for the Enterprise.  Foundry ingests existing data sources and integrates them into a \"Digital Twin\" model of an organization.  Decisionmakers can see in real time what is going on within their organization and hopefully make better decisions with this knowledge. \n\nPalantir claims that Foundry is a General Purpose software solution that can integrate almost any kind of existing software base in as little as a few days, as opposed to a custom software solution that may take years to develop and deploy.  If the claims are true, Palantir should be able to scale its business like a SaaS, rather than a non-scalable, manpower heavy consultancy. \n\nSo in summary:\n\n1. Most of Palantir's products (Foundry and Gotham) are for the purpose of connecting isolated data systems so that leaders know what is going on in their organizations and can make better decisions.\n2. Foundry is claimed to be a General Purpose \"Operating System\" for the Enterprise rather than custom codebase for each customer.  This theoretically makes the software easy to deploy and useful in orders of magnitude less time   than custom code (days rather than years).   \n\nFrom a business standpoint:\n\n1. Palantir is cash-flow positive, has zero debt, and maintains a war chest of about 2.5 Billion in liquid assets.  The company is very strong in this respect.\n2. Stock-based compensation has been the most controversial topic, as many investors did not read the SEC filings and were blindsided (it was disclosed about 2 years ago that SBC would result in over 2 billion shares), but SBC has been on the decline recently, as expected. \n3. The main questions are whether Palantir can (1) expand its customer base and (2) scale its deployments like a SasS business\n\nPalantir is not easy to understand.

The basic idea is this:\n\n* There's no machine that will make good espresso without the barista knowing what they're doing. That was true 50 years ago, and it's still true now. There's really no machines that replace experience\n* The grinder is more important than the machine, and the beans are more important than the grinder\n* So start with good beans. We're lucky that right now good, fresh, coffee is widely available. Even a decade ago you had to order it online in most places to find a decent roaster. These days most decent sized cities will probably have at least one roaster or cafe with good beans available. And the number of roasters available online has grown dramatically. I'd check out the Home-barista.com forums and see what people are recommending, but there's a lot of roasters that have made great espresso blends for decades (Counter Culture, George Howell, Intelligentsia, Stump Town, Verve). I'd really start with trying out a bunch of coffees as pourover or french press or moka pot first, just to get an idea of what you like\n* The grinder is the next most important and can easily make or break your gear. A good grinder makes it *much* easier to dial in a new coffee, and will give consistent and delicious results. A bad grinder will make things constantly frustrating (the only thing worse is stale coffee) and you'll never really be sure what the problem is. What's happening inside a grinder is black magic, so don't try to understand it, just trust recommendations and especially blind taste tests. A higher end Baratza grinder is a good starting point for most people, and if you've got the budget, a Niche is a great grinder that's comparable to grinders costing much more. But if you get really in to espresso it's easy to get fixated on hand built grinders that cost $3000+. This is why you have to remember that there's no gear that will do everything for you, it mostly comes down to your experience.\n* The machine is the least important part, lots of people who have been making espresso for a long time will say that \"the machine just makes hot water\", and that's not 100% true, but it does make a good point. It's very easy to think that some spec or some feature is so important, but really, if you have good beans and a good grinder and you kinda know what you're doing, you'll be able to make great espresso with even a really cheap espresso machine. And if you don't have those other things a $10k machine is going to make undrinkable swill\n\nLots of people who get in to espresso in a big way and spend a bunch of money on their first setup do everything exactly backwards:\n\n* They buy a really expensive machine\n* Then they don't have much money left over, so they buy some cheap grinder\n* And then they don't want to \"waste\" money on good coffee to learn with, so they buy cheap (and probably stale) coffee\n* And they make terrible coffee over and over again, and they have no idea why, and then they buy a more expensive machine to try and fix the problem.\n\nIf I had $1000 to spend on a new espresso setup, I'd spend *at least* $600 on the grinder (probably a niche), and then 200-300 on a used Gaggia classic or something similar and then $100 to spend on some really good espresso blends over the next few months.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "TL knowledge is as wide as it is deep.

It's crazy that they're talking about making a car without a steering wheel when they feel like they have to manually add crosswalks to avoid hitting people:\n\n> Earlier this year, however, one of Apple’s test vehicles nearly struck a jogger while driving at around 15 miles per hour. The car’s software “first identified the jogger as a stationary object” before recategorizing it as a “stationary person” then finally a “moving pedestrian.”\n\n> But even with that correct identification, the car “only slightly adjusted its path.” The backup human driver then “slammed the brakes at the last moment” and the car “stopped within a few feet of the pedestrian.” Had the human not intervened, Apple’s tests indicated that the car “would have almost certainly hit the jogger.”\n\n> After this, Apple “temporarily grounded its fleet to investigate” the “jogger incident.” The company fixed the identification issue and added the crosswalk to its maps database.\n\nTo me it sounds like this could be a clear example of the difficulty of trying to get lidar and cameras to agree, and what to do when they don't. It seems very unlikely that a vision system would mistake a pedestrian as an \"object\", I could see it making the mistake of \"moving\" vs\" stationary\", but there's not a lot of objects that are easily mistaken for a person. Especially if your vision system can identify crosswalks and doesn't need them manually coded in.\n\nSomething I've never seen mentioned anywhere with Apple's autonomous efforts is what they're doing about labeling.

{"title": "Its time to go long on VIX/ UVXY calls... July is going to be a bloodbath", "selftext": "Why I am long VIX/ UVXY Calls…\n\nPicture this… the year is 2022… we just had the worst 6 months in market history since the 70s… yet somehow we are magically now having the best start to Q3 since the 80s… Does that make sense to you? No? Good! Keep reading my friend! \n\nBefore we go any further… the “You cant TA the VIX” comments… don’t hurt you little fingers typing that… I tend to disagree and believe the VIX is very trending when it wants to be… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uiq73tjtpua91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fbc8e7740d9fab636584e19a505c3c294d686f1\n\nHere my friends is the Daily Chart of the VIX for all of 2022. What do you see?\n\nGreen channel- this is where we spend a lot of the beginning of the January and February and briefly spent time in April. This range is 18.7 to 25.5.\n\nOrange channel- this is where we peak in Feb and March and spent almost all of May, June and July until last week. This ranges from 25.5 to 34.7\n\nYou also see we just broke major “support” on the black dotted line last Thursday on the VIX. You also see we have been making lower highs on the VIX since January 24th we have not made a new peak. And we also haven’t made a recent higher high since May 2nd. \n\nTime wise- we have spent 53 days below 25.5 and we have spent 76 days above 25.5 this year that means 58.9% of this year has been spent with the VIX >25.5.\n\nOkay still with me here? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2z2ewnwpua91.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fc57652a416756b8756a97fa38a28a07b0e8404\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqhhvwyxpua91.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc6b6dae50edc2250c6df709f8b84b77d12bafda\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ciodch0zpua91.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=70f8f1db57303d9b5b5264fbb26c6eb708a033be\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sk6wxgk0qua91.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=10b37253bc129fb738b57142b287fa7e36d19276\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3yfgozt1qua91.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb93c9d5a1f2fb96b48bcf717d5ca8ea8e81ade0\n\nIF my calculations, predictions and overall suspicions are correct we should see the VIX “bottom” tomorrow. Currently I have 24 as a support for the vix but It doesn’t have to hit that. We should then see the VIX rising from Tuesday July 12th until two days before FOMC on July 27th. \n\nThis means Tomorrow should be loading time (anything in the 24s especially) and July 25th should be time to SELL. \n\nCurrent positions (picture below for proof) as UVXY August 19th 20C and August 16th 35C. I opened these last week when I saw the vix break the 26.7 trend line it has been holding onto since June 10th. However, I was on vacation/ had the wedding so I couldn’t properly sit down a do some TA/ DD like this to open a bigger position. Tomorrow morning I plan to add more to this position and let them ride until July 25th. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hn683uk2qua91.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd5a124b9733a28ba145af30e49193e6987dcee8\n\nWhat does this mean for Spy, the markets as a whole and other stocks? Well most likely Friday was the PEAK and we are now getting ready for our next sell off. IF this truly is just like January and we are about to get the “big one” and see “capitulation” finally this is the perfect storm and they have set the VIX up perfectly to do it. We are yet to get the holy shit the worlds ending VIX 40-60s, everyone dumping everything they have and full on capitulation that we need to reach a bottom. I think we were close June 8th to June 17th but we didn’t quite seal the deal. \n\nIf my calculations are correct we are about to see the next Sell off from July 11th until July 25th and I suspect this when we see SPY hit 330-340. \n\nThe one question that we don’t know the answer to yet and could be an even bigger catalyst to take SPY to the 200s is that we have GDP for q2 on July 28th (the day after FOMC) and IF this locks in a negative reading we are CONFIRMING we are in a recession. This with q3 earnings starting End of January is going to be either a MASSIVE downward or upward catalyst. \n\nOn Monday July 25th (two days before FOMC) we have earnings from MSFT\n\nOn July 26th (the day before FOMC) we have earnings from Google\n\nOn July 27th (the day of FOMC) we have earnings from Amazon, Boeing, Ford, META (fb), Shopify, Pinterst, and Qualcomm.\n\nOn July 28th (the day of GDP pre market) we have earnings from Apple and Intel\n\nThe week of July 25th is going to be one hell of a wild week for the markets. With all these earnings (and a few notable ones like Tesla the week before), FOMC meeting and rate hike (many suspect we see 100bps depending on this weeks CPI) and the q2 GDP reading (which is expected to be negative) we are most likely going to see full on capitulation this week if we haven’t already seen it. I think one way or another the bottom is going to be put in the last week of July. \n\nWhat if im wrong? Whats the worst case scenario and time to cut bait on VIX/ UVXY calls? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss5gzz93qua91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef138f7f50dc86aa4b56e3601b942b9fd77739c3\n\nIF we were to get CPI this week to come in way under. I mean like 8.5% or less then MAYBE we don’t see the VIX rocket. That is about the only case I can see for the VIX to stay under 25 and not see the 30s or 40s by the end of the month. However, keep in mind.. the same people who told you that we were going to see peak inflation back in May is now EXPECTING the highest inflation yet at 8.8% consensus/ forecast. \n\nAll I am saying is that the VIX has been behaving very fucky the last month and we got a very short spike before we all of a sudden dumped after the June CPI/ FOMC… Its almost like they wanted to get the VIX back under control and back to the low 20s before July. I think July is about to be capitulation month for SPY and the markets.", "id": "vw7sc0", "created_utc": 1657507110.0, "score": 397, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 216, "comments": [{"body":

The last time there was a bump in the market before the inflation report was Target, Target tanked.  Pepsi is going to give some really bad news on future sales and supply chain issues.  \n\nThey also haven't really tanked in stock since the start of the pandemic.  With Inflation, there will also be talking point about how people are going to cut back on things like Soda.  The real victims in the stock market are not usually who you would think, they are the ones the tier below, like Pepsi.  By the time the inflation report comes out at 8.9% on Wednesday, it will be too late to short the bank stocks for later in the week.\n\nI'm calling a 25-50% drop on Pepsi by this time tomorrow.

The same argument can be made for automotive. Like the car shortage, the home shortage you point out. You're seeing more repossessions, you're seeing people bail on these homes they can't afford. The thing is there are still a lot of buyers waiting and if prices come down you're going to attract even more buyers. That's great ! A little bit of deflation or negative price movement and housing and autos would be lovely. It's massively disinflationary across the economy and more importantly it's great for psychology. If you live in a decent area where maybe an average house is say $800,000 to 1 million. If that goes down to 750k to 900k you're going to attract a lot more buyers and wring inflation out of the area. Same with all these cars that are going 10 to $20,000 over MSRP because there is a lack of inventory.
