Financial professionals love to argue that bear markets hit bottom when individual investors give up on stocks in a crescendo or “capitulation” of panic selling.\n\n> Only trouble is, that isn’t what happened in 1932, 1974, 1982 or 2002, among many examples. Bear markets sometimes end in a selling frenzy, but they often end in an indifferent stupor. \n\nOn Vix:\n\n> Many professionals contend that the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is “too low” right now, says Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, an investment newsletter in New York.\n> \n> The VIX, commonly called Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” spiked to then-record highs in October 2008, during the global financial crisis—but stocks still fell more than 19% before the bear market finally ended in March 2009.\n> \n\n[Source: WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-smart-investors-do-in-bear-markets-11657292409?mod=markets_lead_pos5)", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "why the fuck do I get DMs from weirdos/bots everytime I post in here??", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "They've been trying to reach you about your cars extended warranty.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Are you saying you don’t want to know about a chill discord where we give dope trading tips and talk crypto?\n\nWtf is wrong with you?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I lost my job in June guess that didn’t help the market", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry to hear that.

Musk sent a letter to Twitter's board seeking to terminate his acquisition of the social media platform. (Mike Blake/Reuters)\nElon Musk's tumultuous $44 billion US bid to buy Twitter is on the verge of collapse after the Tesla CEO sent a letter to Twitter's board saying he is terminating the acquisition.\n\nThe chair of Twitter's board, Bret Taylor, tweeted Friday that the board is \"committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.\"\n\nTwitter could have pushed for a $1 billion US breakup fee Musk agreed to pay under these circumstances. Instead, it looks ready to fight over the deal, which the company's board has approved and CEO Parag Agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate.\n\n\nThe possible unraveling of the deal is just the latest twist in a saga between the world's richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms.\n\nMuch of the drama has played out on Twitter, with Musk — who has more than 95 million followers — lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech.\n\nWhat Elon Musk's Twitter feed says about how he might run the company\nOn Friday, shares of Twitter fell five per cent to $36.81 US, well below the $54.20 US that Musk had offered to pay. Shares of Tesla, meanwhile, climbed 2.5 per cent to $752.29 US.\n\nIn a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk said Twitter has \"not complied with its contractual obligations\" surrounding the deal, namely giving Musk enough information to \"make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter's platform.\"\n\nMajor shareholder\n\nMusk's flirtation with buying Twitter appeared to begin in late March. That's when Twitter has said he contacted members of its board — including co-founder Jack Dorsey — and told them he was buying up shares of the company and interested in either joining the board, taking Twitter private or starting a competitor.\n\nThen, on April 4, he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had became the company's largest shareholder after acquiring a nine per cent stake worth about $3 billion US.\n\nAt first, Twitter offered Musk a seat on its board. But six days later, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal tweeted that Musk would not be joining the board after all. His bid to buy the company came together quickly after that.\n\nWATCH | Musk's Twitter deal prompts concerns: \n\n\nElon Musk’s Twitter deal prompts free speech debate\n\nCalling himself a \"free speech absolutist,\" Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover deal is reigniting the debate around freedom of speech on social media platforms. Some fear that under Musk’s ownership, Twitter could be exploited as a platform to spread disinformation and monitor critics.\nMusk had agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 US per share, inserting a \"420\" marijuana reference into his offer price.\n\nHe sold roughly $8.5 billion US worth of shares in Tesla to help fund the purchase, then strengthened his commitments of more than $7 billion US from a diverse group of investors including Silicon Valley heavy hitters like Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.\n\nElon Musk threatens to abandon bid to buy Twitter over fake account problem\nInside Twitter, Musk's offer was met with confusion and falling morale, especially after Musk publicly criticized one of Twitter's top lawyers involved in content-moderation decisions.\n\nAs Twitter executives prepared for the deal to move forward, the company instituted a hiring freeze, halted discretionary spending and fired two top managers.

Cant read from Germany.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Now that Elon Musk has signaled his intent to walk away from his $44 billion offer to buy Twitter, the fate of the influential social media network will be determined by what may be an epic court battle, involving months of expensive litigation and high-stakes negotiations by elite lawyers on both sides.\n\nThe question is whether Mr. Musk will be legally compelled to stick with his agreed-upon acquisition or be allowed to back out, possibly by paying a 10-figure penalty.\n\nMost legal experts say Twitter has the upper hand, in part because Mr. Musk attached few strings to his agreement to buy the company, and the company is determined to force the deal through.\n\nBut Mr. Musk revels in impulsiveness and brinkmanship and is backed by a fleet of top bankers and lawyers. Rather than engaging in a protracted public brawl with the world’s richest man and his legions of die-hard followers, Twitter might come under pressure to find a swift and relatively peaceful resolution — one that could preserve the company’s independence but leave it in a tenuous financial position.\n\nMike Ringler, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom who is representing Mr. Musk, informed Twitter late on Friday that his client was abandoning the takeover. Mr. Ringler argued in his letter that Twitter had violated the agreement with Mr. Musk by not providing him with detailed information about how it measures inauthentic accounts. He also said that Mr. Musk did not believe the metrics that Twitter has publicly disclosed about how many of its users were fake.\n\nTwitter’s board responded by saying it intended to consummate the acquisition and would sue Mr. Musk in a Delaware chancery court to force him to do so.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute are the terms of the merger agreement that Mr. Musk reached with Twitter in April. His contract with Twitter allows him to break off his deal by paying a $1 billion fee, but only under specific circumstances such as losing debt financing. The agreement also requires Twitter to provide data that Mr. Musk may require to complete the transaction.\n\nMr. Musk has demanded that Twitter give a detailed accounting of the spam on its platform. Throughout June, lawyers for Mr. Musk and Twitter have wrangled over how much data to share to satisfy Mr. Musk’s inquiries.\n\nEditors’ Picks\n\nIn N.Y.C. Apartments, the Ants Go Marching Up\n\nA Conductor’s Career, Cut Short, Still Blazes on Recordings\n\nIs the Future of American Opera Unfolding in Detroit?\nContinue reading the main story\nMr. Musk’s cold feet about the Twitter deal coincided with a huge slide in the valuation of technology companies, including Tesla, the electric vehicle company he runs, which is also his main source of wealth. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwitter maintains that its spam figures are accurate, but has refused to publicly detail how it detects and counts spam accounts because it uses private information, like users’ phone numbers and other digital clues about their identities, to determine whether an account is inauthentic. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on when Twitter planned to sue to enforce the merger agreement.\n\n“The outcomes are: The court says Musk can walk away,” said David Larcker, a professor of accounting and corporate governance at Stanford University. “Another outcome is that he is forced to go through with the deal, and the court can enforce this. Or there might be some middle ground where there’s a price renegotiation.”\n\nFor Twitter, completing a sale to Mr. Musk is vital. It struck its deal with Mr. Musk as technology companies were enjoying optimistic valuations; some, like Snap and Meta, have now plummeted as they face advertising pressure, global economic upheaval and rising inflation. Twitter’s stock has fallen about 30 percent since the deal was announced, and trades well under the Mr. Musk’s offering price of $54.20 a share.\n\nLegal experts said Mr. Musk’s dispute over spam could be a ploy to force Twitter back to the bargaining table in hopes of securing a lower price.\n\nDuring the deal-making, no other potential buyer emerged as a white knight alternative to Mr. Musk, making his offer the best that Twitter is likely to get.\n\nTwitter’s trump card is a “specific performance clause” that gives the company the right to sue Mr. Musk and force him to complete or pay for the deal, so long as the debt financing he has corralled remains intact. Forced acquisitions have happened before: In 2001, Tyson Foods tried to back out of an acquisition of the meatpacker IBP, pointing to IBP’s financial troubles and accounting irregularities. A Delaware court vice chancellor ruled that Tyson had to complete the acquisition,\n\nBut legal authority is different than practical reality. A lawsuit will probably cost millions in legal fees, take months to resolve and add further uncertainty to already jittery employees.\n\nDeal disagreements have often ended in settlements or renegotiations on price. In 2020, luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton attempted to break up its $16 billion deal to acquire Tiffany & Company, ultimately securing a discount of about $420 million.\n\n“This stuff is a bargaining move in an economic transaction,” said Charles Elson, a recently retired professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. “It’s all about money.”\n\nA lower price would benefit Mr. Musk and his financial backers, especially as Twitter faces financial headwinds. But Twitter has made clear it wants to force Mr. Musk to stick to his $44 billion offer.\n\nThe most damaging outcome for Twitter would be for the deal to collapse. Mr. Musk would need to show that Twitter materially and intentionally breached the terms of its contract, a high bar that acquirers have rarely met. Mr. Musk has claimed that Twitter is withholding information necessary for him to close the deal. He has also argued that Twitter misreported its spam figures, and the misleading statistics concealed a serious problem with Twitter’s business.\n\nA buyer has only once successfully argued in a Delaware court that a material change in the target company’s business gives it the ability to cleanly exit the deal. That occurred in 2017 in the $3.7 billion acquisition of the pharmaceutical company Akorn by the health care company Fresenius Kabi. After Fresenius signed the agreement, Akorn’s earnings fell and it faced allegations by a whistle-blower of skirting regulatory requirements.\n\nEven if Twitter shows that it did not violate the merger agreement, a chancellor in the Delaware court may still allow Mr. Musk to pay damages and walk away, as in the case of Apollo Global Management’s deal combining the chemical companies Huntsman and Hexion in 2008. (The lawsuits concluded in a broken deal and a $1 billion settlement.)\n\nForcing an acquirer to buy a company is a complicated process to oversee, and a chancellor may not want to order a buyer to do something that he ultimately does not follow through on, a risk that is particularly acute in this deal, given Mr. Musk’s habit of flouting legal confines.\n\n“The worst-case scenario for the court is that it makes an order and that he doesn’t comply, and they have to figure out what to do about it,” said Morgan Ricks, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School.\n\nWhile Mr. Musk typically relies on a small circle of confidants to run his businesses, which include the rocket maker SpaceX, he has brought in a larger legal team to supervise the Twitter acquisition. In addition to his personal lawyer, Alex Spiro, he tapped attorneys from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.\n\nSkadden is a go-to corporate law firm, with ample experience arguing cases in front of the Delaware court, including LVMH’s attempt to break off its acquisition of Tiffany.\n\nOn its side, Twitter has deployed lawyers from two firms, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, to manage the deal. Wilson Sonsini is Twitter’s longtime legal counsel, which built its reputation on deals in venture capital and technology. Simpson Thacher is a New York-based law firm with more experience in general corporate mergers and acquisitions.\n\nIf Twitter renegotiates its acquisition price or accepts a breakup, it will probably face more legal problems. Shareholders would sue over either scenario, adding to several shareholder lawsuits Twitter is already facing over the acquisition. In April, financial analysts called Mr. Musk’s price a lowball offer, and Twitter shareholders could balk if the company agrees to further reduce its acquisition price.\n\nA breakup could also bring added legal scrutiny to Mr. Musk. The Securities and Exchange Commission revealed in May that it was examining Mr. Musk’s purchases of Twitter stock and whether he properly disclosed his stake and his intentions for the social media company. In 2018, the regulator secured a $40 million settlement from Mr. Musk and Tesla over charges that his tweet falsely claiming he had secured funding to take Tesla private amounted to securities fraud.\n\n“At the end of the day, a merger agreement is just a piece of paper. And a piece of paper can give you a lawsuit if your buyer gets cold feet,” said Ronald Barusch, a retired mergers and acquisitions lawyer who worked for Skadden Arps before it represented Mr. Musk. “A lawsuit doesn’t give you a deal. It generally gives you a protracted headache. And a damaged company.”", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "any time you want to read something behind a wall, try archive.ph\n\nhttps://archive.ph/1XsdG", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "If the euro gets any weaker we gonna be shipping cars from Berlin to US.", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Oh Chet Costco rotisserie chicken All PROTINE not so high in PHATS and calories\n\nMan it’s hard being phat in 2022 in USA Like men are already not wanted if they are bald or short\n\nPHATS is the nail in the coffin man\n\nAnd REMBER escorts and sec worker is not so legal here so I get why a lot of men are angry as Fook\n\nAt least if USA had the sec economy like Colombia and Dominican Republic\n\nThen they would truly be free and would just have to work and do over time to make income and Fook some cheeks\n\nIt would be the most productive thing mate\n\nTo happen to a big city 🏙 economy\n\nShit like Amazon prime of escorts and massage theorist and twinks with tight man ass\n\ntesla 1,000 EOW", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Our savior!

You really have to invest an insane amount of resources in to labeling to make a robot that can navigate a complicated environment.

Labeling video is better, and it's not much harder to catch mistakes. Labeling a 3D point cloud from LIDAR is hard, humans just aren't wired to recognize that kind of data, so you need to be looking at video at the same time, and it starts to get very slow and very easy to make mistakes that can slip by easily. I can't even imagine what it's like to try and do labeling for these new autonomous cars that have multiple \"HD\" radars, that's just a data format that humans are terrible at interpreting and could have errors that are very tough to catch.\n\nAnd eventually you can use autolabeling, but you need a bunch of human labeled data to get there, and then you still need humans to review and catch/fix errors, etc.\n\n> Maybe add some more Lidar.\n\nAnd this is really what they're trying, and they're just making it soo much harder for themselves. Adding more sensors, that are difficult to label quickly and accurately means you end up with worse data, or less data or both.\n\nGoogle seems to be mitigating this problem by doing a lot of simulation data. If you can do very good simulations, then you create fake lidar data that's essentially 'pre labeled'.

Higher rates tend to slow the economy by making it more costly to buy a home or car or to take out a business loan.\n\nThe central bank wants to reduce the boiling-over labor market to a simmer. The labor crunch has boosted worker pay by the largest amount since the 1980s and helped families cope with rising prices, but it would be harder for the Fed to bring down inflation if rapid wage gains persist.\n\nHourly pay rose a solid 0.3% in June to $32.08, but wage growth is slowing. The increase in pay over the past year slipped again to 5.1% from 5.3% in the prior month and 5.6% in the early spring.\n\nIn a potentially bad omen, the size of the labor force fell for the second time in three months. The labor force tends to stagnate when hiring slows or jobs become harder to find.\n\nThe share of the working-age population 16 or older who either have jobs or are looking for one slipped to 62.2% from 62.3%, leaving it well below the pre-pandemic peak.\n\n**Big picture:** A smorgasbord of recent reports suggest the economy is slowing. It’s even possible the economy could shrink for the second quarter in a row — the typical definition of a recession.\n\nYet while many economists believe a recession is increasingly likely in the next year, they also say the U.S. is in OK shape for now.\n\nConsumers are spending enough money to keep the wheels of the economy turning and businesses are still hiring and investing. Gasoline prices have also fallen recently and could give Americans temporary relief.\n\n**Key details:** The increase in hiring in June was broad based.\n\nProfessional employment rose by 74,000 to lead the way. Some tech companies are holding the line on new hires, but other white-collar firms are still adding jobs.\n\nBars, restaurants, hotels and other companies in the hospitality business created 67,000 new jobs, reflecting pentup demand among consumers to go out again as the pandemic loses its grip on the routines of daily life.\n\nEmployment also rose by 57,000 in health care, 36,000 in warehousing and transportation and 29,000 in manufacturing.\n\nThe private sector has now recovered all 21 million jobs it lost in the first two months of the pandemic. Employment rose to 129.8 million in June from 129.6 million in February 2020.\n\nThe only decline in jobs took place in government, and it was a small one at that.\n\n**Looking ahead:** “June’s strong job growth, especially in the teeth of high inflation, shows that the expansion remains on solid ground,” said corporate economist Robert Frick of Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\n“Today’s report will only embolden the Fed to hike rates by another 75 basis points later this month, which is why we expect the economy to stall and come close to recession at the turn of the year,” said senior economist Sal Guatieri at BMO Capital Markets.\n\n**Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 0.21% and S&P 500 SPX, 0.24% fell slightly in Friday trades. Stocks lost ground after the better-than-expected jobs report on the view that it will force the Fed to aggressively raise interest rates.**\n\nSource: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-u-s-jobs-report-for-june-11657282206](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-u-s-jobs-report-for-june-11657282206)", "id": "vudu03", "created_utc": 1657295397.0, "score": 169, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|32|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|74|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vudu03)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vudu03)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So, Fed will continue to raise interest rates.", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "Correct.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "\"oh god no not my free money i have to now pay for!\"   \n\\~ corporate chuds.", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "ELI5 how there is so much labor shortage with a 3.6 unemployment rate?", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Use easy numbers:\n\nPre-pandemic theres 150 people in the US and 100 jobs and 100 people in the workforce\n\nOf those 100 people (in workforce), 97 are currently employed.
