California dept. of Fair Employment and Housing, SEC, FTC, and most recently (July 6) the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK all have outstanding questions and potential objections to the deal. Notably, Lina Khan (chair of the Federal Trade Commission, the federal antitrust regulator with the greatest power to breakup the deal) has a long history of supporting antitrust actions at every level of government, and describes herself as a member of the New Brandeis movement, a political movement that seeks a revival in antitrust enforcement.\n\nNow, having said all of this, it’s also worthwhile to note that there are big bets it will go through, including a very large stake by Berkshire Hathaway in an arbitrage trade. I find it difficult to believe Warren would make the kind of outsized stake in Activision unless there was a strong belief that the deal would go through as planned. But he’s definitely been wrong plenty of times before, so don’t let that be a reason to validate your thesis.\n\nIn any case, whichever way you want to go with the trade, there are definitely some opportunities. What I’ve done is sold the August $95 put and bought the $75 put. I’m risking (per contract) about $200 with the potential to gain about $1,700. This short put vertical is advantageous to the long call vertical in that time decay (theta) is not working against me on both legs as much as it would be with the calls; that may have changed now, but when I entered the trade there was a skew in the puts so it made sense at the time.

We're gonna make a really special red, it's 13 layers of paint. It makes the color look deep and complex. And then we'll also have a silver that's maybe 8 layers and gonna be really special, kinda like a liquid silver. In a few months we'll make the deep dark red and quicksilver.** They'll be the best paint on any production car that's not made for like a show or something.

Revolvers are all loaded and pointed at each other, but no one wants to shoot because the first person that does, not only gets all the blame from their peers, but also crashes the market.\n\nIt's just like why BIG money Cramer says everything is fine, the worst is behind us. It's not. The housing market, the equities market, the derivatives market, the \"Decentralized\" market, the commodities market; they're all either already in a correction phase or need a massive adjustment.\n\nThings have been overpriced and over-levered for years. There is a reason that when big-time execs come onto Air to talk or give their input, it's usually \"It's not that bad\", \"The worst is behind us\", \"Big potential upside\". It's because everyone in High Finance knows that if anyone speaks out, gives rise to panic, or plainly tells the truth - then the market will crash. It's literally the exact same shit that happened in 07, but this time it's not just subprime shit masked by a box scented with lavender, it's everything. Heck, the stonk market is almost twice as levered now as it was back then. Below is a graph on Margin Debt outstanding on accounts against the Wilshire 5000. Pink lines are recessions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5azp57eb3gb91.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dbb159d60648d7188fb24026cc39e15862a472b\n\nIt's especially retarded because the Fed is raising rates on 30.4 TRILLION of outstanding debt. For reference, 07 was 8-10 Trillion. Good thing we've only accumulated 20 trillion over 15 years.\n\n[Money Printer go BRRRRRRRRRRRRR](https://preview.redd.it/lio71wvx6gb91.png?width=1253&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd241e30397e23a3521fe2e60cc087b9cf0e99c9)\n\nI work in IB and part of my job is adjust our pricing model based on fed CMTs, and every week, when my MD and I discuss, he consistently says \"Man, things are bad, but they are gonna get worse. It has to, 'cause if it doesn't, it'll get even worse. Watch.\"\n\nMy prediction: The end of July/early august will present two important factors. One, the CPI report for July (9.5%-10.2%). Two, the actual GDP report for Q2 (Negative, triggering recession). This causes housing and equities market to drop 40-50% over the next year.\n\nI'm not trying to fear monger, or incite anything. I'm just trying to present facts how I see them and want to spark a discussion of what you guys see on your end.\n\n Edit: TLDR: Leroy Jenkins. God dammit Leroy. Not financial advice btw.

If you add that number to the current 3.6% unemployment number you’d theoretically have 7% unemployment. Compare current participation to what we had post ‘08 housing and financial collapse (where unemployment peaked at ~10%) and we’re looking at almost 10 million fewer jobs, add that to current unemployment rate and theoretically you’re well over 10% unemployment. Yes it’s not that black and white, there are population imbalances, more people retiring than joining the workforce as they age etc, but it’s not to this extreme. One very pessimistic view of all this is that in the last decade between fed policy (because let’s be honest fiscal policy has been non-existent beyond marginal tax cuts and a slight slowdown in regulatory pressure during trumps 4 years, beyond that it’s been restrictive of growth if anything) and general technological advancements we’ve been able to have the GDP growth we had with a workforce that shrunk over a million jobs per year. GDP is the total sum of all goods and services produced in the country, if I have a factory with 100 employees and each employee produces $100,000 of products a year then our factory contributed $10 million to GDP, if 10 employees leave and the other 90 can’t make up the lost production then we produce less. This isn’t rocket science, and it’s a major issue the fed will have in navigating through a recession when there just isn’t the workforce anymore. Look at the mismatch of job openings and unemployment, even if you believe the current unemployment numebr of 5.9 million is totally accurate, bls claims there are 11.3 million job openings. You could even argue that as inflation slows because the economy is slowing, the pressure on the people who left the workforce decreases, taking it even longer for them to rejoin if you believe the theory that they just need to blow though their savings before they go back to work…\n\nYes certain fundamentals are very strong, biggest showing of this is the fact we had such strong gdp growth over the last decade even with the dismal labor market, so we likely aren’t starting down some 2008 style collapse where everyone loses everything, the bigger risk is a Japan type situation where it just becomes impossible to stimulate growth and we get two decades of 0-2% GDP growth per year.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "25-65 workforce participation rate is same as pre-pandemic.

They did everything they could to avoid complete devastation of the economy in 2002 and they did everything they could to avoid complete devastation in 2008.\n\nThe problem is they have just kept kicking the can down the road.\n\nThe inflation numbers and consumer sentiment speak for themselves.\n\nEven with all the debt the fed bought, with all the loans they’ve given out which will never be repaid, with increased access to credit for consumers, with people flipping investment properties more often than penny stocks, with people milking everything they can out of everything they have (uber for the car, REITs etc), with people having gotten used to working two jobs, with people using debt to take on more debt…the can can not be kicked further down the road this time.\n\nThey maxed out on everything they could possibly do to keep kicking the can.\n\nBut we are still hitting the inevitable point where this just can’t keep going. The solutions to the problems that the fed used are exactly what caused the inflation to begin with.\n\nThis isn’t just a USA problem. Other countries had to adapt and basically make the same mistakes in order to stay competitive with the artificially inflated US economy.\n\nSo, globally, everything is now inflated well beyond a rational level.\n\nBut the end result is going to be that people will run out of disposable income (already there based on consumer sentiment) and people are going to max out on credit (already there if you factor in that people are spending more on the cost of living than they actually earn).\n\nThis was never a sustainable model and the fed knew it. They have literally put the whole world up on a giant pedestal just so that it would have further to fall when the rug was pulled.\n\nThere is no way that these people didn’t on some level know what they were doing.\n\nI don’t know if it was malice, shortsightedness or both. But I see no reason not to believe that it wasn’t malice. I am starting to suspect this might have been the biggest Ponzi scheme ever.\n\nWhy? Because the fed still hasn’t closed out any of their positions throughout this whole thing.\n\nEither way, I think rate hikes are here to stay. There is no other way out of this. The cost of living has to go down which means rates have to go up even if it causes a recession or another great depression. After about 20 years of living in an artificial bubble this thing has to be popped.\n\nI think that’s what drunk me was trying to say the other night. I apologize to any autists who had to read my full retard drunken posting.\n\nThis is the more coherent version of what I was trying to say.\n\nMy biggest worry though isn’t the financial aspect. My biggest worry is that politicians need to keep winning elections.\n\nIn order to win elections they will have to either find a scapegoat for the problems or create a bigger problem that they can then use to wash their hands of what is happening now.\n\nWhen this exact situation happened in Germany it gave rise to Hitler who presented the Jews as the reason the economy was failing instead of the government admitting to decades of poor government decisions. We all know what happened with that and it most likely (I hope) won’t be repeated on that scale and that obviously.\n\nThis is a conflict of interest between the governments of the world and the citizens they govern because this could provide the motivation for a new world war.\n\nIf the world goes to war they can stay elected and blame shift everything to Russia or China or whoever pulls the trigger first. Even if they’re doing things like economic sanctions to try to provoke their enemies to pulling the trigger so that they can blame them for retaliation later. Sound familiar?\n\nEither way, war or no war, the markets are going down and I really believe that we haven’t reached the bottom yet.", "id": "vyrk7l", "created_utc": 1657790274.0, "score": 383, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 278, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|28|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|577|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vyrk7l)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vyrk7l)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's hilarious growing up in this.

The ECB does with at least some government pension funds.\n\nI know for sure at least much of the QE is purely treasuries for bank reserves.

It is 140% and climbing.\n\nCan FED raise interest rates while government is so much indebted? Right now, FED fund rate must be around 6-7%, minimum to prevent inflationary pressures but then how would government pay the interest burden at such high interest rates?\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot see how this will play out. It is certain that FED cannot raise interest rates unless government increases taxes to pay the debt and interest. Since government will not increase the taxes because no one will have guts to do it, then the only solution seems like inflating the debt away but that will cripple so many retirements funds holding the government debt and will generate a generation of poor retirees.\n\nI don't see how the hell this will play out :) It seems like some shit is going to happen but which one. I have a feeling that inflation will be the solution as that will screw US government debt holders, a significant portion of them are non-US entities. If that happens, anyone holding cash will get burned. If government does the right thing and increase interest rates and taxes, all the asset prices will crash and no one knows what FED will do.\n\nThe only winner out of this would be the people who borrowed during pandemic or before. The people who took leverage. I feel like an idiot that I didn't borrow during the pandemic and I kept on telling that I need to borrow, I need to borrow. I am idiot because I knew what would happen and still didn't take any action. Fuck me!\n\nOne thing, I don't understand is that who are the idiots that are still buying fixed  interest US government bonds. What is keeping 10 year treasury under 3% is mystery to me.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
