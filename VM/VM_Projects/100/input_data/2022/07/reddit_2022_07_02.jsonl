That GME share price would go down to single digits like a lot of the detractors were predicting at that time.\n\nMany people were telling me to sell before the share price goes down even further. To accept my losses and move on. I refused. I refused to sell a single share. Instead I wrote a positive post about GME in another investment sub, detailing the positive aspects of the stock and cheering up my fellow GME investors. Telling them not to give up hope. My post received over 35,000 upvotes and made it to the front page of Reddit before it was taken down by mods on some flimsy excuse.\n\nThe very next month, GME share price went to $350/share.\n\nMy point is, never lose hope. You've only truly lost when you sell your shares at a loss. Never sell them at a loss. Be patient and wait. You may have to wait a year or 5 years. That's OK.

Individual stocks carry a significant risk, and it is imperative to assess that. I've seen people ride down individual stocks with that mentality down to near zero and to a point where their tickers cannot be mentioned here anymore because of the rules with that very same mentality. To recover their losses, they would need these companies to do more than a 20x from their current price, and some will most likely go bancrupt within the next years.

Anyone who bought in the last 6m probably regrets it, anyone who sold in the last 6m probably looks like a genius. \n\nBeing down where you are isn't underperformance given where the indices are YTD - NASDAQ ~30%, SP500 ~20%, DOW ~17%. \n\nThat being said, instead of focusing on where the market has brought your portfolio now, I would focus on the composition of the portfolio and the future implications. \n\nNVDA - best in class cyclical/semi stock that really is so much more than that run by Jensen Huang, who, in my opinion, is one of the best CEOs in the world right now (hardware/tech).\n\nTGT - best in class retailer, targeting a wide range of consumers up and down the socioeconomic ladder (consumer staple-discretionary hybrid).\n\nDIS - entertainment conglomerate: streaming, international theme parks, best IPs, etc... (entertainment-media/consumer discretionary)\n\nBRK - a value mutual fund with good exposure to defensive-technology and energy run by the smartest minds in the market (diversified-value).\n\nABDE - software company that makes business creation and online-business feasible (software/cloud).\n\nIn short, you own a fairly diversified portfolio that has a lot of promise when the macro turns around and becomes more favorable for stocks.

I actually starting investing a year or so before covid, but I put in basically nothing (4k I think) - I was up 1k before covid crash and then was down 1k I believe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways jump forward a few months and I started investing more and more to mixed results but mostly gains. At one point I think I was up around 10k on only 25-30k invested.\n\nEarly/mid 2021 I was somewhat pressured/convinced to put more money to work. At this point I think I had around 50k or so invested but still had more than that in cash. I invested 50k more, than more and more.\n\nAt the peak I had invested around 140k of my own savings, and I had gains of around 40k. Fast forward to now I am down all time close to 60k. From the peak of gains of 40k to now down 60k, that is 100k \"lost\" (over half my current net worth). At the time I started investing my net worth was only around 100k.\n\nI've come to terms with it. It's a shitty feeling but I try to stay positive and realize I'm still fortunate to not have to worry about paying bills etc - family is healthy etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think we'll make back our gains (assuming you're not invested in garbage, from what you listed I believe you aren't).

I remember when I first started investing and lost a few hundred dollars in a day it would cause me to freak out and panic (even though it was a small % of my savings) - to over time I became numb to the big swings. I fell into the stupid/false mentality of the market always rebounded in the short term to a newer high. In early 2022 I had already lost all my gains and I think I got to a point of down all time around 20k - and I was considering selling everything but was convinced to hold. Should have trusted my intuition but at this point I feel it would be foolish to sell. Another regret I have is when I first started I would make a lot more moves - I would \"panic sell\" things at times or buy things and sell them a week later for small gains etc. but as time wore on I shifted more towards just leaving things as they were - which was obviously a big mistake.

I'll try to answer as best I can.There are different types of inflation. Not all types require the same criteria. Yes, many corporations are charging significantly more than they need to thus driving up prices. And I feel as if even though you didn't explicitly say it, we probably have the same opinion of CPI releases. They are very manipulated and weighted poorly.However take the housing market for example. In the US at least, housing prices have soared. There is an increased competition for a limited amount of homes. This is called demand pull inflation and I can see how someone could perceive it as not a real form of inflation and rather simply a price hike simply due to people wanting to pay more. Take this into consideration though. Housing competition peaked when interest rates were at their lows. Very many people can afford a mortgage at 0.25 percent interest rates. Not as many can afford one at 5 percent. Therefore as money gets cheaper to borrow their becomes more of it. This is pretty basic and I am not trying to patronize you. Apply the same concept to equities and that's how you get asset inflation. There is a surplus of money in the economy. And if more money is made in a year than destroyed (obviously there are some nuances here considering most money is not even available to your average joe) the prices of things will gradually be forced to increase and that is inflation at its core. The last line of your original comment pretty much sums it up. Everyone is making more. Not just corporations but covid and how unemployment was handled decimated the job market so much that people who were making 9 dollars an hour now make 15. With corporations adjusting accordingly to maintain profit margins whilst paying more (sprinkle in a little greed as well) and with people having more net money in their pockets, you are going to have prices surging.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I would prefer patronizing - when someone is explaining their view point, over angry mockery and no answers.

Maybe I generalized your generation. Your work sounds interesting indeed.\n\nThe fact remains that the government, and their policies have caused the situation for your generation. It certainly wasn’t “The Boomers”. I don’t get how you can blame a whole generation of people who essentially did what the government wanted them to do. Work hard, contribute to Social Security, go to college, secure your retirement. For instance, The Social Security trust fund was never meant to be part of the general fund. Politicians have squandered that money which the intent was to supplement a secure retirement. I certainly didn’t vote to raise the retirement age or reduce benefits. I surmise you are a Sanders supporter, and that’s ok. I’m actually for universal health care and I like the the Japanese model. Be wary of politicians that offer “free” stuff though. There is a cost to everything. Are you willing to trade X for Y dollars. In my lifetime experience, nothing that the government touches is good. If they had to make their own weapons, well, we would be in trouble. The private sector is so much more resourceful and efficient. They ruin everything and are so inefficient and waste taxpayer dollars. Just look at the VA system. It was a total nightmare and is being overhauled, and I still don’t believe our vets get quality care. \n\nWhy is college so expensive? The university’s are greedy, and yes Wall Street wants you to take out those student loans, guaranteed money for them. You can’t declare bankruptcy. The Universities want more from students, more money from the government, more buildings, more research, more prestige. In my view, it’s not worth the cost to attend a four year university unless you have done your research, and have a targeted degree, and an exact job in mind. I surely wouldn’t be a liberal arts major or political science major now.\n\nIf you want a pension, there are still companies that offer them. I’ve worked for three companies in my lifetime that offered pensions. I chose my current employer by re-educating myself with tuition reimbursement from my former employer. Most recently, 10 years ago I started that job that offers a pension,  401k, profit sharing, and a bonus. The government offers pensions, school districts, state jobs, Fortune 500 companies etc. I chose my employers carefully because I wanted all those things.\n\nI believe there is climate change, I’m not that naive. You can’t take the country to renewables overnight though. I’ve read that the electric grid will not even handle an EV in every driveway in America.  Shouldn’t we think about this longer term? I’m even looking into getting a solar roof and an EV. You know electricity is generated from fossil fuels right?, and there is a certain amount of pollution that will go into every EV made and every solar panel. I mean somebody has to mine the raw materials, right? Some foreign factory is going to make them and not give a crap about pollution or climate change. \n\nBiden declared war on the fossil fuel industry, and I wouldn’t blame them if they were “holding back” production with a President and far left that wants you out of business like yesterday. And, how to we handle India and China, the biggest polluters on the planet? Even if we were carbon neutral, they would still use fossil fuels and have zero pollution regulations. It’s way more complex than just turning an off switch to fossil fuels. Honestly, the oil and gas industry is claiming that the Biden administration is killing them with regulations. Why should they drill if it’s going to cost them more and jump through endless hoops. They have shareholders to answer to. \n\nThe pipeline had very little, if any affect on energy prices. The pipeline wasn’t even done yet.\n\nIn retrospect, I would have rather had a 401k with a decent match than a pension. I would have been so better off and retired right now with compounding interest. \n\nThis subject is more complicated and there are more chess pieces at play in this than we both will ever know.

As long as one of those bills is a credit card. Just paying your power and phone bills won’t have much affect (if any; some people debate whether utilities even get reported, but I don’t think they do unless they go to collections or something). I mentioned this briefly but the method I was explaining and that I had done is NOT as fast as some other methods, like taking out a large car loan or getting a mortgage and paying those on time, every time, BUT if someone has 5+ years to improve their credit slowly, my method is great because it’s very low risk (the interest on the credit card is the only thing that could really get you in trouble, instead of defaulting on a mortgage or having a car repossessed, but usually the interest rates on credit cards for people without much credit or with bad credit can be really high. Like 15-20% isn’t unheard of. Maybe even higher, in some instances, so that can get you in trouble if you carry a balance on something that’s like 20%). Yet another option that’s possible but really only applicable to people with a large savings would be taking out a loan for a car or jet ski or snowmobile or something that you had enough money to buy outright, but picking a loan that you can pay off early without being subjected to interest on the entire principle and then paying it entirely off when the first month’s payment is due. Note: this is only useful if you REALLY need to improve your credit FAST and are willing to lose a small amount of money in order to do so, since you will have one month of interest at least. But I cannot stress this enough: you have to be very clear on the terms of the loan because many loans won’t allow you to pay it back quicker to avoid some or most of the interest, which would mean you would just be throwing money away on interest. I only found out about that method because a friend of mine purchased a car that way and then inherited some money and paid it off immediately and she showed me how fast her credit improved (it was a live-in girlfriend at the time and I was fully aware of her finances for a couple reasons). But whatever anyone does, don’t enter into an agreement on financial matters if you’re not aware of your responsibilities or if you’re not certain you can handle the payments.\n\nBut yeah, even a high interest, $200 limit “starter” credit card can be used to raise your credit fairly quickly as long as you spend at least like 75% of your limit each month and always pay it off each month and never pay any interest on it. Then cancel the “beginners” card and open a regular one with a more reasonable interest rate once your credit has improved enough to allow you to get a lower interest rate on a new card. Then once you continue to spend like 60-80% of your limit monthly, while always paying it off entirely at the end of the month, your credit should be very good and then you can close that second card and open a new card with a competitive interest rate and probably some benefits like cash back or flight miles or something. Once your credit is good enough, credit card companies will try to entice you into opening an account with things like ultra-low interest rates or other perks like flight miles or whatever. I would say 18-24 months with the beginner card, another couple years with the average card, and then you should be able to get really low interest rates from that point forward, given that you stick to the plan and don’t pay any interest, or very minimal. And if you don’t trust yourself entirely, be careful because many companies will increase your limit without being asked to do so, when you have shown yourself to always pay it off, since they’re in the business of making money, which they won’t be doing off you or I. I believe most companies will allow you to lower your limit if requested, if they do raise it on you without asking. All my lines of credit put together have limits that are roughly 3x my income and one card alone is double my income, so someone without complete self control could get themselves in trouble. Just be careful and remember that things that sound too good to be true usually are.\n\nEdit: maybe 2 years with the beginner card, 2-4 with the average card. Hard to say.

Where I live in Southern New Hampshire in a large city but this is typical of all over New England all the banks failed except one or two private ones. The difference was unlike during the depression, the FDIC guaranteed deposits. 100-year-old institutions were liquidated never to return. This was all due to commingling of institutional banking with mutual savings and loans and investment. I don't remember the particular details but this is just as banking was allowed to go overstate borders. Before this Banks were heavily regulated and only local but once the champagne corks were popped the boys went crazy and loaded the portfolios with a delicious balloon of real estate coast to coast and it all collapsed. You could have bought everything for pennies on the dollar literally. I bought my own house back at foreclosure $350,000 mortgage paid 22k for it etc condos for $3,000 a piece six families for $5,000 a piece etc etcetera these aren't exaggerations he's for the prices for almost 2 years because it was no liquidity absolutely nobody lending except loan sharks.. the inventory did not even clear out until just three or four years ago. That's how much of a backlog there wasn't foreclosure.

I had never been on my own before and didn't want to \"waste\" my first years of freedom pursuing something I wasn't even sure I wanted. I wanted to be an Architect or industrial designer. I loved drawing and painting and loved buildings. How ever I couldn't afford the school I wanted to attend, nor the town it was in. My older siblings were already enrolled in a different school in a different town and they and a couple of their friends were renting a house near campus. Cheaper school, cheaper rent... No architecture department. I was so bummed, but didn't have a valid solution to anything else... I just kind of breezed through my first year trying to figure out what I could possibly learn at this school that I would like. First year I took only electives, core classes, drank and partied. Then went into art because drawing was kinda my thing. It wasn't right though, it didn't fit, it wasn't architecture.  \n\n\nStart of my third year I switched to mechanical engineering. Jarring switch, but it was more up my alley somehow. Until senior year (year 5 at this point) and I hit a road block. Couldn't pass a high level math course. Not because of ability or the teacher... I just really couldn't get into the subject matter, it bored me. I loathed doing the homework for it. I had taken and dropped it twice... Was spending all my study time on engineering. One semester I scheduled the class, and never even stepped foot in the classroom... Got nasty emails from the prof and my advisor and dropped the class a third time. That day I switched my major once again to computer science. I had been working on campus in the student use computer labs. Became a PC tech for them. Originally it was just an on campus job that paid decent enough and I had no commute. I found I was enjoying that more than my engineering classes and I really was avoiding said class. Best part, that particular math class was not required for CSCI.   \n\n\nWithin 3 semesters of 21 credit hours in CSCI I was a senior in that department. (going on year 6.5-7 now.) Most people  go to college for 7 years and become doctors. I went for 7 years... And then dropped out... While taking CSCI classes and working for the university IT department, I started my own small IT business. Never made much money. Helped pay my rents and lunch, but that was about it. One of the contacts I made providing IT support to a local lawyer (one of their clients) offered me an IT job working exclusively for them. They were going to pay me more than any entry level job in the area, and they didn't care whether or not I finished college. Worked there a few years, honed my skills, and eventually moved to the job/location I am at now. Both companies are oil and gas, and I perform networking, IT, and automation programming for their processes. Am now the IT/I&E lead and currently earn a multiple of what some of my old college friends who actually graduated in engineering or CSCI earn.   \n\n\nI still have a fascination with housing and architecture. I use money earned from my primary career to invest in real estate. I have flipped houses. Rented houses. Commissioned the build of houses... etc. I have no desire to go through the rigors of becoming an architect through university, etc... But I have discovered with enough money and being owner/contractor... You can basically be the architect as well. I am currently in the process of doing 2 real estate projects. One is a home I purchased and will live in for a few years, then sell. The other is my \"for ever\" home I plan to build shortly. I drew up the plans, made the floorplan, did all the preliminary sketches. For legal reasons and building codes, I had to sub out to an actual architect to do the final engineering of it.

His kids had just bought a new house thinking that the money from the sale would help them afford it, so wouldn't be surprised if they lost that too.\n\nWhat a ride that was to hear from the realtor who purchased the property as a flip, then spent $70K to help it barely qualify for FHA, getting delayed from a 3-month timeframe to a 6-month timeframe on the remodel due to supply chain issues, then make prolly less than $15K profit off the sale because the hard money loan matured before he could sell. \n\n6 months of hard work and stress to pretty much make maybe a little over $2K a month.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This was his first flip.

My mother had me when she was 40.. grandparents were already dead.. my father passed away when I was 15.. my father had a really good job and my mother stayed at home.. he handled all the finances.. the house was paid off..  she lived off that money when she was younger..  years pass, she goes on social security.. goes on medicare and also had a supplemental insurance policy..  anyway, my sister gets home one night (my sister lived w her at the time) and found her on the floor passed out.. they call an ambulance.. and then my mother gets put into the hospital.. they bounce her around from place to place for a few years.. and the insurnce eventually refused to pay bc she wasn't getting any better.  She wasn't capable of going home, even with a live in nurse.. she needed 24/7 long term care.. so she tried to apply for medicaid (well my sister tried to do it for her).  Sooooo, none of us knew that insurance could just say f you.. and then medicaid also says f you.. medicaid said we're not paying, or won't pay, without taking a fine tooth comb and going thru her personal finances.. basically medicaid won't spend a dime until that person has nothing left.. they'll essentially take control of your finances.. my mom was in a facility that was 13k a month!  So they start draining her bank account.. burnt thru well over 100k.. then they'll sold off all her stocks and retirement money.. then they sold her car and used that money.. finally they take the house and sold the house and used that money.. she was I'm a facility for a few years.. then once she owns absolutely nothing, then they'll finally start paying the bill.. she was I'm long term care for a few years, took everything she owned, and shortly later she passes away.. then after she's dead, they send a freaking bill out and say, you owe us x amount of dollars to cover the expenses!  It doesn't get pushed onto the family but if there's a life insurance policy they'll take their money out of that 1st!  \n\nLoophole with this life insurance policy:  if there are benefactors listed on the policy, medicaid can't touch it.. but if no benefactors are listed, and the policy goes to the estate, then they get paid 1st and take whatever amount is owed.. if this helps 1 person then this was worth writing! Lol.. \n\nAnyway, she did have a safety deposit box too.. we had to pay a lawyer to go open this box, and he had to inventory everything in the box.. all the contents of that box are part of the estate, so medicaid is entitled to everything in there until they final balance is paid off!  \n\nThe only thing she was allowed to do with her money after she got sick, was she was allowed to keep 8k of her own money to set up and pay for her own funeral.. she wasn't allowed to touch another penny.. \n\nAnd medicaid is able to go back thru your finances for 5 years!  So if you got sick today and put Into the hospital tomorrow, and then try to give your kid your house the following day, medicaid can go back and take that house from your kid if they feel you were trying to hide or give away your $ before applying for mediciad... you can sell your house or your car to your kids for fair market value but you can't just sell it to them for a dollar after you're sick.. you have to do that while you're still healthy \n\nI guess there's ways of setting this up that protects you, a financial advisor probably would have helped.. we didn't know any of this stuff, it was kind of our own dumb ass fault.. assumed bc she owned the home outright they couldn't touch it, not true.. think this is why old people hid money in jars and under mattresses..

The only way we get out of this mess is through changing the law to make it easier, just like the wealthy bribe politicians for their tax cuts. I would propose a cap on the number of rental properties any organization is able to acquire. These new caps should be even more limiting in places with an affordable housing crisis. Most landlords in America have no business controlling other families households. A popular business model for wealthy Americans is to buy up many rental properties and undergo less-than-bare-minimum maintenance. We have to stop this because people going into this are often very ignorant about what they are trying to do.\n\nAnother way is to fight NIMBY's and get more supply in the housing market. We still have racist zoning laws from back before women or minorities could vote and even the most liberal districts are unwilling to change. There needs to be more zoning for multi family homes and affordable housing. Most NIMBY's fear urbanization and we have an opportunity to make new affordable housing developments.\n\nI also think Millennials need to stop being fake woke. People will be woke until there's a paycheck. When most people start getting money, they act like it was all hard work and then blame the poor for laziness. In the Monopoly study, people who were explicitly given more money in the beginning thought they earned it when they won. Also, if you're woke, then stop snoozing when it's your time to speak up. Too many of us saw the Uvalde shooting and even though the shooter was radicalized on Facebook and even though the platform has profited and amplifies alt-right rhetoric, we still think Facebook and Instagram are social norms we should continue.\n\nThe housing crisis is not going to get any better but we cannot make sitting around for a discount our generations game plan.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Om gosh pls crash", "score": -3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good, let housing crash again.

The cost of home ownership is inaccessible for millions of Americans and there are numerous measures that can change that. Homeownership is vital for families and economic prosperity. So long as the cost of homes remains profoundly inflated, the American middle class will continue to disappear. Nations thrive economically and in virtually every other measure of national stability, e.g., education, etc., when a significant number of its citizens are within its middle class. It’s no measure of national progress that the majority of its citizens lack access to homeownership, quality affordable medical care, quality education, and thus, are made to feel ‘othered’ and excluded from basic necessities due to a lack of means. Neither Millennials nor any other citizen not in the middle class or higher cheer for a housing market crash due to entitlement, that’s a ridiculous claim. No one expects not to pay their fair share for housing, but housing market is in no way based on fairness.
