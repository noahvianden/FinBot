The rise in repossessions comes after car prices surged during the pandemic, as auto manufacturers struggled to meet demand amid chip shortages and other issues. Used car prices rose particularly sharply, with the average used car price jumping almost¬†17% in May¬†to more than $32,000.¬†\n\n\"You have used car prices skyrocketing and people having to borrow more and more to get their hands on a car,\" Beilfuss Popeo said.¬†\n\nUsed car market \"bubble\"\n\nAmericans had \"temporary pockets of income\" during the pandemic, thanks to stimulus checks, extra unemployment aid and Child Tax Credit payments, allowing them to pay up for pricier cars, she added.¬†\n\nThat's caused concerns among experts that the used car market is in a \"bubble,\" Beilfuss Popeo noted.\n\nBut those government supports have ended, and many families are now facing budget shortfalls given the¬†highest inflation in 40 years. As a result, more consumers are defaulting on their auto loans, with subprime repossessions up 11% since 2020,¬†according¬†to the auto-news site Jalopnik.¬†\n\nAnd repossessions among prime borrowers has doubled from 2% to 4% during the past two years, Beilfuss Popeo said.¬†\n\n\"One red flag is the rate of repossession for prime borrowers is starting to rise. It's not just subprime borrowers that are having problems,\" she noted.\n\nBut there is a bright spot, said Popeo, who believes the rapid rise in interest rates as a result of aggressive Fed hikes should cool the market as intended. \"Demand is cooling ‚Äî it should lower prices for certain things, like cars.\"\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/used-car-bubble-market-repossessions-are-surging/", "id": "w0wqi7", "created_utc": 1658024748.0, "score": 230, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|98|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|30|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w0wqi7)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w0wqi7)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Meanwhile the dealerships here are charging a minimum of $8000 ABOVE sticker price for any vehicle, ‚Äúdue to high demand and short supply ‚Äú", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "For now.

Apparently my one play I spoke on, $YANG, decided to go up 50% within a week on slowing China economic news I thought was priced in already. I decided to give it another shot with my 3 brain cells on the Chinese domain of Reddit.\n\n\\*\\*NOTE: Reports out of China are notoriously fudged a little to make the nation look better. Look at the numbers as an overall view of what is occurring within China.  \n\n# Economic Problems\n\nFor the sake of my brain cells, I will assume everyone knows about the set up of China‚Äôs Housing and their financial Crisis. \n\nLocal and provincial Governments incomes depended on the land sales which in turn would create more infrastructure with debts attached to the banks. With the halt, many provincial governments are financially crippled with **hidden debts suspected to be up to 50% of Nationwide GDP** ( [LINK](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3160566/chinas-hidden-corruption-problem-behind-local-debts-goes-hand?module=perpetual_scroll_0&pgtype=article&campaign=3160566)) . The government positions are being demanded to voluntarily **cut salaries of up to 30%**  in wake of the crippling debt ([link](http://chinascope.org/archives/29979)). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2018 IMF Report on China Debts ([link](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp18219.ashx))\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/l2034lkri1c91.png?width=1924&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e7e87d5942ff4fd8c3ce14819075a140e5c20bd)\n\nIncreasing Debt to GDP from [bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-06/china-s-debt-to-climb-to-record-in-2022-government-adviser-says) too cheap to pay for it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/bh40aoqxk1c91.png?width=1214&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1ad51969a09933c5b41f59586902fb9e1f08997)\n\nChina‚Äôs banks are deeply intertwined with local governments. Many banks offered retarded investment packages instead of actual bank accounts to citizens. These investment packages either included the suspicious provincial government‚Äôs land rights as debt or were outright scams. Consequently many citizen‚Äôs money were not picked up by China's main bank. With zero liquidity, banks closed online access and became really hostile to anyone who was asking for their money. The subsequent bank runs are creating unprecedented demonstrations to force the regulatory commission to release frozen funds ([link](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/banking-waves-china-release-frozen-bank-funds-after-rural-protests-203568)). These bank runs are deeply systematic and need government intervention and will no doubt cause further strain on Chinese incomes. \n\nSpeaking about their infrastructure projects, their water dams are partially to blame for the massive floods throughout China. China currently has thousands of Dams, both active and abandoned. Some active Dams are in deep disrepair due to lack of provincial resources([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07136-0)). With increased rainfall reported throughout the region, the integrity of these Dams are threaten. These officials will suddenly open the flood gates to claim no fault. These floods are specifically pushed towards the rural towns and destroying food production in the South. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese food shortages are recognized by the Government. China implemented a Great Leap Forward in food production by forcing local governments to make more food([link](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/china-seed-industry-seeks-better-laws-support-innovation-318341)). China is also encouraging citizens to limit food waste through either subtle messaging or ordering restaurants to limit the amount of food given. \n\nFood Shortages have been compensated by the increased import of food. China currently projects to import **100 Million Metric Tons of SOYBEANS** from the Global Market ([link](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/blogs/agriculture/060722-china-climate-change-food-security)). This and other crops imports will increase despite China‚Äôs policies to increase local food production and limit food waste. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2020 USDA Report on China's increasing food [imports](https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/china-evolving-demand-world-s-largest-agricultural-import-market).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/t7a72lkzn4c91.png?width=1556&format=png&auto=webp&s=54c7ddd2b939396236acfda0904a81e3474a5592)\n\nEven if the invasion never happens, a ticking time bomb is occurring with the NYSE investigation on China companies audits with even $BABA not passing scrutiny ([link](https://fortune.com/2022/07/08/us-china-companies-stock-exchange-listing-audit-papers/)). These Reports indicate many Chinese companies will be de-listed from the NYSE by 2024 without China giving into demands. \n\n# Big Elections in November 2022\n\nWhile Xi removed political term leadership limits in 2018, he still needs to look good for his people. Their ‚Äúelection‚Äù is in November with numerous concerns of fighting off his political Rivals. The humiliation he has been experiencing with his COVID Zero Policy and his Trade War with Australia and USA has been damaging to China economically. \n\nXi is unlikely to lose however he does need to show strength within his party soon. He needs a solution that can give him absolute control over the country when you cannot simply print expensive infrastructure bills and ignore rural workers. \n\n# Their Solution? Taiwan. (But not what you think)\n\nNothing brings people together like a time of war.\n\n**(Insert American Patriotic Theme)**\n\nWe all know the memes and shit posting. We also know China has significantly increased military spending for the past two decades ([Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China)). However people believe that China will simply attempt to blitz over the 180km strait to invade without a plan. I suspect China will want a quick victory that the West will hopefully ignore and give the Party including Xi a propaganda win at home. \n\nI do not believe Taiwan itself is in immediate trouble, its islands it controls nearby China are in trouble. Taiwan‚Äôs Kinmen islands are less than 10km (6 miles) from China‚Äôs shore. Recently China has been increasingly harassing Taiwan by invading their airspace([link](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-chinese-military-is-flying-more-combat-aircraft-near-taiwan-2022-7)).  This required Taiwan to respond with their air force in a fight of maintenance attrition from Taiwan repairing their planes. I would not be surprised if it's a psychological tactic similar to some bargain brand Operation Desert Storm. \n\nStolen Picture from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China). \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pguotg3lk1c91.png?width=1814&format=png&auto=webp&s=755a84e0bd8eca1f0580c0e36069e11bd40b007c)\n\nThe West will not go to war over some rocks near China. However they would increase pressure for a peaceful resolution via Sanctions and weapons deliveries to Taiwan similar to the Russian-Ukraine War. Eventually leading down towards artillery bombardment and sea blockades to starve each island out similar to the first two Taiwan Strait Crisis-es. However I suspect they could leverage their dealings with Russia and their Belt and Road ‚ÄúPals‚Äù to compensate for the sanctions. Regardless this will lead to a globalization breakdown filled with panic and massive sell offs.\n\nThe real question comes as China begins to eat up islands belonging to Taiwan. I suspect a positive feedback loop of further investment away from China and China slowly eating up the Islands closest to them and using conquered islands as launching bases. This can increase Nationalistic Fervor within China regardless of how poor the citizens will become. \n\n# Miscellaneous Notes I cannot find a spot for them\n\n* Citizens discontent in passive aggression. Bai-lan/ÊëÜÁÉÇ ‚ÄúLet it rot‚Äù or Tangping/Ë∫∫Âπ≥ ‚Äú Lying Flat‚Äù has been a growing trend of Youth to now Middle class refusing to work/cooperate because they believe it is hopeless for them to become successful ([link](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/the-rise-of-bai-lan-why-chinas-frustrated-youth-are-ready-to-let-it-rot)). \n*  The QUAD Alliance of Japan, India,Australia, and the USA is the NATO of Asia for military cooperation and encouraging trade deals. Already increases in trade deals are occurring through India and Australia due to China-Australia Trade War tensions for political reasons ([link](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-india-trade-deal-open-biggest-economic-door-morrison-2022-04-02/)). It is also worth noting that Western Countries are starting to realize they prefer to keep their intellectual property rather than constantly looking for cheaper workers. \n* China has been trying to become self-sufficient in recent times. Made-in-China Policy is designed to achieve independence from foreign supplies by 2025 ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025)).  Concerning especially when you remember the US Audit Investigations threaten black listings of Chinese companies beginning in 2024/2025. \n* There is already a noticeable counter-influence towards the Chinese debt traps. The partnership for infrastructure  and Investment (PGII) is a $600B investment scheme for developing nations([Link](https://www.axios.com/2022/06/30/g7s-600b-infrastructure-bid-to-counter-china)). This could scare China into being more aggressive as NATO and other Western Democracies create their own debt lending programs for undeveloped and developing nations. \n* The Data leak is definitely a complete embarrassment to the Party and the Security Forces. I wonder if the data will be an insight to the rotten panda in the zoo. I question the income and expense costs reported in China. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Shut up and give me Plays!\n\nOverall I am expecting the ‚ÄúWe got a Cold War at Home‚Äù version of a Cold War.

It‚Äôs so fucking hard to talk to the retarded people because you actually can‚Äôt understand a point, take a deep breath and try to get it for one second. China has been threatening invasion of Taiwan for a long time, and by that they mean mainland Taiwan. Since the 50s Chinese military capabilities have changed drastically and in the event of a conflict Chinese navy is entirely capable of swiftly cutting away these bunch of micro islands and if they stop there the war proper will never spark. Taiwan doesn‚Äôt have capabilities to match China on the sea, but China tried to do an amphibious landing of mainland Taiwan that would be an entirely different matter. And for the record I don‚Äôt believe this scenario is even likely or the war for that matter, but if China commits it would be all or nothing.\n\nOP‚Äôs point was that the authoritarian government will try to distract people‚Äôs economic problems with military a chauvinism. For the record, I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs the case, at least not a conscious choice, it‚Äôs more often than not a correlation, authoritarian governments which can‚Äôt deal with complex economic issues try to instead do something which looks (but isn‚Äôt) simple. Just ask Vlad.\n\nAs far as property market goes, what you did heavily downplayed the problem and rambled on about US government debt. This has been hotly debated issue among the economists and how should China deal with it, if they can deal with. Your short paragraph was laughably simplistic and complete dismissal of the enormity of the challenge China has ahead. It‚Äôs fine to be clueless about the topic but don‚Äôt go around and tell people you‚Äôll educate them on it.\n\nLastly to address this strawman you keep throwing at me, I never said such a thing but let me take a crack at it anyway. The problem is the incestuous relationship of local governments, property developers and property sales. Because CCP owns all the land, the local governments get an enormous amount of revenue every year through land leases (because you can‚Äôt actually buy land in China, so it‚Äôs leased for 70 years or so). I‚Äôve seen numbers as much as 50% of local government revenue is generated through these leases. Local governments turn around and invest right back into the property developers by getting them to build more infrastructure, rail, roads, industrial estates, some though not all housing, that‚Äôs mostly paid by Chinese citizens taking enormous loans for mortgages. The problem becomes when any one of these start underperforming. If the local government has too much debt and can‚Äôt invest more into the property sector then developers don‚Äôt have enough don‚Äôt have enough to invest back into leasing more land which compounds the problem for the local government and so on.\n\nNow, every developer will be affected differently, some more, some less depending on the type of work and market, but they all buy the same bricks or cement, one problem affects the entire supply chain, if roads are not being built that effects the housing developers too. And the situation right now is quite bad, both local governments and developers are in an incredible amount of debt, lot of the infrastructure spending has turned into massive drain on budgets and to make it worse the demand is seeing a pretty serious drop, be it from Covid or something else it‚Äôs real nonetheless. And I haven‚Äôt even talked about some comical ways these governments have used the tricks to incur more debt, but that would be way too long. \n\nThe main issue goes back decades, with CCP setting high growth targets for decades and encouraging and spending more and more in property development. It works great if your economy is doubling every 5-7 years and foreign investment is an enormous sum, but now the growth is not so fast and frankly best development areas are already done. So debt started building and building and now it has become an enormous problem that has no easy solution.

The issue is what if the demand doesn‚Äôt pick up, what if the infrastructure spending continues to be a black hole for the budgets. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an easily solvable problem. Also the reason I think the war is very unlikely, if the shipping lanes get disrupted for any reason, things go for local governments from bad to catastrophic.

Some of the 20 year leases have already come due and the CCP renewed it without issue and they also put private property rights into the new constitution. There is zero chance of any kind of land seizure.\n\nSecond. Pray tell what's the difference between a local government that funds itself via land leases and one that funds itself via property taxes? What do you think happens when a developer wants to build a new planned community in the US? The local government collects an assload of impact fees, and then the infrastructure is funded via public bond attached to the new properties. All of which is funded by buyers borrowing way more than Chinese buyers are. If property values decline, like in 2008, local governments get in deep shit due to dropping property taxes and homeowners defaulting on all those bonds and you end up with restructuring the debt or the state/federal government steps in.\n\nIt's not any different in China. Yes the relative size of the debt for local governments is larger, but their central government also has a much smaller amount of debt. It is a serious problem like I said, but one that the CCP is attempting to resolve via their latest attempt at a soft landing for the RE market.\n\nLike you understand that the current state of the Chinese real estate market was purely caused by new CCP policy right? Xi is trying to stop runaway property prices and instituted 3 red lines to deleverage the entire real estate sector. You say it's \"comically weak\", how is it weak? They've forced the largest developers to deleverage whilst simultaneously keeping RE prices from crashing. At the same time, the stalled developments are mostly resuming as these firms reorganize and healthier firms take over construction. Yes it's a delicate high rope act, but one that so far has not resulted in collapse.\n\nMoreover, OP tied bank failures to the RE market, which is utter nonsense. Those local bank failures were basically the Chinese equivalent of Celsius - the whole thing was a scam. Do you believe the failure of Celsius and Voyager is going to destroy the US economy causing Biden to invade Mexico to distract the people from the economic issues? That's how insane the OP sounds.\n\nYou've now changed goalposts from \"the OP is correct\" to \"well China has problems\". **No shit China has problems, it has many and some of them are very severe.** But that doesn't mean the OP is even remotely correct when he decided that the current self inflicted downturn in the Chinese RE market is somehow tied to bank scammers and is going to cause the CCP to invade Taiwan.

{"title": "You will own nothing: serfdom and the subscription economy (part 1)", "selftext": "If this gets some views I may follow up with a part 2, etc.\n\nIn between my days spent jerking off and watching twitch streams, I've been thinking about what \"you will own nothing and you will be happy\" really means. I think what is mentioned below is obvious but I have not seen anyone mention it in detail so I will write it down below.\n\n\"You will own nothing and you will be happy\" really means the below:\n\n1. A gradual move to a subscription based economy (i.e, you will own nothing and rent everything)\n\n2. A basic income for workers that no longer provide value (i.e, you will be happy because you no longer need to work)\n\n3. A gradual move from physical consumerism to digital content consumerism, with novelty and dopamine as the opioid for the masses (i.e, you will be happy spending your time consuming digital content, porn, tiktoks, youtube videos, streams, games, music, recreational drugs, etc)\n\n4. A decline in free speech through both media censorship and self censorship (i.e, you will be happy, because if you are not happy then there is something wrong with you and you need to be put on something).\n\n5. A return to historical norms, where 1% (and really the 1% of the 1%) controls most of the wealth and power of society), aka, a kind of tech based serfdom.\n\nLet's go into these in detail:\n\n1. A gradual move to a subscription based economy:\n\nWhen wages from labour no longer keep up with the price of assets, it means workers can no longer save enough income to buy financial assets in sufficient amounts to transition from labouring to capital class. This is straight forward, if you make a lot of money working for others, you can use that money to invest and then you no longer need to work for others. When the price of assets have increased dramatically more than wages, this becomes more difficult, which means if you are working now, you cannot retire, and are stuck in the labouring class. \n\nThe current changes to interest rates and asset prices will ultimate destroy what is left of the middle class, simply by:\n\n1. Print a lot of money/keep interest rates low and inflate asset prices after 2008. Most of the benefits of these policies are gained by the wealthy who are more financially knowledgeable and held onto their assets.\n\n2. Print even more money during COVID, causing the working class to FOMO in with their retirement savings. At the same time, the smart money started selling with the cover the Powell provided, and moved some money into cash.\n\n3. Powell does a rug pull, rises interest rates. Asset prices fall and the working people panic out of the market, losing a nice portion of their retirement. A nice recession ensures the working people don't get too \"uppity\" since they have been making too many demands lately (see antiwork, work from home, etc)\n\n4. The smart money buys back in, and after enough time to accumulate, Powell says he is surprised at how the economy has been decimated by the aggressive rise in interest rates, and lowers rates. Asset prices go back up again.\n\nCapitalism cannot exist without cheap labour to exploit, since labourers sell a finite asset (i.e, their life-time) for money, which they will only do if they do not have enough money in the first place. If everyone was a fucking hedge fund manager, who would work to generate return on investment? To discipline labour, sufficient fear is necessary, which can be done by first producing a state of confusion (2020), mania/FOMO (2021) followed by the panic and despair (2022/2023), thus ensuring the wagies go back to their cagies.\n\nWage stagnation means you can buy less of everything else, house, car, etc. This means you \"own\" less things.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. House -> mortgage -> rent\n\n2. Car -> lease -> ride share\n\n3. Utilities, internet, etc -> already subscription\n\n4. Entertainment/media -> subscription\n\n5. Phone/phone plan/internet -> subscription\n\n6. Consumables (food, gas, etc) -> consumed and have to buy again.\n\nThe goal is eventually to transition most people into a state where their money is spent either on subscription services OR consumables.  Once that state of reached, we can move to the next phase.\n\n2. A basic income for workers that no longer provide value\n\nSince the cost of living has increased, standard of living is in decline. Automation and other factors (globalization, etc) are making less workers necessary. As standards of living decreases, peoples' mental health decline, and people become desperate, which leads to a lot of the things we see on the news. In order to placate people, it is easier and cheaper for the government to provide a basic income to keep people from rioting and causing trouble.\n\nA basic income for the poor, is simply the government printing money and giving it to the rich in a roundabout way. Since people will just use their basic income either to pay off existing loans (profits to corporations/shareholders and taxes), or use to buy basic services/entertainment (which leads to salaries for workers and profits to corporations/shareholders and taxes). The salaries of workers are then used to buy goods and services (which means to profits to corporations/shareholders, etc). \n\nIf the government prints money and gives it to people, this eliminates the problem of inflation for the poor since if the cost of food goes up 10%, the government will just increase basic income by 10%. Of course, this fucks in the ass the middle class and wage workers or anyone that has savings in non capital assets.\n\nThe process is ultimately unsustainable in the longer term, but it will probably be good for another 10 years. In late 2019/early 2020 before COVID, the economy was not doing great, but it held on long enough for COVID to come along, and provided the perfect opportunity to take \"unprecedented\" action.
