Nearly 90 percent of its revenue comes from ads and another 10 percent are generated by data licensing, as they call it, which are custom services that are offered to corporations. Since its foundation, no executive has found another reliable way for the company to make money and that is bad, since its user growth is slow to say the least. Twitter tried to make some partnerships with TV networks in the past to generate more engagement, but that experiment was not very successful. The company's monetizable users grew by only 24 percent from 2019-2021 in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. This figure is dwarfed by the other tech giants and they are way, way more diversified than Twitter. Actually, the Twitter situation might be even worse than Netflix's, cuz at least NFLX is somewhat profitable, has a better business model and there is at least some hope that they might continue to grow in the future by making higher quality productions, charging customers more or expanding into streaming.\n\nIf the court rules in favour of Elon, I can't see any bullish argument about this company. What is your opinion?\n\nEdit: Since a lot of people misunderstood me and are commenting that Twitter is not a boomer stock.

CBS doesn’t come up with a new episode of NCIS every week strictly to please you, the demanding viewer with a limitless capacity for being entertained. It’s because you and 12 million other people will watch that episode, and thus pay at least subconscious attention to the 16 minutes of commercials that are interspersed throughout it.\n\nFor a car manufacturer or fast-food restaurant, there are few more efficient ways to grab customers’ attention, something CBS and its rival networks are well aware of. Media companies are more interested in pleasing the ad buyer, with the unconscious aid of the viewer.\n\n**Meta Jumps on the Advertising Bandwagon**\n\nFor social media, the importance of the number of viewers glued to their computer or smartphone screens is every bit as important (if not more so), as it is to commercial television. There’s a reason why Meta’s 10-K filing with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses the acronym ARPU, as in average revenue per user.\n\nMeta's ARPU at the end of 2020 was $32.03. Multiply that by the aforementioned estimated user base for Q3 2021 to get an approximation and now you can understand why Meta has a market capitalization of over $1 trillion.\n\nWhen Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg went looking for a chief operating officer in 2007, it’s no coincidence that he selected not an engineer nor a technologist but a vice president with a background in advertising sales. **Sheryl Sandberg** had spent 6.5 years selling advertising as a vice president at Google (ticker symbol: GOOG).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Man, where were you when I was writing my Master's thesis???", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Haha!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Go woke go broke", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Old technology for the masses.

Also use this thread to post updates, pictures, videos from the Austin visit. Let the fun begin!\n\n**Below content added on 7/20:**\n\nWhat can we expect in the 2022 share holder meeting apart from the actual meeting itself? Anyone who attended past meetings in person? What was the experience like?\n\n2020 and 2021 meetings were f-ed by covid. 2020 meeting was combined with battery day. In-person attendees sat in Tesla cars in parking lots with the audio piped in through the car's audio system. 2021 meeting was virtual.\n\nThe last in-person meeting was in 2019. Check out this LA Times article to get the mood of those times: [https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-musk-annual-meeting-shareholders-20190611-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-musk-annual-meeting-shareholders-20190611-story.html) . Check the 2018 annual meeting media reports for even more chills. Can't believe many of us HODL'd and accumulated through those phases. Compared to those phases, ups and downs these days are really child's play. Those were the days when both the company's and Elon's future seemed a lot more risky.\n\nTesla has dubbed the 2022 meeting as Cyber Roundup. Why the Cyber branding? In a sense, this is Tesla's first in-person shareholder meeting as a big company, successful company with real rich shareholders. It would probably be the first real celebratory in-person shareholder meeting, Q2 results notwithstanding.\n\nHere are some things I am guessing / hoping for at the meeting:\n\n1. Factory tour, including the Gigapress in action.\n2. Up close and personal look at the Cybertruck. I hope they have several prototypes. I hope they have enough prototypes to give us joyrides.\n3. Optimus Prime prototype appearance... although this is probably reserved for AI day.\n4. New product announcements. There has not been much reporting about this, but Elon mentioned not too long ago that there are few new products waiting to be announced, and the announcements would need their own event(s). I hope the annual shareholder meeting qualifies for at least a few of those announcements.\n5. Some unique souvenir.\n6. Techno dance party?\n7.

It’s making Americans lazy, fat, arrogant, and entitled. \n\nMy personal thought is that a lot of the mentality has shifted that way because of the fed printing money. There have been no consequences for capital mis-allocation in the last 25 some odd years. There are numbers out there on zombie corporations - they are at all time highs. [link](https://m.dw.com/en/fed-may-finally-put-americas-zombie-firms-to-rest/a-62111545)\n\nMost alarming is that corporate debt is at an all time high, and there simply is not enough cash in existence to service that debt. [link](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/us-corporate-debt-hit-hard-inflation-shock-intensifies-economic-fears-2022-06-13/) I wonder how many shit companies out there with lazy management and a broken business model are going to fail as inflation continues to rise and the fed increases rates. According to Bloomberg, 20% of the top 3000 companies in the US are zombies. \n\nIs that the real bubble that pops this thing and sends us into a depression? It could be, who knows. I think that the US will be fine over the long term so long as the fed stops printing money and allows the economy to fix itself naturally. Let fucking winners win, reward the people and companies that are the most productive - the way it is supposed to be. It pisses me off that detailed analysis has less value than someone’s gut feeling or opinion. “You can’t time the market” = fucking bullshit. It also pisses me off that bad companies get bailed out by big govt. Chroney capitalism. \n\nIt wouldn’t surprise me if stopping the money printing meant a struggling US economy over the next 10 years. However, I do think if the fed keeps printing money then they all but guarantee war and an unproductive economy with a bunch of lazy citizens. The FED is trying to drive the country off of a fucking cliff.

Then things started shifting to more digital sales and publishers were happy because digital means no used copies to compete with, if someone wants to buy a digital copy, they have to pay the price the publisher asks, and the publisher can offer sales occasionally if they want, but they're in full control and get a large percent of the money from every sale.  \n\nFor like a decade now Steam has had the community market to allow users to buy and sell in game skins and shit if the dev wants to allow it, some games do, some don't.

The difference between crediting a skin to a user's steam account vs crediting a game copy to their account is a negligible amount of code.
