Rising prices are always caused by substantial increases in units of currency, the money supply.\r  \nCommodities are a clear example. In 2022, investors have been purchasing commodity-related products to protect themselves from inflation and generate real returns. However, rising commodity prices are not a cause, they are a consequence of excessive money printing. With increased inflationary concerns, the likelihood of rising interest rates, and elevated geopolitical concerns, commodity-focused funds have seen record inflows in 2022.\r  \nThis happened at the same time as central banks injected unprecedented quantities of money into the economy. Between 2020 and 2021, the assets of the major central banks rose by more than $10 trillion. Furthermore, broad money supply (M3) growth rose at a double-digit rate in 2020 and 2021 in the major economies.\r  \nOil and gas prices will be used as the scapegoat for inflation, as long central banks keep interest rates low, and continue to print massive amounts of currency. But the reality is that sharp increases in money supply actually causes commodity prices to increase, because this excessive money printing debases the currency, making it worth less.\r  \nNow the increase in broad money supply has finally translated to an explosion in all prices. Some will blame wages, others will blame the Ukraine war, and others will blame high demand due to economic recovery. The fact is that currency debasement is at the heart of generalized price rises everywhere. Rising prices are the consequences of inflation, not the cause. Just like catastrophic property damage is the result of a hurricane, not the cause. \r  \n \r  \nMilton Friedman - Only Government Creates Inflation\r  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F94jGTWNWsA", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Where was the source of the cheap money?

The storm became the largest Atlantic hurricane on record as measured by diameter, with tropical-storm-force winds spanning 1,150 miles (1,850 km).\r  \nIn the US, Hurricane Sandy affected 24 states, including the entire eastern seaboard from Florida to Maine and west across the Appalachian Mountains to Michigan and Wisconsin, with particularly severe damage in New Jersey and New York. Its storm surge hit New York City on October 29, flooding streets, tunnels and subway lines and cutting power in and around the city. Damage in the United States amounted to $65 billion (2012 USD). In Canada, two were killed in Ontario, and the storm caused an estimated $100 million (2012 CAD) in damage throughout Ontario and Quebec.\r  \nIn Jamaica, Hurricane Sandy left 70% of residents without electricity, blew roofs off buildings, and caused about $100 million (2012 USD) in damage. Sandy's outer bands brought flooding to Haiti, killing at least 54, causing food shortages, and leaving about 200,000 homeless. In Cuba, there was extensive coastal flooding and wind damage inland, destroying some 15,000 homes, killing 11, and causing $2 billion (2012 USD) in damage. Sandy caused an estimated $700 million (2012 USD) in damage in The Bahamas.\r  \nHurricane Sandy brought massive damage to Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, The Bahamas, and the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states in late October 2012. The bulk of storm-related deaths, injuries, and property damage occurred in the United States. An estimated 8.5 million people lost electrical service as a result of the storm. Several cities and towns along the Atlantic coast of New Jersey and New York were devastated, and the storm surge was made worse by high tides amplified by the full moon that occurred on October 29. Air, rail, and road transportation ground to a halt, with more than 20,000 flights canceled. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, property damage was estimated at between $30 billion and $50 billion; however, this estimate had grown to $71.4 billion by 2014.\r  \nIn New York City a storm surge measuring nearly 14 feet (about 4.3 meters) combined with heavy rains to cause the Hudson River, New York Harbor, and the East River to flood the streets and tunnels of Lower Manhattan.

Flooding and power outages nearby forced the closure of the New York Stock Exchange, the longest weather-related closure of the exchange since 1888.\r  \nAlong the coastline of New Jersey, damage was extensive. Part of Atlantic City’s world-famous Boardwalk was destroyed, and many of the city’s homes and businesses that were not protected by seawalls were also heavily damaged or destroyed by the storm surge. The boardwalks of Seaside Heights and Belmar were also destroyed, along with many coastal developments along New Jersey’s shoreline.

That’s sounds like a crypto scam with a 40-year lock-up period!!!\n\nOh and during all this time, since the US dollar (and all other currencies around the entire world) is a fiat currency that is completely removed from the gold standard, it is eventually bound to either default off treasury bonds, or hyper-inflate itself until it is rendered worthless. \n\nSo yeah, of course the market is pumping.

The 9.1% number is YoY, and the MoM number was 1.1%. When viewed by themselves, they look bad, but this is also a trailing indicator. Meaning, things were bad last month.  \n\n\nLets also consider a few other numbers to get a better picture of where we might be heading.\n\nOil (one of the largest contributors at the moment, that is driving the price of everything else up) - Peaked in June at 120/barrel and is currently at 97/barrel. A pretty significant drop which will have impacts across all CPI categories\n\nJobs - The jobs numbers and specifically non-farm payroll is going up, which overall is a positive economic indicator. As we can see as well, the overall continued jobless claims peaked in June and is heading down again. While we are seeing layoffs more broadly, there is still growth.\n\nMfg numbers - Core capital equipment and factory orders are up, another good positive sign. Mfg index is positive, retail sales is up and not driven by vehicle purchases. \n\nAdditionally, the 3yr inflation expectation is down from previous reports.\n\nOverall, the 9.1% YoY CPI isn't nearly as doom and gloom as most of the internet would have you believe. While we were at the hight of covid, oil demand was at its lowest point (possibly ever, not sure on that though) so while we were having supply chain disruptions across the board, the cost to ship was extremely low, even when compared to previous lows in oil prices. \n\nI would argue that the CPI numbers are simply reflecting 3 years of constant money printing by the FED combined with a massive spike in consumer demand over the last 6mo. With being in peak travel season, this was driving the price of oil overall and creating a strain. I personally expect this to be short lived, and with the recent market conditions and analyst ratings I think were at least nearing an equilibrium. \n\nI know the \"Inverse Cramer\" meme is pretty popular right now, but a broken clock is still right 2 times a day so his recent post about the bottom may be true... But with that said, q2 initial GDP estimates print on July 28th so we may confirm recession on that trailing indicator, but the mfg numbers may be signaling a flattening in that for q3.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Shouldn’t the stock market inflate as well?

There's plenty of reasons to think that this is all posturing as part of an ongoing battle over the terms of the acquisition.\n\nNeither Twitter's board or leadership wanted Musk to buy the company, or even have any more shares, a few months ago. And now they're going to fight tooth and nail to force him to buy? Which would probably mean them all getting fired? But they obviously have to say they want to enforce the terms of the deal, otherwise they'd get buried under investor lawsuits.\n\nAnd Musk wanted to buy twitter, and probably still does. Maybe he really thinks the bots are significantly worse than any disclosures? Or maybe he doesn't want to pay as much given that the market has gone way down? Or maybe he's making a point that literally no one else is interested in buying the company, and if he does walk away at this point they are *fucked*.\n\nIf Musk walks away, even if he's forced to pay a penalty, or maybe especially if he's forced to pay a penalty, Twitter is in serious trouble. They fought tooth and nail to keep Musk from buying, and then tried to find anyone else to invest and couldn't and then Musk balks and tries to leave over potentially fraudulent SEC filings? If the deal doesn't go through, not only will Twitter's share price fall back down to earth, but they'll probably face a ton of shareholder lawsuits for screwing up the deal and/or lying to investors. Advertisers might have serious questions about their user calculations, and so revenue might be going down at the same time. It's not hard to imagine them having a real crisis of confidence where no one wants to touch them and the company implodes. Maybe Musk swoops in a few months and picks up the shares for pennies on the dollar?  \n\nFrom the board and c-suite's perspective, forcing Musk to acquire might be the worst possible outcome? They just forced Musk to buy a company that he believes has been fraudulently reporting users for years, and then give him all the data to test that idea and all the correspondence from everyone at the company that might be talking about calculating user numbers. Not only are the board and lots of other people getting fired, but they might be getting personally sued too.\n\nI suspect the most likely outcome is they do some posturing and then agree to a settlement where Musk buys for some reduced price, that's high enough to head off most serious investor lawsuits. And most importantly gets Twitter's leadership off the hook for dealing with this mess and any fallout.\n\nMusk is probably trying to delay to make them sweat more.

Its stock $CZR is extremely overvalued and unprofitable in a market climate that crushes such companies. Its price action consistently underperforms the overall market, and it will continue a downwards trend for the next several months.\n\n[Monthly Chart from 2017 to 2022.

Previous financial reports denote the 4.5B variable interest rate loan maturing in 2024 as 4.5&#37; + LIBOR \\(3.9&#37; as of mid-July\\) currently totaling 8.4&#37; and rising.](https://preview.redd.it/uj6vi9xnvqb91.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=72044e7a5df8a647ca6e3e2ee4f8e783f2d01269)\n\n[Ratings of B1, B2, Caa1](https://preview.redd.it/szg8wdxpvqb91.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=992eed3b7568201860bc29548271fba56567dc9e)\n\n[Literal Junk \\(Non-Investment Grade\\) Bonds](https://preview.redd.it/x3vds65rvqb91.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=d151c9027b69fe26e2951761b94e32f27a65297e)\n\nTo put this into perspective, here is a summary of their recent quarterly financial reports.\n\nAs you can see below, the interest payments cost approximately 550m-579m each quarter. Caesars' entire operating income (Total Revenue minus Cost of Revenue minus Operating Expense) ranges from 662m to -45m before interest. These interest payments are comparatively massive, and will only increase.\n\nFurthermore, their revenue is trending down while their *cost of revenue* and *operating expense* are trending up. Caesars explains it's primarily due to casino and pari-mutuel commission expenses meaning advertising, marketing, promotions, staffing, gaming costs, opening up casinos, etc. What's worrying is that despite spending more on what is ultimately a desire for customer growth, Caesars is showing decreasing customers/revenue for their efforts.\n\n[I can not emphasize enough how absurdly high these interest payments are on those junk bonds and variable interest rate loans.](https://preview.redd.it/kqkga26svqb91.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a8938530ea3b3b21af2d3f262613280f487ebaf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxv6uf7tvqb91.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7f0316259c6dd0d8e6f1e6a88abd3903cbfa48f\n\nAdditionally, Caesar's real estate assets will decrease in value with the overall RE market as interest rates rise. They've already started selling assets in an attempt to deleverage and pay off interest + debt, but it is painstakingly difficult to find buyers willing to pay reasonable prices for their properties.\n\nThe 14b they have in debt doesn't even include their long-term capital lease obligations (they lease a lot of their casinos instead of owning them), which totals to an additional 12.5b in debt. They also have about 5b in current liabilities.\n\nTo put that in perspective, Caesars has about 5.1b current assets (allegedly, with 3.3b of that being assets held for sale), and 14.6b in PPE (Property Plant Equipment). The rest of their claimed assets equates to that load of horseshit called goodwill and intangibles.\n\nThis yields a net tangible assets/book value of -12b. Yes, *negative* 12b. No wonder there were bankruptcy concerns in 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8i8mt4uvqb91.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=f921ef45a7ba6cf568f28dc2fb8d3b6b30b0efc2\n\nCaesars' bleak financial outlook is not even close to being fully priced in.\n\nSee current earnings forecast/estimates with 0 revisions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iuenu36vvqb91.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=92ffea158ce92291b52345c8c91df60fbd4127ec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzau9vyvvqb91.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=579c069bf6855bf7cabb635b246659ca5a95ab31\n\nPositions:\n\n$CZR 2022 Aug 12 Puts strike 45$CZR 2022 Aug 12 Puts strike 36\n\nI'm planning to hold through FOMC July 26-27, Q2 GDP July 28, and $CZR earnings August 2.\n\nEdit: Rolled the positions farther out by several months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85k9fdrwvqb91.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=252d4bc6a91e509e39ffd87266a82b7a1dfc435d\n\n[Heikin Ashi Candles, 3 Year Scale](https://preview.redd.it/k5l0o2gxvqb91.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bc6b60b64a2fad6dafc8032b52655f45c84e52a)\n\n[Daily Chart, 4 Month Scale](https://preview.redd.it/aaj7dow72xb91.png?width=2022&format=png&auto=webp&s=95a30c3c857d5a3bd4df31d036cc656021384055)\n\nNote potential technical convergence point.If $CZR can break through lower resistance, it's primed for another solid leg down.Otherwise, its price action may better align within the yellow channel rather than blue.\n\n[Daily Chart, 10 Month Scale. ](https://preview.redd.it/zsuw1k7t1xb91.png?width=2026&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc0b7ef5c9c6e7c693a61d5bcc0fbe657b2636f7)\n\nTL;DR: Puts on $CZR.

The Fed's rate setting mechanism primarily drives demand for the overall US economy. Raising rates tempers demand, lowering rates fuels demand. The majority of historical instances of US inflation have been due to high consumer demand fueled by an overheated job market.\n\nWhile there is some of that currently, the primary cause of inflation currently is supply shocks from the CCP's unrealistic zero covid policy and Russias invasion of Ukraine. Without getting into the hopeful eventual resolutions of these, supply shocks reduce economic output (recession) while prices rise (inflation), or the economic asshole-fisting combo better known as stagflation.\n\nIn periods of stagflation the Fed has two options in the open market - lower or raise rates. Lowering rates will save economic output but inflation will accelerate and runaway. Raising rates will further decrease economic output (deeper recession) but restore price stability, which is overall seen as the lesser shitty of the two options.\n\nThe Fed and other economists know this, but will not openly state this to avoid panic by the US public which would drive a steeper recession (in the Fed's case) or so whoever is paying them can get their money moved at the best price before the public gets wise (in the economists case).\n\nThere is more pain to come \n\nTLDR; stagflation bad, fed can't fix supply side shocks, only way to tame this inflation is to bring the US economy to a moderate to strong recession.", "id": "vzo7d1", "created_utc": 1657890159.0, "score": 219, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vzo7d1)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vzo7d1)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Or give people a more attractive place to put their money other than buying goods until supply can normalize.
