Every buy is matched by a sell. Now, to blow you mind a little, the buy and sell need not be the same type.

Thus they are less likely to go bankrupt and by that virtue, over time, they outperform others. Turtle vs Hare argument.\n\nNow think about wealth.

I also assume that they want to automate most of it soon so they want to get rid of the old factories and start over once the tech is ready. So they sold the old operations at top dollar before they are obsolete and they avoid employment issues with having to fire all those people (not easy to do in many countries). But the result of this is lower rev/net and thus higher PE. You will also note that net margins started improving for the same reason.\n\nThats not to say I agree with KO's decision but it has some merit. Once the re-alignment is complete, in theory, they should be leaner and meaner and growth should improve compared to prior.

I do not  believe that this is going to happen.\n\n**Body:**  The way I see it, the market has been trained like a Pavlovian dog to  expect that when ever there are problems with the economy, the Federal  Reserve comes in and bails everyone out with their Fed put: QE, rate  cuts, the whole shebang. This time, Pavlov's dog is hearing the  deafening bell and really wanting some food, but it will not get it. See  the figure 1 below. The market believes economic pressures are expected  to become too much to handle around the end of Q4 2022, inflation will  have fallen, and then we can cut rates and go back to the liquidity  extravaganza we have all loved to buy calls upon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xkhot80djg991.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=89a7edaabad5db7eb3b551571d7a51053c4c2f35\n\nThe  problem, however, is that this does not align with what the Federal Reserve officials themselves think. The first and most glaring case that I  think the market is ignoring is from Governors Neel Kashkari and  Christopher Waller. When even Kashkari has turned hawkish, you know  there is a problem.\n\nTake a listen  to this video. This is from May 10, 2022, not long ago. Of all the  parts, most shockingly, it only has 658 views the time I have posted  this. With only 658 people that have listened to everything that has  been said, I think the market is missing out on some extremely important  information.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQgMe-Ec-C8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQgMe-Ec-C8)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5awjgvejg991.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1e7149c5c920287b87dbd3d58691284d050b672\n\nThe  most important part, even though I believe the entire thing is  important, starts at 16:55. The two are discussing economic history and  how they think it is influencing the present.\n\nWaller:  \"To get inflation down... in a soft landing... people say you can't do  it, you've got to cause a recession and tank the economy, because  they're thinking back to Paul Volcker in ... 1980... He jacked up  interest rates to 20%, tanked the economy... and now the entire world  thinks that's what you have to do to bring down inflation.\"\n\nHe then goes on to say, \"I'm going to say that's not the case.\"\n\nAnd  I definitely start to agree with him here - you do not need 20%  interest rates. The Volcker Moment was the destination of a 10+ year  mistake-ridden journey from Arthur F. Burns before Volcker.\n\nFrom  Waller Again - 17:28: \"Volcker had to deal with a world in which inflation was out of control from almost a decade. The Fed had zero credibility in its promises to do anything about inflation, because every time they did...\" and this is  the best part of all \"**unemployment  would tick up, but they would immediately abandon the inflation (fight)  (rate hikes) and went after the unemployment.**\" \"That's not the case (now), we barely had inflation for about a year of any significant magnitude, **and there is no backing off.**\"\n\n18:40: \"...We know the damage that happens if you don't do it. **That's the lesson we learned** from the 80's. We know what happens from the Fed not taking their job seriously on inflation.\"\n\nNeel Kashkari: \"Well said.\" Audience laughter....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo,  Waller said that they learned their lessons from the 1970's &  1980's. What wrong action led them to this lesson? The Lesson was acting  like Arthur F. Burns. What did Arthur Burns do repeatedly that was so  bad that eventually led to the Volcker Moment? Well, take a look at  1970/01/01 and 1974/09/01 on the figure 2.) graph below. Each time  inflation started to go down, the discount rate - Fed used discount rate  in the 1970's, not Fed Funds like today - followed inflation lower to  the point where the discount rate never got substantially above the  inflation rate until the 1980's, where the discount remained  substantially above the inflation rate for some time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hgz1hachjg991.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af62d141a2fd828662bdd0ce013e27340843e5f\n\n1980  was the key, the economy entered a recession, inflation started to fall -  house prices, energy, food, materials - but the discount rate did not  fall to being modestly above the CPI y/y rate, the discount rate stayed  substantially above the inflation rate for some time - notably in 1983,  which put the death nail in the inflation increase with 6.50% real  rates. Other wise, there likely would have been another inflation leg  higher into 1985.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn figure 3.), this is the CPI y/y vs. the Fed Funds rate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0kst6nojjg991.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=34a58a28cb9ab25b7068dd49a61c84faae5b7aa0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn  figure 4.), this is the real 5 year U.S. rates, using UMich consumer  inflation expectations over the next 5 years minus the current 5-year  U.S. Treasury rate. I used UMich consumer inflation expectations and not  investors inflation expectations from breakevens because I believe the  consumer expectations are more accurate - less disconnected - and more  relevant and responsive to actual price changes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9ftnctnjg991.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=49c9038e6b77278134666fbe8b6ddd58c2018b5b\n\nCombining  figures 3 & 4, we see that the Federal Reserve forward guidance is  working, kind of. The 5 year real rates are still negative, and based  from what we saw from the 1980's where you need not just positive real  rates, but substantially positive real interest rates -- 1980's had  6.50% real rates to finally vanquish inflation -- vs. the negative 0.10%  of today is extremely stimulative.\n\nThe  most important point here is that at the recessionary bottom in 1972,  the real rates were +2% and this was not enough to stop inflation over  the next decade, **the real rates need to be higher.**\n\nDisregard  for a minute that we have been in a recession since January and  inflation has still increased 7% annualized since the start of our  current recession, invalidating the bull parroting that \"a recession  will cure inflation!\" It clearly has not. However, a severe recession  might.\n\nAnd this is where my thesis  comes in. The inflation rate is expected to fall when we enter the  deeper throws of the recession. If inflation falls to 3% over the next  year - extremely optimistic I think - the real rates will still only be  +.50% if the Fed gets to a 3.50% Fed Funds, and this is with the fed not  cutting rates that everybody thinks they will! The 1980's showed me  that we need much higher real rates than 2%, maybe near 6%, once  inflation's momentum has increased substantially like it has now and  like it did in the 1980's, +.50% just did not cut it back then and will  not cut it now. To get substantially positive real rates, we either have  to have *sustained* deflation of  about -2% (3.50% fed funds - -2% deflation == +5.50% real rates) or  interest rates about 6% with 2% inflation (6% fed funds - 2% inflation  == 4% real rates.)\n\nIn other words,  the Fed Put is dead. Nothing that I think will happen can allow the  Federal Reserve to cut interest rates without repeating the mistakes of  1970's and starting a next cycle higher in the inflation rate -- which  Waller unequivocally stated they will not allow to happen, because of  how devastating it will be.\n\nTherefore,  the only way I see out of this is that when inflation troughs lower,  the federal funds rate stays elevated -- no cuts in the Federal Funds  rates, and deflation. When the Federal funds rate is not cut going into  this inflation trough, the economy is going to severely contract,  leading to deflation, like in 2008 when the housing bubble burst. When  there is deflation with an un-cut Fed Funds rate at 3.50%, and sustained  deflation of about -1.50%, then we will have substantially positive  real rates of 5%. This allows the least worst outcome in my mind. The  Fed does not have to raise interest rates substantially positive so that  the Federal Government does not have to pay substantially higher  interest on their debt, and they stamp out the inflation problem. If the  Federal Funds rate is cut going into this inflation trough, then we are facing the inflationary momentum of the next legs up like what  happened in the 1970's since real rates will now be lower than the substantially positive levels that are necessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore  evidence that makes me think central bankers see the zugzwang we are in  and are going with the not cutting rates and deflation move is from the  Financial Times. (no paywall, surprisingly)\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/b937e023-c86c-4b07-b40d-a3266d84f149](https://www.ft.com/content/b937e023-c86c-4b07-b40d-a3266d84f149)\n\nAnd finally, from J. Powell's numerous speeches, but from the Guardian here - [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/18/the-federal-reserve-says-its-remedies-for-inflation-will-cause-pain-but-to-whom](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/18/the-federal-reserve-says-its-remedies-for-inflation-will-cause-pain-but-to-whom)\n\n\"Powell  recently made it clear that the Federal Reserve's remedies to combat  runaway inflation, \"will cause some pain.\" Will here is a future tense,  meaning it has not happened yet.\n\nThis  echos Waller from earlier -- \"unemployment would tick up, but they  would immediately abandon the inflation (fight) (rate hikes) and went  after the unemployment.\" They are expecting unemployment to tick up --  that is the real pain -- and they are saying it has to happen and we  have to go through with it, meaning we can not try to ease it, with rate cuts.\n\nIf this thesis starts to play out this could get bad as this is what home prices vs. income looks like right now in figure 5. As Michael Burry once said, if it's not income that increasing home prices, its leverage.\n\n[Figure 5.](https://preview.redd.it/hsaegss9kg991.png?width=2186&format=png&auto=webp&s=1671ed3101c412c591f1f757796e52251a8dceb1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\n**Long** ***Strong*** **Corporate Bonds & U.S. Treasuries:**  I have not bought any of these, and will not, but I think they will be a  good store of value/ slight wealth appreciation to ride out the damage since deflation is good for creditors.  I think you can make some money with these with low risk, but I want to  make a lot more money since I have some to risk now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Shorting commodities:** High real rates and recessions have always been bad for commodities, deflation is worse. I picked shorting natural gas here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/el0a6ekqjg991.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b8d448250d9e1056a940c4f2951f7391f2719c8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Shorting Companies that Rely on Low Interest Rates**:  For this one I have picked going short on Amazon. I think that the  consumer is very weak right now, and if we get the deflation they will  get weaker. In addition it is by its nature a luxury good, people  increase spending at it in good times and switch to inferior goods in bad  times, going to Dollar General, Walmart and the like. Amazon is also a  classic growth stock with a 51 PE at the time of writing this, not good  for what I think will happen. These are pretty short dated, but I'm especially bearish into this earnings season and after will roll them out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a0o0t5htjg991.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=0650f3ef60933ccd25a6efad21d640d9d506b350\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisk Factors:\n\nAs  stated previously, the market clearly does not agree with this idea,  they think that rate cuts are on the way and the Federal Funds rate will  not stay elevated, at a minimum. Even the biggest bears in the market  do not agree with this idea - exemplified by Michael J. \"Big Short,  Bigger Realist\" Burry below. If I disagree with this autistic genius,  then I am probably 99% chance going to be wrong, but I am holding on to  that 1% tightly.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy072hiujg991.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e6a24d942873c2f9848280d73b535a0d5b1fcb4", "id": "vqwjnt", "created_utc": 1656899870.0, "score": 559, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 238, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|1 day ago\n**Total Comments**|92|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vq4jb1/due_diligence_i_think_that_the_market_is_wrong/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vqwjnt/due_diligence_i_think_that_the_market_is_wrong/) \n**Account Age**|1 day|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vqwjnt)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vqwjnt)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow a bigger bear than Burry on WSB.

Looming WW. Shortage of workers due to cash influxes from work, people pissed off and leaving during covid. An over simulated market quickly collapsing that was pumped up by people suddenly with more time on there hands 2 years ago.  All of a sudden the money leaving the market because the money that flooded in was from govt. stimulus, oh shit govt, stimulus leads to inflation. Inflation is bad for markets. Markets come down. Oh shit markets come down, we're no longer as insanely over valued, we need to slow hiring and lay people off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Shorting Companies that Rely on Low Interest Rates: For this one I have picked going short on Amazon. I think that the consumer is very weak right now, and if we get the deflation they will get weaker. In addition it is by its nature a luxury good, people increase spending at it in good times and switch to inferior goods in bad times, going to Dollar General, Walmart and the like. Amazon is also a classic growth stock with a 51 PE at the time of writing this, not good for what I think will happen.\n\nI 100% agree that consumers normally cut luxury spending. However amazon in't luxury spending, and the also have AWS, companies aren't going to leave that. Think peloton, fashion brands, and expensive luxury cars. I would even say lululemon. And hotel chains. However, theres also lots of pent up consumer demand. I think hotels will do okay because of pent up demand. Peloton is fucked for numerous other reasons, lululemon could very likely hurt and get slaughtered by cheaper and now trendier more viral online only clothing brands. The luxury car market and car market is just bat shit crazy, so I'm not going to bet against them, and there's a lot happening with EVs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy 2 cents, fed will likely cut interest rates toward the end of 2022, and early 2023. There could be 1 more interest hike. I think it comes down to when the pent up demand and excess cash starts to slow, inflation will begin to slow. But the fed also doesn't want markets to dip to low, plus they need to be able to afford their debts. And to be honest a housing crash is in the majorities worst interests, and no one wants that (Although extremely unlikely, as it's nothing like 2008).

A question I think we should all be asking is this: what does the Fed want? In no particular order:\n\n1) Low unemployment\n\n2) Strong economy\n\n3) Low rates\n\n4) Low inflation\n\n5) Lots of spending\n\n6) More tax collection\n\nNow, those things aren't totally in line, but you certainly see that 5 of the 6 are perfectly agreeable. The odd one out here is inflation. In order to fight inflation, you have to fight ALL OF THE OTHER 5 DESIRABLE FACTORS. That does not mean they aren't willing to take a hit on the other 5 in order to quell inflation. But it does mean that, in their eyes, the sooner inflation gets under control, the sooner we can increase our desirable effects.\n\nI think the market pricing in rate cuts is right on the money. Powell tried to get spending and the markets to calm down by threatening the rate hikes. He did that for nearly a god damned year, hoping he could cool things off without raising rates. When that became unrealistic, he went all in with rate increases: 75 basis points being the last one and biggest in decades.. That is by design. Make the pain short and intense, hopefully get ahead of inflation before we start seeing the negative effects in the job market.\n\nThe Fed is not going to affect inflation enough anyway, unless they are willing to get crazy with hikes. So you have to ask yourself, is the Fed willing to put the US economy into a deep recession, job loss, market downturn, less spending, weaker economy, and then as a consequence, less tax revenue all so that we can have inflation at 4 or 5% instead of 8?\n\nI think that kind of logic is unsound. I expect the market is right: the Fed is going to do another rate increase or two, scare everyone to shit, bring down inflation a little bit, and then pivot sharply in order to prevent the kind of damage that takes years and years to recover from. The fact that they are constantly adapting out inflation measuring tools is simply another piece of evidence that inflation will be 'fixed' sooner than anyone realized would happen.\n\n\\*This is simply a look at things from a psychological perspective, never mind concepts such as inflationary pressures being a tad different this time, and likely quicker to ease.

They close the cash deal between <company>, who is the \"buyer\" and the seller first. Then the ACTUAL buyer closes the deal with <company> as the seller. There's a couple of things that can happen.  You rent it back till your financing is in order, or, if you're good to go, they simply roll a fee into the total mortgage cost.  Depends on price of home, company used etc and they all work on different fee structures.  \n\n\nWhy would you do this?  Because if you were like me, and losing out to \"cash buyers\" you can still save money.  E.g. House 1, list at 580k We offered 650k, no contingencies, with financing locked up, we lost to someone offering 625k. Ok, house 2, 50k over list, no inspections, no contingencies. Lost to someone 25k over \"all cash.\"  Switched realtors, tell them what's been happening, and they basically told us what was going on with these types of companies.  House 3. List at 600k, we offer 615k full cash w/ inspections, and beat out a 645k offer that still had to go through financing.   \n\n\nSo instead of a multiple buyers with 2-5k escalations for 50k-100k over list, the cash buyer comes in more \"appealing\" because home sellers don't want to deal with financing falling through.  These companies have absurd balance sheets, so, they can easily absorb the costs for basically a working capital loan.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I've never read a k-10, but I've pet plenty of k9s.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're sort of right. To put a broad topic really simply, the \"housing supply\" is a very artificial. At any given time a relatively tiny portion of homes are available on the market (somewhere between 5-15% usually). Additionally, the current situation is very complex but exists because of a few key factors:\n\n* Housing stock is being bought up by foreign entities and larger landlords, leading to a high demand, inflating the prices. \n   * This has a side-effect of massive rent hikes as these investors are trying to make good on their investment.\n   * The reason that the rent hasn't dropped in this situation is that the increased value of the home as a form of *land banking.* Housing is more lucrative than the stock market or keeping many currencies. \n* There are different levels of housing stock at different price-points within the market. \n   * High-end and luxury housing (both single family and multifamily) are in a surplus. Much of the construction going on right now is catered towards this as there is demand in large cities for nice apartments and homes. In many situations however, they overbuild but end up not being punished due to how wildly high rent prices are, allowing for very poor practices to be maintained. \n   * On the low end/ affordable housing end there is a massive demand and a shrinking supply. \n* Much of this is *by design.* This is a massive problem in NYC, where you see the massive amount of manipulation in the market. These real estate companies will remove certain housing and office space stock from the market to specifically raise the price and restricting supply. Due to loan structures and capital, these companies are capable of sitting on these properties for roughly 10 years before any negative effects come their way. \n\nThis all culminates in some wonky effects that we see today. Housing prices continue to spike but there is little faith in the long term sustainability of this which means at some point prices will come down. The question is whether that's a pop of a bubble (crash) or a deflation of a bubble. Ultimately someone will be left holding the bag from the luxury home developments but the question is who. The real estate companies want to restrict supply so that they can continue to charge high rents due to the false supply scarcity. Given the length of most bull/bear markets they are usually able to avoid any consequences for doing this. The *hope* is that many of these luxury units will be forced down in price by the market and start to reach into the band of affordable housing, thereby increasing the stock as these properties age and can no longer command high rents. \n\nSource: Me. I studied this extensively during my master's, having met with politicians, developers, real estate companies, and architects. \n\nTL;DR: Chances are we will see deflation in housing prices over time rather than a crash.

Only to crash starting September triple witching week or October 23-27.\n\nif you remember guys i was quite adamant that i wont flip flop from my predictions which i made back in April when March rally was fading. Well folks, I have to say I'm about to flip flop now. Now I could be right and we go up but the odds of me being wrong have definitely gone up. \n\nSo in this post I will address how I am about to be wrong, my reasons for it and at last an experiment demonstrating with chart where we will fall and then rise and then fall and then rise and then fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So the sentence have now become like this** \n\n**“We make a bottom on July 26-30 either in July fomc or Gdp July 28 Q2 adv est” And now after making a bottom and pricing recession we go up in August for a bear market rally and then we sell out somewhere in August making a bottom in September. Now my guess is it's gonna be a week of triple witching. But let's see later on that.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow before we begin let’s take a deep breath and now please shit as much as you can on me in the comments down below. I definitely deserved that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now after shitting lets see how much of a loss i made for you guys.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're my old viewers, you know I told to “Dca index, especially Nasdaq somewhere in June fomc” and cautioned not to gamble on stocks here because if you really wanna do then find something that won't get Fud.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2.5&#37; up doesn't look bad :\\)](https://preview.redd.it/9dup38kwzk991.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9cca566ce98655f4bc8e6e4dd7237e87367e2db)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell look at that we were supposed to follow a green path ( min a short or max a big one ) but look like we are unable to break the red Ketlner line and are probably heading down. But currently we are making a profit of 2.5%. So i guess ahhh not that bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Now lets Experiment : Swing trade July.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For people :** \n\n* This advice is mostly meant for traders and not investors whose investing goal is in a long term horizon lets say minimum 15 yrs. \n* My investing approach is simple Dca at key levels. Have cash in hand plus a secured job to be ready for Dow Jones -89% drop or falling around 200 monthly moving average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy own one trick pony approach : Swing the 2nd bear market rally and let’s sit on the sidelines until there is at least -50%+ in all indices. You could also short after selling in bear market rally that is entirely up to you.\n\nFor no risk investors like billionaires : Just sit out and don’t enter until Dow hits 200 mma. Park your cash with mmf in and only in rrp. Even liquid funds ex : t-bills aren’t safe due to Paul volcker rate risk. Forget about keeping the money in the bank cause there will be a bank run if depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hypothesis :**\n\n* July we get -2% above contraction in the economy and also in July, August estimates.\n* We are not in a depression coz then these rules will fail and we just keep going down till November 2024.\n* A 3 factor world analysis including Gdp, Inflation and Fomc.\n* Markets are always forward looking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The reason why i’m wrong :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[New York and Atlanta Fed negative estimates.](https://preview.redd.it/6gxy5f011l991.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=c46aca278cd3f44e534d53acd7939f8d9b902ce0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt’s pretty simple. There are 12 Federal banks in the United states of America. Out of which 2 of them recently came up with their Gdp forecast. These 2 banks have pretty good reputation and are certainly getting traction in the Twitter and Reddit world. So here’s what they said.\n\nThe New York Fed released a Dyse model forecast on 16th June  ( which they say is not from them but c'mon it’s on their website. Hence maybe signalling something ) that Gdp of Usa was expected to drop to 0.9 in march but they have now revised it to -0.6 in June. \n\nThe Atlanta Fed on the other hand previously had Gdp forecast around -1%. But then came a shock on July 1st when Atlanta Fed have revised their Gdp forecast to -2.1%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean is you may ask. \n\nWell one conclusion is simply that now the market will price this in. Meaning it will make a lower low. It didn’t get time on Friday but it nearly left an impression that it will go and test that support region it made after the Swiss franc surprise hike by 50bps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Historical data for recession :** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Blue line : JHGDP \\( Gdp based recession indicator \\) , Orange line : Gdp yoy , Graph : SPX ](https://preview.redd.it/4cznen3s1l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=daab3a1305e03545f215b8c43d0f2afe695920e8)\n\nSo we established above that the market will make a lower low to price recession. But what does it mean to price ? \n\nIt means that markets will make a drop to -30%+ above by September. Don't forget we have discounted QT. But since i established earlier that this explanation is to a basic and intermediate audience therefore we won't dive into that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does this chart above tell us ?\n\nIt tells us that markets have priced out recession before the Gdp yoy growth fell to 0. The red circles below represent that. Meaning before final September Gdp data we might have bottomed providing if Gdp yoy doesn't fall more in Q3 or Q4 adv est data. ( Meaning if we do then make new LL in Gdp contraction and hence more price dropping ) \n\nThe only two circumstance it didn’t was Stagflation of 70’s and 2008 recession. But why must the question be in your mind? The answer is pretty much simple. The Gdp yoy fell even more afterwards. So unless there was a proper bottom for Gdp the markets didn’t stop making lower lows.\n\nNow there is an anomaly represented by a yellow circle. It’s called the dotcom recession where the Gdp fell dramatically by earnings recession. Though the Orange line i.e our yoy Gdp never fell below 0 but there was a recession. Quite strange perhaps but we will fit this in our recession pricing going forward cause we are doing a simple analysis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now let's take all the recession into account.\n\nNote : % = ( ( L - H ) / H ) \\* 100 where L = low , H = high of candles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll data is in monthly charts because I'm not that free. Also I'm not using Dow Jones which I should but I'm not. But I should. Damn it's happening again. 400 Bad request.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1970-71 recession ( red circle no 1 )\n\nS&P 500 - H : $109.37 ( Dec 1968 ) , L : $68.61 ( May 1970 ) , Crash : -37.267%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1974-75 recession  ( green circle no 1 )\n\nS&P 500 - H : $121.74 ( Jan 1973 ) , L : $60.96 ( Oct 1974 ) , Crash : -49.926%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1980’s recession ( red circle no 2 )\n\nS&P 500 - H : $120.22 ( Feb 1980 ) , L : $94.23 ( Mar 1980 ) , Crash : -21.618%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1981-82 recession ( red circle no 3 )\n\nS&P 500 - H : $141.96 ( Nov 1980 ) , L : $102.20 ( Aug 1982 ) , Crash : -28.007%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1990’s-91 recession ( red circle no 4 )\n\nS&P 500 - H : $369.78 ( Jul 1990 ) , L : $294.51 ( Oct 1990 ) , Crash : -20.355%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 2001 dot com recession ( yellow circle.

Sorry guys it's getting long and boring but honestly this is my way of doing things manually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now let’s deep dive into the Key events :**\n\nThere are only three events we need to watch for. \n\n* Inflation i.e Consumer Price Index\n* Fed Fomc\n* Gdp advanced estimates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : Gdp comes in groups of three. Adv, second and final. Second and final will be released in August and September respectively. Usually they are all the same but this inflation swindler can f things up if it persists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Aladdin Software xD](https://preview.redd.it/tzazplxq4l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7aa658cc3d6d66fa077541574c2dc0c9b755bae)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut before we do that let me quickly go and grab someone’s computer in Black rock. For those who don’t know that I'm a toilet cleaner at Black rock. xD Running joke it is or is it not ;)  \n\nOkay I'm logging in guys and I'm opening this “Aladdin'' management software. So here’s basically what it does in a three factor world.\n\nWe will be distributing points from now. As we all know data is either a hit or miss. A miss can be a miss to higher or lower. A hit is exactly as the estimates say meaning they are already priced in by the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here is how the point distribution system will work.\n\nA miss to lower : +1\n\nA hit : 0\n\nA miss to higher : -1 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : In case anyone wants this full software for their company or for individual purposes just give $5M dollar to Jamie Dimon. He will get it installed for you right away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet’s now head back to our events\n\n**Inflation : July 13th 2022**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cpi](https://preview.redd.it/4yqys1d35l991.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=15ee7bfeff4c055ef0177a961ab8c11c61f6e526)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm expecting it to come around est. 8.4% or is it 8.2% Just do check guys it's wrong in this photograph.\n\nAnd do remember if less then  +1\n\nIf higher then  -1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fed Fomc : July 26-27th 2022**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fed monitor](https://preview.redd.it/onqmbme85l991.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=34a68c31fc0fdfa284b2f0826984e2cb01fb2152)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf 100 bps we fall : -1\n\nIf 75 bps sideways : 0. This is being projected by Fed monitor\n\nIf 50 bps we rally : +1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gross Domestic Product : July 28th 2022**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGdp miss to higher : -1\n\nGdp hit estimates : 0 Currently markets have not priced Gdp estimates i.e. full definition of recession. We will discuss later how much it has priced. \n\nGdp miss to lower : +1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf market are forward looking they will price everything before September. Meaning markets will price somewhere b/w -20.34% to -49.93% if there is no banking crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What has been priced for recession :**\n\nCurrently ( as of 4th July 2022 )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS&P 500 - H : $4818.62 ( 4th Jan 2022 ) , L : $3636.87 ( 17th June 2022 : This number looks very funny i’m starting to doubt myself xD ) \n\nCrash calculation : -24.524%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n% of recession priced in by markets  = ( x% ( currently ) / historical recession low ) x 100 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest case pure recession : Historical recession low = -20.34%\n\nProbability % = 100% already priced in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Everyone is looking at it)\\*\\* Average case pure recession : Historical recession low = -37.505%\n\nProbability % = (24.524/37.505) x 100 = 65.3886% \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Me) Worst case pure recession : Historical recession low = -49.93%\n\nHence probability % = 49% something. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat this tells us is that markets are pricing in kinda worst case recession around 50%. As it should because we got one negative quarter of Gdp.\n\nSo if we get another negative quarter in July 28, then the market will start pricing another 50% if worst case recession till September final estimates for Q2. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now comes two scenarios :**\n\nCase a)\n\nWhat if i’m wrong again? And market just prices full on recession in July itself and then we start moving up. Then market will just drop -50% from Ath in July itself. You should be just buying puts of 1 month expiry July 28 or later.  If you think that the case is. \n\nCase b)\n\nAnd if you still trust me and kinda liked my analysis until now. Here’s what the market will do exactly and kinda dance on my whim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Two : 15&#37; bear market rally , One : 23&#37;+ bear market rally. Dates are given in chart](https://preview.redd.it/muij34ds7l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=05ed6ab65db8fdb86910b0103328f8497a77007b)\n\n[This is worst case recession probabilities.](https://preview.redd.it/mebvh5ds7l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c7a3b03f907135394d5ab6a4e5f5eabbc434b4a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou shouldn’t do anything until September if you can't comprehend what the chart is showing you above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat this is basically telling you is there is gonna be a two 15% rally starting July (one around Cpi and other around Gdp) and one 26% rally in August. Around September Fomc is where you will get your bottom and then the market might have priced in probability % of 99% by then of worst case recession. So that takes S&P500 to $2400-$2600 range. \n\nExact number would be $245X . Now this X is something i don't know. So range is $2450-$2460.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could be wrong here and i really need to just quit posting sh9t. Or markets starts pricing in things after july 28 and hence eventual bottom will then be a day before September Fomc just like it was for June Fomc bottom and things started pricing in after April Gdp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : Current levels as of now are higher than bear market tops will be. So don't forget to sell everything if swinging and trusting this case b).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Beta calculations :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor this i will take just Nasdaq. You guys can calculate beta for your own stocks in a similar manner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Beta](https://preview.redd.it/7krhxcwi8l991.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=71ea74a58656625253601510fd7fbe9f25f7d567)\n\nHere is how it goes.\n\nWe know that NDX/SPY = 1.29 or sometimes 1.30. So providing if beta remains constant then if price of SPY moves down by -24.524% then the Nasdaq must have made low’s higher than beta multiply SPY downfall i.e. NDX drop > 24.524% x 1.29 = 31.63%.\n\nHence NDX fall > 31.63% which actually was 34%. So not exactly close but definitely higher than 31% assumed. Here are pictures down below to prove it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY, NDX](https://preview.redd.it/ok1226fn8l991.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9025a5d3753695a3d3c8dafa80997b3b9944791a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow to use this knowledge ?\n\nWell if we assume SPX will fall around 49% then NDX will fall 49% x 1.29 = 63.91% roughly 64% by september. Since the NDX fall won't be exactly 64% but higher and if i roughly wanna assume what that number will be in case i’m betting this on a casino table of billionaires or millionaires then i would i bet NDX fall by roughly 69% something for sure. xD \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other way we can interpret beta is with volatility\n\n.\n\n* A stock with beta greater than 1 tends to be more volatile whereas stock with beta less than 1 tends to be slow.\n* It can also be used to measure volatility of stock against its sector.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : Volatility and beta are not the same thing. Also V asset class especially V king have beta higher than 1.67 so for them above 83% drop is coming.\n\nVolatility Example: if a stock such as Microsoft has an annual volatility of 40%, then it would be expected to move up or down 40% in price on an annual basis.\n\nBeta Example: if a stock such as Microsoft has a beta 1.26 in relation to the S&P 500 Index ( SPX ), it would be expected to move at a rate of 126% of the fluctuation of the SPX. (This beta is calculated over a period of months and does not necessarily hold true on a daily basis.) The higher the beta, the more volatile the stock. A beta of less than one indicates that the stock's price is more stable than the market (in general and over a long time period).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Invalidation : Here’s why i could be wrong. Case a)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNew York Fed forecasted in March (read above sheet of Nyc. march 0.9) that Gdp will be positive. So the market being a voting machine in near term didn’t price anything until we got close to that April advanced Gdp estimates which signaled start pricing in recession and till final estimate Gdp month we completed a worst case 50% probability recession. \n\nBut this time around the Atlanta and New york Fed has forecasted a recession already. So maybe it’s time to increase from 50% to almost 99% in July itself. And after that we go up. \n\nTbh, this sounds stupid. Markets will die, banks will get broke and all our friends in Apple, Google Microsoft, Facebook except Tesla ( they are prepared ) will be crying because of huge layoffs. Because then it could signal a depression is coming and this 50% drop is just nothing as compared to -89% Dow Jones drop. Plus Fed is still buying Mbs and selling so low bonds. Man the bank reserves are just not there i guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\nIf total pts >= 1 :  We are going straight up after July Gdp estimates. Not directly the day after.\n\nif total pts 0 :       We bear market rally like told above in graph\n\nif total pts <= -1  : Bear market rallies will be tough and not that higher. Don’t bet on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Result :**\n\nCase 1 : ( Highly unlikely )\n\nJuly destruction : Price -50% right here right now by July 28 and open the doors for depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase 2 : ( Most likely )\n\nCalm selloff : Two 15% rally and one 23%+ rally in august. On 20th September a day before Fomc we bottom. ( because last time it was on the day. Swiss franc was an exception won't count. And in march it was a day before too ) After that we shall see. Also we make a lower low from here now to July 28 because Gdp estimates aren’t priced by markets. \n\nI like my odds with case 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase 3 : So where did this come from. Well it's from my tweet. As I must have said on the latest tweet by institutional level analysis. $2800 - $3200 is the true range for recession because below this institutions believe financial system will struggle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReasons why number $2800 and $3200 :\n\n200wMA was the last time SPX bounced from and it could go a little lower due to QT. Hence this number is on everyone's lips nowadays and you must have heard on news many times.\n\nThe $2800 number is pretty easy. It’s the average recession drop number around 37-38% that we calculated above. For Michael Burry this is the number coming and after this Fed will start QE again. Let’s see if he right. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Closing thoughts :**\n\nThat’s all I have to say guys. I think i didn't do a great job explaining as i'm busy doing other things. You guys can perhaps improve the model better. My twitter post is kinda weird. It's based on institutional levels sh9t. Meaning think of it as someone sitting in Morgan Stanley or JP Morgan are doing things. \n\nI just try to give my original content only here for guys because I believe in the future of this platform. I just enjoy posting stuff here and trynna help people not necessarily with trading but just giving out some theories with unique kinds of analysis mostly macro. ( This is the last time I'm swinging. It’s tough when markets do jump from where we expect but just sell off like i just threw my money to a black hole in outer space ) Something you may not see in any youtube channel or stock trading courses. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith lots of love.\n\nA Happy 4th of July once again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you\n\nRegards \n\nUchiha\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[In case someone doesn't know : Chicken genius is back.

Economic output fell in the first quarter and signs suggest it did so again in the second. Yet the job market showed little sign of faltering during the first half of the year. The jobless rate fell from 4% last December to 3.6% in May.\n\nIt is the latest strange twist in the odd trajectory of the pandemic economy, and a riddle for those contemplating a recession. If the U.S. is in or near one, it doesn’t yet look like any other on record.\n\nAnalysts sometimes talked about “jobless recoveries” after past recessions, in which economic output rose but employers kept shedding workers. The first half of 2022 was the mirror image—a “jobful” downturn, in which output fell and companies kept hiring. Whether it will spiral into a fuller and deeper recession isn’t known, though a growing number of economists believe it will.", "id": "vrel2e", "created_utc": 1656961076.0, "score": 481, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 439, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|80|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|147|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vas0sp/why_i_simply_dont_ever_want_to_touch_netflix_stock/) [x](https://i.redd.it/r7gqtrjv79591.png) \n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vrel2e)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vrel2e)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I have the answer.

I've seen it up close. My family is in an area experiencing this. These freshly retired boomers from the northeast are coming in, flushed with cash, snatching up homes left & right.
