While almost all major component indexes increased over the month, the largest contributors were the indexes for shelter, used cars and trucks, medical care, motor vehicle insurance, and new vehicles. The indexes for motor vehicle repair, apparel, household furnishings and operations, and recreation also increased in June. Among the few major component indexes to decline in June were lodging away from home and airline fares.\n\n**The all items index increased 9.1 percent for the 12 months ending June, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending November 1981.** The all items less food and energy index rose 5.9 percent over the last 12 months.

Fed rate hikes can’t do anything meaningful about this.  \n* Trump & Biden era Trade war semiconductor & technology bans disrupt access to adequate supply of chips that go into just about everything nowadays, halting production or driving up prices. Fed rate hikes can’t fix that.  \n* Intentional trade war-related supply chain disruptions like the above along with unplanned supply chain disruptions from the pandemic combine to drive up prices, lower supplies of goods and create scarcity even when supplies exist. Failure of the US leadership to address its numerous supply chain (port, transport & logistics) incompetencies & labor shortages makes this an ongoing, chronic problem, How can Fed rate hikes fix transport issues? (They can’t). The recent bill Biden signed to investigate/harass foreign owned marine shipping rates, is absurdly inadequate as a way to address transport & distribution relate supply chain problems. Fed rate hikes can’t fix those.  \n* Decades of growing energy consumption coupled with ESG-motivated underinvestment in oil, gas & coal production despite by a big energy sector decline during the pandemic that the US did little/nothing to alleviate means that we have a years-long, chronic supply side energy crunch. The US gov, including Biden, is doing everything in its power to temporarily drive down gas & diesel & jet fuel prices before Nov 2022 midterm elections, but they can’t fix the energy supply shortage on a long term basis. The unreliable & inconsistent energy price environment means the benefits of a strengthening dollar from the Fed rate hikes won’t impact energy prices long term in a meaningful way.  \n* The sanctions vs Russia, along with some war-related supply chain disruptions from Ukraine caused by the Russian invasion/war, creates a whole other level of nightmarish inflation, mostly in commodity-importing countries in Asia, the Middle East & the Southern Hemisphere. Because these sanctions are voluntarily imposed on the entire world by NATO, countries that are not NATO-aligned are imposing export bans and tariffs to protect their national supplies of commodities and some export production goods. So the NATO-vs-Russia sanctions/trade war is causing a whole other level of indirect inflationary trade disruptions. Fed rate hikes aren’t going to do anything about that.  \n* The US has always relied on immigration as an abundant, cheap, reliable source of growth. Since immigrants have started to become too brown in recent decades, the barriers to immigration of skilled trade and unskilled labor have risen. We are currently chronically starved for blue collar labor, making production & supply chains in the US very expensive and scarce. Either the US has to reopen the floodgates to immigrants or it has to transform its economy to be more like Europe’s where the blue collar working class is less insecure re: health care, food, job & financial if it wants a mostly-white-people blue collar working class to work skilled trades in sufficient numbers, and doing so is very inflationary. The Fed rate hikes can’t fix poor labor conditions that repel working class whites or open up immigration to more brown people, and so the Fed can’t fix our labor shortages.  \n* China is hunkering down under its COVID-Zero policies while ever evolving, more-communicable strains of COVID are making its internal eradication efforts more and more futile. Whatever back-tracking on Xi’s core vanity policies might occur, they will likely not occur until after the 2022 CCP congress that determines whether Xi wikl serve a 3rd term or not. So China’s COVID-Zero policy is less likely to change before November than after November, if it changes at all. We are dependent enough on China’s production that we experience inflation/recession along with China’s lockdowns.\n\nThose are just the big, headline issues driving inflation today. There are many other ways in which government have been creating inflation, basically out of thin air. IMO, Biden lacks the political capital & motivation to address anything on that list. Probably the easiest thing for him to do is lift all of the Trump-era tariffs on Chinese imports, which would immediately drop core inflation by probably more than 1%, but he’s far too weak to deal with any “pro-China” accusations & attacks from the right. He basically has to hunker down in all the most populist status quo positions on every issue, and even if he does that, Democrats will probably still get creamed in November mid-term elections. Republicans have no inventive or desire to step in, cooperate and/or force-change anything for the better when economic discontent rises under Democratically led white house, house & senate. So these government policy caused factors of inflation have no plausible political path to reversal.\n\nWhat we are experiencing is political/geopolitical inflation that is mostly caused by active policies of both authoritarian & populist democratic governments.

Multiple governments doing something stupid does absolve individual governments.  \n\n\nAs far as inflation in the US, the Fed prints money... ok, then what? Creating digital money by adding a bunch of zeros to an account at the Fed doesn't really do anything. The Fed has to get that money into circulation for it to \"matter\". How do they do that? They use the created money to buy assets. They can buy MBSs and keep interest rates artificially low (thereby creating massive asset bubbles). They can also buy treasuries, which they've been doing in record amounts ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FDHBFRBN](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FDHBFRBN)). That enables the government to spend money it wouldn't otherwise have, which they've also been doing in record amounts ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYONGDA188S](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYONGDA188S)).

But by claiming victories for these policies he also deserves the blame. When the Fed prints money to buy treasuries to cover government spending it can't afford it is potentially inflationary. And just as other asset bubbles pop the government spending chicken is about to come home to roost. We have two options going forward: the Fed continues to tighten which forces gov't borrowing costs up which will force some really really hard conversations about priorities or the Fed relents and we eat inflation until debt to GDP ratios come back to earth. The latter is essentially imposing an inflation tax on everyone to pay for all the promises the government has made (including Biden). The former would require politicians to be honest with people and say difficult things so the latter is what will actually happen. So yeah, I think Biden is at least partially to blame.
