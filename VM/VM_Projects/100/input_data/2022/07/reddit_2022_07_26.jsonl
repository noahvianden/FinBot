Do you agree?", "selftext": " President Joe Biden and White House officials are continuing to downplay recession fears, even as they brace for a highly anticipated report that could show the economy shrinking for a second consecutive quarter.\n\n\"We're not going to be in a recession, in my view,\" Biden told reporters on Monday. \"The employment rate is still one of the lowest we've had in history. It's in the 3.6 (percent) area. We still find ourselves, the people, investing.\"\n\n\"My hope is we go from this rapid growth to a steady growth. And so, we'll see some coming down. But I don't think we're going to -- God willing -- I don't think we're going to see a recession,\" he continued.\n\nWhile there is no steadfast rule governing what defines a recession in the United States, it is commonly understood to be two consecutive quarters of the country's gross domestic product -- or GDP -- shrinking. But a small group of economists on the Business Cycle Dating Committee officially define when the US economy is in a recession, and they define a recession as involving \"a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\"\n\nThe US is expecting a number of key economic reports this week aside from the second quarter GDP numbers coming Thursday, including Tuesday's consumer confidence survey and Friday's Personal Consumption Expenditure index. The Federal Reserve also meets on Wednesday to discuss interest rates.\n\nTop Biden administration officials continue to insist the economy is not in recession amid widespread inflation.\n\nSource: [https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/25/politics/white-house-recession-worries/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/25/politics/white-house-recession-worries/index.html)\n\n**President Joe Biden says ‚Äòwe‚Äôre not going to be in a recession, in my view‚Äô.**\n\n**Do you agree?**", "id": "w8kgrt", "created_utc": 1658843818.0, "score": 449, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 593, "comments": [{"body": "What is the definition of a recession ?", "score": 355, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 202, "replies": [{"body": "A recession is something that identifies as a recession.", "score": 163, "replies": [{"body": "Don‚Äôt assume my cession", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Such a reeee", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I‚Äôm not a geologist but this might be correct", "score": 31, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wrong.

{"title": "Big Tech earnings are about to determine the direction of the market", "selftext": "Just five companies control nearly a quarter of the S&P 500 index‚Äôs market cap, and they will all report earnings this week that could determine the direction of the market for weeks or months to come.\n\nAs Big Tech ‚Äî Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.36% GOOG, -0.14%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.05%, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.74%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, -1.55% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.59% ‚Äî prepares to report, there are serious doubts about their near future for the first time. All five have signaled that they are cutting costs or plan to soon, as MarketWatch‚Äôs Jon Swartz reported.\n\nAmazon ripped off the Band-Aid three months ago, and it looks like some of its Big Tech cohorts may look to do the same in this earnings season. Apple has reportedly planned cost cuts for next year, while Microsoft is closing down open positions and making small layoffs. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees on the last day of the second quarter that they face one of the ‚Äúworst downturns that we‚Äôve seen in recent history,‚Äù and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai warned employees of slowing hiring just a few days after the quarter close. Results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP, -0.10% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.51% show concerns about the digital-advertising business are founded. Even an early warning from Microsoft about its earnings and the knowledge that Amazon is already cutting costs may not be enough to truly prepare Wall Street for what may be coming. One area that could cause a major ripple is a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, as Therese Poletti opined, with one analyst telling her that ‚Äúpeople are going to freak out.‚Äù\n\nAny big moves for those five companies would have major ripple effects in the market. Collectively worth roughly $7.5 trillion despite the declines that have already struck this year, the five companies make up about 23% of the total market cap of the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.13%, according to the Dow Jones Market Data Group. The group‚Äôs earnings and revenue have buffeted the entire market in recent years, as the COVID-19 pandemic juiced their balance sheets. Collectively, the quintet produced profit surpassing $320 billion last year, with sales topping $1.4 trillion, which would rank 13th in gross domestic product as a nation, just behind Brazil and ahead of Australia, according to World Bank figures.\n\nThis year is going to be a tough comparison to that performance, especially after Amazon reported a loss of nearly $4 billion in the first quarter. And cost-cutting from those companies will have an effect on the larger tech economy. The true concern in Silicon Valley and Wall Street is that a domino effect happens ‚Äî Big Tech cuts costs, hurting smaller tech companies that rely on them, who in turn go under or at least cut back on costs such as cloud computing, cloud software, hardware and more, causing more pain throughout the industry.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-earnings-are-about-to-determine-the-direction-of-the-market-11658769593?mod=newsviewer\\_click](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-earnings-are-about-to-determine-the-direction-of-the-market-11658769593?mod=newsviewer_click)", "id": "w8eg5o", "created_utc": 1658824803.0, "score": 485, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 131, "comments": [{"body": "It's going to be a helluva a week.", "score": 272, "replies": [{"body": "Yes it is, Walmart already tanked yesterday in after hours so that doesn't bode well...\n\nStrap in gents the ride has just begun.\n\nSo will they still carry on with redefining what a recession is when everything comes out?", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "costco at a 40 P/E isn't very low the rest are just starting to have the pain of inflation, rising interest rates and reduce household disposable income which we just saw disclosed by walmart - we still likely have two more down legs to go could be three or four thou.

Trillion dollar market caps, they will continue to have stable income if nothing other than a luxury brand. \n\nMeta - I can see people being iffy on them. Personally, I don't invest in any social media because the nature of the game is they are only as valuable as they are trendy, and trends come and go. \n\nSo yeah, like with everything some companies will never recover after basing their entire evaluation on potential.

{"title": "The case for a FED pivot and a big rally", "selftext": "After the worst first half of the year for the S&P500 since 1970, it is not surprising that the overall bearish sentiment is at very elevated levels right now. This is something that can be seen in various data points. For example, asset manager positioning in ALL equity futures (% OI) is currently at 2.08%. To put that into some context, this was 5.07% in March 2020, 3.11% in 2016 and 2.85% at the end of 2011, making the current matric a new record low over the past decade. There are also signs of capitulation in the broad equities market, with the percentage of companies trading below cash and short term investments reaching nearly 12%. Again, for some context, this number only briefly exceeded 10% at the bottoms in 2002 and 2008. Lastly, the corporate insider buy/sell ratio is indicating that insiders are once again on the buy side. On a historical basis, they have usually been on the right side of the trade. Does this all mean the bottom is in? No it does not, but in my view we are close to one when looking at these data points, especially if we see reversal in monetary policy by the FED soon.\n\nNow I know some of you may be wondering what this has to do with the FED pivoting, as they have shown that they are not really bothered by the broad equities market correcting in the manner that it has done. After all, what they are concerned about is getting inflation down to more sustainable levels. Allow me to put a pin in that ‚Äòfight against inflation‚Äô for a moment and concentrate on something that monetary policy does care about, which is the economy. Let‚Äôs start off with everyone‚Äôs favorite subject, taxes. We are seeing tax receipts come in lower on the back of these rate hikes and an economy that is slamming the proverbial brakes. This was also covered by Bloomberg recently, who noted that June‚Äôs estimated payments, which are closely tied to capital-gains realizations, were 31% lower than the same period last year. With tax receipts going down and likely continuing the slide if we don‚Äôt see a turnaround in monetary policy, budget deficits are poised to go up and US entitlement spending is poised to consume approximately 90% of these US tax receipts, which is wholly unsustainable.\n\nAnother reason why the FED is on the cusp of either breaking the economy or breaking their rate hike policy, with my view being that the latter is far more likely, is that the treasury market is slowly breaking. With debt to GDP at around 130% in the US, a major rise in yields and the breaking of the treasury market is a sure fire way to put a bullet in the financial system, something that I believe is not on the cards. They can rectify this by pausing their rate hikes, cutting inflation loose to inflate debt to GDP down towards the high double digit level, start a new QE program to halt the cracks in the economy and implement yield curve control as the final piece of the pivot puzzle.\n\nIn my view, seeing the speed at which this is unfolding, I believe that we will see a pivot by the FED and the beginning of the aforementioned monetary policy roadmap before the end of Q4. What they would need to start this however, is something to justify it. Call it an excuse or rather a justification for changing said monetary policy. This would likely have to come in the form of lower inflation numbers, as that has been the most important driver vis a vis the current rate hiking cycle. I think that this is exactly what they are poised to receive very soon, so let‚Äôs take the pin out of this subject and address it. Why do I think that after we just had the highest inflation print in some years? Because inflation metrics that are looking ahead, such as 1-year inflation swaps and port data are pointing to slowing inflation and that will give the FED the excuse it needs to get back to said renewed QE. Various commodities are also down over the past few weeks and months, with two examples being copper (down from $4.82 to $3.41) and oil (down from $113.39 to $98.43). With inflation slowing down, QE is the most likely path going forward to support the economy, even if it means cutting the inflation loose and letting it go up for the coming 12-24 months to bring down debt to GDP as I mentioned earlier. Before that happens however, we are still looking at a strong US Dollar, as well as continued volatility and downside risk across the markets between now and the decision to stop hiking, which I again think will come before the end of this quarter.\n\nWhat will benefit from this taking place? Asset classes across the board, with the broad equities market resuming an upward trajectory and commodities (such as copper) and energy (such as uranium and oil) performing exceptionally well as those embark on the second leg of their respective bull markets. One asset class that I want to touch upon briefly in particular, gold and silver, is poised to outperform in a QE and YCC environment after being in a correction for nearly 2 years now. Sentiment is scraping the bottom of the barrel for this asset class and from a TA point of view they are at historical support levels. There are various ways to play this, whether it be via an index tracking the actual metal, royalty companies or the miners themselves, but that is of course all dependent upon your own portfolio goals and risk tolerance.\n\nI hope that this post has proven to be informative and the coming months will likely be as volatile as they will be eventful.

There are multiple instances of screwing retailers and suppliers. One person that I know whose products became ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs choice‚Äù said that they applied\nmassive pressure on him to ramp up orders, which he did but then shortly after they wanted to pay lower prices for those agreed orders. He said he can‚Äôt as hell literally go in the negative on them and they ‚Äúpaused‚Äù all business with him. They thought they were going to be able to pressure him to fold but they didn‚Äôt know Amazon only accounted for 10% of his business and he‚Äôs also a lawyer was happy to hold them to the contracts. They eventually paid up but to this day still continue to pull bullshit.\n\nSecondly, they have literally put people and whole companies out of business by decided not to sell at below cost, to take a loss until their competitors go bankrupt. They did it to diapers.com who were the largest and a privately owned company, but they couldn‚Äôt compete when Amazon were selling below wholesale price. As soon as diapers.com went under, Amazon jacked the prices back to retail and owned the market.\n\nThirdly, got a warranty problem with a product and it‚Äôs outside of the returns period? Lol. The manufacturers often won‚Äôt help you and the call center in India that does customer support can‚Äôt ever help. They‚Äôre breaking all sorts of warranty laws especially with products that are no name brands where Amazon should really honor the warranty but don‚Äôt.\n\nFourth, the reviews are a complete scam, Amazon knows it allows it. They don‚Äôt care and a common scam is to sell a product for cheap to get good reviews then use that same listing but edit it to a completely different product to retain the positive reviews. They also allow payola I.e. leave us a 5 star review and get a second product for free (the supplements section is rife with this).\n\nFifth, they‚Äôre not just ignoring counterfeit goods but actively promoting them. Certain cosmetics and electronics are straight up counterfeit goods and even when reviews have been posted showing the fake items (like side by side comparisons) amazing don‚Äôt do anything. I even know one instance where a company ordered the kickoff, told amazin who did nothing and it was only when they filed in court (costing them serious legal fees) did Amazon eventually remove the product.\n\nThey then fuck their workers, are anti union and anti small business.\n\nIn short: they‚Äôre trash as a company.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Doesn't sound like anything different than other retailers would do.

People here, such as myself, enjoy pointing out GM because they were presented as the 'leader' of the EV movement by Joe Biden. That's all there is to it. This is just banter more than anything else. Everyone here has already looked past GM and Ford. Very rarely do any of us mention BMW or Benz. Not because we dislike them but because we quite frankly don't see GM as a viable auto company. It has more to do with GM than BMW or Benz.\n\nSo it seems that because you don't like the results of GM vs Tesla, you want Tesla to be matched up against Benz or GM.\n\n1. Outside of Benz, Tesla is just slightly below them in terms of profit per vehicle sold for year 2021. They will surpass them this year. Third is BMW.\n2. I see you want to use operating margins. So that penalizes a company like Tesla from a financial reporting standpoint. Why? Because Tesla shares skyrocketed, which means operating expenses increased throughout that period. Also, R&D is a huge cost in operating expenses for Tesla for obvious reasons (EV innovation requires more spending than a mature ICE industry). So it's obvious from this standpoint that efficiency of creating the product, such as gross profit, is a more reliable measure as to the efficiency of the product.\n3. [https://stockdividendscreener.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tesla-operating-expenses-to-total-revenue-ratio-ttm.jpg](https://stockdividendscreener.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tesla-operating-expenses-to-total-revenue-ratio-ttm.jpg)The above chart shows that Tesla's operating expense as a % of revenue decreases as Tesla scales. Right now, Tesla is still at its infancy stage of scaling... Thus, operating expenses are going to affect a company, such as Tesla, in its growth stage more than it will affect a mature company such as Benz, Ford, GM, BMW, etc., Gross profit is a far more reliable measure because it is bare bones efficiency.\n4. Look, no one disagrees about BMW and Benz's margins. They're great. But what will their future be in ten years when they lag around and don't push EV vehicles out? What are their margins going to be when they go EV? Right now, there are EV leaders such as BYD, NIO, Geely, XPENG, LiAuto, etc., that will enter every auto market in the world because EV is the future of auto. They want the entire AUTO market share - not just EV. So what is BMW and Benz's projectory looking like? Hint: Not good. They are lagging behind with European labor and auto unions focused on ICE vehicles.\n5. You keep saying GM doesn't compete in the same market as Tesla. Yeah, because they can't. No one wants to pay $60k for a random GM vehicle. They do, however, want to pay $60-70k for a Tesla vehicle. And that is precisely the point: Tesla is able to record industry-leading gross margins for EV's when these other auto companies can't do that with ICE but some have been around for centuries.\n6. It seems you are so stuck on ICE. You know what sucks for these ICE companies? For every EV they sell, they are hurting their bottom line. That is why they are and have been dragging their feet. Imagine telling investors, some who strictly care about profit and won't be around to manage the company by the time EV's come to haunt them, that you have to spend billions to sell EV's at a loss. Good luck with that. ICE will be dead in the future. Any company still selling ICE want to be in Tesla's position. Why? Because Tesla's future is the brightest in this transition to EV's. No one comes close. If you believe so, now is your chance to present your case. But if all you can come up with is, \"But look at Benz's and BMW's margins for luxury ICE vehicles\", you've already failed to look at the bigger picture.\n7. Worth noting... Tesla will be the most profitable automaker in the U.S. by the end of this year. By 2025, they will be the most profitable auto company. This is a company that started mass scaling in 2018 (potential bankruptcy year) and seven years later, will be more profitable than auto companies that have existed for nearly a century.\n\nI'm not here to disparage Benz and BMW. But they are not in Tesla's league. The margins you are quoting is including the fact Tesla outspends them, as a % of revenue, in R&D because they are ramping up operations as well as including a shitload of money for stock-based compensation that has to be expensed in their SGA. The simple fact is, Tesla, at its infancy, is outperforming century old companies at their maturity. Here's your chance: Disprove what I wrote.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
