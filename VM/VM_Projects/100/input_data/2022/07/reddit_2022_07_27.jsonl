His research indicates that the Fed may need to hike rates to levels not seen in decades to force rising prices into retreat.\n\n\"If inflation is going to be high and remain higher, that means that the neutral rate in the economy is also going to be higher because the price of goods are going up,\" he said to CNBC.\n\nA June survey of inflation expectations from the New York Federal Reserve suggests the price hikes aren't over yet. The group predicts that by June 2023, prices will have risen approximately 6.8% from their current levels.\n\nMaintaining stable prices and maximizing employment are the Fed's top responsibilities. Jobs appear plentiful in the U.S., which may give the central bank cover to raise interest rates at an aggressive pace through 2023.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was contacted for comment but is in a media blackout before the expected rate announcement later today.", "id": "w9eymy", "created_utc": 1658928919.0, "score": 1835, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 530, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "Fed hikes interest rates by 0.75 percentage point for second consecutive time to fight inflation", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/fed-decision-july-2022-.html\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday enacted its second consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate increase as it seeks to tamp down runaway inflation without creating a recession.\n\nIn taking the benchmark overnight borrowing rate up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%, the moves in June and July represent the most stringent consecutive moves since the Fed began using the overnight funds rate as the principal tool of monetary policy in the early 1990s.\n\nWhile the fed funds rate most directly impacts what banks charge each other for short-term loans, it feeds into a multitude of consumer products such as adjustable mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The increase takes the funds rate to its highest level since December 2018.\n\nMarkets largely expected the move after Fed officials telegraphed the increase in a series of statements since the June meeting. Central bankers have emphasized the importance of bringing down inflation even if it means slowing the economy.\n\nIn its post-meeting statement, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cautioned that “recent indicators of spending and production have softened.”\n\n“Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,” the committee added, using language similar to the June statement. Officials against described inflation as “elevated” and ascribed the situation to supply chain issues and higher prices for food and energy along with “broader price pressures.“\n\nThe rate hike was approved unanimously. In June, Kansas City Fed President Esther George dissented, advocating a slower course with a half percentage point increase.\n\nThe increases come in a year that began with rates floating around zero but which has seen a commonly cited inflation measure run at 9.1% annually. The Fed aims for inflation around 2%, though it adjusted that goal in 2020 to allow it to run a bit hotter in the interest of full and inclusive employment.\n\nIn June, the unemployment rate held at 3.6%, close to full employment. But inflation, even by the Fed’s standard of core personal consumption expenditures, which was at 4.7% in May, is well off target.\n\nThe efforts to bring down inflation are not without risks.\n\nThe U.S. economy is teetering on a recession as inflation slows consumer purchases and dents business activity.\n\nFirst-quarter GDP declined by 1.6% annualized, and markets were bracing for a reading on the second quarter to be released Thursday that could show consecutive declines, a widely used barometer for a recession. The Dow Jones estimate for Thursday’s reading is 0.3%.\n\nAlong with rate increases, the Fed is reducing the size of asset holdings on its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. Beginning, in June, the Fed began allowing some of the proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off.\n\nThe balance sheet has declined just $16 billion since the beginning of the roll-off, though the Fed set a cap of up to $47.5 billion that potentially could have been wound down. The cap will rise through the summer, eventually hitting $95 billion a month by September. The process is known in markets as “quantitative tightening” and is another mechanism the Fed uses to impact financial conditions.\n\nAlong with the accelerated balance sheet runoff, markets expect the Fed to raise rates at least another half percentage point in September. Traders Wednesday afternoon were assigning about a 53% chance the central bank would go even further, with a third straight 0.75 percentage point, or 75 basis points, increase in September, according to CME Group data.\n\nThe FOMC does not meet in August, instead gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for its annual retreat.\n\nMarkets expect the Fed to start cutting rates by next summer, even though committee projections released in June show now cuts until at least 2024.\n\nMultiple officials have said they expect to hike aggressively through September then assess what impact the moves were having on inflation. Despite the 1.5 percentage point increases between March and June, the June consumer price index reading was the highest since November 1981, with the rent index at its highest level since April 1986 and dental care costs hitting a record in a data series going back to 1995.\n\nThe central bank has faced critics, both for being too slow to tighten when inflation first started to accelerate in 2021, and for possibly going too far and causing a more severe economic downturn.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told CNBC on Wednesday that she worried the Fed hikes would pose economic danger to those at the lowest end of the economic spectrum by raising unemployment.", "id": "w9lks6", "created_utc": 1658945027.0, "score": 2499, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 506, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "Meta earnings are out – Here are the numbers", "selftext": "Meta reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results:\n\nEarnings: $2.46 per share vs. $2.59 per share, according to Refinitiv\nRevenue: $28.82 billion vs. $28.94 billion, according to Refinitiv\nMeta shares have lost about half their value since the beginning of the year, underscoring investor concern about the health of the company’s core online advertising business. That unit has been hurt by Apple’s iOS privacy update last year, limiting Meta’s ability to track users, and by a weakening economy that’s led some companies to slash their ad budgets.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report its first ever year-over-year revenue decline, with sales projected to slip 0.5%. While the rest of the year isn’t expected to be as bad as the second quarter, analysts are still forecasting tepid growth of 5.6% for 2022 for a company that’s never had annual growth shy of 20% in its 10 years as a public company.\n\nMeta could be the beneficiary of low expectations.\n\nLast week, Snap and Twitter reported disappointing second-quarter results, and executives cited economic and mobile platform challenges that have permeated the online ad market. The mood soured so much that shares of Alphabet and Microsoft rose on Wednesday even though both companies missed analysts’ estimates on the top and bottom lines.\n\nMicrosoft said “reductions in advertising spend” in the quarter resulted in more than a $100 million loss in its online ad business that powers products like LinkedIn and Bing search. At Alphabet, YouTube’s growth slowed to below 5% from a year earlier, and CFO Ruth Porat said advertisers are pulling back due to “uncertainty about a number of factors.”\n\nFor Meta, the story goes well beyond the economy.\n\nInstagram is coming under increased pressure from short video app TikTok. Meta has responded by pushing Instagram’s Reels feature, which algorithmically surfaces short videos to users.\n\nThat shift has come under scrutiny, including from celebrity sisters Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian, who criticized the app’s new direction this week. Instagram head Adam Mosseri indirectly responded by saying in a video shared on Twitter that Meta is working to improve the app. While photos will continue playing a major role, he said “more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time,” because of changing user habits that favor video.    \n\nMeanwhile, Meta continues to spend billions of dollars a quarter on the metaverse, a digital world that can be accessed via virtual reality and augmented reality devices. The company’s Reality Labs unit, which is developing the metaverse, lost $2.96 billion in the first quarter.\n\nEarlier this week, Meta raised the price of its Quest 2 VR headset by $100, citing rising production and shipping costs. Although Meta is currently the leader in selling VR headsets, that market is still tiny compared to mobile advertising.\n\nExecutives will discuss the results with analysts on a webcast starting at 5:00 p.m. ET.", "id": "w9olze", "created_utc": 1658952553.0, "score": 222, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 220, "comments": [{"body": "Not too bad imo.

{"title": "Market Not Making Sense, What’s Bullish?", "selftext": "I know the saying “markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent”, I have to say that’s never rang truer than this bear market but curious from a bull’s perspective - what is bullish? \n\nMany bulls are betting on a pivot toward the beginning of next year once a recession becomes evident. For two years it was constantly repeated to “not bet against the Fed” and now Bulls are doing exactly that. They have no clue if the Fed is going to back off at the end of this year, in fact Powell isn’t signaling he is going to at all. To me it appears they are just hoping they do. With the bond market holding at approximately 2.7%, the Fed only has to hike one more time and basically be done. I don’t foresee 2.7% to hold as further inflation readings come out. \n\nBut let’s say he does pivot - how does that benefit the economy? There’s no way the rate hikes that have been implemented are doing enough damage to inflation to suggest that QE would be a good idea next year. If they lowered rates only a year after starting, that would just further lead to a stagflationary environment where consumers will continue to be priced out of everything - leading to another inevitable inflationary recession or the prolonging of the one we are entering. It would be a bandaid on  a much bigger wound that needs adequate medicine - a hardcore high unemployment recession. \n\nWithout high unemployment inflation can not go down. It’s simply not possible. They need to push people out of work in order to conduct true demand destruction. We have started seeing hiring freezes and slight layoffs in certain companies, but nothing in terms of the magnitude to adequately conduct demand destruction. I firmly believe Powell won’t back off until he sees higher unemployment. He consistently repeats that the labor market is strong and is suggesting we aren’t going into a recession, so if that’s true how is that bullish? If anything he’s stating how strong things are and it gives him even more of a reason to hike. He reiterates the same thing over and over - we have a strong labor market. \n\nSo to me we get two options: either a Fed that hikes into a recession and high unemployment and he meets his goal of demand destruction to tackle inflation or he pivots and further contributes to higher inflation and leads to a recession anyway. I am a bull long term, but the current times mimic the depression. The roaring 20s were due to QE after the war (this time COVID), unchecked speculative investing and inflation, and a behind the curve Fed that started tightening into a recession.  Earnings also haven’t been looking great, with big companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta missing. Apple is up tomorrow as well and I anticipate a miss, especially after seeing Walmart’s atrocious miss.

There is no reason credit needs to be extracted from the economy as fast as it was applied. Even if you need to pay off these debts eventually, it could be at a slower rate than your growth rate, which merely stumps your future income stream a little *but still maintains growth over time.* This means no further decline, but reduced stock market returns for the time being, which still makes todays discount maybe the best opportunity.\n\n2. A lot of people have gotten pay rises to match with inflation which creates a fairly permanent increase in *nominal* disposable income. While real GDP is slumping, nominal GDP is growing at an astonishing pace ([link](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/united-states/nominal-gdp-growth#:~:text=United%20States%20Nominal%20GDP%20Growth%20was%20reported%20at%2010.657%20%25%20in,Mar%202022%2C%20with%20297%20observations.)) While the consumer is effectively \"paying more for less\", higher nominal corporate earnings warrant higher nominal equity prices.\n\n3.

This is good long term for the economy as it open up talented workers who no longer get rich off of free money equity in e.g., tech startups and money losing shitcos and can actually go do something useful. An increase in labor supply (yes more unemployment can be bullish) decreases the costs of hiring competitive workers and thus lowers production costs in the economy. This is a fine balance between point 3 and 2 because disposable income is very linked to labour costs globally. Some companies will thrive, others wont. Additionally, this can lead to further market dominance of already big players, which are usually heavily weighted in market indices and could push prices up even when the economy deteriorates.\n\n4. Like Ive already mentioned before, there is no reason for the FED to continue QT indefinitely. They don't need to shrink a lot, and they can shrink it passively. QE has been going on for 10 years and has never led to inflation before. They know this is a supply side issue but they must contract for public opinion (\"look, we're trying\"). As soon as inflation eases they will be able to continue business as usual, altho I surely do hope they continue contracting at a slow pace. \n\nI could obviously come up with just as many or more bear cases but thats the whole point.

It's actually a GOOD thing for the economy if we see more hikes to battle inflation. It's also bullish to see it done slowly over time, so that everyone has time to adjust (employers and banks).

In each case, the potential threats to US hegemony turn out to be short-lived, and serve to simply reinforce the existing order, for all its good and bad.\n\nAnd for all the pearl-clutching online, temporary gas shortages in Germany, Meta missing expected earnings by 5.02% or interest rates rising to the same level they were in 2019 are not going to flip the apple cart.\n\nI'm not saying the global economy will never change to that extent, in fact it's inevitable provided a long enough time frame, but if it's happening soon, shorting the stock market or diamond handing GME won't save you, a bunker full of gasoline, cans of beans and shotgun shells will.\n\nThis doesn't mean we won't have typical market cycles and fluctuations, such as the market having the worst start to the year since 1970 (side note: how anyone can claim there's been no pullback is a strange claim), simply that we are most likely not on the precipice of global economic meltdown.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Amen!

Ultimately, a prolonged rally like this becomes inevitable for repositioning to take place which will wipe out all the shorts and put us in a more bullish tone which will then allow for the next leg down which will actually be much more violent and it is there where we probably will finally see the VIX spike with unhedged panic selling and ultimate capitulation.

In that sense, it's a failing company. But is it likely to declare bankruptcy and become delisted from the market? Not really. Again, the company got $2 billion (with a \"b\") from apes and swing traders last year just by diluting its shares once. There's no reason GameStop can't keep doing that.\n\n>Right, both retail and swing traders somehow coordinate and know how low it’ll get before they all somehow pile in 💀 no no no wait a lot of them stay away because it’ll “stay single digits” but at the same time a lot of them somehow pump it at the same time?\n\nYet another example of the self-proclaimed most well-educated investor base in history having no financial literacy. No one's coordinating anything. If I see GME drop to $25, I start thinking that I might be able to buy in and make a decent profit if it eventually runs to $40 (which is pretty likely). Of course, I'll also be worried that GME might not run again, and that it might continue to drop well below $25. This is the thought process of me and countless other retail and institutional investors. How could it not be? And I don't have to coordinate at all with any of these other investors.\n\nSome of these investors with a thought process similar to mine will end up buying, and some won't. If enough buy, the price will turn around and go up. If it goes up enough, people like me will FOMO in. On the contrary, if not enough people buy at $25, the price will continue to drop, let's say to $20. Now, me and everyone like me will be going through the same thought process as before, but the risk/reward will be slightly different. Since the price is lower, I won't lose as much if the price continues to plummet. Moreover, if it runs to $40, I'll make even more buying at $20 than I would have buying at $25.\n\nBasically, the lower the price goes, the more likely people like me are to buy in. And again, I don't need to coordinate any of this with anyone. This isn't that complicated, my dude.\n\n>They also tell the brokers when to stop routing orders through the dark pool Im assuming right?\n\nWhat? Why would I or anyone like me care whether or not my orders are going through dark pools? Do you even know what happens when an order is routed through a dark pool? (Hint: it's not what most apes would have told you.)\n\n>you’re over here telling me that apes all know the lowest point and all pile in when it gets there to pump it?\n\nI thought you were financially illiterate, but now I think you might just be illiterate, because that's not at all what I told you. First, apes aren't the main group driving GME's price action. Second, no one knows where the lowest point is. Again, as the price drops, the risk of buying GME becomes lower, and the potential reward becomes higher. No one knows exactly when it will turn around, but if the risk becomes low enough and the reward becomes high enough, it will likely turn around eventually. And when it does, people will likely begin to FOMO in.\n\n>Just say you’re too much of a bitch to put your money where your big ass mouth is pussy.\n\nMy money is exactly where my mouth is. My mouth is saying, in no uncertain terms, that GME is not worth buying or shorting at this time. And my money is not buying or shorting GME at this time. So how am I not putting my money where my mouth is?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Bagholder spotted.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

GameStop is one of them.\n\n>That 2 billion is down to a billion. Weren’t you meltdowners claiming it’s burning through cash quick\n\nOf course it's burning through the cash quickly. GameStop's own financial statement show that it lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year, hence its $2 billion going down to $1 billion. But if you weren't completely financially illiterate, you would know that major corporations don't just disappear when they run out of cash.

It certainly doesn't suggest that everyone will buy at the same time at the lowest point 😂\n\n>even though their buys don’t affect the price since they get sent through the dark pool.\n\nWait, you think that orders that go through dark pools don't affect the price? Oh my god, that's even dumber than what I was expecting 😂 If anyone else is reading this, these are the idiots who call themselves the most well-educated investors in human history.\n\nOrders that go through dark pools still affect the price, kiddo. What dark pools do is hide the intentions of buyers and sellers before their orders go through. Think of it like this: if Warren Buffett says that he intends to buy $50,000,000 worth of a given stock, that stock will go up. Even before Buffett's order actually fills, the stock will go up because people will see Buffett's intention to buy and decide to buy the stock themselves. This is bad for Buffett because it means that his order will have to be filled at a higher price.\n\nThis is what would happen if Buffett's order went to the lit exchange. Even before Buffett's order fills, the price will jump as other people on Wall Street see that Buffet is intending to buy the stock. If Buffett's order goes through a dark pool, though, then no one will know that he's planning to buy that stock. **The buys will still affect the price, once the orders go through**, they just won't affect the price before going through.\n\nThe idea that orders going through dark pools don't affect the price at all is something that apes just made up and have decided to stick with (kinda like what would happen if SS were an echo chamber full of financially illiterate morons).\n\n>Yup like I said glad to know we both don’t expect it to bankrupt anytime soon. \n\nYup.\n\n>But what does “within the next few years” mean mr all knowing ?\n\nAll-knowing? All I did was explain some basic economic mechanics. But I guess that would make me seem all-knowing compared to an ape. Unfortunately, I'm not all-knowing, and I have no idea when GameStop will dilute its stock again.

Their attempts will come at **different times** on **different days**, and the vast majority **end up buying far from the lowest point**.\n\nAgain, let's say that GME is going to continue to drop down to $20. At $25, some swing traders will buy, incorrectly guessing that it's the bottom, and some will stay away. Then it'll drop to $24, and a few more swing traders will buy in (it will be a few more because the risk is lower and the potential reward is higher). Again, these people are buying at a **different time** and they are also mistiming the bottom. $23, same thing. A few more people buy at yet another different time, and they also mistime the bottom. $22, same thing. $21, same thing. At $20, the risk is just low enough and the reward is just high enough that the slight increase in buy pressure from swing traders is able to prevent the price from dropping any further. These few swing traders--who are buying at a different time than all of the other swing traders--end up getting lucky and timing the bottom fairly well. But most swing traders don't time it so well. Again, many already bought at $25, $24, etc. and many others won't know that $20 is the bottom, and won't but back in until it gets back to $24, 25, etc. Hell, many of them won't end up buying until the run gets close to its peak. So swing traders are buying at **different time, different dates, and at different prices that are usually not very close to the bottom.**\n\nHonestly, I can't explain it any more simply than that.
