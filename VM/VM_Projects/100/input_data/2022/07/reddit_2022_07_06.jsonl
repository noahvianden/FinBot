Make sure to sell at strikes above your cost-basis and at a strike you are comfortable with selling your shares at if you get assigned (this way no matter what you always make money on the underlying, same as you would if you set up a long term limit sell at a set price) 2. -aim for weekly/monthy premium. The closer you are to expiry, the better in order to make theta work for you. You can also realize the premium within a shorter time instead of waiting 45+ days or more out. I like to sell contracts 3 to 10 DTE. 3- Sell calls that have a .30 delta or less (.20 delta or less if you want to ensure a very low probability of being assigned). Lower deltas have lower probability of falling ITM. \n\nThe other reason I like to to sell weekly/bi-weekly covered calls is flexibility. With 3 DTE you can take advantage of theta burn and sell at a slightly higher delta if the premium is worth it. If the stock is flat at 10 DTE you will typically see the premiums for the following week stay flat as well, so selling 14 days out won’t make much of a difference, and selling 10 days out you are ahead on time decay by -4 days. Selling shorter weekly/bi-weekly DTE also allows you to adjust your strikes when there is an uptrend. If the stock moves up 10% in the same week your call expires, you can move your strike up the following week and capture the same or even higher premium at a higher strike, and you get paid out a higher premium while improving your underlying value if it ends up moving sharply and finds its way ITM. Another basic rule is try and sell on green days when your stock moves up. You want to take advantage of the highest premium you can get for that specific strike when you sell a call, and the premiums move up (in some cases, dramatically) when your stock moves up. The important thing when selling calls for profit is set up your calls so the likelihood of getting assigned is very low, and that in the event you do get assigned, you make money on the underlying as well as the premium on top. There is no such thing as zero risk of getting assigned, so when selling calls keep that in mind that if a sharp move up happens and falls ITM, you have to be ok with the strike you sold at. You don’t want to be in a position where you target high premiums below your CB, have your CC’s fall ITM close to expiry, and end up having to roll your calls into eternity. Put together a game plan of a realistic average weekly profit goal (example> if your sell 4 weeks DTE for 600 premium, your weekly ave profit is 150 per week. If you sell 1 week DTE your goal would be to make at least 150 or more per week). The other beauty of covered calls is they also hedge your shares on the downside. So if if the stock dips, the premiums drop and you can actually buy to close at the lower premium value and take profits earlier (which helps if you want the flexibility to release your obligation to sell those calls and still be able to keep a portion of the premium paid). There are alot of strategies to sell covered calls, so it all comes down to your preference and goals over the long term.

The timing is based on your goals and preference. Stick to those basics, and it should help so you won’t find yourself in a weird situation where you have a sharp rally and your shares are stuck to a call you sold 6 months out, and can’t sell your shares unless you BTC at the higher premium, meaning you basically BTC at a loss so the overall net is virtually not much profit. That is why, always set up your CCs right and shorter duration to expiry, the better. You will actually make a higher weekly average by selling weekly than going for higher premium 6-12 months out. It is always tempting, and higher premium further out means less work on your end, but if you want weekly/monthly profit and alot of flexibility where your shares aren’t locked up for months, you go for a shorter 1 to 4 week strategy primarily targeting selling calls 3-10 DTE.

Just buy back the following week, no? Or does it get complicated with wash sales?  I try not to sell calls with strikes that are below my original CB, but after I’ve sold a number of weekly calls on a stock and my adjusted CB is lower, I’ll sell calls with a strike that is above the adjusted CB but lower than my original CB to maximize the premium. If I do get assigned, I would be technically selling the shares themselves at a loss. Is this a bad strategy?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Buying back after assignment is certainly also an option, but it depends on how sharp the move up is in SP and also consider how much you have already collected in premiums, because technically yes, you can get assigned on a Friday and buy back Mon and begin the process of selling calls again. But the only thing that can screw you is if the move up is sharp and the SP on Monday is much higher than your net profit from underlying + premium at assignment. You would end up having to buy the stock back for alot more than the overall net you made at assignment. But yes, technically when you collect premium and don’t get assigned, the premium can factor into lowering your CB since the CC acts as a hedge as well. For example, if you have a cost basis for AAPL at 143 and sell a July 8 CC at 146 strike (.192 delta) for .36 and the option expires OTM worthless on Friday, factoring in the premium your cost basis becomes 142.64. You can decide to go for higher premium the following week at 145 if the stock stayed flat, and I don’t mind taking a chance on higher premium if the expiry is 3-5 days out. The tough thing is, overall as you keep factoring in your premium received into your CB, after weeks or months of receiving premium, you diminish the potential capital gains you could be receiving on your original CB if you have a trend of selling calls closer and closer (and eventually below) your original cost basis. So you can run the risk of just ending up break-even if you get assigned instead ending up in the green overall. Your goal in selling covered calls for profit is you want to end up ahead with a healthy profit if you do end up getting assigned in the long run. Then buying the stock back higher after assignment isn’t such bad thing because your overall net profit is still green even after buying the stock back. But you also want to protect your intrinsic value. This is why I prefer not to factor in the premiums received into my cost-basis unless the stock is in a downtrend, and I am selling calls to get out of a stock to break even without a loss. So the idea is to protect your intrinsic value by making your original CB the nail, your primary position where you base your P/L. CCs are a win win as long as they are set up right.

With the worldwide adoption of EVs, it's only natural that the price of electricity goes up in the next 10 years. Couple that with the fact that in EU, they made the painful, and definitive choice of switching away from Liquid Natural Gas. That means more consumption of electricity for heating. \n\nFood : the overall Food price index has gone down from end of may to end of June, from 159 to 151, but it's nothing to write home about. \nPrice of poultry has gone up, beef has fallen a bit, and pork has pleateau'ed\n\nPrice of cereals have gone up over the month of June. \n\n\nRent : rent price of 1 and 2 bedrooms has continued growing year over year, and month over month, according to the Apartment list national rent report, but we are starting to see a slowdown in rent growth.\n\n\n\nSo overall, I have a feeling that inflation isn't going down any time soon.

Musk, who has been an outspoken advocate of bringing more babies into the world, now has nine known children.\n\nIn April, Musk, 51, and Zilis, 36, filed a petition to change the twins' names in order to \"have their father's last name and contain their mother's last name as part of their middle name.\" The order was approved by a judge in Austin, Texas, this May. (Insider is withholding the children's names to protect their privacy.) The twins were born weeks before Musk and Claire Boucher, the musician who performs as Grimes, had their second child via surrogate in December.\n\nMusk and Zilis did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMusk is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of about $220 billion. He's at the helm of four companies: the electric-vehicle maker Tesla, the spacecraft manufacturer SpaceX, the tunnel-construction startup The Boring Company, and the brain-machine-interface implant company Neuralink, where Zilis works. This year he announced plans to purchase Twitter for $44 billion, though the deal has been held up over what the Tesla CEO has described as several unresolved matters. In May, Insider reported that SpaceX had paid a company flight attendant $250,000 to stay quiet after she alleged that Musk exposed himself and propositioned her for sex.\n\nZilis is a rising star in Musk's empire. Born in Markham, Ontario, Zilis received her bachelor's degree in economics and philosophy in 2008 from Yale, where she also played goalie on the women's ice-hockey team. A lifelong athlete, she has been pictured on social media surfing, zip-lining, and ice climbing. After beginning her career at IBM, she joined the early-stage venture-capital fund Bloomberg Beta, where she led investment efforts in data and machine learning. She was on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in the venture-capital category in 2015.\n\nZilis met Musk through her work with OpenAI, the artificial-intelligence research-and-deployment nonprofit Musk cofounded in 2015. She serves as the youngest member of OpenAI's board of directors. In 2017, Zilis moved to Tesla, where she was a project director, deploying her AI expertise on the Autopilot and chip-design teams. Today she holds the title of director of operations and special projects for Neuralink, where Musk is a co-CEO. She previously worked as a project director in the CEO's office. She's recently been floated as one of the people Musk could tap to run Twitter after his acquisition.\n\nDuring Zilis' tenure at Neuralink, the company has conducted surgical trials of its Bluetooth-enabled brain chips on monkeys and pigs and enabled a nine-year-old macaque to play the video game Pong using its brain. Musk has suggested human trials could start by the end of 2022.\n\nZilis lived in San Francisco before buying a home in a gated community in Austin in August, about three months before the twins were born. The real-estate website Zillow estimates the home is worth more than $4 million. Musk has said his primary residence is a $50,000 modular house in Boca Chica, near SpaceX's launch facility in South Texas, but in the court documents Musk and Zilis listed the same address — the multimillion-dollar home — in Austin. Musk has been spending more time in Austin after opening Tesla's new Gigafactory Texas on the outskirts of the city.\n\nZilis shares many of Musk's intellectual passions, including space travel, transportation, and, most of all, artificial intelligence. They appear to have a similar sense of humor — they've both tweeted AI puns and tongue-in-cheek references to Musk's favorite cryptocurrency, dogecoin.\n\nShe has been an ardent defender of Musk in the face of criticism. In 2020, when a California State Assembly member, Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, tweeted \"F*ck Elon Musk\" after Musk tweeted about moving Tesla out of California over COVID-19 restrictions, Zilis responded: \"This makes me sad. No one's perfect but I've never met anyone who goes through more personal pain to fight for an inspiring future for humanity - and has done so tirelessly for decades. Everyone's entitled to their opinion but mine is that there's no one I respect and admire more.\" —Shivon Zilis (@shivon) May 11, 2020\n\nIn August, she retweeted Musk's photo of SpaceX technicians and engineers connecting a Starship to its Super Heavy booster, writing, \"Humanity's history and future in a single photograph.\"\n\nMusk says he's built his empire with the goal of protecting humanity against what he sees as its biggest threats, including the climate crisis, artificial intelligence gone rogue, and, more recently, population collapse.\n\nHe began sounding the alarm about declining birth rates in 2017, when he tweeted, \"The world's population is accelerating towards collapse, but few seem to notice or care.\"\n\nHe revisited the topic during a debate in August 2019 with Jack Ma, the chairman of Alibaba Group, at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai. \"The biggest issue in 20 years will be population collapse,\" Musk said. \"Not explosion. Collapse.\"\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, the mogul has tweeted more than a dozen times about population issues. On May 24, he posted a graphic from The Wall Street Journal showing a \"fertility slump\" in the United States.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "\"Contrary to what many think, the richer someone is, the fewer kids they have. I am a rare exception,\" Musk said. He returned to that thread several times over the next month, adding on June 14, \"I mean, I'm doing my part haha.\"\n\nOn June 17, Musk tweeted the opening scene of \"Idiocracy,\" the 2006 Mike Judge comedy depicting a world in which highly intelligent people are reluctant to reproduce while those with low IQs continue to have large families, dumbing down the Earth's population. \"When I ask my friends why they're not yet having kids (very few are), it sounds exactly like the movie,\" he wrote.\n\nIn response to a tweet in 2021 praising him for his large family, he wrote: \"I'm trying to set a good example! Population collapse is a much bigger problem than people realize and that's just for Earth. Mars has a great need for people, seeing as population is currently zero.\"\n\nMusk's first wife, the author Justine Musk, told Musk's biographer Ashlee Vance that he \"wanted to get married and have kids early on.\" In 2002, the couple had their first child, Nevada Alexander Musk, who died of sudden infant death syndrome at just 10 weeks. After the baby's death, the couple turned to in vitro fertilization. Justine gave birth to twins, Vivian and Griffin, in 2004, then triplets, Kai, Saxon, and Damian, in 2006.\n\nThis June, Vivian was granted approval to legally change her name and gender. In her petition, she wrote that she no longer wished \"to be related to my biological father in any way.\"\n\nFollowing Musk and Justine's 2008 divorce, Musk married, divorced, and then remarried and redivorced the actor Talulah Riley, with whom he had no children. In 2018, he was romantically linked to Grimes. She gave birth to their first child, X Æ A-Xii Musk, in 2020. (The couple had to change their son's name from X Æ A-12 to comply with California law.) In March, the existence of their second child, Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, was revealed when Exa started crying while Grimes was being interviewed by a Vanity Fair reporter.\n\nIn the interview, Grimes described the complicated nature of her relationship with Musk. \"There's no real word for it,\" she told Vanity Fair. \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid. We live in separate houses. We're best friends. We see each other all the time ... We just have our own thing going on, and I don't expect other people to understand it.\" She also spoke of plans to have more children with Musk, saying, \"We've always wanted at least three or four.\"\n\nThe day the article was published, she tweeted, \"Me and E have broken up again since the writing of this article haha, but he's my best friend and the love of my life, and my life and art are forever dedicated to The Mission now.\" (She later defined \"The Mission\" as \"sustainable energy, making humanity a multiplanetary species and the preservation of consciousness.\")\n\nMusk and Amber Heard — who dated for about a year in 2016 — may also have frozen embryos together. During Heard and Johnny Depp's high-profile defamation trial this spring, Jennifer Howell, Heard's sister's boss, testified that she had heard secondhand from Heard's mother, Paige Parsons, that Heard \"was in a legal battle with him over the rights to embryos that they had created together,\" adding, \"He wanted to destroy them, and Amber tried to keep them to have a baby.\"\n\nThough Musk speaks reverently about fatherhood, he has also been up front about his limited role in raising his children when they are younger.\n\n\"Right now there's not much I can do,\" he told The New York Times about his relationship with X Æ A-Xii as an infant. \"Grimes has a much bigger role than me right now. When the kid gets older, there will be more of a role for me. I think just doing what I've done with my other kids. If I have a trip for Tesla to China, for example, I'll bring the kids with me and we'll go see the Great Wall or we took the bullet train from Beijing to Xian and saw the Terracotta Warriors.\"\n\nLast week, Musk took his four eldest sons along with him as he met the pope.

But what is true is that Tesla's market cap and enterprise value is already extremely high relative to their current production, which means that there is already a very significant amount of growth priced in. It is silly to think that from a competitive standpoint, Tesla could grow into one of the world's biggest automakers and not face margin compression and competitive response. They are competing against car manufacturers that have been doing it for decades and even centuries. They will need to overcome brand loyalists, expand product lines to capture different segments of the market, and generally settle into becoming one of the largest automakers. You are assuming that they can do that and have absolutely no impact on their profit margins, which is a big leap to make. \n\nFor reference, Toyota sold over 10x as many cars as Tesla in 2021 but Tesla's enterprise value is 2x Toyotas. That is bananas. For simplicities sake, if we were to look at Tesla as purely an auto manfucaturer, even if we assumed 2x the profitability of Toyota  once they mature, that they would need to sell over 10 million cars per year to justify their CURRENT market cap and enterprise value. \n\nI understand that Tesla is not just an auto manufacturer, and that they are trying to create a separate ecosystem with solar and battery tech, etc., but you are paying a significant price for it with limited upside in the long-term. We are talking about the 6th biggest company by market cap in the world here. Your upside is capped with Tesla unless you can somehow argue that they should be worth much more than Apple in the long-term (which is an argument I'd love to see) and you would be reliant on them meeting and exceeding already significant growth expectations that are priced into the stock at this point.

The question to ask is what does the market think the lowest multiple should be for Tesla to be a steal in this current market.
