In the process, St. Agnes also outperformed 99 percent of all equity mutual funds, whose managers are paid considerable sums for their expert selections...\n\n>This leads me to Peter’s Principle #3: **Never invest in any idea you can’t illustrate with a crayon.** This rule ought to be adopted by many adult money managers, amateur and professional, who have a habit of ignoring the understandably profitable enterprise in favor of the inexplicable venture that loses money.

Who could draw a picture of a Dense-Pac Microsystem?...\n\n>“This same kid’s-eye approach to stockpicking led the 1990 St. Agnes fund managers to the Walt Disney Company, two sneaker manufacturers (Nike and L. A. Gear), the Gap (where most of them buy their clothes), PepsiCo (which they know four different ways via Pepsi-Cola, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Frito-Lay), and Topps (a maker of baseball cards). \n\n>“We were very much into trading cards within the seventh grade,” Ms. Morrissey says, “so there was no question about whether to own Topps. Again, Topps produced something the kids could actually buy. In doing so, they felt they were contributing to the revenues of one of their companies.”\n\n>They got to the others as follows: Wal-Mart because they were shown a videotaped segment of “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous” that featured Wal-Mart’s founder, Sam Walton, talking about how investing benefits the economy; NYNEX and Mobil because of their excellent dividends; Food Lion, Inc., because it was a well-run company with a high return on equity and also because it was featured in the same video segment that introduced them to Sam Walton.", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm short on Marriot.\n\nMay the best 5 year-old win.", "score": 36, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lesson Learned: To generate generational wealth, have parental assistance.", "score": 42, "replies": []}, {"body": "Post on TikTok get viral and receive 1M offer to trade for a wall street hedge fund\n\nI miss the 90s", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Me when I make up fake scenarios in my head and then get upset about thrm", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.

Look at each company. If you think it will go out of business, sell the stock now. If you think it's a survivor, sit back, hold it, and catch your breath.\n\nGiven that we find ourselves in bear country, stocks ARE likely to drift lower, but they will recover.

Set the strike out to where you can just above break even if it gets assigned, and forget. Even for a few cents per cycle, you would have brought your CB down by the time the economy recovers. Please understand that this is a defensive strategy and is more complex than I have just described, involving changing the strike  points as your CB changes over time.

After all there is almost no benefit to losing money. \nSome of the reasons a person may want to lose some money are:\nTo offset gains and lower their tax bracket, prevent a spouse from getting the money in a divorce, etc.\nWhile you may think it’s super easy to lose money while trading stocks; this is false. The stock market will always try to trick you. So while you try to lose you may actually gain.\n\nThe main strategy for losing money is buy high, sell low. This way your stocks always lose.\nBecause market timing can be difficult an even simpler solution is to follow my portfolio and do exactly what I do. \nIm not perfect and occasionally I dont lose money on my trades. However, for the most part this is the simplest way to guarantee overall losses.\n\nOne more thing to remember: if you don’t sell you didn’t lose money so make sure to sell the dips.\n\n\nChapter 2: How to make money in the stock market\n\n\nIt goes without saying that this is the goal most people have when investing their money. Ideally as a trader we want our profit to cover taxes and inflation at a minimum. \nLoads and loads of books have been written with different strategies and techniques to time the market, set up trades and ultimately profit from the stock market. Most of these strategies require following complex patterns and following the markets closely to buy and sell at the right times.\n\nIn simpler terms the strategy is buy low, sell high. A lot easier said than done. \nIn this book we will explore a much simpler methodology based on basic logic that almost anyone can achieve.\n\nAs already talked about in chapter 1, I will consistently lose money. It’s just me. When markets were up and inexperienced traders were making 100s and 1000s of percentage points, majority of my trades still resulted in red. \n\nWhile unfortunate for me, as I only trade to try and make money, this is very fortunate for all of you. \n\nThe same way one can lose money by following my strategy exactly, one can simply reverse this strategy for guaranteed wins. Simply watch my portfolio and everytime I make a move you do the opposite. I buy , you short. I sell, you cover. \n\n….\n\n\nIt’s still a work in progress obviously but keep an eye on bookstores near you.

I've got about five styles each with several parameters that must be met to be in the results. #2, convert each list into a \"watch list\" using the same name i. e. \"Beat up no Reason\"  etc. #3, using Active Trader Pro I have a custom interface saved with my charts and indicators in place. This sounds complicated but once it's set up, it opens the same every time. This also needs a picture which I can do if someone is that serious to see it. Within my set up are one year, six month and three month based charts (on tabs, but six month is on top) another cluster has one month and daily in tabs (just for in the moment viewing) #4 I use about six primary indicators that are stacked on top of one another. Stochastic, StochRSI, MFI, CMO, RSI, and MacD. #5, my watch lists are screen left bottom, just under held positions screen left top. Charts are screen right entire height.\nHere's my strategy (which is not 100% correct all the time. There are many times I get in to early and I have to watch it go down a little before it comes back up) I follow and view charts of major indices plus a few ETFs like IVV, IUSV, IUSG, & SPY, DJI etc.\nYou can see the indicator line for each of those mentioned move from up (like over bought) and down (over sold) each indicator has known trigger values that you can find and with ATP those trigger lines are already populated. So #6 major index and broad etfs all need to be down below the trigger line. All of them, or I do not buy. (and this is on the six month chart. Not day trading) then I click on each of my watch list stocks (I limit my list to ten for each style) I click and view the indicators to see if any are, once again all indicators below trigger line. This is a waiting game. And usually I find that most stocks will go down together with the broad market. So when one is a buy, there is usually a couple more as well.\n#6 When to sell. For this I use the three month chart because it is more volatile and moves to trigger faster than the six month. When all (ALL) of the indicators are up top trigger line, I sell.\nSome of my recent BUYS & SELLS, EPAM, IIVI, HCKT, MGA, OC, ABBV, MMM and CC.

Would have been too unpopular but screw billionaires, amirite? But Congress cleverly didn't adjust the tax brackets to inflation. Oops.\n\nThe only tax law that I'm aware of that inflation has been beneficial to the citizen is the NFA firearm tax. In 1934, there was a rise of machine gun violence because of prohibition. So to solve the problem of violence caused by one government law (banning alcohol), the government created a new law, the national firearms act.\n\nYou could legally buy a full auto gun but the tax was $200. Which was like 6 months salary for the average person. So only the rich could afford machine guns. And of course, criminals still had them because, well...  criminals.\n\nThe $200 tax remains the same today even though that equates to only a couple hours behind the Wendy'a dumpster.\n\nBut the government \"fixed\" this inflation-adjusted tax loophole by banning new machine guns into being allowed to be purchased by civilians. Of course the government agencies can still have new machine guns. And criminals can easily convert a gun to full auto in a few minutes because, well... criminals.\n\nSo now a machine gun still has the $200 tax but they're $20k+ due to requiring a \"pre-ban\" version. So they still cost 6 months of average persons salary. Unless you're a criminal then it's $20 worth of parts to retrofit a semi-auto gun.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "So $3000 a year for the rest of my life?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Unless you have capital gains to offset.
