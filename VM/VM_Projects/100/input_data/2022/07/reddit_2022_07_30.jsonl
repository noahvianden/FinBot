Although ARK does not make investment decisions based on short-term fluctuations, we believe that other investors are concerned that Teladoc will not be able to deliver on the steep ramp in EBITDA* it is forecasting for the fourth quarter. Based on the annual guidance it reaffirmed for this year, we estimate that Teladoc will have to generate 43% of its annual EBITDA target by way of lower advertising in the holiday quarter. In 2019, Teladoc generated 48% of its annual EBITDA in the fourth quarter, which suggests that its EBITDA assumptions for this year are not out of line.\n\nFocusing on the factors that do inform our investment decisions, we note that most key operating metrics in the quarter affirmed our long-term thesis that Teladoc will become a premier enterprise partner for hybrid care delivery in the US and perhaps elsewhere. Utilization and per-member-per-month (PMPM) spending both reached all-time highs, increasing on a year over year basis from 19% to 24% and $2.31 to $2.60, respectively, while total new member additions and chronic care enrollment surpassed analysts‚Äô expectations.\n\nToday, 30% of chronic care enrollees use multiple Teladoc products. Illustrating its value to patients and health systems, for example, nearly 67% of new Primary360 members had not seen a physician in the last two years, and another 33% said they wouldn‚Äôt have seen a physician were it not for Primary360. Teladoc‚Äôs land-and-expand strategy also demonstrated success with several large account up-sells (Primary360 + Chronic Care). Management called out Priority Health, a major US health plan, as a particularly notable win.\n\nWhile consumer sentiment, discretionary spending, and paid search yields have impacted Teladoc‚Äôs EBITDA margin, we believe these forces are transient, certainly in the context of ARK‚Äôs five-year investment time horizon. Teladoc‚Äôs revenue is increasing much faster than its cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) and operating expenses, illustrating significant leverage in its core business.\n\nTeladoc is the largest global provider of whole-person, virtual-first healthcare services.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "No moat, zoom for doctors", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "I just unfollowed Ark invest on Twitter,  forgot I was following them but now can't take them seriously", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "I like the product.

Why settle on the second best and diworsify when you can buy the best possible risk adjusted return in the market right now (TSLA)?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": ">Do you think that PLTR will outperform TSLA over the next 5 years?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI see Palantir today as where Tesla was between 2014-2019: stuck in a zone of controversy where the general investment community is very divided in where the business will go.\n\nPalantir faces the same fundamental questions as Tesla did 4-8 years ago: (1) Can the company broaden its customer base?  (2) Can they scale their business upwards?\n\nFor Tesla specifically, there was skepticism that their EVs could go from a niche luxury market to mainstream mass market, and skepticism that Tesla could go from building 10s of thousands of vehicles per year to 100s of thousands and then millions of vehicles per year. Tesla answered those questions in late 2019 through 2020, which provided the catalyst needed for TSLA's breakout.\n\nToday, Palantir faces skepticism that it can broaden its customer base from mostly government agencies to commercial/private enterprise customers.  They also face the question of whether their software is generalized enough to scale like a SaaS (fast to deploy, minimal manpower needs, high margin) as opposed to a consultancy (slow, lots of custom code needed, manpower heavy, low margin).\n\nIf Palantir becomes a commercial success with rapidly deployable, high margin software sold as a service, PLTR could quickly reach a breakout.\n\nI hope Palantir will have a major breakout in the near future, but I have no idea if this will happen in the next 5 years.  It could be 10 years, or even never.\n\nPalantir still has a lot of work to do in salesforce development, and in making their platform more flexible for smaller customers\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why settle on the second best and diworsify when you can buy the best possible risk adjusted return in the market right now (TSLA)?\n\nShort answer:  I like Palantir as a company, and it literally doesn't matter to me financially whether PLTR stock outperforms TSLA or not.\n\nLong analysis:\n\nMy situation is probably a bit different than most here.  I reached Financial Independence at the end of 2020, closed down my consulting business in early May of this year after completing a final contract (I got a large cash payout from this), and then retired early with about 4-5x my original retirement asset goal.\n\nAt present, my portfolio looks approximately like this:\n\n80% TSLA\n\n15-16% Index Funds, Index ETFs, other boring stuff -- mostly from rolled 401(k) plans\n\n2% PLTR\n\n2% ARKG\n\nLess than 0.5% DNA\n\nWith TSLA holdings already being multiples of what I needed to retire, I don't feel compelled to add more shares to my portfolio.  Crazy as this sounds, whether PLTR appreciates as much as TSLA does in the next few years makes no practical difference to me.  If PLTR rockets, it's a nice bonus.  If the stock stays stuck for a long time, I won't be affected at all.\n\nI bought PLTR shares because I thought the company was very misunderstood and extremely underestimated.  I liked the Foundry demos and vision for the Foundry platform.  It left a similar impression on me as the Model S Beta I saw in 2011.\n\nPLTR, ARKG, and DNA are basically small side bets for me on tech that I think could be huge going into the 2030s.  Software will continue to be extremely important.  Genomics, being related to the programming of biological life, is sort a software art in of itself (though fiendishly more difficult to control with precision).\n\nAs far as TSLA vs. PLTR for most investors:\n\n* I think TSLA today is a safer investment than PLTR.  Tesla is far more established and further along in its maturity curve than Palantir.  Tesla has a very broad set of interconnected businesses in heavy manufacturing, energy grids, and Artificial Intelligence.  TSLA growth potential remains very high due, due to many products in the pipeline and several businesses that have yet to mature\n* PLTR is a wildcard.  Most people still do not understand the company.  Disconnect between public perception and reality means that there may be opportunity to buy equity that may be very valuable in a few years.  Because Palantir's software products are difficult for many investors to understand, it may be more difficult for them to build conviction in Palantir's business and hold shares during volatile periods.\n\nEdit:  To conclude, I favor TSLA as an investment and my portfolio reflects that, but I'm impressed with Palantir and want to own part of their business too.  As with all things investment related, I think any decision to invest in PLTR will be highly dependent on individual risk tolerance, goals, and understanding of all things related to Palantir", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Awesome opinion piece - thank you ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "üíØ Thx for writing that up Magikarp, makes perfect sense.

Now that many digital tokens have been hammered, these consumers are going into reverse.  \n  \n>  \n>  \nChrono24 Co-CEO Tim Stracke said the pullback for some models represents a consolidation as prices for the most sought after timepieces fall closer in line with similar watches.  \n  \n>  \n>  \nAt the same time, Stracke said trading volumes on the platform, which links dealers or private sellers with buyers, have jumped more than 50% in the first half of the year.  \n  \n>  \n>  \nThe price of a Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711A, which sells for about $35,000 at retail, surged to $240,000 in the first quarter, according to Chrono24.

Margin doesn‚Äôt have this non-linearity, although has other costs/risks. These two options are more complicated and not everyone can get margin.

We've already seen above cheap transport has lost its \"cheap\" qualifier. So how about that fertiliser? \n\n[Here are the world's top fertiliser exporters](https://www.worldstopexports.com/top-fertilizers-exports-by-country/)\n\n1. Russia: US$12.5 billion (15.1% of total exported fertilizers)\n2. China: $10.9 billion (13.3%)\n3. Canada: $6.6 billion (8%)\n4. Morocco: $5.7 billion (6.9%)\n5. United States: $4.1 billion (4.9%)\n\n[\"Sanctions cripple the Russia‚Äôs fertiliser industry\"](https://www.allaboutfeed.net/market/market-trends/sanctions-cripple-the-russias-fertiliser-industry/) allaboutfeed. June 22nd, 2022\n\n\"The lack of Russian fertilisers on the global market has not only caused a spike in prices but has also resulted in their shortage in some places around the world. Guriev estimated that sanctions have nearly halved Russian fertilisers export. \" (Excerpt from the link above)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\"China‚Äôs fertilizer exports ban raises worries from global markets\"](https://www.fastmarkets.com/chinas-fertilizer-exports-ban-raises-worries-from-global-markets) Fastmarkets. **OCT 5th, 2021**\n\n**\"** The region is expected to further tighten its controls on exports of fertilizers, effectively shutting off the supply of phosphate to the global market and accentuating restrictions that have already driven prices higher. \" (Excerpt from the link above)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/blogs.worldbank.org\\/opendata\\/fertilizer-prices-expected-remain-higher-longer#:\\~:text=Fertilizer&#37;20prices&#37;20have&#37;20risen&#37;20nearly,and&#37;20export&#37;20restrictions&#37;20\\(China\\).](https://preview.redd.it/trcjt4s5cne91.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=28407bedc22ab5c1ddc118bed69272490f5fe852)\n\n [\"Fertilizer prices expected to remain higher for longer\"](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/fertilizer-prices-expected-remain-higher-longer#:~:text=Fertilizer%20prices%20have%20risen%20nearly,and%20export%20restrictions%20(China)) WorldBank. May 11th, 2022\n\n\"**Record-high input costs**. Rising natural gas prices, especially in Europe, led to widespread production cutbacks in ammonia‚Äîan important input for nitrogen-based fertilizers.  Similarly, soaring prices of coal in China, the main feedstock for ammonia production there, forced fertilizer factories to cut production, which contributed to the increase in urea prices. Higher prices of ammonia and sulfur have also driven up phosphate fertilizer prices. \" (Excerpt from the link above)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne more for the road?\n\nThis image should help visualise just how much more farmland is available now thanks to modern farm inputs.

Something we make a lot of here in the US. We have a lot of natural gas here simply as a by-product of fracking. Potash is abundant in Canada, and it's what they use to make their fertiliser. Therefore I am investing in nitrogen and potash fertiliser-producing companies based in the US. Because their major ingredients are all within the country or north America. And now will have a much higher demand. \n\n**TLDR / Conclusion:**\n\n**Here are the companies I will personally buy into for the long term. This is not financial advice.**\n\n* **( CF ) C.F.
