This translates into approximately 110,000 individuals each month, a large sample compared to public opinion surveys, which usually cover fewer than 2,000 people. The CPS sample is selected so as to be representative of the entire population of the United States. In order to select the sample, all of the counties and independent cities in the country first are grouped into approximately 2,000 geographic areas (sampling units). The Census Bureau then designs and selects a sample of about 800 of these geographic areas to represent each state and the District of Columbia. The sample is a state-based design and reflects urban and rural areas, different types of industrial and farming areas, and the major geographic divisions of each state. \n\n>Every month, one-fourth of the households in the sample are changed, so that no household is interviewed for more than 4 consecutive months. After a household is interviewed for 4 consecutive months, it leaves the sample for 8 months, and then is again interviewed for the same 4 calendar months a year later, before leaving the sample for good.

I've been genuinely astounded at your lack of comprehension and mental gymnastics. To recap, this started by you claiming that we had the lowest unemployment currently since the 1950s. When I said that was wrong, and gave you specific dates when unemployment was lower, you accused me of \"nitpicking,\" and that it actually helped your (false) claim. \n\nWhen I pointed out that 2019 falls between 1959 and 2022, you followed that up with the hard hitting analysis that your local area was hiring some people, and so you must be correct. When I rebutted that by once again going to the national numbers showing that both new unemployment claims and continuing unemployment claims were rising, you went back to personal opinions. You seemed to be unable to comprehend that a rising number of people claiming extended unemployment leads to higher unemployment. Admittedly, making the connection that rising unemployment claims and rising unemployment rates may be a little too complicated for you to understand.\n\nAt any rate, thanks for the discussion. It's good to be reminded just how off base some people can be. I really loved hearing about why your personal opinions were more important than the actual numbers. Ultimately, I don't particularly care to convince you of anything. It'll all come out in the wash.

{"title": "The Fed vowed to crush inflation with higher rates. Then the stock market rallied. Here’s why. (It’s not good news)- Interesting read", "selftext": " The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by another 75 basis points despite acknowledging that economic growth is clearly slowing. The central bank, under Powell, reiterated that the path of least resistance is well-represented by the so-called dot plot: More hikes ahead — all the way to a fed funds rate of 3.75%!\n\nAnd yet, the stock market has staged a humongous rally, led by the most valuation-sensitive and risk-sentiment-driven asset classes: Nasdaq stocks **COMP,** **+1.08%** and crypto.\n\n**So … what the heck?!**\n\nIt all boils down to how one single sentence was able to affect the probability distributions that investors were projecting for different asset classes.  \nDoes it sound complicated? Bear with me: it’s not!\n\n**Why did stocks rally?**\n\nWhen the FOMC’s press release was published, it looked like business as usual: A well-telegraphed 75-bp hike with the only small surprise represented by an unanimous vote despite clear acknowledgment that economic growth is softening.\n\nBut not even 15 minutes into the press conference, the fireworks went off!  \nIn particular, when Powell said: ‘‘We are now at levels broadly in line with our estimates of neutral interest rates, and after front-loading our hiking cycle until now we will be much more data-dependent going forward.’’\n\n **This is very important for several reasons-**\n\nThe neutral rate is the prevailing rate at which the economy delivers its potential GDP growth rate — without overheating or excessively cooling down. With this 75-bp hike, Powell told us the Fed just reached its estimate of a neutral rate and, hence, from here they aren’t contributing to economic overheating anymore. But that also means any further increases are going to put the Fed in an actively restrictive territory. And the bond market knows that every time the Fed became restrictive in the past, they ended up breaking something.\n\nUntil Wednesday, you could be completely sure that the Fed would have just pressed on the accelerator — inflation must come down; no space for nuance. So journalists asked questions to find out something about the ‘‘new’’ forward guidance. It went roughly like this:\n\nJournalist: ‘‘Mr. Powell, the bond market is pricing you to cut rates starting in early 2023 already. What are your comments?’’\n\nPowell: ‘‘Hard to predict rates six months from now. We will be fully data-dependent.’’\n\nJournalist: ‘‘Mr. Powell, due to the recent bond and equity market rally, financial conditions have eased quite a lot. What’s your take?’’\n\nPowell: ‘‘The appropriate level of financial conditions will be reflected in the economy with a lag, and it’s hard to predict. We will be fully data dependent.’’ \n\nHe did it. He totally ditched forward guidance. And what happens when you do so? You give markets the green light to freely design their probability distributions across all asset classes without any anchor — and that explains the gigantic risk rally — as well as the jump in the broader S&P 500 SPX, +1.21%.\n\n**Let’s see why-**\n\nIf the Fed is so data-dependent, and there is basically one data they care about, it all boils down to how inflation will evolve in the near future — and the bond market has a very strong opinion about that. Using CPI inflation swaps, I calculated the one-year forward, one-year inflation break-evens — basically, the expected inflation between July 2023 and July 2024, which is represented in the chart above and sits at 2.9%. Remember that the Fed targets (core) PCE, which tends to historically be 30-40 bps below (core) CPI: Essentially, the bond market expects inflation to slow very aggressively and roughly hit the Fed’s target in the second half of 2023 already!\n\nSo if the Fed is not nearly on autopilot anymore, and markets have a strong opinion on inflation and growth collapsing, then they can also price all other asset classes around this base case scenario. It starts to be more clear now, right? This is what my Volatility Adjusted Market Dashboard (VAMD — here’s a short explainer) showed soon after Powell enunciated that one single sentence.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fed-vowed-to-crush-inflation-with-higher-rates-then-the-stock-market-rallied-heres-why-its-not-good-news-11659037159?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fed-vowed-to-crush-inflation-with-higher-rates-then-the-stock-market-rallied-heres-why-its-not-good-news-11659037159?mod=home-page)", "id": "wayz3g", "created_utc": 1659082069.0, "score": 432, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Both tools operate to reduce DEMAND (the economic term, for the economically illiterate out there). \n\nThe problem is, demand is not the primary culprit for inflation in this environment.

Inflation is a monetary problem, and without a corresponding increase in aggregate demand, supply shocks may lead to lesser inflation or recession already. Supply shock didn't cause housing to go up in price 80% over the past 2 years. The low interest rate and promising forward guidance did. Combined that with people widely employed, and business able to borrow to fund cash purchases is what resulted in the housing bubble.\n\nHousing costs has gone up way before food and gas.

Fine, that makes sense. \n\nWhat didn't make sense is once inflation reached 5%, he still wanted to keep rates low, believing the inflation transitory. His decision is based on data and judgement call. His data tells him inflation is high, his judgement tells him its supply shock based. But he convenient ignores surging housing costs and a bubbling stock market.\n\nAt that point he should entertaining the idea that inflation may not be solely supply shock, and that he caused a shit ton of it.

Asset inflation surely has been accommodated by the fed, and specifically mortgage rates were chased to lows by their purchase of mortgage backed securities. Furthermore, the fed dumped trillions in cash on the market through their QE purchases, dollars which have struggled to find adequate return for risk. I also fundamentally disagree with the feds heavy handed responses to their anticipated outcomes. \n\n\nHowever, housing has been in a shortage since the 2008 financial crisis, and building has not been able to keep up. COVID uncertainty slowed and halted many projects, supply disruptions on housing components, and labor disruptions have all contributed to rising housing prices. I would also agree that the Fed could have moved to curb mortgage demand earlier by raising rates, or even using the MBS they purchased to dilute the mortgage market, raising specifically mortgage rates. \n\nHowever, it would be inaccurate to suggest that housing price increases weren't also a function of supply side issues, imo.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": ">However, it would be inaccurate to suggest that housing price increases weren't also a function of supply side issues, imo.\n\nI agree with that statement in that price increases can only happen when demand exceeds supply. Neither demand nor supply can be viewed in a vacuum. But does that mean demand stayed the same and supply dropped, or demand soared but supply cannot keep up. \n\nI'm leaning toward that demand soared, but supply simply cannot keep up, rather than demand stayed the same or decreased but supply dropped. And I attribute the demand soaring due to both loose fiscal and monetary policy. Monetary policy doesn't fix structural issues as you have noted, like supply chain issues. Hence they should not have been used to spur the economy.\n\nCOVID shutdowns were structural issues that should been addressed by fiscal policy, which the government tried by PPP loans and stimulus checks. Monetary policy used during that time to provide stability to credit markets is also reasonable. But in 2021, businesses were opening up, people were vaccinated, hospitalization were going down, asset prices were going up, and while you could argue that housing may have supply issues contribution to its inflation, I doubt you could say the same for stocks and cryptocurrency. \n\nSo not sure why the Fed didn't see that in 2021 and think \"oh geez, the markets rose 20+% in 2020, and it seems to be continuing to rise at that pace in 2021, and unemployment low, inflation rising, let me put a break on it?\" and instead goes, \"money printer go brrrr.\"\n\nI understand it's unfair to put the blame totally on the Fed, because the government keeps spending and doesn't raise enough taxes to cover the shortfall for at least a decade now, but we're entering a phase in which debtor keeps borrowing to keep himself afloat and kicking the can down the road. I myself am okay when inflation is low, but when inflation is high, I get nervous. \n\nIn order to outpace the inflation today, I have to take outsized risks investing, when assets already have a rich valuation.

I think that officially is actually two questions. But anyway, we'll take them both.\r  \n\r  \nOn the market side, we'll say we were well into the quarter and we saw the market characteristics change quite suddenly, right? And that resulted in both the sell-through in the marketplace, but also these significant inventory adjustments. We work with our customers on those inventory adjustments. And as we said, these are like once in 10-year kind of inventory adjustments because the customers were working through the quarter, catching up to demand that was short for years, right? And all of a sudden, as they saw that shifting, they took quite significant adjustments to their inventory positions. And we wanted to be in a position that we had some thoughtful view of what the market was for the future.\r  \n\r  \nSo that's the reason that brought us to today. We think that we've given you a clear view of where the market is coming into the future. The DCAI point, as I said in my formal comments, we were disappointed. Some of that was driven by the macro.\r  \n\r  \nIt was also match set issues that we've been struggling with as well and Ethernet components, power supply components, etc., have been challenged. But as we also said, we have some of our own unique execution issues, and we kept the quality bar high on Sapphire Rapids. And thus, we did another stepping, which was a forecast, which puts some inventory and reserve issues in front of us as opposed to high ASP, new product revenue. So some of those things were unique issues to us that we were addressing.\r  \n\r  \nThat said, we do feel like the progress on the data center, right, is clear in front of us. We have -- Emerald is looking very good. We'll be powering on Sapphire or Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids shortly. All of that taken together, we feel our competitive position is improving.\r  \n\r  \nWe also see that's -- we know where the market share is, and wins like we announced with AWS and Meta, we are going to focus on every socket, every workload, every customer quite aggressively on both AWS and Meta. These were substantial wins for us this quarter, and we hope to be announcing several others like that as we go forward. We're also bringing new capabilities. As we sort of said in our formal comments, the size of our footprint here is underappreciated.\r  \n\r  \nAnd we're going to be focusing on really benefiting from that and bringing new capabilities against that enormous footprint with capabilities like Granulate and our Amber Security Service, things that allow us to bring more value to our customers, as well as harvest more revenue from that enormous installed base. So all of that taken together, we feel like we are owning up to the challenges that we had in data center, but we have a clear view of how we write this business for the future and are well underway on doing exactly that.\r  \n\r  \nDavid Zinsner -- Chief Financial Officer\r  \n\r  \nAnd maybe I'll just add, in terms of profitability, it was disappointing where operating margins landed for the DCAI business for sure. That was largely the impact of the decline in revenue. But keep in mind, we're also investing a lot, for all the reasons that Pat said, to bring out great products that wow our customers. And so that investment does also weigh down on the operating profitability of the business.\r  \n\r  \nWe do see that getting better. We took, as Pat mentioned, reserves on Sapphire Rapids. And those are kind of a one-off thing that dissipate as we go through the second half of the year. We also expect revenue to improve as we progress through the year.\r  \n\r  \nThose things combined should improve operating margins in the near term. In the long term, we see this business as a business that gives us greater than corporate average operating margins, gross margins and operating margins for that matter. It has traditionally actually for us and for the industry. And so it's a matter of just putting our nose down and executing to get those results, and we feel very confident we'll get there.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yadda, Yadda…\nVivek was right.

The Fed goes up to the bank and says, \"Give me your bond, and I'll give you some 'reserves', i.e., electronic money.\" The exchange occurs, and now the Fed owns a bond on its balance sheet and the bank has credit it can lend out. The change to the bank's balance sheet is unchanged.\n\nBoom, the Fed has thus expanded its balance sheet.\n\nThe interest on those bonds is sent out by the bond issuer (the Treasury) to the Fed. But the Fed in the end gives all its net income back to the Treasury. Eventually, the bond expires and the Treasury pays out the full principal to the Fed. If nothing else happens, the money essentially disappears, and the balance sheet is now reduced. This is what is happening right now with \"(passive) quantitative tightening (QT).\" To keep the balance sheet stable, the Fed would have had to buy more bonds. \n\nIf the Fed decides it wants to reduce its balance sheet *now*, and not wait for its bonds to expire, it can directly sell them in the market. This is called \"active quantitative tightening (QT).\"\n\nThe Fed's balance sheet has mortgage backed securities it bought, and short/long term government bonds it bought.

Their liability increases by the reserves you mentioned and cash in circulation.  This truly has created money \"out of thin air\".\n\nHistorically the Fed has always made money for the US Treasury.  However, there's an extremely good chance that in 2023 and for a couple years, the Fed will lose money for the first time in history.  \n\nBy itself this isn't necessarily problematic.  After all they've been sending a lot of money over the years to the Treasury.  However, it raises a lot of uncomfortable questions about the ample reserves regime.\n\nThe reason why the Fed will lose money is because of the obscene and ballooned amounts of money parked at the Fed via reserves and RRP, which is completely uncharted waters.  They could end up paying $200B-$300B or more potentially in interest (RRP + IORB).\n\nSo the first question that may arise is why is the taxpayer sending 100's of billions of dollars to banks and money market funds?  Warren and AOC's of the world could create an optics shitstorm.  Then the second question that could arise is *what would happen if the Fed stopped giving all these \"handouts\"*?\n\nThe answer is that interest rates would plummet and collapse as all this liquidity would rush to treasuries, government debt, interbank lending, so that interest rates could potentially go back to ZIRP levels or even negative.  So not only is the Fed crowding out private functions of the credit market and artificially propping up rates, by keeping rates higher than what the free market would arrive at, taxpayers are potentially overpaying like crazy on newly issued debt.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "What value do bonds have why would they buy bonds?

The Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy, i.e., control the supply of money/credit available in the US economy. They implicitly impact credit availability by targeting certain interest rates in the economy.\n\nIn standard 'open market operations', the Fed buys/sells bonds to banks to impact the amount of credit available in what are called 'overnight lending markets.' Essentially, banks lend/borrow from each other overnight to make sure they have adequate liquid cash to perform their desired functions. The Fed basically swaps out banks' bonds for electronic money, so there is now money available for banks to lend out, and the bond now lies on the Fed's balance sheet. The interest rate between banks falls since more cash is available and banks are less urgent about getting credit so won't accept as high rates. If the Fed sells bonds, it takes cash out of the bank and gives it a less liquid bond, and this means there is less credit available for that bank to lend to other banks. This causes the interest rate banks charge each other to rise, since it's harder for a bank to get a dollar from its neighbor bank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve does not care about the value of a bond per se, but the value the bond carries as an asset it can swap with financial institutions for more liquid electronic money.\n\nI don't know what your second sentence is asking, exactly; the Fed doesn't invest in its own personal projects like infrastructure projects. The goal of the Fed is to control American monetary policy, and open market operations with other country's banks or companies would not accomplish that. Moreover, government bonds are very liquid and easier to buy/sell compared to say corporate bonds.\n\nQuantitative easing, by the way, mostly just means the Fed buys longer term bond and also mortgage backed securities, and not just the short-term government bonds in standard open market operations.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Means more money printing!", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Lets here some earnings plays.

It generally goes down when markets are going up and goes up when markets go down. The fact the market is going up and the VIX is down doesn't really tell you anything.

Sudden spikes lower or higher in the VIX can be seen as an indicator that things might be getting over done either to the upside or downside.\n\nOn the flip side of that the VIX over short-periods is also trend-following. So a down move in the VIX is likely to be followed by more down moves until it's not. So near-term it probably could be seen as more positive than negative, but if you believe the bear market isn't done yet then you should also probably expect it to bounce higher at some point as it mean reverts to a more typical bear-market level.\n\nBasically it doesn't really mean anything. It tells you something, but it's fairly useless on its own.

Windows on ARM is not at all the same experience either.\n\nAMD's Zen3+ 6nm 6800u is actually just as efficient as Apple's M2. And 6800u is a 6nm node chip. So AMD hasn't even moved to 5nm yet. 5nm Zen4 is coming out next month most likely and will be faster than Apple's fastest 5nm chip. So AMD has a clear architectural lead. Apple has lost their top chip design talent recently as well.\n\nCloud providers making their own chips are even worse than Apple's chips. They are cheap and a way to vendor lock in customers. But they will never have the scale, footprint and software support to dethrone x86. CPU space was never x86 only. We've always had things like Sparc, IBM PowerPC, MIPS etc.. ARM is just a new special snowflake. But if you look at Graviton 3 (5nm) it can't even hold a candle to AMD's 7nm x86 chips.

The closest ARM came to taking over is when Intel had a fab leadership and when they made their xScale processors which were ARM. ARM isn't taking over because ARM has no intrinsic advantage in high performance CPUs.\n\nLike I mentioned it needs to be better at something in order to take over. And it isn't better, it's worse at a number of things. The most notable one is the sheer size of the PC ecosystem and the millions of programs that were written for x86. ARM looks good compared to Intel because Intel is struggling particularly in efficiency, but AMD isn't struggling. They clearly have the best architecture with industry leading PPA (that's Power Performance Area, the magic triangle). Their processors look impressive even with a node disadvantage, which tells you that x86 at least as far as AMD is concerned are as ahead of ARM architecturally as they have always been. If 6800u can provide similar multithreaded performance with less transisotrs at same efficiency as M2 while being a node behind. That means Zen is actually architecturally superior and can deliver more performance when all else is equal. Because the 5nm Zen4 will be significantly better and more efficient. So node for node Zen > M2. \n\nAnd Apple's processor is the most impressive of the ARM bunch because it's a custom core they designed, which fits their use case, but it comes at a cost of using the bleeding edge node (ahead of everyone else) and at the cost of area. The devil is in the details and when you analyze those details you realize ARM is behind architecturally. Even M2 is behind, most other manufacturers use licensed ARM cores from ARM Holdings. Which are not as good as Apple's cores. \n\nSince you brought up RISC-V, yes RISC-V actually offers an advantage of being an open spec, but the Open Hardware model doesn't work. Designing high performance cores is an expensive and arduous process. Zen 1 took 5 years to design, next Zen 5 by the time is released will have taken 4 years. No one is going to spend 4-5 years of engineering time and just give the RTL source away for free.  It's a pie in the sky and a fad just like ARM is.\n\nARM will continue to do great in commodity hardware and so will RISC-V. AMD uses ARM and RISC-V in some of their products too.

{"title": "BREAKING: FTC to open investigation into algo-trading, market manipulation and tampering have reached “unprecedented levels”", "selftext": "“FTC chair Lina Khan is not only suing Meta to block their virtual reality deal, she is now aiming to make a broader impact on the stock market in general, opening up a new investigation into the murky legality of algo-trading and market manipulation.  “There is an unfathomable amount of money being traded every split second by non-human traders, to the point where human perceptions and activities on the markets have little to no impact on the market's value.  Human traders cannot possibly make the right moves as highly advanced algorithms are already 10 steps ahead”.\n\nPart of the fear surrounding algo-trading is the nefarious idea it is designed to extract as much wealth as possible from real human beings and place it into the hands of the algorithms.  Khan continued “... if algo-trading is not regulated soon, there is no telling how much impact it could have in the future, we fear the impact could grow exponentially…”.  Her logic seemed to imply the more money the algorithms control, the greater the impact they will have on the markets.”\n\nIDK about you guys, but with the recent market behavior this explains everything.

This is true in most of the global economy as well.\n\nSo don't believe the bullshit on the media. Certainly don't believe anything you get from the government - in particular the White House.\n\n**\"But... but they wouldn't lie. The government wants to take care of everyone.

What the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nThere's a reason why a recession is calculated the way it is.\n\nIf you can't have a recession until you get two quarters of negative GDP, then you have 6 months of being in a recession before people figure it out.\n\nHow smart a scam is that?\n\nDon't worry.

Unemployment numbers always increase in a broad decline decline in general economic activity because in that circumstance there's no other sector to pick up the slack. So according to the NBER, whether unemployment is 10% or 50% or 80% is irrelevant, because the other factors they use, aside from GDP, correlate strongly with unemployment.\n\nIf people spend a lot less, demand drops and employment drops. The question is whether it's meaningful and represents a broad decline in activity.\n\nI am saying the FRED data correlating is NOT revelation.

Anybody who's ever had a job knows that people stop looking for work when they get an offer, and that in the period between leaving their old job and joining a new one, not only do people typically take a week or two off, but it also takes a few weeks for companies to report new payroll admission because of lag in processing.\n\nThis matters. People leave the workforce and aren't on the payroll between jobs, and when you have low unemployment, when you have job growth without growth in the laborforce that typically means you have people changing jobs in many cases.\n\n**This doesn't need data to prove, it's an inherent and known and often advertised limitation in the BLS' data collection methodology, which is why people don't hyperfocus on wobble in monthly jobs and workforce numbers.**\n\nI also don't need a separate dataset to demonstrate it because, again, it's directly inherent in the source of the dataset you're using per the BLS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The Labor Participation rate is also an odd choice for you to make.

That's evident, and the BLS admits it.\n\nThe onus is on you to prove that a statistical wobble of 0.2% of the workforce demonstrates a blindspot in unemployment data such that we can't use it to assess current economic conditions.\n\nThat's your claim, and it's not proven by your analysis of the numbers.

Do not pass go, do not collect $200.\n\nAnd here's the thing: We know this because the BLS publicly posts its methodology and explains it in their reports. They literally adjust the figures every month to account for the wobble you're citing.\n\nIt's not a big secret, there's no scam, and there's no bamboozling. The White House didn't redefine a recession, as you've admitted every time you cite the NBER's definition.\n\nIt's OK to say that all of these other factors point to a possible recession, I'm not arguing that... what I'm arguing is that you're skewing data to claim some grand political conspiracy when ironically everything you're citing is all public data and agrees with the administration and the Fed.\n\nAbandon the conspiracy bullshit and the politicking based on misunderstanding the data and I'm on board with your argument that a recession is likely, but we can only get there by agreeing on bedrock principles.\n\nOne of those principles is that we are not just wandering aimlessly in the dark and questioning data is not the same as it being useless. We can assess magnitude of imperfection and come to conclusions, like the fact that 0.2% wobble in this environment in the numbers you cited doesn't really mean anything.\n\nWe also need to agree that the NBER has long held that a recession is not just based on GDP and as such no one's redefining anything.\n\nYou've already admitted that point is bullshit every time you cite the NBER methodology, so just fucking be consistent and abandon the bullshit.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">I am saying that the FRED data uses a declaration which heavily relies on unemployment.\n\nYou're missing my point.\n\nShow me the NBER calculation used to determine a recession has a heavy weight assigned to employemnt and you have a point.\n\nYou don't have thay calculation.

The NBER wouldn't take notice of an 80% unemployment rate.\n\n>the FRED data uses a declaration which heavily relies on unemployment\n\n?\n\nThat just doesn't make any sense.\n\nYour argument is the FRED uses the NBER determination of a recession in its data and that the NBER uses employment as a **major** data point in its determination. But the NBER thinks unemployment is irrelevant.\n\n>What I did was look at the numbers you're making a big deal about and assess their legitimacy in prediction and with regard to the veracity of the numbers\n\nYou're rejecting a thesis that unemployment data does not correlate to a recession based on the fact that a recession cannot be defined by the NBER.\n\nBut you're providing no suggestion as to how to how one could ascertain when a recession begins or ends so we could compare that to unemployment.\n\nI guess there is no way to define a recession in your mind.\n\nSo why bother discussing it at all.\n\nYou can't clearly demonstrate that unemployment levels do not have a correlation with a recession.\n\nBut you are certain unemployment levels do rise mid/late in a recession.\n\nYou're arguments are circuitous and self-contradicory.

You're focusing your argument on one sole point while ignoring all the other evidence I provided in support of the fact that, along with the FRED data, unemployment will rise.\n\nYou're trying to be right instead of considering more data that proves you're not.\n\nJust like the Fed and the White House.\n\n>unemployment has a relationship to calculated workforce participation and is dependent on that number. What I'm discussing here is the statistical implications of people leaving and re-entering the job market, which influences unemployment numbers.\n\nCorrect. And, coincidentally, both the labor participation rate and unemployment tend to behave the same way before and during a recession.\n\nA point I didn't bother to make because you so strongly object to the FREDs delineation of a recession vis a vis employment. (because it's based on NBER data which you state has a *major* factor which you can't actually know).\n\n>you're skewing data to claim some grand political conspiracy when ironically everything you're citing is all public data and agrees with the administration and the Fed.\n\nAnother straw man argument.\n\nI did not state there was \"a grand political conspiracy\".

That's either bullshit or naivety.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "There's nothing to respond to here. Your response is just vomit from the very start.\n\nIt's pretty straightforward: The NBER uses unemployment as a primary criteria for whether we're in a recession or not and it's a side effect of a mass indicator broad economic decline, which is necessary to be in an **economic** recession.\n\nNot a GDP recession... an economic recession.\n\nThat's not debatable, you've already said it several times, yet when I say it you move the goalposts and say I need to show their formula or that you have these 4 other reasons (which were not in the original argument and are not in the \"correct\" {to you} definition of recession you keep using repeatedly which is two periods of negative GDP)... you just keep trying to dodge the obvious reality which is that to have an actual decline in overall broad economic activity across every sector you need to actually have a meaningful and broad economic decline in overall activity, which GDP does not alone represent.\n\nIt's easy to understand, but it doesn't reinforce your biases so you're doing somersaults to avoid seeing even the most basic sliver of light.\n\nFor instance:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That 315K loss is very relevant in comparison to the 372K gain that the BLS is also representing took place in a different survey. That was the point.  \n>  \n>There is a discrepancy of 687K in those numbers. When discussing numbers that are 300-400K, that is hugely relevant.\n\nI already explained this, and the BLS report you linked also explains it.\n\nThese numbers do not actually conflict, which you'd know if you read the report. What you are seeing is overlap in the data because the two surveys happen side by side at different rates through the month.\n\nThe BLS employment situation survey you're all in a wad over at [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm) shows the following relevant statistics:\n\nCivilian labforce: -353k\n\nWorkforce Participation rate change: -0.1% (this is subject to rounding error, and the number is between -0.1 and -0.2% once accounted for)\n\nEmployed: -315k\n\nUnemployment rate: 3.6% (unchanged)\n\nSome of these are retirements, deaths, etc... people who actually left the laborforce. I don't need to go into deeper data than that because it's not really up for debate. Every month people die and retire, and it's a factor that we already agree on.\n\nIn the end, you made the claim that this survey said we lost \"315k jobs.\"\n\nIt does not say that, it says workforce participation rate reduced by around that amount. You don't think there's a difference because you don't understand the source of this data or how it's calculated.\n\nTo get this data, the BLS asks two questions:\n\n1. Are you currently employed?\n2. Have you been searching for a job in the past 4 weeks?\n\nPeople who have accepted new jobs (in your \"created jobs\" data in the month of June) are quite likely to be between jobs, still on the payroll from their old job, and  may or may not be on the official payroll at their new job yet.\n\nThe BLS does not survey the entire country, so these are projections based on a sample. That produces statistical risk wobble. Because this overlap exists between the two reports, ask yourself this question:\n\n**Would people accepting new jobs in June be likely to be out of a job and not looking for a job during the period between jobs?**\n\n**The answer is \"of course they fucking are\" and this is the reason why the numbers are constantly being revised.**\n\n**This is a known limitation of the two datapoints. It does not represent an additive discrepancy of 687k jobs, which is hands down of all of the dumb things you've said the dumbest fucking thing you said. A learning disabled 9th grader in a high school stats class would know not to add these fucking numbers.**\n\nWhat will happen when you have unemployment stay the same and an increase in filled jobs is that someone has to leave their original job to go to their new job. There will then often be a lag filling the old job, and that's exaggerated lag when there are limited candidates like right now.\n\n**I'm not pulling anything out of the ether here. Anyone who's ever had a job knows it works this way.**\n\n**I don't need any extra data to prove it, because it's in the fucking data you already provided.**\n\nBut either you don't understand that data, or you're intentionally misrepresenting it.\n\nIn response you're saying I'm trying to say it's too complex to assess... to the contrary, **I'm saying that if you actually fucking consider the way the BLS gets the data and the mechanics of the labor force, it's not that mystical or uncertain or imprecise at all. In fact, the BLS is pretty open about how imprecise the data is and isn't.**\n\n# Unlike you, I actually took the time to work the numbers to see if they matched your claim, and they don't.\n\nAnd yes, my analysis of this datapoint doesn't take into account any of your other points because I'm only assessing this one point in this response.\n\nYou say that's \"sharpshooter bias\" but for that to be the case, I'd have to be arguing that a recession is not likely, and therefore your other datapoints would be relevant.\n\nBut as I have said multiple times, sometimes in bolded letters, I am not saying we are definitely not entering into a recession. In fact, in the very post you're responding to I acknowledged that those 4 points are possible signs of economic weakness. (Whether they are or not is a much longer discussion.)\n\nYou made a specific claim, I referenced your own data to demonstrate that it doesn't mean what you think it does.\n\nThe bottom line here is that you are apparently incapable of doing full research before forming opinions, having fallen into a rather deep pit of logic failures in trying to collect data to make your claims... first in completely misunderstanding the FRED chart and now with a thoroughly and extraordinarily basic misunderstanding of BLS statistical data... not to mention a complete and total butchering of the very field of statistical analysis... in order to create an absurd claim that we can't see big layoff data in current unemployment data.\n\nMy point here is that we can measure the degree of imprecision and understand where there are contradictions by digging into the data.\n\nYou are literally saying \"It's too complex, so let's throw our hands in the air and just not use the data.\"\n\nYou keep accusing me of that in an extraordinarily infantile and stupid projection play, but that's basically the entire point you're making about unemployment and it's just dumb.\n\nIf we lost 1M jobs this past month, it's going to show up in the data. It'll be significant. The degree of imprecision here is knowable and these numbers don't conflict the way you think they do.\n\nNo amount of muddying the water, or misattribution, or claims of fallacies (which are almost all bullshit on your part representing a lack of understanding of fallacies, too), or bad math that would keep you behind a year in elementary school is going to change that.\n\nSee here's the thing, though: Your trollish, Internet debate methods give you away. I don't think you're actually dumb enough to come to stupid conclusions like the idea that this data is readily comparable such that you can claim there's a discrepancy.\n\nI think you know your argument's a misrepresentation of the data, so you're trying to cover it up by confusing the thread and using alt-right style inertia methods akin to 4chan and projecting your own arguments onto me.

At worst, people are ginning this up for clicks or political/economic motivations.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many times people modified Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not an authoritative source on what a recession is.\n\nOver 20 years ago, when I got my education, the definition of a recession as being more than just GDP retraction was pretty well set in, and had been for decades before that. It is true that there is no universally agreed-upon definition of a recession among economists (which is true for most things in economics because this is not a simple discipline).\n\nThe problem is that \"recession\" is a loaded term, and GDP retraction DOES NOT always result in the types of behavior people commonly associate with a recession, like mass economic difficulty and spending reductions of significant scale.\n\nThis is why the extended definition matters. We typically in common discussion say \"a recession is technically two periods of negative GDP\" because two periods of negative GDP is a relatively rare of an occurrence and we want to calm people down who get freaked out over ANY negative GDP print (which is not as rare as people think and doesn't always mean what people think it does).\n\nUnfortunately, people are generally unsophisticated and complicated topics confuse them, so autistically delving into complex topics as I'm prone to do doesn't always penetrate (as I'm sure it will not penetrate for many people here who either do not want to understand this topic or who are talking their book, and I will let people figure out who is who but both types of people exist in this sub).  So we tend to stay away from the complex part of the discussion until we have to address it.\n\nAlso unfortunately, this leads to misconceptions, like the conclusion drawn about the FRED chart on unemployment.\n\nThat chart tracks declared recessions. The fact that unemployment is a lagging indicator from declared recessions is not revelational. It's literally in the criteria the NBER uses to declare a recession...\n\nWhen we're looking at the FRED graph, if we understand that the NBER declares recessions based on factors like unemployment elevation rather than just negative GDP, it's not a surprise that the shaded grey areas are where the unemployment spikes are and end when they slow.\n\nThat's just in the fucking definition being used to shade the graph, and is NOT the question we're asking looking forward. This is a fantastic example of mining the history in a chart to find a pattern that doesn't exist looking forward.\n\n# The REAL question: Does two periods of GDP retraction predictably lead to a recession as defined by the NBER (meaning with the social ills we associate with recessions)?\n\nIf you overlay the graph of relative GDP changes, which is the datapoint that is actually pertinent, not recessions that don't fit that definition looking back, you'll find that decline in relative growth rate is not strictly tied to the social and economic issues people tie to recessions, like market crashes and mass unemployment spikes.\n\nSo can we look forward and predict a market crash from GDP retraction?\n\nThe answer is that this condition is more common than crashes, and so we cannot do so.\n\nThe logic used to claim that a crash is predictable on the basis of tracking low unemployment is also flawed because it uses the same flawed logic people use when they say \"VIX is at support, so the market has to crash.\"\n\nNo it fucking does not have to crash, and a lot of people got washed out this past week thinking this same broken logic. (I got washed out from my puts, too, as I was also short-heavy, but not because I fell into the VIX idiot trap.)\n\nLagging indicators cannot, by definition, predict the future. VIX lags and unemployment lags... this is only a surprise to people who do not understand the topic. What happens is that these conditions happen frequently enough that people build tactical methodologies around them and losing a certain number of times is manageable.\n\nWhat isn't manageable is dumping all of your money in puts because someone on the Internet told you that GDP was a reliable indicator for crashes based on the wrong data that is backward looking, not forward looking, nor even tied to the claim about GDP.\n\n**Now I want to be clear, and I'm going to bold this so people fucking get it. I'm NOT convinced the bear market is over, nor am I convinced that we won't have a recession...**\n\n...**my point is simply to educate people and clarify that the information in this post DOES NOT PROVE THE CLAIM.**\n\nIt's an interesting argument, but the chart and the argument do not prove definitively that the bear market is intact as presented. It may in fact be, and I am not betting that it's over. We do not have confirmation of that in the chart based on past review of volume and price action trends of prior corrections/crashes.\n\nI'm just really tired of people talking their book frankly lying about people redefining a recession when that's not the case.\n\nAnd it's bad advice to suggest that it's a sure thing that we're taking another leg down on this basis, when we really don't know that. Much of the market is already down between 50-80% at the trough, which if we're going to oscillating indicators like market breadth as an indication is a pretty good sign of the end of a bear market. People will tell you that a capitulation crash has to occur where megacaps all take the same hit.. it historically does not.\n\nThe most reliable indicator I've found of a reversal is the flattening and breaking of On Balance Volume trends, because they correlate price and volume in the market, and that correlates to buying inflow which is what really decides reversals. Even then, the trend can fake people out and we do not have confirmation there yet even though the OBV trend is looking like it's possibly ready for a bullish reversal.\n\nSo I recommend a guarded position. I don't think it's sound fiscal advice to suggest a switch to short here if you're positioned bullish except with regard to a contrarian or guarded portfolio stature.\n\nRemember: Somebody's selling you those puts and people are buying puts themselves, and all of them have reason to convince you that a crash is a sure thing so you behave in that manner. Be skeptical. Ask if the information you're being given even makes sense given the situation we're in. Ask if there are conflicting factors, such as the behavior of institutions and addressable capital to put into the market (which is a major factor now because the Fed is NOT pulling all of the capital out of the market... hell they're barely making a dent which makes our current situation very unique relative to past corrections and GDP declines).\n\nSo be wary of arguments like the OP. Nothing in economics is so cut and dry, and the market is \\*definitely\\* not cut and dry and predictable like this. If it was, 2020 would have been a year long bloodbath based on macro scare factors... but it wasn't because context and addressable capital matters.\n\nI'm not necessarily accusing Stockpreacher of that, as I don't know what his motivation is... he may be falling victim to confirmation bias here and may honestly think the cornerstone of their argument means what he thinks it does.

What you're retracing from matters. The amount of capital in the system matters. The social contexts (which drive demand and spending patterns) matter.\n\nFor instance there's an assumption that there's going to be a massive crash in the housing market a la 2008 among some posts here, but the context really is different than 2008 and while I fully expect a continued decline in price in many markets, the debate is really about what happens to that market and whether it replicates prior extreme examples, and there are several things which will help keep the real estate market somewhat propped up, including the Fed continue MBS sequestration and holding risk for the banks and the extreme increase in liquidity in the market particularly among housing speculators.

There always have to winners and losers in the market, and there are lots of ways to find advantage in the market, so deciding when and where to buy is hard whether it's stocks or real estate.\n\nThe big question for me, based on what we learned in 2020, is how much liquidity will be addressable in the system. That's what really drives the market:\n\n\\- How much capital is available to institutions?\n\n\\- How much does accessing that capital cost?\n\n\\- What's the potential for growth? (will offset capital cost)\n\n\\- What's the risk-free rate of return? (The maximum gain from a sure-thing investment, like a 10y T-bill or other type of secured bond)\n\n\\- What's the directional risk in the market, and how do existing market metrics reflect buying tendencies?\n\nThis is a good place to start. This is where you combine your macro, chart, and fundamentals and micros data to find a place to play.\n\n**--- My trending methodology, in brief ---**\n\nRight now we're trending down, so overall bullet point 5 is weighting equity valuations heavily. There are multiple ways to trend the market, but personally I draw a lot from SMMA and EMA matrixes comprised of the SMMA 20, 50, 100, and 200 and EMAs 8, 21, and 50. I do this on the one-year SPY chart (daily candlesticks).\n\nIf you go to tradingview and set these up and zoom out, you'll find that they align in specific ways where the short term moving averages are aligned at the top and the longer term are aligned at the bottom during bull markets. During bear trends it's exactly the opposite, and when the market is flipping directions all kinds of patterns emerge where the averages cross (many youtube and other videos suggest playing these crosses, but in my experience they're only sometimes tradeable - by definition crosses represent periods of volatility and can as a result lead to fake-outs).\n\nI use two charts to do this. The SMMA-based one I call strategic because I'm tracking long term trends. The EMA one is short term, and reflects different patterns in the short range. For SMMAs, because it's longer term, I use the close metric. For the EMAs I use high and low lines, so that I see the range like a cloud on a daily basis. The tactical chart gives short term signals. The strategic term chart confirms the prevailing trend.\n\nOn the Strategic chart, I setup Fibonacci ranges, looking for measured movements and breaks of pattern. Breaks of pattern often coincide with reversals. This is a little tricky, but can be used with Pitchfork and channel analysis to find inflection points, and when the market doesn't continue on a pattern trend at an inflection point where a range and a channel intersect, it's usually violent and causes an unwinding or cover event on a trendline break when backed by reinforcing price action and volume structure.\n\nThere's actually a lot to this and I can't explain all of it right now, but the cornerstone is actually On Balance Volume. I also use channel analysis, trendline intersection on the short term (I'm not 100% sold on the relevance of long-term trend lines), RSI/MACD/Bollinger Bands for minor confirmation and trending (though these are of limited tactical value), and Pitchfork meanline trending based around the fact that the market tends to trade within 2 standard deviations of its established trend meanline until a break happens. (The market broke above this this week, btw)\n\n**--- The importance of On Balance Volume in verifying trend changes and changes in market sentiment ---**\n\nOn Balance Volume measures price action against volume, and volume trends over time dominate outcomes in trends. If people are buying into the market, it'll go up... and if you don't have inflow, it'll go down. There's always a little selling in the market, but buying to balance the selling is only reliable if reinforced by exuberance and trust in the market, but that's driven by the trending since any bull trend induces FOMO.\n\nWhen a bear market rally happens, typically OBV respects its trend. A person looking just at EMAs in March-April would have been faked out on trend, seeing the price action take SPY up into the bullish territory, but OBV respected a long running trend while breaking a short term weak trend, and when it hit the trend (going back to December 3rd) the market began another leg down. OBV can bounce, settle, and then bounce down since it reflects market price, But divergence in OBV that lasts, like when you price for SPY is lower but your OBV is higher than it should be, usually reflect a volatile change and when OBV begins to find support stepping its way up, that can be a sign of reversal of the market. It reflects buyers coming back in volume.\n\n**This is why the institutions are important.**\n\nWhen the Fed began raising rates and tightening, they increased the cost and the race to sell created the pattern of fear that drove institutions to de-leverage and preserve capital. With continuing uncertainty and bad news about the cost of capital and availability of capital from banks in the form of loans (since Fed tightening increases bank reserve capital drawdown - which is a mixed bag for banks right now since it increases their reserve utilization while also increasing risk for new loans), and with the 10y bond going up, the risk-free rate of return against growth prospects was balanced against elevated returns in bonds.\n\nBut the Fed's been influencing the bond market through QT resulting in higher bond volume, which has been influencing the yield curve along with sentiment.\n\nWhat are 10y bond yields doing now? Going down, reflecting a reduction in a risk-free rate of return.\n\nWhere are relative valuations for equities? Down heavily, meaning the potential for growth on return of capital to the market exists.\n\nCapital cost is more expensive, but if the Fed slows raising rates, now there's more certainty about future potential for measurable return rate, which means less risk in buying decisions (since getting stuck while on margin doesn't inherently result in the risk of having to finance at greater and greater rates outside of a predictable rate).\n\nAnd even with tightening, the Fed's not gonna get anywhere near the excess capital in the reserve system... that's gonna remain elevated relative to baseline. We pulled 10 years forward in the banking reserve expansion plan...that's not all coming out at once. It'd destroy the country to do that. So the plan will be to get it down to like 2025-2026 levels is my guess and continue growing from there.\n\nMeaning that liquidity addressable will increase, not decrease over time as people are presuming as banks become more sure of capital deployment and less concerned about Fed fund rate hikes. Banks don't get anything from idle capital, so a reduction in callback risk is tantamount to a demand to increase the rate of lending or investors will punish banks that fall behind, the higher interest environment will eventually (once risk has reduced) actively promote increased lending.\n\nThen you have all of the capital that was in the market when the market topped in Dec/January. That's still floating around out there looking for a home. That is not getting taken out of the market. That shit's here to stay.\n\n**Add this all up. Is the greater force economic uncertainty that we all currently expect and are looking for, or is it structural capital liquidity flows?**\n\nThere's no clear answer to this right now. Preacher's arguing that the economic risk still represents increased threat of uncertainty, and aside from the things I disagree with about what he said in his position, I do agree that uncertainty remains heavily elevated.\n\nBut does that matter if the lack of a threat of reduced access to capital and the lack of a significant relative increase in cost of capital promotes institutional lending, resulting in and reinforcing a dominant trend?\n\nThat last part will happen a LONG time before the macro uncertainty abates.\n\nSo we must be guarded, but there's absolutely no guarantee the market will do what we think it should based on sentiment. **There's too much structurally reinforcing potential for buying to not entertain the thought of market/economic divergence.**", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "If recession started in Jan, this would be the only recession on your graph where unemployment was steadily decreasing.

Therefore, this could be an indicator that we are in the early stages of a recession. \n\nFollow?\n\n>and it will only become clear months after it's too late to act. \n\nNo.\n\nUnemployment does not always take months to grow in an appreciable way (go pull your own chart of unemployment rates and look).\n\nThe unemployment rate is released Friday. It has been at 3.6% for 4 months which could mean a bottom (especially because it's also the lowest it's been in 50 years).\n\n3.5% or lower means unemployment is down and supports the thesis that we are not in a recession.\n\n3.6% is inconclusive.\n\n3.7%+ supports the thesis that we are in the early stages of a recession.\n\n>at the moment it looks like we're in an awfully weird recession with low unemployment\n\nAgain, low unemployment is typical at the early stages of a recession. That was in my post and supported by the FRED chart I posted.\n\n>robust profits\n\nI posted a source above that shows earnings are below the 5 year average.\n\nI posted two sources that show profits are declining.\n\nYou're just wrong.\n\n>and high inflation\n\nI guess you haven't heard of an [inflationary recession](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation#:~:text=In%20economics%2C%20stagflation%20or%20recession,and%20unemployment%20remains%20steadily%20high.)\n\nAnd you didn't research your idea (like you don't seem to do with any of your nonesene opinions).

The committee's view is that while each of the three criteria—depth, diffusion, and duration—needs to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions revealed by one criterion may partially offset weaker indications from another. For example, in the case of the February 2020 peak in economic activity, we concluded that the drop in activity had been so great and so widely diffused throughout the economy that the downturn should be classified as a recession even if it proved to be quite brief. The committee subsequently determined that the trough occurred two months after the peak, in April 2020. An expansion is a period when the economy is not in a recession. Expansion is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief.
