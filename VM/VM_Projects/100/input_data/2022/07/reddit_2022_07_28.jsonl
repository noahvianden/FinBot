No way we get there in 2023. We don’t even know if inflation has peaked yet. We’re not going to see larger base effects (from the YoY comps) on the CPI until October, so I doubt we see any notable disinflation until *at least* then. That may even be wishful thinking as the longer inflation persists the harder it becomes to predict and control as the psychological component of it takes hold. Not to mention other factors such as energy crises that could continue to exacerbate the problem. 2024 would be more realistic, but if the fed stops tightening, or god forbid starts easing again due to economic weakness…how could anyone think we’re getting back to normal in those conditions? The whole idea of a recession killing inflation ignores the fact the money supply has increased by 40% since Feb 2020. Prices are still adjusting upwards because of this. The only way a recession kills this inflation is if it causes the money supply to contract substantially. The irony there is that when that happens the Fed has a history of turning the printers on…so only time will tell what they decide to do. They’re stuck between a rock and a hard place. Are they going to let it all crash and burn, or go brrr again?\n\n> It’s going to be a volatile summer, coalescing in overvalued assets tanking harder than we’ve seen these last 7 months.\n\nYeah, I think we’re going to have some volatile years ahead of us as the Fed ping-pongs around trying to fight inflation one minute, then trying to prop up the economy the next. I’m definitely in the stagflation camp. Inflation is going to average higher than what the markets think right now, and growth is going to suck.

How does that relate to the NBER’s recession dates?\n\nA: Most of the recessions identified by our procedures do consist of two or more consecutive quarters of declining real GDP, but not all of them. In 2001, for example, the recession did not include two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. In the recession from the peak in December 2007 to the trough in June 2009, real GDP declined in the first, third, and fourth quarters of 2008 and in the first and second quarters of 2009. Real GDI declined for the final three quarters of 2001 and for five of the six quarters in the 2007–2009 recession.\n\nQ: Why doesn’t the committee accept the two-quarter definition?\n\nA: There are several reasons. First, we do not identify economic activity solely with real GDP, but consider a range of indicators. Second, we consider the depth of the decline in economic activity. The NBER definition includes the phrase, “a significant decline in economic activity.” Thus real GDP could decline by relatively small amounts in two consecutive quarters without warranting the determination that a peak had occurred. Third, our main focus is on the monthly chronology, which requires consideration of monthly indicators. Fourth, in examining the behavior of production on a quarterly basis, where real GDP data are available, we give equal weight to real GDI. The difference between GDP and GDI—called the “statistical discrepancy”—was particularly important in the recessions of 2001 and 2007–2009.\n\nEDIT: But hey, I’m spreading misinformation right?

They are there to tow the line for the govt and corporate America which truly are one and the same with the fed being the sugar daddy paying for their loses and ensuring they survive while small\nBiz gets irradiated. This is the plan, there’s a reason Covid allowed all big box retailers and national food chains to stay open while the average biz owner got screwed. Just wait til this upcoming winter, some bs shitshow bs will occur further suppressing the small biz owners. Look at trucking atm, owner operators are shutting shop while the massive national fleets continue on. The O/O’s can’t compete with the low pricing brokers are offering for loads and the big fleets are able to absorb the lower load payouts. It’s the exact same game as Covid but using the supply chain to destroy independent truckers. This is all about redistribution of wealth and consolidation of all types of businesses into the hands of corporations. Sucks to say it, but the more that time goes by I feel we are watching the final death woes of what was left of a free market where the average person can survive. We went from a single boomer being able to work and support a stay at home mother of a family to what we have now which is people making 50k/yr and STILL struggling. Older people having roommates is going to become extremely common if we the people don’t stand up to passive legislative tyranny. The best way to change a country without war is do do it from within, self-emulation of the current system so they can come with a solution that’s truly anything but a genuine solution. It’s been rinse and repeat since early 70s. Further back too, but it’s was more about wars to evolve. Today, is subversion and full blown propaganda against their own citizens. Be carful in the markets, sitting on cash is smart atm. No way we don’t have another 30-55% down to go. Bear rallies mean nothing, they are the final cries on the way down and those who will be crying are the retail folks hoping they times the bottom only to wake up one day and see they’re losing. Takes a while to hit the bottom, look at the way down as a staircase made of hills. Those hills are to induce the retail/average trader to take the bait. Trading atm, imo, should only be done for scalping, take your short 2-5% and gtfo so you can protect your capital. It’s best to have cash, have capital to invest at a good safe(ish) time vs playing around in an extremely volatile market. Remember, when tshtf it happens QUICK. Don’t hold that bag like the wealthy would like to see happen. Cash is king when a truly BAD crash seems likely. Don’t even mess with dollar coat averaging, just wait. We’re not on a scenario where people should be dca’ing unless you are positioned to sit on your investment for many years. We’re in unprecedented times, this is nothing like the mid 70s. Far more variables and the fed is showing their true colors buying up all the debt. What happens when they can no longer do that?

It doesn't make sense to look back to 1942, at the dawn of the widespread availability of antibiotics, for clues about a likely drawdown caused by a recession. WW II created a very different set of circumstances for the country than did the dot com implosion. I'd go so far as to say that circumstances have changed so much due to widespread telecommunications and computing that even looking back much before 2000 might be like trying to compare apples to oranges.\r  \n\r  \nThat said, I think that the median drawdown of -32% is reasonable. Reaching -20% from recent peak in June constitutes a bear market. Figuring out whether we're in a recession, if you believe the government, is more difficult because we're in a putatively paradoxical situation where unemployment is low, inflation is high, and the Fed is quantitatively tightening (QT). The government construes a recession as widespread economic slowing. I personally think that we are, indeed, in one, but QT takes a long time to play out and really show itself.\r  \n\r  \nI think in one year to eighteen months, we'll see increasing mortgage loan defaults, car loan defaults, and higher unemployment. The way that the government construes unemployment leaves out all of the people who have given up trying to find a job. As for the supposed millions of unfilled jobs, many of them are minimum wage, sometimes hazardous jobs that no one wants.\r  \n\r  \nWhat the government never seems to want to acknowledge is the real cause of inflation: massive money-printing that expanded the money supply by more than 40%. The supply chain is a red herring. Until that \"extra\" money is burned up, or the population grows into the expanded money supply, inflation will keep going. On the former possibility, The JPow has already deleted a great deal of money via the stock and options markets. Still, according to the Buffett Indicator, SPY is substantially overvalued. This overvaluation is unhealthy. It means that at some point, a trapdoor could open beneath us suddenly.\r  \n\r  \nI personally believe that SPY will move down by another leg, but it will involve a slow burn that will unfold over the course of the next year to eighteen months. While it's difficult to make predictions because we're in unprecedented times, with the ever-evolving virus and a geopolitical reorientation underway, it's helpful to remember that:\r  \n\r  \nBear markets have never ended without a recession being declared by the government.\r  \n\r  \nIn a bear market, you see high volatility and relief rallies that will fool many people into thinking that the coast is clear, when it's not.\r  \n\r  \nThe only way that we'll truly know that the bear market is over is when the POWcycles stop grinding share prices down. (If you're not familiar with what a POWcycle is, you can look up five long posts on the topic on Reddit.)\r  \n\r  \nWhat I'm personally looking for is three consecutive months of market stability. I want to see $VIX fall and stay below 20.00. I want to see internal market dynamics (e.g. stocks rising versus falling) shift dramatically upward. Right now, growth stocks are, effectively, dead money. I want to see that turn around when the Fed stops QT, presumably in 2023.\r  \n\r  \nThe stock market is a challenging place to make money right now. One or two days of green doesn't change that. Wealth is about playing the long game, not what happens over the course of two or three days. I'm surprised by the recent positive earnings. We'll need to see whether that will also be the case for Q3.\r  \n\r  \nHang in there, and tread cautiously.

So indeed, if you think that this is is the start of a new Bull market, and that the markets bottomed in June, then you are assuming that the current recession is going to continue on for a couple more quarters and then the US economy will start entering into a period of sustained growth. Now that may not be a bad assumption and indeed you may be right but I’m in the camp that’s forecasting a long sustained period of negative GDP growth because the conditions we facing now we haven’t faced in 40 years.

If that hadn’t happened then the  US economy would have gone into a Depression and markets would probably have shed another 50%.

I really dont know what the accounting terms are (though I did take courses long ago... im just not a memorizer). What I see is its $25b more in pocket if I cut down a discretionary expense. If my R&D no longer provides me with innovation, then I cut it. Its not a expense that I need to operate. How it shows up in the accounting is less important to me as long as it ends up in my pocket. That said, it would definitely influence PE eventually, it has to, the money didnt come out of no where, so if it were cut, PE would definitely reflect it somehow. Thats what I meant by saying \"misleading.\"\n\nThe problem with PE isnt the stat, its the how we interpret it. Most folks will look at it and immediately say overvalued compared to peers. Well we just had a discussion about why that is not necessarily true. We obviously have different background so we may be saying the same thing but in different ways.\n\nIn Amazons case, at some point, that spending will slow and it will become cash in pocket because they cant possibly continue to innovate they way they have the last 20 years... can they? Maybe but that would very hard. Which means that eventually the expense will cool off and they will focus on profits.\n\nFor the record, I like what they are doing with the R&D. The stuff they are working is both impressive and has important application especially if we want the USA to grow and compete with the world. So for me, I want them to keep plowing forward with logistical and warehouse automation. I want them to figure out home robotics.

And I kinda meant that everyone's going to buy an EV, but in some sense I suspect it's going to feel like *everyone* is buying a Tesla very soon.\n\nThere's a good chance that the Model Y is currently the best selling car in the world right now (with 4 factories pumping them out and Toyota's corolla and Rav4 sales down a bit from their historical highs). And that trend is just going to continue and very quickly, within a year or two, we're going to be in completely uncharted territory with Teslas in general and the Model Y in particular being an *extremely* popular choice.\n\nHere's some stats I've been thinking about, trying to put this in context:\n\n* At the end of this year Model Y production will probably be at over a 1m/year run rate, maybe in the 1.25 m range?\n* It'll definitely be the highest selling car by revenue this year, it'll probably be the best selling car in the 2nd half of the year, and it might be close to the best selling car of the year (and the Model 3 will probably be top 10 somewhere)\n* The modern car with the most sales in a single year was the VW beetle with 1.3 million in 1971, the Model Y could outsell that next year\n* Tesla will probably end next year with a Model Y run rate over 2 million/year. It's hard to predict much more after that, it all depends on how much they focus on different products, but that seems like an achievable production and sales goal\n* The best selling car in a single year of all time was the Model T with a 2 million sales year (about 100 years ago), and that was at a time when most people didn't have a car and it was priced like a fancy appliance ($5,000ish in today's dollars)\n\nA few years at that kind of pace, and the Model Y will quickly start catching up  with the numbers for the most sold cars ever. Compare it to something like the Prius, which seemingly became very popular very quickly in some areas. It seemed like \"everyone was buying a Prius\". But really, it took them 3 generations of the car (so three different cars that shared similar parts and design) to really hit big numbers and 16 years to hit 3 million total sales. The Model Y has been on sale for just over 2 years at this point. When it's been on sale for 5 or 6 years, there's the chance that it could be selling 3 million units *per year*. I mean, that would be incredibly aggressive, but it certainly seems like it's in the realm of possibility at least?\n\nAnd then Tesla will probably build out Model 3 lines at Austin and Berlin? Maybe do a Model 3 refresh at some point to add single piece castings? And also launch the Cybertruck and selling hundreds of thousands of those easily, just in the US, with the sales being limited by how many they can make. I could see it easily being another 1 million/year car, just in the US.\n\nHow will people react to that relatively fast and completely unprecedented popularity? Will people treat it like the iphone, where suddenly it seems like \"everyone has one\" and so everyone needs buy one to keep up with the Joneses? Or will it seem like a boring choice to buy the obvious best car that everyone buys? Will Model S/X sales jump way up because people want to buy a Tesla so they're going to buy the best one? Or will Teslas be so common that even a luxury Tesla doesn't stand out (similar to the problem Toyota had, and the reason they made Lexus). Will Tesla start advertising to try and influence the perception of these cars that suddenly are everywhere?\n\nThere's probably going to be Tesla memes about how popular they are in the next 2-5 years.

A mean reversion for a deep negative sentiment results in positive movement. The psychology of the market is about navigating these sentiment considerations to try to find inflection points for profit.\n\nBut while people focus on the psychology as a primary mover of the market (because it reinforces our biases about individual control of outcomes) the REAL primary mover of the market is institutions who are responsible for 80% of the volume and holdings in the market. They position based on structural access to liquidity, since institutions are paid to deploy accessible capital in the market based on risk and availability. When capital is released to them because risk is reduced (as it is when we get most of the rate hikes visible out of the way) they buy... and they buy broadly and they buy across multiple sectors, which is why everything goes up on certainty events.\n\nWhether bullish trends fizzle or not depends on uncertainty and the return of buying volume.\n\nRight now we're going up on low volume, which is a sign of \\*potential\\* reversal, but de facto buying on low volume can also sometimes be a sign of a change in relative sentiment. Earlier in the year we declined on low volume, demonstrating de facto sentiment.\n\nWhat we're looking for is an increase in volume balance as the market goes up, as that would indicate a stronger market reversal in the presence of increased institutional capital deployment.\n\nThis is why the market rallied so hard during the pandemic when many of the macro indicators were so bad, and it's what's driving both the up and down trend now, and it's why so much of this doesn't make sense when we try to apply our own rational frame to the market... so much of this is structural when we're told it's psychological.\n\nPersonally I think there are still lots of unknowns, so I don't trust this bullish trend yet... it's very new and weak on volume and I think anyone saying it's all green lights is missing the larger context, but if you're confused about why it's going up now, think about how certainty events like this influence institutional access to capital and it'll make more sense.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Transitory recession", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Don’t you dare dead name this beautiful xueen economy", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Wait til open it'll go down", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Okay.

Yes, politicians will try to deny this fact (gasp).

I think the highest level for any previous recession was under 4 million.\n\nAlso, the economy can be fucked up without technically being in a recession.
