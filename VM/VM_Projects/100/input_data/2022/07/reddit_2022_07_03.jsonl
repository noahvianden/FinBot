Also the caveat that I'm mostly just keeping up with the market on the majors through outside news since I work for an independent upstream only company.\n\nMy take is that in the mid 2010s, prices crashed pretty quickly with OPEC opening up their supply. Before, many projects were profitable and gaining production was key well above operating prudently and cheaply. Spending excess dollars on finding new developments was great to keep future horizons open and deepen your reserve sheet. But now, at lower prices, all of a sudden only the best plays are making money. Therefore everyone pulled back and started only drilling their best stuff, thinking this was a short lived problem. When doing this there isn't much incentive to explore because you already have plays in your back pocket at higher breakevens and your balance sheet can't take much of a hit to explore. So everyone bunkered down. \n\nWell, fast forward a few years and this has started to feel like the new normal. Operators are getting better at being profitable, but there still isn't much being done for new exploration. Because of this, a lot of company's reserves sheets are starting to look a bit smaller than they'd like. They also aren't immune to the world around them and start to try to hedge for the new energy future you mentioned. This also (largely I believe) is being driven at the investor level. During this timeframe, investing in oil and gas was terrible and banks were getting fed up. They not only weren't getting a return, but public opinion was turning too and so the majors needed to find another way to appeal to them.\n\nThen, this year happens and they make a big windfall that they haven't had in a while. With investors getting shafted in years past the majors want to do what they can to build faith in that community and bring investment back and so they do anything they can to bring their price up. Also, at the lower levels there's worry that these other companies that are now sitting on cash are going to buy you out if your price isn't high enough so you better raise yours too.\n\nThat's also completely ignoring that the people making a lot of these decisions (the boards) have a lot of money tied up in these companies and finally they can strike to get a return and so they are.

It‚Äôs like casting a line out and reeling it back in immediately because a fish didn‚Äôt bite during the 2 seconds the lure was in the water.\n\nSome people make a living or try to make a living day-trading, and it‚Äôs a fool‚Äôs errand.

Same with daytrading stocks. \n\nI would read Peter Lynch‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Up on Wall Street‚Äù (and ‚ÄúBeating the Street‚Äù after that).

Same with those individual tech stocks. Hating on ARKK is a meme but the only thing more foolish than thinking $300/share for TDOC was a good idea (if you bought ARKK near the peak you basically subscribed to the belief that TDOC @ $300 was a good idea), is thinking that Cathie Wood has no idea what she‚Äôs doing and ARKK is doomed. Nobody can make that call after just this past year or two, because ARKK went from vastly outperforming the S&P 500/SPY to matching it, and only in the last couple of months has SPY done better than ARKK over the last 5 years. And Cathie Wood has said that‚Ä¶ they look at 5 year returns, because *of course they do*- it‚Äôs a volatile fund with volatile stocks. \n\nI have bounced back and forth between Cathie Wood being smart and being foolish, but again only time will tell and I would not be surprised to find ARKK makes a recovery by 2026. It‚Äôs just that nobody wants to wait that long, especially those who bought near the peak and saw 60% wiped out in less than a year. I get it, it‚Äôs hard to watch. To those people I would say A) you‚Äôre definitely not alone, plenty of people have lost more over the last year‚Ä¶ you could be dumber!, B) even the ‚Äúsmart people‚Äù who have everything in SPY are down 20% YTD, and C) the stock market goes up and down, and you want to buy when it‚Äôs down, even though it feels like the opposite of what you‚Äôd want to do.

I will say as a software engineer who works in AWS every day and worked in Azure every day before that, and has worked in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)‚Ä¶ I think there‚Äôs plenty of pie to go around to all three companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google). One of them may ultimately dominate the other two in the area of cloud, arguably AWS already is, but all three companies, it‚Äôs neat because they all make bank from The Cloud(TM) yet don‚Äôt compete with one another really, otherwise. So that‚Äôs why, to me, there‚Äôs enough pie to go around. Nvidia is a bit of a tough call. I do machine learning things as part of my job, I‚Äôm on an R&D team which is a sweet gig, we spend a lot of time experimenting and learning, and given the choice I don‚Äôt think any machine learning engineer or data scientist will pick AMD GPUs over NVIDIA. The support I find is almost always lacking for whatever software I‚Äôm using. ‚ÄúNvidia CUDA only‚Äù is a familiar phrase. Of course Nvidia doesn‚Äôt make most of their money from consumer GPU sales‚Ä¶ I think the FUD around crypto crashing is dragging it down unfairly. Still, its PE is kind of ridiculous, even now. The problem with a stock like NVDA is I could see it going to $100 and I could see it going to $1000. It‚Äôs like TSLA.

It all depends on your goals, time frame for achieving your goals and appetite for risk.  Plus how much time do you realistically have to devote to investing/stock picking?  If you consider yourself to be a ‚Äúlong-term investor‚Äù and you don‚Äôt need the money for decades then all the advice about holding the better big-tech stocks and maybe getting some dividends and selling some CC to collect premium while you wait for ‚Äúthings to come back‚Äù may make sense but it‚Äôs still a lot of work.  \n\nIf you don‚Äôt have the appetite or time to continue picking stocks in this market then DCA-ing into index ETFs as they go down more and then recover could definitely work with less effort on your part.   But depending on how much further we fall, you have to be prepared for how long you may have to wait to try to just break even much less grow your capital.  DCA-ing into those ETFs will help. Or holding some cash now and waiting to invest in those ETFs after they‚Äôve fallen further may make more sense.  You don‚Äôt have to reinvest immediately.  Cash is a position, too. \n\nSome History:  I was in index funds back in 2008 where I experienced a 50% or so drop and it took a really longggg time for my portfolio to recover losses and start to grow again.  About 7-8 years for the indexes to come back.  Too long in hindsight but I stayed the course and rode it down and then back up.  I lived to tell the tale but I certainly didn‚Äôt optimize my returns those years. \n\nIf you believe there‚Äôs more room for the market to fall or that we are heading for a recession (and many do but no one really knows for sure) then it‚Äôs about which risks do you want to take? Preserving some of your funds and staying in stagnant cash for awhile?  Or staying 100% in falling stocks and losing even more before we head back up? \n\nThere‚Äôs no one right strategy for everyone but I‚Äôm definitely approaching things differently than I did back in 2008.  First, I don‚Äôt consider myself a long term investor at this stage of my life.  I‚Äôm still learning the risk-management mindset of a shorter-term trader so preserving cash and limiting losses in a big market downturn is now my number one goal.   Trying to find tradable set-ups worth the risk in this market isn‚Äôt easy for me at least (I don‚Äôt short the markets but others do that more successfully) so I‚Äôm sitting on the sidelines in cash practicing patience and ‚Äúsit-out power‚Äù which Is hard to do but keeps me from getting chopped up by volatility. \n\nSo far, I‚Äôm down less than 4% this year and will be starting with at least 96% of my capital when I start back in.   Not trying to come back from 50% losses as I had to do back in 2008.  That was a hard lesson to learn but it just feels better to me to step aside for now and avoid the left side of the fall.   I may miss a few points on the way up but my base will be much higher than if I rode it down again.  There‚Äôll be plenty of time to buy big tech or anything else at much better valuations in the future, IMHO. \n\nI know taking losses is a hard pill to swallow and it might not be the best time for you to do so but for me taking losses when I‚Äôm down 5% or less feels far better than taking them at 50%.  There‚Äôs a reason they say ‚Äúyour first loss is your best loss.‚Äù  If I were in your shoes, I‚Äôd take some losses and be raising some cash now and keep building my cash hoard.  Even if the market is already down 20%, it can still head down another 20% or more.  Same for individual stocks. Those that are now down 50% can fall another 50% or more.  \n\nSince you don‚Äôt have to make it back where you lost it, preserving and raising some cash now means you live to fight another day when conditions start to improve.  Leadership often changes after a big market correction.  Studying past events shows that every time.  Many stocks and sectors may bottom and start recovering and go further and faster before big tech or more speculative tech does.    If you have cash when that happens you have the freedom to invest in those sectors that are heading back up first rather than waiting around for the sectors you invested in previously to get off the mat.  \n\nNot trading advice.

That said, I'm not sure about all of them reaching the highs you bought them at. But it's good you got out of the extremely speculative hype-stocks, because these companies actually have a future and are here to stay, even if the age of explosive growth is behind most of them.\n\nAnd index fund will give you a lot more safety to the downside for a smaller upside. It may well take several years to recoup the losses you made on these stocks as well. As for whether the index will do better and get there faster than your combination of these stocks, no one can tell you. Some of these stocks may have the upside of potentially getting there a lot faster. But on the other hand, I just cannot see NFLX reach 590 in the near future, or maybe ever, again.\n\nSo, think about your goals, think about when you need the money, think about your psyche as well. And that's a big part. No one can tell you which approach will perform better over the next 5, the next 10 years. One gives more safety than the others. So if you feel like it's weighing deep on your psyche now and you would feel much less affected if you had the money sit in an index fund where you don't see those kind of losses and will likely either only see minor red or green going forward, it is a valid option to rotate for that sake alone.

Try to not go \"I'm such an idiot, I should have stayed in GOOGL (which I think is likely to reclaim your cost basis the quickest btw) rather than going into the index\" in a few years if the choice you made turns out to be wrong.

That said, I think either choice is viable considering how solid companies most of them are. I do think NVDA and NFLX are the weakest out the bunch.\n\nAlso be aware of the size of these companies. MSFT at current prices is bordering a 2T market cap. That's insanely big. And it may be the best run company in the world imo, but at some point there will be a limit for how big they can get. And who knows where that limit is. But, you know, just to put it into perspective: The size of the french economy is slightly over $3T, the size of the german economy is just over $4T. So for MSFT to double it's stock price from here and essentially become a $4T market cap would mean that it would have size equal to the fourth largest economy in the world.\n\nYou think about how likely you think that is. I can't tell you either. Obviously the world's economies grow as well, but it feels like we shouldn't expect to see too many 5T+ companies. AAPL is a similar case. It reclaiming your cost basis would essentially mean that it would border on becoming a $3T market cap.\n\nThat said, the global GDP is expected to grow by almost 50% into 2027.\n\nIt also depends how big those positions are and what you plan going forward.

It takes emotional control, a disciplined approach, and a focus on doing what is right for the long term. It means sticking to what you understand (or your circle of competence).\r  \nThe formula for success hasn't changed in the last few centuries, and it seems unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.\r  \n**Rule No. 1: Buy Into Good Businesses**\r  \nBuy shares of good businesses that generate real profits, produce attractive returns on equity, have low to moderate debt-to-equity ratios, improve gross profit margins, and have shareholder-friendly management. This strategy can shave decades off your quest for financial independence, not to mention protect you if you happen to lose your job, think like Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett.\r  \n**Look for Good Value**\r  \nBear markets provide great opportunities for long term investors. The trick is to know what a good company looks like. Beaten up, battered, and underpriced, these are all descriptions of stocks during a bear market. Value investors such as Warren Buffett often view bear markets as great buying opportunities because good companies get hammered down, along with the overall market, and this is when good companies sit at very attractive valuations. Buffett often builds up his position in some of his favorite stocks during less-than-cheery times in the market because he knows the market's nature is to punish even good companies by more than they deserve.\r  \n**Free Cash Flow**\r  \nFree cash flow (FCF) is the cash produced by a company through its operations, minus the cost of expenditures. In other words, free cash flow is the cash left over after a company pays for its operating expenses and capital expenditures (CapEx).\r  \nFree cash flow shows how efficient a company is at generating cash and is an important metric in determining whether a company has sufficient cash, after funding operations and capital expenditures, to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\r  \nFree cash flow can be an early indicator to value investors that earnings may increase in the future, since increasing free cash flow typically precedes increased earnings. If a company has rising FCF, it could be due to revenue and sales growth, or cost reductions. In other words, rising free cash flows reward investors in the future, which is why many investors cherish high free cash flow as a measure of value.\r  \n**Price-to-Book Ratio**\r  \nThe price-to-book ratio or P/B ratio measures whether a stock is over or undervalued by comparing the net value (assets - liabilities) of a company to its market capitalization. Essentially, the P/B ratio divides a stock's share price by its book value per share (BVPS). The P/B ratio is a good indication of what investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's net value.\r  \nThe reason the ratio is important to value investors is that it shows the difference between the market value of a company's stock and its book value. The market value is the price investors are willing to pay for the stock based on expected future earnings. However, the book value is derived from a company's net value and is a more conservative measure of a company's worth.\r  \nA P/B ratio of 0.95, 1, or 1.1 means the underlying stock is trading at nearly book value. In other words, the P/B ratio is more useful the greater the number differs from 1. To a value-seeking investor, a company that trades for a P/B ratio of 0.5 is attractive because it implies that the market value is one-half of the company's stated book value.\r  \n**PEG Ratio**\r  \nThe price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a modified version of the P/E ratio that also takes earnings growth into account. The P/E ratio doesn't always tell you whether or not the ratio is appropriate for the company's forecasted growth rate. \r  \nThe PEG ratio measures the relationship between the price/earnings ratio and earnings growth. The PEG ratio provides a more complete picture of whether a stock's price is overvalued or undervalued by analyzing both today's earnings and the expected growth rate. \r  \nTypically a stock with a PEG of less than 1 is considered undervalued since its price is low compared to the company's expected earnings growth. A PEG greater than 1 might be considered overvalued since it might indicate the stock price is too high compared to the company's expected earnings growth. \r  \nSince the P/E ratio doesn't include future earnings growth, the PEG ratio provides a more complete picture of a stock's valuation. The PEG ratio is an important metric for value investors since it provides a forward-looking perspective.\r  \n**What is the Current Ratio?**\r  \nThe current ratio lets you know whether a business has enough cash to service their immediate debts and liabilities. The term ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù usually reflects a period of about 12 months. \r  \nIf a company‚Äôs current ratio is high, it means a company has enough cash on hand to pay its liabilities and also invest in improvements for the business. The higher the ratio is, the more capable a company is at paying off its debts and has more free cash to invest. Big companies like Amazon and Microsoft usually have quite a lot of cash, and so tend to have higher current ratios.\r  \nIf a company‚Äôs current ratio is low, it means they will have a difficult time paying immediate debts and liabilities.  \r  \nIn general, a current ratio of 1 or higher is considered good, and anything lower than 1 is a cause for concern. Good companies generally have current a ratio, in most cases, between 1.5 and 3.0.\r  \n**Who Is the Father of Value Investing?**\r  \nValue investing is a strategy credited to and used to great success by Benjamin Graham. Due to Graham losing his entire investment portfolio in the Stock Market Crash of 1929 (which lead to the Great Depression) he developed a system for arriving at an intrinsic value for stocks rather than simply considering that stock's current market price. Graham‚Äôs book, The Intelligent Investor, went on to sell many copies and inspire an investing great, Warren Buffett.\r  \n**Warren Buffett says this, ‚ÄòThe Intelligent Investor is by far the best book on investing ever written‚Äô.**", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I am from India, and what you say is exactly what i have done,\n\nIndex & smart index (momentum, alpha, quality)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think you need to check out r/boggleheads", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hold unless you need, I'm -60% into PLTR and -30 to 40% on WFC, I don't want either of them anymore.

{"title": "Short tinder (MTCH) for being a terrible app", "selftext": "So I downloaded tinder last week because I‚Äôm graduated from college and going to be in my hometown for a while. I figured may as well try the dating app again. I even bought the $8 unlimited swipes to try and help boost my chances of talking to women. \n\nI got one match and she never responded after asking how I was. After a week of nothing and constant swiping, I decided to [delete](https://imgur.com/a/oy1HXn0) the app and short the fuck out of the stock or buy puts to protest this app since it cucked me. I can‚Äôt believe I threw $8 at this for nothing, so now I‚Äôll throw my life savings against it to short it. \n\nMTCH is not just tinder, it is a group of 14 dating apps such as hinge, okc, plenty of fish, and a bunch of others. You can check their [website](https://mtch.com/ourcompany) out to see more. Maybe 2 of these apps are widely used (tinder and hinge) so that‚Äôs not a good start if you have 14 apps and only 2 are popular. \n\nWe‚Äôve seen companies like Netflix get absolutely hammered due to a loss in subscriptions. Match is about to head in the same direction. When a recession comes will people pay $25 a month for tinder gold? Idk about you but I don‚Äôt want to pay $25 a month for 0 matches and a bruised ego. \n\nAfter I deleted the app I vented my frustrations out in the daily discussion thread where user u/sloanemonroe told me only 4% of guys get swiped on. Think about how many times your puts have had a 4% chance of hitting and expired worthless. That‚Äôs you on tinder. You think you‚Äôll get a lot, but you end up expiring worthless and getting no matches. Don‚Äôt blame yourself, blame the app that needs to go be yeeted out of existence. \n\nI just don‚Äôt see how they keep a paying user base during a recession and I don‚Äôt see how they didn‚Äôt spread themselves too thin with 14 apps. The stock also has a 79PE while the actual stock is priced at $71. Everything about this company screams short it to 0. If Snapchat tanked 60% in a day, I don‚Äôt see how MTCH won‚Äôt. \n\nThis is how capitalism works. When a company fails to serve the needs of the people we short the fuck out of it and put it out of business so a competitor can do it right. That‚Äôs what needs to happen here.\n\nEdit: for those saying institutions own most of this stock, they are doing this to start a massive short position like they do to other stocks they short.", "id": "vqk7b0", "created_utc": 1656862516.0, "score": 1964, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 1132, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1828|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vqk7b0)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vqk7b0)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I wish you put the same amount of effort in your dating life as you did posting about your crappy experience on a dating app üò´", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I think there is more to this story than just the 8 bucks.", "score": 3206, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 630, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 430, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 224, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 39, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Is that OP's profile pic?", "score": 14, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Dude needs a blowjob :(", "score": 319, "replies": [{"body": "Now instead of paying 35$ the BJ will cost him 43$...", "score": 148, "replies": [{"body": "Have you tried swiping right, OP?", "score": 57, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thats hoeflation right there son", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "Inflation? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Go to Wendy‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure he can find the dumpster !!", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bo‚Äôjah*", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Maybe the tinder experience was followed by an angry fap", "score": 104, "replies": [{"body": "Naw.

Learn how to take pictures, take pictures with friends that make you seem like a person thats fun to be around. Get a dog or some shit to make you appealing. Wild concept, maybe work on yourself.\n\nHowever now that ive given you a constructive roasting, I do agree with a short forecast. When the economic music is over and people have no chairs and no clothes, Tinder is likely not gonna peoples budgeting priority and its sure to suffer a correction if they are overvalued now, are they? You havent spoken about that, maybe they price in that the apps frustrate sad bastards, but then again, when times gets hard, so do penises and so maybe sex/dating apps are recession resistant. Who knows maybe people will abandon Tinder and start fucking casually without the use of an app. Also, you can get a version of tinder  with all the s*ubscripts activated for free if youre tech savy and figure out how to use third p*arty \\*pp sources. The only people they‚Äôre making money off of consistently my guess is lonely and desperate people. Which, to plays devils advocate, seems to be on a reliably upward trend if you pay attention to studies. Correct me if im wrong, do the due diligence for your theory, how much comes from ad revenue and how much comes from subscription revenue. Any other revenue sources? Whats the upkeep? Servers? Shitty app devs? Do they even market anymore?they seem to have brand permeation complete.\n\nTheyre already down 45% YTD, My uneducated guess is they will suffer a bad corrections and momentum over the next 6-12 months they will drop another 40%, only to recover when people have expendable income again.\n\nTheyre a shitty app, but one thats been around for a long time, it has staying power, it has brand recognition, they have a pratical monopoly since they bought out their competition no? Whos the competitor? Are you shorting lonliness? In this emotional economy? It wasnt the apps fault man.\n\nHeres the real question, is wall street short or long on MTCH, and what does that mean.\n\nYou just dont appeal to the demographic with your profile the way it is. Its probably half assed like this theory.\n\nBut guess what my sad little buddy, I believe in you like those tinder missed connections didnt. Im swiping right on your general sentiment. Come back with some answers to my questions and for the questions I didn‚Äôt ask, not just concerning tinder the whole MTCH basket of loneliness apps and the wider sector of competitors too.
