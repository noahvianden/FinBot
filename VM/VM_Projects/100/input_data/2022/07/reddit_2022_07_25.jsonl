Very short periods of decline are not con- sidered recessions. Most commentators and analysts use, as a practical definition of recession, two consecutive quarters of decline in a country’s real (inflation adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP)—the value of all goods and services a coun- try produces (see “Back to Basics,” F&D, December 2008). Al- though this definition is a useful rule of thumb, it has draw- backs. A focus on GDP alone is narrow, and it is often better to consider a wider set of measures of economic activity to determine whether a country is indeed suffering a recession. Using other indicators can also provide a more timely gauge of the state of the economy.\n\n>The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a private research organization, which maintains a chronology\nof the beginning and ending dates of U.S. recessions, uses a broader definition and considers a number of measures of activity to decide the dates of recessions. The NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, last- ing more than a few months, normally visible in production, employment, real income, and other indicators. A recession begins when the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends when the economy reaches its trough.” Consistent with this definition, the committee focuses on a comprehensive set of measures—including not only GDP, but also employment, income, sales, and industrial production—to analyze the trends in economic activity.", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "The amount of ignorance shown in this thread is astounding.

For example, in the case of the February 2020 peak in economic activity, we concluded that the drop in activity had been so great and so widely diffused throughout the economy that the downturn should be classified as a recession even if it proved to be quite brief. The committee subsequently determined that the trough occurred two months after the peak, in April 2020. An expansion is a period when the economy is not in a recession. Expansion is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief. However, the time that it takes for the economy to return to its previous peak level of activity may be quite extended.*\n\n*https://www.nber.org/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions#:\\~:text=A%3A%20The%20NBER's%20traditional%20definition,more%20than%20a%20few%20months.*", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "Historically GDP has always been sufficient.

The Model Y is probably creeping up above a run rate of 800k, and closing in on a 1 million/year rate and then likely surpassing it by the end of the year. \n\nTotal Model Y sales this year might be in the 900k range, which would make it one of the best selling cars globally. And by revenue it'll probably blow away everything else, it might have more revenue than the Corolla and RAV4 combined. But of course Austin and Berlin  are still early in their ramps, and are targeting a 10k/week rate for next year? That would put production at around 2m/year globally, which would be the best selling modern car ever (the VW beetle did 1.3m in 1971), with the Model T being the only car in history that sold more in a single year.\n\nBut it seems like there would still be room for higher sales for the Model Y, what would the upper limit be? If they added an SR version, and lowered prices as local production/deliveries became a bigger part of sales. Plus, they could ever expand production at the existing factories more or add an additional factory somewhere? I don't really know what the upper limit might be, but the Model Y could conceivably be setting automotive sales records every single year for the next 5 years or more?\n\nThe only thing holding back Model 3 sales at this point is that Tesla has prioritized the Y, and I would imagine they'd add Model 3 production at Berlin and maybe Austin too (or move all US Model Y to Austin and change over the Fremont lines to all Model 3?)

{"title": "Rate hikes will surprise everyone", "selftext": "When I was eating my daily dose of crayons, I thought that there is a relevant aspect of FED rate hikes that we are overlooking. The two relevant reserve currencies in the world are the USD and the EUR, the former constitutes 59% of reserves, the latter 21%. In the last year the EUR tanked, from 1.24 USD it reached parity with the USD, now standing proudly at 1.02. \n\nThis helped to cushion the inflation in the US, because the trade deficit of the country is huge (860 billion USD in 2021), and all these imports come dirt cheap when the dollar is strong. The US imports \\~3400 billion USD worth of stuff annually, and surprisingly only a small part of this huge amount are industrial raw materials (522 billion USD), the majority (1859 billion USD) is comprised of capital goods, consumer goods, automobiles, and food&feed ( [https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-are-top-us-imports/](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-are-top-us-imports/) ). In the US inflation is already at four-decades high while all these imports are getting significantly cheaper as the USD gets stronger. \n\nUp till now the strengthening of the USD was almost a certainty, the FED started rate hikes, and although base interest rate still stands at 1.75%, it is still higher than the measly -0.5% the ECB uses, EUR being the only relevant competitor for the USD as a reserve currency. And it seemed highly unlikely that the ECB will ever start rate hikes, as the fragmented European economy would simply push Italy into bankruptcy in the event of rate hikes.  This stalemate prevented rate hikes for years and weakened the Euro as a currency.\n\nThis changed last week. The ECB finally found a way to increase interest rates (by 0.5%, but promised aggressive hiking) and start QT without pushing Italy over the ledge. They can simply sell more German debt and even buy Italian papers until the sum of these transactions still decreases the ECB's pile of assets. Simply after a decade the EU found a way to increase interest rates without falling apart. More rate hikes are on the horizon, we have a decade to catch up on. \n\nThis is extremely dangerous for the FED. After a decade the ECB can finally increase base interest rate, most likely the EUR will strengthen while the USD will weaken. A weakening Dollar will re-ignite inflation in the US, all those imports will become much more expensive. Simply because us Europoors finally managed to sort out our shit. \n\nThe ECB's solution forced the FED to increase rates just to keep the Dollar's purchasing power. A long-dormant player entered the arena that can blow up inflation in the US. The only defense against the strong Euro is increasing interest rates in the US. The FED will not turn dovish until the ECB does, and we have a decade to catch up on. FED rate hikes will be faster and more frequent than anyone predicted before, just to keep the Dollar afloat.", "id": "w7lokb", "created_utc": 1658745922.0, "score": 179, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|49|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w7lokb)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w7lokb)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "\"managed to sort out our shit\" \n\nNo.", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": ":D:D had a small chuckle at this.

See, eg: https://www.nber.org/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions\n\n“Q: The financial press often states the definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. How does that relate to the NBER's recession dates?\n\nA: Most of the recessions identified by our procedures do consist of two or more consecutive quarters of declining real GDP, but not all of them. In 2001, for example, the recession did not include two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. In the recession from the peak in December 2007 to the trough in June 2009, real GDP declined in the first, third, and fourth quarters of 2008 and in the first and second quarters of 2009. Real GDI declined for the final three quarters of 2001 and for five of the six quarters in the 2007–2009 recession.\n\nQ: Why doesn't the committee accept the two-quarter definition?\n\nA: There are several reasons. First, we do not identify economic activity solely with real GDP, but consider a range of indicators. Second, we consider the depth of the decline in economic activity. The NBER definition includes the phrase, “a significant decline in economic activity.\" Thus real GDP could decline by relatively small amounts in two consecutive quarters without warranting the determination that a peak had occurred. Third, our main focus is on the monthly chronology, which requires consideration of monthly indicators. Fourth, in examining the behavior of production on a quarterly basis, where real GDP data are available, we give equal weight to real GDI. The difference between GDP and GDI—called the “statistical discrepancy”—was particularly important in the recessions of 2001 and 2007–2009.”\n\nThe 2 quarter definition is also absent in their piece from 2008. https://www.nber.org/news/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcement-january-7-2008", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "You thought they’d stop changing definitions at “women can have wieners?”", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "\"oh fuck we're gonna get flattened in the midterms, hurry up and tell the retards we don't have a recession\"", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "It would be comical if we weren’t all getting completely fucked. \n\nActually it’s still comical", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Government telling us to load them puts", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You know it's the NBER that declares a recession, right? \n\nhttps://www.bea.gov/help/glossary/recession", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Glad to see The Experts are here to tell me how my community and I are doing, despite our own eyes and wallets.", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Bitch who are you going to believe, me or your own lying eyes", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "I laughed!", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "How you and your community are doing is unlikely to be indicative of an entire economy.\n\nJust because it's raining where you are doesn't mean it's raining for the entire country.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "So jealous you guys still have $1.50 gasoline over there.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I live in SoCal, the gas here has always been very expensive. \n\nIf I took your stance, I'd be saying it's apocalyptic levels of gas prices for a decade+ at this point and the entire country is suffering from retarded levels of gas prices because that's what my community and I are experiencing.\n\nGreat example, thanks for helping me make my point.", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "You're certainly making *a* point, perhaps not the one you think tho", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "I think the level of critical thinking you've shown very clearly shows why you don't trust experts.

The media may define it as that, but the NBER is the entity that is known for deciding it.\n\n>The NBER is well known for its start and end dates of US recessions. The NBER uses a broader definition of a recession than commonly appears in the media. A definition of a recession commonly used in the media is two consecutive quarters of a shrinking gross domestic product (GDP). In contrast, the NBER defines a recession as \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales\".[8] Business cycle dates are determined by the NBER dating committee under contract with the Department of Commerce. Typically, these dates correspond to peaks and troughs in real GDP, although not always so.[9]\n\n>The NBER prefers this method for a variety of reasons. First, they feel by measuring a wide range of economic factors, rather than just GDP, a more accurate assessment of the health of an economy can be gained. For instance, the NBER considers not only the product-side estimates like GDP, but also income-side estimates such as the gross domestic income (GDI). Second, since the NBER wishes to measure the duration of economic expansion and recession at a fine grain, they place emphasis on monthly—rather than quarterly—economic indicators. Finally, by using a looser definition, they can take into account the depth of decline in economic activity. For example, the NBER may declare not a recession simply because of two quarters of very slight negative growth, but rather an economic stagnation.[10] However, they do not precisely define what is meant by \"a significant decline\", but rather determine if one has existed on a case by case basis after examining their catalogued factors which have no defined grade scale or weighting factors. The subjectivity of the determination has led to criticism and accusations committee members can \"play politics\" in their determinations.[11]\n\n>Though not listed by the NBER, another factor in favor of this alternate definition is that a long term economic contraction may not always have two consecutive quarters of negative growth, as was the case in the recession following the bursting of the dot-com bubble.[10] For example, a repeated sequence of quarters with significant negative growth followed by a quarter of no or slight positive growth would not meet the traditional definition of a recession, even though the nation would be undergoing continuous economic decline.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Economic_Research", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don’t understand why the WH thinks the definition really matters?

A recession is broad-based weakness in the economy. We’re not seeing that now.”\n\nWith U.S. consumer prices rising at the fastest rate in four decades, a growing number of analysts say it will take a recession and higher joblessness to ease price pressures significantly. The Federal Reserve raised rates in June by the most since 1994 and is expected to approve another 75 basis-point hike this week.\n\n Inflation is “way too high,” Yellen said, while renewing the Biden administration’s argument that it’s also high in many other advanced economies.\n\n“The Fed is charged with putting in place policies that will bring inflation down,” said Yellen, a former Fed chair. “And I expect them to be successful.” \n\n Even if the US posts two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, Yellen—citing the U.S. job market—said she doesn’t expect that the academics at the National Bureau of Economic Research who rule on recessions would call one.\n\n“I would be amazed if the NBER would declare this period to be a recession, even if it happens to have two quarters of negative growth,” she said. “We’ve got a very strong labor market. When you’re creating almost 400,000 jobs a month, that is not a recession.” \n\nSource: [https://fortune.com/2022/07/24/yellen-says-signs-of-u-s-recession-arent-in-sight-when-youre-creating-almost-400000-jobs-a-month/#:\\~:text=Treasury%20Secretary%20Janet%20Yellen%20expressed,Meet%20the%20Press%E2%80%9D%20on%20Sunday](https://fortune.com/2022/07/24/yellen-says-signs-of-u-s-recession-arent-in-sight-when-youre-creating-almost-400000-jobs-a-month/#:~:text=Treasury%20Secretary%20Janet%20Yellen%20expressed,Meet%20the%20Press%E2%80%9D%20on%20Sunday)\n\n ‘I'm not seeing evidence of a US recession now’ says US treasury secretary Yellen.

Holders of MBS receive pass-through principal payments when the underlying mortgages are paid off after the home is sold or the mortgage is refinanced, and when mortgage payments are made. As a passthrough principal payment is made, the balance of the MBS shrinks by that amount. These pass-through principal payments are uneven and unpredictable.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**Purchases in the TBA market and delayed settlement.** During QE, and to a much lesser extent during the taper, and to a minuscule extent now, the Fed tries to keep the balance of MBS from shrinking too fast by buying MBS in the “To Be Announced” (TBA) market. **But purchases in the TBA market take one to three months to settle. The Fed books its trades after they settle. So the purchases included in any balance sheet were made one to three months earlier.**  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**This delay is why it takes months for MBS balance to reflect the Fed’s current purchases. The purchases we san show up on the balance sheet in June were made somewhere around March and April.**  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>And these purchases are not aligned with the pass-through principal payments that the Fed receives. This misalignment creates the ups and downs of the MBS balance, that also carries through to the overall balance sheet.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>In addition, MBS may also get called by the issuer (such as Fannie Mae) when the principal balance has shrunk so much that it’s not worth maintaining the MBS (the issuer then repackages the remaining underlying mortgages into new MBS).  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Tightening deniers. **So when the tightening-deniers – including a hedge-fund guy with a big Twitter following – trolled the internet and the social media about QT not happening because MBS balance ticked up by $1.2 billion on the June 23 balance sheet, they got tangled up in their own underwear.** The following week, the MBS balance fell by $19.5 billion. That’s how MBS on the Fed’s balance sheet work. T**hese folks just didn’t know, or more insidiously, tried to manipulate the markets.**  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The thing to remember about the Fed’s MBS balance is that it declines due to pass-through principal payments, and occasionally because they’re called, and this is an uneven process.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "I like how this guy comes here with an explication and after 5 hours some dum-dum comes and says \"i have a feeling that Fed is lying\".

(seriously, idk, why?)\n\nSome bearish things that come to my mind, idk how likely/unlikely:\n\n1) CCP collapses (no more embargos and trade wars), high-end production (chinese EVs) collapses, so **asian lithium miners look to offload anything/everything at low prices, thus flooding the west with cheap lithium** in 2025+. (It's easy to run a mine, much easier than making EVs).  \n\n2) Car manufacturers (and/or battery manufacturers) create a pseudo-cartel and refuse to pay high prices for lithium, and/or keep the produced EV/ev-battery numbers lower than expected (i.e. **the predicted EV boom doesn't happen**).\n\n3) Lithium based EVs start to explode / catch fire en masse in 2022/23, or require non-stop recalls, forcing companies to stop making EVs with lithium batteries. (again, lithium-EV boom doesn't happen)\n\n4) Increased lithium mining drives down the price of lithium so much, that nobody really profits much... Possible?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny of those four seem like possible/probable issues? Or is there something else that could realistically torpedo the lithium play?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I always appreciate a devil's advocate. Here's my thoughts:\n\n1.) If CCP collapses I think we've got bigger macro global economic problems to worry about. Everything would take a big hit, as much as the world might not want to admit it, we are highly dependent on Chinese production globally. So yes, I think everything across the board would take a hit purely because of the economic uncertainty that would come with such an event. For your bolded part of the point, there's really not any lithium surplus they could \"offload\". No one is sitting on a reserve of lithium right now to my knowledge. Sure it's not that difficult of a resource to mine once the facilities and processes are in place, but the demand has ramped up very quickly and we are in a huge demand shortage right now. With what lithium prices have done in the last 18 months there's no way companies aren't selling every metric ton they can produce already.\n\n2.) This has already kind of happened. Lithium prices were mooning so much, China literally put a cap on the maximum lithium spot price. That happened in March, when lithium prices topped out. That's one of the reasons we saw a retraction from the lithium stock boom in March this year. The point is, who knows how high lithium prices would have gone if they weren't artificially capped? Lithium spot prices have held pretty strong from their ATH in March and are only about 5% below that number. At the end of the day, I do think we will see a retraction in lithium spot prices, but most of these company's feasibility studies and profit guidance are based on lithium prices that are a fraction of current prices.\n\n3.) I think this one is pretty much proven out based on the last few years of lithium cars being on the road successfully. Sure, like anything, there can be a few outliers and random problems that can cause a set back. Tesla isn't perfect, they've had some issues, but they're selling more EVs than ever. I don't think we're going to suddenly discover some massive, industry killing problem with lithium. Lithium battery technology has been around for a long time, were only getting better at it.\n\n4.) Eventually, yes. Like I mentioned above, most new lithium mining operations take 5-7 years to come online. First a deposit needs to be identified, then tested, then planned, then permitted, then built, then put into production. It's a long drawn out process and there are different requirements for the different types of lithium \"mines\". They're not all open pit mines, there's also lithium brine evaporation, which is a lengthy process in itself. All this to say, there are more lithium juniors than ever because of this \"white gold rush\" so yes, eventually there will be enough production to start matching the demand, but it likely won't be until at least 2030, and maybe longer.\n\n5 (bonus).) Probably the biggest external threat that would disrupt the lithium boom would be the development of a superior battery technology that doesn't require lithium. Notable alternatives are fuel cell, dual carbon, and sodium-ion. While these are certainly worth noting and watching, they still have a ways to go before the cost-benefit exceeds current lithium-ion battery technology and cost, even with the price boom.\n\nAnyways, always a fun exercise to think through problems, thanks for your input!\n\nEdit: spelling", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "FWIW, Schlumberger is spinning up a Lithium fracking division in the American southwest.\n\n5 total plants planned", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "VALE Gang reunion  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "The electrical infrastructure needs a desperate upgrade before anything else.
