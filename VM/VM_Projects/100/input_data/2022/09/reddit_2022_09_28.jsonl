Were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen,  there would be a material risk to UK financial stability. This would  lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a  reduction of the flow of credit to the real economy.  \n>  \n>\"In  line with its financial stability objective, the Bank of England stands  ready to restore market functioning and reduce any risks from contagion  to credit conditions for UK households and businesses.  \n>  \n>\"To  achieve this, the Bank will carry out temporary purchases of long-dated  UK government bonds from 28 September. The purpose of these purchases  will be to restore orderly market conditions. The purchases will be  carried out on whatever scale is necessary to effect this outcome. The  operation will be fully indemnified by HM Treasury.  \n>  \n>\"On  28 September, the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee noted  the risks to UK financial stability from dysfunction in the gilt market.  It recommended that action be taken, and welcomed the Bank’s plans for  temporary and targeted purchases in the gilt market on financial  stability grounds at an urgent pace.  \n>  \n>\"These  purchases will be strictly time limited. They are intended to tackle a  specific problem in the long-dated government bond market. Auctions will  take place from today until 14 October. The purchases will be unwound  in a smooth and orderly fashion once risks to market functioning are  judged to have subsided.  \n>  \n>\"The Monetary  Policy Committee has been informed of these temporary and targeted  financial stability operations. This is in line with the Concordat  governing the MPC’s engagement with the Bank’s Executive regarding  balance sheet operations. As set out in the Governor’s statement on  Monday, the MPC will make a full assessment of recent macroeconomic  developments at its next scheduled meeting and act accordingly. The MPC  will not hesitate to change interest rates by as much as needed to  return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in  line with its remit.  \n>  \n>\"The MPC’s annual  target of an £80bn stock reduction is unaffected and unchanged. In light  of current market conditions, the Bank’s Executive has postponed the  beginning of gilt sale operations that were due to commence next week.  The first gilt sale operations will take place on 31 October and proceed  thereafter.  \n>  \n>\"The Bank will shortly publish a market notice outlining operational details.\"\n\nVia: [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/bank-england-statement-purchase-long-dated-bonds-2022-09-28/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/bank-england-statement-purchase-long-dated-bonds-2022-09-28/)", "id": "xq9iwg", "created_utc": 1664362581.0, "score": 196, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|116|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|650|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xq9iwg)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xq9iwg)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Raising rates and QE at the same time?", "score": 169, "replies": [{"body": "JPow was doing the same thing until July, they did not stop buying MBS but were increasing rates.

This episode actually started as a direct to DVD special and then was added to the end of the next season order months later.  In one scene, Charlie yells at a Mall Santa, asking if he 'fucked his fucking mom,' and earlier, the Santa asked Mac if Charlie was 'r-worded' both of which were completely uncensored on the DVD of course, but when it aired on TV, 'Fuck' was censored every time, but the 'r-word' was not.  Years later, Sunny has something of a clip-show episode that plays with the format, though there are a few legit clips from previous episodes as well.

{"title": "I shall now explain in detail why I believe the UK is going to be absolutely fucked in October.", "selftext": "Hi all.\n\nI spoke in the pre-market about how I believe that Monday is going to be horrendous for the whole UK, but I wanted to take the time to write a whole ass essay about why, because I believe there's some nuance that couldn't be shared over a quick voice chat.\n\nTL:DR - the UK is poised to fall into an '08 tier recession, is already sliding there, and as much as I hate to admit it, now is a good time to be a rainbow bear.\n\nSo, first off, I stand with my assertion that Monday is going to be a bloodbath. Why? Because that's the first trading day after the energy price cap changes. On Saturday, the price cap on energy will be raised significantly, meaning that nearly the whole country is going to face an increase in energy bills that will, for many, simply be untenable, or at the very least, impossible to pay without massive cutbacks to spending. I'm talking anywhere up to about £200 a month extra per month, with some households set to get even higher, depending on supplier and usage. There's no way around it, this is going to be utterly brutal.\n\nBut if that were the only thing happening right now, then we might be able to get away with it. After all, other European countries are dealing with crazy energy prices, but here's why I believe the UK isn't just fucked, but UNIQUELY fucked.\n\nFor a live play-by-play of the chancellor's meeting with banks and the BOE, see this insightful video: [Kwasi Kwarteng.mp4](https://youtu.be/MFX0MggWdNc)\n\nSo, apart from the price of keeping homes warm as winter approaches reaching a staggering new high, with January poised to possibly make it even worse, there's also some other juicy factors. Factors such as, say, the Bank Of England jacking interest all the way up to 6 percent by next year: [actually a real article and not a shitpost](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/26/pound-sterling-uk-interest-rates-bank-of-england) . Oh baby, you know you love some big, fat interest. That big, fat interest, mind you, is already making folks' house moves fall through, and is pretty much set to make any borrowing extra hard for the people who need loans and mortgages the most. Who, incidentally, are the ones about to be buttfucked-no-lube-spiky-drilldo-style by the cataclysmic energy price rises.\n\nAre we starting to see the problem here?\n\nThen there's the inflation. No, not the kinky kind, more the kind that makes barrels a leading fashion choice. That inflation is still at near enough %10, driven mostly by food [real source 2, electric boogaloo](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/august2022) and other living expenses. In layman's terms, the UK has experienced an increase of about five or so years of inflation, all at once, to coincide with the first wave of truly bonkers energy price rises.\n\nAnd finally, what of wages? [live feed from downing street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhckuhUxcgA) but no, seriously, wages aren't going up to help people pay for this shit.\n\nSO what's the government doing about all this? Surely they have a plan? Didn't I hear something about the BOE eating debt just to keep the economy stable? Yes, you did. Because UK pension funds just got margin called for enough money to invade Iraq with. Yeah, you bet I got a source for that: [Margin calls - not just for WSB idiots any more](https://www.risk.net/derivatives/7954682/uk-pensions-hit-with-ps100m-margin-calls-as-gilts-and-sterling-slide) . But that's not all, folks, no, because, you see, the government are going to be giving everyone a £400 payment to help with energy bills and are going to be cutting all the taxes, everywhere. Except that payment isn't going to go very far, and not even the UK banks or the actual motherfucking IMF think the chancellor's recent economic plans is a good idea. [real source 4: this time it's personal.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/09/28/ftse-100-markets-live-news-pound-bonds-bank-england/) If the people in the glass buttplug think your economic policy is shit, it's probably shit.\n\nOh, and the pound saw its lowest value since decimalisation, so, effectively, the lowest it's ever been.
