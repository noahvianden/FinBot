Right now, *we don't know for sure* ‚Äî though my own take at this time is that it's hard to imagine they're losing any money at all with the Mach-E when a GT model costs $71K.\n\nSome stuff we certainly *do know:*\n\n* Commoditization (supply chain development) is happening quickly. The Mach-E and Lightning are *already* products of supply chain thinking. Cells from LG and SK. Packs from Magna. Motors from BorgWarner.

It did not take them long to transition. Most of the rest of their facilities (BlueOvalCity notwithstanding) will simply transition just like Volkswagen's Zwickau, Renault's Douai, or Tesla's Fremont. There's no need to build from the ground up like Austin, so timeline comparisons to that facility are silly stuff.\n* Other OEMs (who are ostensibly in similar positions to Ford) seem confident enough in their profitability that they are expanding. Renault today announced they're bringing their EV lineup to Latin America ‚Äî a region where there are no fleet emissions regulations or incentives driving supply ‚Äî a big step.\n\nSome additional thoughts on my end: \n\n* Software and services are a dead end. A race to the bottom. Bandwidth costs are asymptotically approaching nothing, and no one is buying apps for their car.

Our parents and grandparents had the ability to invest in the quickest growth in human history. Think about that. Just because the last 50 years have been insane growth doesn‚Äôt mean the future will be. The economy will either be stagnant or lower in the future. \n\nIf you follow Elon Musk, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen his take on [underpopulation](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1563020169160851456?s=46&t=UWWtwmwjDeA2twRazq5H3Q)\n\nHere‚Äôs a excellent video where he talks about [it too](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRPQnBLa/)\n\n\n\nYou may be thinking ‚ÄúHE JUST WANTS MORE WORKERS!

So has the [marriage rate](https://www.statista.com/statistics/195951/marriage-rate-in-the-united-states-since-1990/).\n\nNow let‚Äôs take a look at population by generation.

[Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/)\n\nThis means less and less younger people are getting married and having kids. Young men 18-30 who are not having sex won‚Äôt suddenly get married and start having kids. This will translate into a worse economy in the next 20-40 years. When the millennials and gen Z are older, we will literally not have enough young workers to keep the economy going. My prediction is the next great crash in the mid 21st century will be due to an underpopulated society. \n\nThese are all indicators of a slowing society. It‚Äôs not good for your long term portfolio. A healthy society would be raising children and keeping the family unit alive. \n\nThe only counter argument people have is that immigration will solve this. Sadly you couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. We get maybe 1 million [people a year](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/20/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/) immigrating to the USA. \n\nLess people means less innovation, less growth, and a slower economy. It‚Äôs going to be a rapid decline. I don‚Äôt want to say 2021 will be the peak of the market forever, but we‚Äôll see.\n\nWall Street bettors who win will be the richest.
