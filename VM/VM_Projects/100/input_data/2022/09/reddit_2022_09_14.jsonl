Ok here goes‚Ä¶\n\nDTC-2021-002- Enhances the methodology for setting bank deposit investment limits based on the size of bank counterparties. Previously, the DTC limited maximum bank deposit investments based solely on external credit rating. DTC-2021-002 proposes to limit bank deposit investments not only on credit rating but also on size of the bank counterparty (as measured by equity capital). ELI5: The DTC wants to protect its banking members, so it will now force them to reduce lending caps when lending to smaller counterparties.\n\nDTC-2021-003- Increases frequency of position reporting to the DTCC. Adds fines for inaccurate or delayed reporting. ELI5: DTCC can open the books of any market member at any time to examine just how deep into the sh*t they are.\n\nDTC-2021-004- Increases oversight and liquidation capabilities of the DTC to protect all of it's members. Sets margin call limts for any member in a heavily over-leveraged position. Essentially, it is an insulator to an uncontrolled squeeze by allowing the DTC advise a liquidation of assets of an overleveraged member to minimize the over-leveraged positions' impact on the rest of the DTC's members. It also states that it will not \"bail-out\" a member who is in an over-leveraged position, which is HUGE. ELI5: If hedgie shorts the f*ck out of a stock and finds itself trapped as share price rises, the DTCC can liquidate them to cover their positions and prevent it's other members from taking losses. In addition, firms that are f*cked is on their own. No safety nets.\n\nDTC-2021-005- This is the biggie. This ruling prevents using synthetic shares created by deep ITM calls and married puts from being used to cover REAL short positions. It links any of these synthetic shares to the call or put that created them. ELI5: No more synthetic shares to cover FTD obligations.\n\nNSCC-2021-002(advance notice for which was NSCC-2021-801)- Maintains the Daily Liquidity Requirements of Hedge funds if the DTCC deems necessary (ties closely to DTC-2021-004 and 002). DTCC rules set the expectation, the NSCC rule declares the limit and enforcement of it. ELI5: GET MARGIN CALLED.\n\nOCC-2021-001: This ruling increases the maximum aggregate operational loss fee that the OCC would charge all of its clearing members in the even that equity of its members falls below certain thresholds defined in its Capital Management policy. The threshold is $250 million. In the event that the OCC's equity fell below $225 million, or stayed below $250 million for over 90 calendar days, the trigger event would occur. Under this ruling, each clearing member would then need to cough up a MAXIMUM of $1,337,072 per clearing member (assuming the amount of clearing members remains 1,007). If they could not remain above their minimum capital requirement after charging the max operational loss fees, the OCC would enact its recovery and wind down plan. Once complete, it would be obsolete. Seem like a coincidence that they decide to propose this ruling at the foot of what might be the greatest and final short squeeze the stock market might ever see? I think not. ELI5: OCC sees a storm on the horizon. In order to stay afloat, they need to increase the amount of equity they have by taking some from their members. This gives them some buckets to scoop the water out. If the buckets don't get enough water out of the boat, the OCC sinks.\n\nOCC-2021-002: This one was hard for me to crack, if I am being honest, but I think I have it figured out and will do my best to make it simple to understand. There are three main parts. Part 1: This ruling alters the way Derivative Clearing Organizations (\"DCO) determine the minimum margin requirement for customers with higher risk accounts. In addition, it gives DCO's additional discretion to increase the minimum margin requirement for customers that have accounts with \"heightened risk\". In addition, this section removes language that allows distinct margin requirements for customer hedge and speculative positions. Part 2: This one hurts my head. Ready? So, in 2011, the CFTC adopted a regulation that required each DCO to prohibit DCOs from allowing customers to remove funds from their account unless the clearing member held enough assets to cover its margin requirement. In 2012, they revised this rule to allow the CFTC to treat separate accounts of a futures commission merchant (FCM) as separate entities. Part 2 of OCC-2021-002 creates an exception to the 2012 revision. From what I understand, and I would like some feedback here, this second part eliminates the ability of DCOs to treat FCM accounts as separate entities. If you are an FCM and you make a bad bet, you don't just lose the ability to withdraw from your account that has the bad bet, you lose the ability to withdraw from your entire FCM portfolio until you meet the margin requirement. Part 3: This one is mostly fun for us. It requires the OCC to publish a public notice when it decides to suspend a defaulting clearing member. However, it includes some nice legal jargon. It states that it must publish a public notice \"as soon as reasonably practical.\" Coming from a law background, \"reasonably practical\" could mean 1 day or 1 year. All depends on who is determining practicality. ELI5: Part 1 increases minimum margin requirements for all DCO customers. Part 2 forbids DCOs from treating different accounts from the same FCM as different companies. If you make a bad bet in one section of your portfolio, they lock you out of the whole thing until you pay your margin requirement. Part 3 lets us know when a Clearing member is a bad boy.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "(PART 2)\n\nOCC-2021-003- This is the ruling often abbreviated as \"skin in the game\". It's quite simple really. The OCC proposes, with this ruling, to make it obligatory upon itself to provide for the use of \"in excess of 110% of it's Target Capital Requirement\" in the event of a clearing member default. Previously, it was at the OCC board's discretion as to whether or not the OCC's funds would be used to cover the loss of a defaulted member. Taken straight from the ruling \"In the event of a Clearing Member default, OCC would contribute excess capital to cover losses remaining after applying the margin assets and Clearing Fund contribution of the defaulting Clearing Member and before charging the Clearing Fund contributions of non-defaulting Clearing Members.\" ELI5: We are the OCC, and we stand by our non-defaulting members. We will liquidate the funds of a bad egg, and even our own funds before forcing our members to step up to the plate to cover the losses of one bad egg. (Gee, I wonder why Susquehanna would want to delay this one? I think we found our rotten egg)\n\nOCC-2021-004- This one fascinates me, and is perhaps the smoking gun of how everything here comes together. This ruling augments the procedures for an asset auction, and allows more parties to be involved in an asset auction. When the squeeze happens, it will almost definitely put some HFs out of business. They will default on countless short positions, loans, etc. When they go out of business, you can't just take their long positions off the market because that will crash the markets. So, what do you do? You auction them off to competitors. Competitors get shares at a discount, the regulatory agencies increase their liquidity to pay off the defaulted members debts, and the market doesn't crash. This ruling allows not only current members to bid at auction, but allows new members to be brought in with the referral of an existing party, or at the discretion of the OTCC. It increases the pool of liquidity that can buy off the shares and options of the defaulted member by bringing more players to the table. ELI5: Firms die out at sea, sharks smell blood and feast on remains. OCC-2021-004 brings more sharks to the feeding frenzy. Regulatory agency has less carcass to clean up.\n\nDTC-2021-003- In order to know just how f*cked up this squeeze is going to be, the DTCC needed to be able to see the books of the overleveraged parties.\n\nDTC-2021-004- Once the DTC knows just how f*cked up the situation is, they need to be able to remedy it with as minimal damage to themselves and their signatories.\n\nOCC-2021-004- Once a squeeze happens, regulatory agencies need to be able to settle the bankrupted HFs positions as quickly as possible to minimize damage to the markets. Hence adding more sharks to the feeding frenzy.\n\nDTC-2021-002- Sets the expectations for collateral the HFs need to continue shorting. IMPORTANT: this rule can be in effect at passage but cannot be exercised until NSCC-2021-002 takes effect. This is critical to understand. Without the NSCC rule, the DTCC rule has no enforcement capabilities.\n\nNSCC-2021-002(advance notice for which was NSCC-2021-801)- This is the big boy margin call. This needs to happen after the (4) above because without those (4), there could be a margin call, and then the pieces aren't in place to control the black swan. I doubt the DTC would advise a margin call to the NSCC before everything was in place, so this might be able to shift around in the sequencing, but it would be better for it to come after to guarantee the pieces are in place. I would bet that the SEC wants this only after the previous (4)\n\nDTC-2021-005- Once FTDs can't be covered with the long positions created by deep ITM calls and married puts, the hedge funds take their last breath. This is the catalyst that puts closing positions into motion. This absolutely has to be the last one to go into effect. without question. It fundamentally changes how shorts can cover, and by doing so it forces closing.

According to the member list published by the NSCC in April, 2021, there are 3,440 members. This goes into effect no later than 20 business days after the SEC accepts the rule. Spoiler alert: the SEC still hasn't posted the rule on their website.

Skin in the game being delayed is just going to hurt the OCC. NSC-2021-002 does allow margin calls to be", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You ready? Ok here goes‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nDTC-2021-002- Enhances the methodology for setting bank deposit investment limits based on the size of bank counterparties. Previously, the DTC limited maximum bank deposit investments based solely on external credit rating. DTC-2021-002 proposes to limit bank deposit investments not only on credit rating but also on size of the bank counterparty (as measured by equity capital). ELI5: The DTC wants to protect its banking members, so it will now force them to reduce lending caps when lending to smaller counterparties.\n\nDTC-2021-003- Increases frequency of position reporting to the DTCC. Adds fines for inaccurate or delayed reporting. ELI5: DTCC can open the books of any market member at any time to examine just how deep into the sh\\*t they are.\n\nDTC-2021-004- Increases oversight and liquidation capabilities of the DTC to protect all of it's members. Sets margin call limts for any member in a heavily over-leveraged position. Essentially, it is an insulator to an uncontrolled squeeze by allowing the DTC advise a liquidation of assets of an overleveraged member to minimize the over-leveraged positions' impact on the rest of the DTC's members. It also states that it will not \"bail-out\" a member who is in an over-leveraged position, which is HUGE. ELI5: If hedgie shorts the f\\*ck out of a stock and finds itself trapped as share price rises, the DTCC can liquidate them to cover their positions and prevent it's other members from taking losses. In addition, firms that are f\\*cked is on their own. No safety nets.\n\nDTC-2021-005- This is the biggie. This ruling prevents using synthetic shares created by deep ITM calls and married puts from being used to cover REAL short positions. It links any of these synthetic shares to the call or put that created them. ELI5: No more synthetic shares to cover FTD obligations.\n\nNSCC-2021-002(advance notice for which was NSCC-2021-801)- Maintains the Daily Liquidity Requirements of Hedge funds if the DTCC deems necessary (ties closely to DTC-2021-004 and 002). DTCC rules set the expectation, the NSCC rule declares the limit and enforcement of it. ELI5: GET MARGIN CALLED.\n\nOCC-2021-001: This ruling increases the maximum aggregate operational loss fee that the OCC would charge all of its clearing members in the even that equity of its members falls below certain thresholds defined in its Capital Management policy. The threshold is $250 million. In the event that the OCC's equity fell below $225 million, or stayed below $250 million for over 90 calendar days, the trigger event would occur. Under this ruling, each clearing member would then need to cough up a MAXIMUM of $1,337,072 per clearing member (assuming the amount of clearing members remains 1,007). If they could not remain above their minimum capital requirement after charging the max operational loss fees, the OCC would enact its recovery and wind down plan. Once complete, it would be obsolete. Seem like a coincidence that they decide to propose this ruling at the foot of what might be the greatest and final short squeeze the stock market might ever see? I think not. ELI5: OCC sees a storm on the horizon. In order to stay afloat, they need to increase the amount of equity they have by taking some from their members. This gives them some buckets to scoop the water out. If the buckets don't get enough water out of the boat, the OCC sinks.\n\nOCC-2021-002: This one was hard for me to crack, if I am being honest, but I think I have it figured out and will do my best to make it simple to understand. There are three main parts. Part 1: This ruling alters the way Derivative Clearing Organizations (\"DCO) determine the minimum margin requirement for customers with higher risk accounts. In addition, it gives DCO's additional discretion to increase the minimum margin requirement for customers that have accounts with \"heightened risk\". In addition, this section removes language that allows distinct margin requirements for customer hedge and speculative positions. Part 2: This one hurts my head. Ready? So, in 2011, the CFTC adopted a regulation that required each DCO to prohibit DCOs from allowing customers to remove funds from their account unless the clearing member held enough assets to cover its margin requirement. In 2012, they revised this rule to allow the CFTC to treat separate accounts of a futures commission merchant (FCM) as separate entities. Part 2 of OCC-2021-002 creates an exception to the 2012 revision. From what I understand, and I would like some feedback here, this second part eliminates the ability of DCOs to treat FCM accounts as separate entities. If you are an FCM and you make a bad bet, you don't just lose the ability to withdraw from your account that has the bad bet, you lose the ability to withdraw from your entire FCM portfolio until you meet the margin requirement. Part 3: This one is mostly fun for us. It requires the OCC to publish a public notice when it decides to suspend a defaulting clearing member. However, it includes some nice legal jargon. It states that it must publish a public notice \"as soon as reasonably practical.\" Coming from a law background, \"reasonably practical\" could mean 1 day or 1 year. All depends on who is determining practicality. ELI5: Part 1 increases minimum margin requirements for all DCO customers. Part 2 forbids DCOs from treating different accounts from the same FCM as different companies. If you make a bad bet in one section of your portfolio, they lock you out of the whole thing until you pay your margin requirement. Part 3 lets us know when a Clearing member is a bad boy.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "I asked you to source your claims that we are going to see a real estate market crash in Q1 2023 without your interpretation added, and you responded with bad interpretations of stock market clearing corporation rules and guidelines. \n\nYou claimed that in Q1 of next year we will see a central bank run, a collapse of all consumer loans, and a dissolution of all pension funds.

See, a mortgage payment+ taxes+ upkeep is certainly significantly more than what a rental payment would be. So if I'm paying X renting my house, and then you buy it and now are paying 2X per month with all the expenses, well, I have X per month to save. This is also a way of building equity. A stock portfolio is also called an equity portfolio. If half your payments are going to the bank over 30 years, how is that better off? Sure half went to building equity of you home, but mine is in an index fund. After 30 years it's basically a coin flip who made the better financial decision. It's VERY close and likely negligible. But that's in normal market conditions. Right now homes have gone up too fast too quickly. So for now, I don't think it's a coin flip, I think renting is by far the smarter financial decision. BUT AS I SAID BEFORE, IF YOU LOVE THE HOME AND WANT TO LIVE IN IT THEN BUY IT. My point is purely from a financial perspective.

You would have to depreciate/ amortize entire production sites worth many billions on their books, invest billions to convert them for months if not years (meaning there's no production in the meantime), completely retrain staff, all the while likely producing less cars per site, per employee and per capital invested than Tesla currently does at their plants. \n\nAnyone working in the industry will tell you how fascinating it is what they achieve atm. They drastically cut the time a car is being assembled, production steps required, factory footpring required, employees required, factory downtime required, etc. And the craziest part? It's continuously getting better. Giga Shanghai is way better than Fremont (former legacy OEM factory), Berlin and Texas are again improved compared to Giga Shanghai which also was recently further optimized. Which might not sound crazy, but it enables Tesla to produce 500k cars out of a factory that a legacy OEM could only get 300k out of. Now you tell me about the cost structures of both vehicles. \n\nThere is no use in producing 2 models at a 300k annual run rate at two different production sites when you can produce one model at 600k annual rr out of one site. Not only are the directly attributed fix costs significantly less, the entire logistics become so much easier as well. \n\nFurther points are issues like vertical integration. Yes, BMW and Daimler are seemingly catching up in many aspects of BEVs, BUT: they do so with heavy reliance (core parts of BEVs, not easily interchangeable parts) on Bosch, Continental, and more. And they all get their piece of the cake. Same with VWs planned battery plants. Most (if not all) are joint ventures for which VW actively seeks outside funding and business partners. They all will get their margins.\n\nEspecially troubling are issues like software. Yes, VW has been hell bent to catch up with its software, but Cariad has not been a success story so far and already needs outside help, won't achieve its 2025 goals (according to VW themselves) and costs VW indirectly money in the meantime (through lack of OTA updates and more). All the while employing more software developers than Tesla does (excl. FSD projects). Add being locked in in the dealership structure and other issues, and you will see that legacy OEMs are facing lower margins, huge upfront expenditures (investments) and depreciation, dependency on key suppliers and more. \n\nWe have yet to see a legacy OEM ramp up EV production the way Tesla does. Only real competition on that part is BYD for example.\n\nHigher quality trims, better finishing and a larger product portfolio are not exactly a guarantee of success in such a fundamental transition. That's just my take on it.

So I'm just gonna sparknotes some inmportant points.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Tesla has a 15+ year head start on modern day EV assembly. They're playing a TOTALLY different game than competitors. OTher companies are asking \"how do we get a car at the same specs as a Tesla that's profitable?\" While Tesla is asking \"how few batteries can you put in a car so we can ship as many as possible?\"\n2. EVs require a completely different field of engineering, rendering much of the workforce and infrastructure of legacy manufacturers largely useless (and an active hinderince, like in unions, cuz EV transition = union employees lose jobs).\n3. Other manufacturers can't reach profitability with EVs while Tesla has iPhone-level margins on its cars. LIke...wrap your head around that. IT's unheard of, there's no industry comparison. And other companies can't simply \"focus\" on EVs and magically reach that same level of profitability.\n4. Tesla's software advantage. Yes, other luxury cars might have nice interior buttons, but the software experience is MILES apart, and it's so painfully apparent. This is a 5000+ post alone. You should research it.\n5. Tesla's vertical integration. There's a reason the US passed a multi-billion dollar bill to secure the battery supply. Good video here on how fucked the US is by relying on China so much - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUxO3TAp2DM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUxO3TAp2DM) Tesla's the only company that is taking major vertical integration steps like creating its on cathode refining facility and supporting miners.\n\n\"Cool...but other luxury car makers are gonna make fancy cars and people will prefer that to Teslas because buttons and standing out.\"\n\nLike...okay. Let's see how well niche manufacturing of $150,000+ cars on sub 15% gross margin works out and how many people will wanna buy those (with inferior specs). There will always be people who want inferior products for same intangible brand reason (looking at you Jeep), but how consequential is that? We're on an investing forum, and the Tesla Model S basically outperforms 99% of all $1 million+ super cars. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpC\\_AoSnPrQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpC_AoSnPrQ) this is basic? This is not fun? IDK. Bring a Tesla to any elementary school and see the kids' reactions. That will tell you all you need to know about the Tesla brand prestige.\n\nThis is not including the roadster, which will have possibly low 1s in 0-60 acceleration, 500+ miles of range, and maybe even have SpaceX rocket thrusters on it in order to achieve its speeds.\n\nIf Tesla sells 20 million cars in 2030 on 20% gross margin, it will be the largest company in the world, point blank.\n\nAnd yes...Tesla energy will be as big as Tesla cars.

Tesla as a company does not have the structures of legacy automakers with their dealership network. This network costs the company a LOT and this means lower profit, but also headaches for customers. The legacy automaker is also projected to have lower profitability than Tesla for the next decade or until whenever the world is mostly EV. This is because they hold on their balance sheets a lot of assets that are related to ICE cars. This has to be written off on a yearly basis, so this means, profitability that is super under pressured. Not only is Tesla more profitable than any other car company right now without these write offs, but once these writeoffs BEGIN (they have not), Tesla's valuation will just demolish all legacy automakers, this is why it should be that Tesla's valuation is way more than legacy automakers because Tesla does not have all these extra costs. Remember that an EV company's valuation is based on the value of their EV business minus the costs to get rid of their ICE business. Because Tesla has no ICE business, it basically will at least double the profitability of the next legacy automaker. The only real competition from an investment standpoint to Tesla is a company like Rivian, NIO, etc.\n\nNow on to the business itself. Tesla has basically almost a monopoly on batteries. Even legacy automakers like Benz is not able to get batteries as much as Tesla can. If you want to order an EV from them, its also on wait list, mostly because they dont have the parts to fulfill the demand, and this is not going to change anytime soon. Tesla not only have secured supply but the newest tech in battery. Think about it, if you are a battery company, which company would you want to supply? Benz that buys 25k batteries from your per year, or Tesla that will buy 1.5M? Off course you will approach Tesla first. Tesla also is producing their cars at lower cost for the same build quality due to their innovation in manufacturing. I own both a Tesla and a Benz, their build quality now is similar, its just that people do not scrutinize Benz build quality as they just trust it already, but Benz has as much panel gaps and even more than my Tesla lol, but when you buy a Benz, you dont spend like an hour at the dealer using your flashlight scrutinizing every paint defect, and then another 6 hours at home going through a checklist.\n\nTechnology, Tesla is also still ahead. Which car company that is a real competitor today has a similar offering to Tesla's screen? Even the new EQS from benz, has lags and clutter. Which car also have access to something similar to a supercharger network. Many people love the ioniq 5 and even Rivian, but unless you own your own home, you will need to rely on these charging stations, read what people are experiencing, its not bad, but definitely not as good as Tesla's and it will not show noticeable improvements until maybe 2 years from now, or if Tesla starts opening up their supercharger network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are more, but really today if you are buying an EV, currently Tesla's true competitors are the Hyunda Kia cars and Rivian.

In 2022, it already is the best selling car based on Revenue. There are many points that I have left out as it would be too long of a reply, but all signs still showing to Tesla dominance in the next 5 years unless Rivian starts ramping up like crazy, or NIO comes stateside, IONIQ5s can scale faster, etc, which is not happening soon.

It depends on other factors and the company‚Äôs operating strategy. Higher margins ensure higher disposable capital they can invest back into the company to  grow for future years. Another factor is competition. A company that can maintain higher margins, keep operating costs low, and reinvest their profits responsibly to grow future returns will stay in business longer and beat its competition. If a company cares about its employees and wants to remain competitive in the labor market, then it would consider giving out significant cost of living raises to help their employees afford rising prices and so they would choose to remain at said company. A company does not have the authority to print new money like a central bank and therefore they have to obtain more by raising their prices on produced goods and services. \n\nThe choice to not raise prices is not as simple as it would seem. The inflation problem is a result of too much money in the economic system. Period. More money leads to more spending which leads to higher demand for goods and services. The problem is when demand becomes much higher than the current supply of goods and services. Prices of goods and services will increase dramatically as demand remains abnormally high. In a normal healthy economy, supply and demand run toe to toe. What we currently have is a major imbalance between supply and demand. There is just too much money circulating in the economy relative to the current supply of goods and services. \n\nOne tool the central banks use is raising interest rates. This makes borrowing and ultimately spending more costly. This helps to decrease demand. The higher they raise interest rates, the stronger the decrease of demand. \n\nThis tool is a double edge sword. If interest rates are raised to high to fast, then the balance will tip dramatically the opposite way and trigger a recession. However, if interest rates are not increased enough then the rate of inflation will remain high and people will struggle to afford the higher costs. If people spend less, then this effect will trigger a recession. Some experts believe that a prolonged recession would result if inflation does not get dealt with sooner. A prolonged recession is what we call a depression. \n\nSimilar to pulling a bandaid off a wound.

Does the farmer use the seed on hand now to make bread and keep the belly full each day? Or should the farmer plan for future a harvest? The answer is both but  striking a perfect balance is a daunting task. Now let‚Äôs add another factor in this analogy. What if the farmer knows there will likely be a drought in the next year or two. How would this affect sowing the future plans? Well sowing no seed will generate a zero yield harvest for sure.
