{"title": "Analysts at mutual fund Vanguard says there is a 25% chance that the U.S. will drop into a full-blown recession sometime during the next 12 months, and some time during the next 24 months at 65 chance%. Do you agree?", "selftext": " Analysts at the mutual fund giant Vanguard estimate the likelihood that the U.S. will drop into a full-blown recession sometime during the next 12 months at 25%, and some time during the next 24 months at 65%.\n\nThe Vanguard analysts aren’t alone.\n\nA SmartAsset survey of nearly 300 financial advisors taken in early August found that 80% believe the U.S. either is already in a recession or will enter one during the next 12 months. A rough rule of thumb to define an economy in recession is when it records two straight quarters of declining economic growth. For the second quarter of 2022, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.9% after a contraction of 1.6% for the first quarter.\n\nBut many believe it takes more than just negative growth to constitute a recession.\n\nOther factors also are part of whether an economy is in a recession. They includes employment, which has remained high despite the GDP figures, with a jobless rate of 3.7% for August, a level well below the 5% unemployment rate economists have traditionally considered full employment. In addition to adding more than half a million jobs, inflation stalled between June and July. Since then, gas prices have fallen, housing prices have dropped and consumer spending has remained strong.\n\nEven with those signs of improvement, prices are remain higher than before the pandemic. Even if inflation disappeared tomorrow – dropping to 0% for the rest of the year – the inflation rate for December would be 6.5%. That’s unlikely, so the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee is expected to keep upping interest rates. Right now, another hike of at least 50 (0.50%) or 75 (0.75%) basis points is set for this week, with more increases continuing into 2023.\n\nThe Vanguard analysts wrote that they expect the Federal Reserve to increase its federal funds rate target to a range of 3.25%–3.75% by the end of the year, which will increase rates on mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other consumer and business borrowing. The aim is to reduce the amount of available money in the economy in order to lower demand for goods and services, resulting in lower prices to bring inflation down.\n\nFull article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguard-says-theres-65-chance-155559181.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vanguard-says-theres-65-chance-155559181.html)", "id": "xpfnot", "created_utc": 1664282321.0, "score": 129, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "lol.

The most infamous example of this is what was dubbed the \"Google Tax\", where some European countries like Spain and Germany tried to force Google News to pay the Newspapers for the privilege of pushing traffic the Newspapers websites by showing the headlines of their news articles and providing links to go to those sites to read them. The \"Google Tax\" was set so absurdly high that there was no way anyone could possibly make a profit being a news aggregator, and Google responded to the \"Google Tax\" by shutting down Google News in those countries, which ironically hurt the Newspaper industry even more there because their websites got a lot less traffic, and people didn't start subscribing to paper newspaper subscriptions again.\n\nThings like GDPR in the EU meanwhile may be intended to crack down on the FAANG stocks, but the legislation is extremely burdensome to a small tech startup which will need to spend a much higher percentage of their profits/revenue in order to comply with the law than a giant FAANG stock that's already wildly profitable.

We don't like to rock the boat, and we don't have an awful lot of ambition. Most of all though, we're incredibly risk averse. You can think of Britons these days a bit like Hobbits in the Shire. \n\nAs a result of all of this, most people in the UK do not invest outside of either or property, or their employer pensions, which I would wager most people don't even look at until considering retirement. I know my dad and father in law didn't check theirs until their mid-50s. Part of the reason for this though will be that previously older generations got Final Salary Pensions, which is fairly self explanatory, so people didn't have to worry about them so much. For example my 90 year old grandad is getting more from his pension than my dad earns in salary. Sadly those pensions have basically gone the way of the dodo now. [This website](https://www.finder.com/uk/investment-statistics) offers some insights into this and states only 33% of Brits say they own stocks and shares, compared to over 50% of Americans. That number is slowly changing though as younger generations are realising they have to actively invest if they ever want to retire now.\n\nThe lack of investment has therefore also led to a lack of entrepreneurialism and venture capitalism, so we don't really have any startup culture here.

In previous years, university in the UK was very much not the 'done thing'. Before my generation, no one in my family had gone to university, and we're lower middle class. Many, many people would take apprenticeships instead, and a lot more people used to leave school at 16 when compulsory education ends. Compare that to the US however where there's a much bigger culture of going off to university, and you probably start to see why there's a bigger flow of ideas over in America.\n\nI think a lot of this is somewhat true across Europe as well though - there isn't an awful lot of tech around here.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "You need to cast your net wider I think, how come the whole of Europe is terrible at making tech companies?

In many other first world countries, there are way more regulations that aim to protect its citizens, but the issue with this is that there is a negative effect of this, is that it also protects old companies. This is because often the regulations are quite strict and is a huge hurdle for a small budding company to go through, and as a result it protects the dominant position of the old companies.

This is because of the strong supporting ecosystem that is vital for entrepreneurs and startups to be able to succeed in creating advancements and innovations.  \n\nTo dive into that statement, let me compare my state to your country and then the technology startup scene in Atlanta, Ga. Atlanta, Ga is considered the FinTech Capital of the World, mainly because we are also the \"financial transaction hub of the world\"  While the UK is 1.6 times larger than Georgia in size, blows us away in population and GDP comparisons. You only have 18 companies in your entire country that are in the Fortune 500, while here in Georgia, we have 17 calling our state their home.  To add to that, Georgia only has 40 fewer colleges & universities than your entire country has to offer.   While there are several with \"entrepreneurial programs\" one university sets itself apart from the rest.  \n\nGaTech is considered one of the best engineering/comp science schools in the US, and typically ranked right behind MIT.  \n\nAt GaTech there are two different innovation programs - CreateX and ATDC (Advanced Technology Development Center).  \n\nI volunteer as a mentor at ATDC. ATDC is considered by Forbes to be one of the top 5 startup incubators in the US.  Startups pay a small fee of $100 a year for access to the entry level Educate program, which provides access to mentors that entrepreneurs can meet by attending the variety of classes offered in the program, like Customer Discovery, Financial Literacy, Sales 101, and several others. Once a startup has successfully completed all of the classes, they can be granted entry into the 2nd and 3rd levels of the ATDC program, which the startups pay a monthly fee for office space and are provided a dedicated mentor to assist them with growing their business. ATDC does not ask for any equity in a startup or to be listed on any patent work while a startup is in the program.  At the 3rd level, the leadership will work hand in hand with the startups in further building their revenue by making introductions to potential clients and warm introductions to the many Angles and VC that walk the halls of the ATDC building\n\nCreate-X is a quarter long program offered by the University - there is no special building offering office space or classes about starting a business.  Instead it is a program where founders can receive an initial seed investment by GATech in return for a small equity stake of the startup. During the quarter, the entrepreneurs work to launch their MVP (Minimal Viable Product) and try to land their first couple of pilots with potential customers. At the end of the program, GATech holds a large event for the startups that have a completed MVP to pitch their company.  At the event you will find both Angel Investors and Venture Capital firms.  \n\nThese two programs, however are not the only programs in Atlanta helping startups.  There are more than 15 startup incubators that act like ATDC- where they offer classes, mentors, and office space - some are at other universities, some are provided by city governments as part of their growth strategy, some large companies provide programs like Cox Communication, Samsung USA, and US Bank all have innovation programs for startups, and yet there are others incubators that simply private businesses.  One of the later is Atlanta Tech Village (ATV), which has 6 floors of office space in Buckhead for startups, ATV offers mentoring to the startups, holds roundtable discussions - like sales leadership and CEO leadership roundtables (I have help lead both roundtables), and other events on a variety of topics to help their entrepreneurs. To give you an example of a few of the unicorns that have come from ATV:  SalesLoft, Spanx, Bakkt, MailChimp, Greenlight, OneTrust, Calendly, Cardlytics, and Internap are a few that I can think of off the top of my head.  While ATV doesn't invest in the startups, there are plenty of Angels and VC that walk the halls of ATV.  Not to mention David and David (the co-owners of ATV) both have a VC firm. Then there are at least 18 more incubators similar to CreateX - like TechStars, which invites startups to compete in a pitch competition, the winner receives office space and seed capital for a x% equity stake.  I have been both a startup coach for the competition and a judge.\n\nOn top of all the incubators, we also have a ton of programs for entrepreneurs to attend across the state.  For example, I am a co-founder of a non-profit called The Entrepreneurial Hour, we meet weekly at an incubator called Tech Alpharetta in Alpharetta, Ga.  At this weekly meeting, we have one startup founder present about their company and any issues they are facing.  This presentation is limited to 10 minutes. Then for the next 40-50 minutes, we have a round table discussion giving practical business advice to the entrepreneur. It is totally up to them if they want to take the advice or not.  Considering, however, we have 15 to 20 attendees who are all very successful business leaders or retired entrepreneurs like myself.  Then there is House of Genius, 1 Million Cups , Atlanta Startup Battle, CodeLaunch,  etc to name a few.\n\nFinally is the last key to creating successful startups and leading the world in technology innovations... it is financial support.  In Georgia, on top of the 18 incubator programs that provide seed funding, not only are there just individuals that are angel investors that entrepreneurs stumble onto like a couple cardiologist that I introduced the founder of a health IOT company too that invested $5M into so the company could get through the needed trials for FDA approval consideration, then there are also three very large well know groups of Angel investors - like Atlanta Technology Angels, and finally there are a good dozen or more VC firms that are involved in A through C funding rounds like Sig's Mosley Ventures.   \n\nNow think about this... that is just Georgia... nearly every state has at least one city like Atlanta that really has and promotes a strong startup ecosystem.  \n\nI will also state that I think your probably missing the money side and that I believe can be contributed to your national taxation being nearly 50% of your income, versus our tiered level which at the highest is 37%.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}

There is no reason to buy into something right now.  It's not like you're going to \"miss out\" if you wait for the market and these stocks to truly settle.\n\nI took a look at every single one of those stocks.  Not one is a good buy right now.  They will be good buys, certainly, but every single one is dropping, some worse than others.\n\nWait, there's one that sort of ok, GILD.  You might be okish with LOW too.  \n\nI'm also a fan of NFLX. I think a deliberate bad marketing ploy pushed their prices down to stupidly low levels.  Their metrics are rock solid and among the best they've ever been at.  Despite this, they're priced like it's 2017 which is nuts.  I honestly expected them to recover fast.  Surprisingly, the marketing seemed to work, and they've stayed unusually low.  I made a little on their initial ramp back up, but they stagnated.  Long term, they're still a solid bet.  When you actually compare them against every other streaming service, they are basically a titan in comparison, not just in raw subscriptions, but their growth has constantly been better.  They should have been back up to $600 by June, frankly.  I'm expecting their October financials to be well above estimates.\n\nI don't mind deals.  There's a lot of stuff that are deals.  I just think most of these will see better sales.  Nearly everything you mentioned is still going down and there is neither confidence nor investment momentum in any of them.  The only outlier looks to be GILD, but that's it.\n\nThere's a few things that are green right now and that will make you money right now.  But a lot of what's paying out right now is Bear indexes/ETFs.  You're betting against nations, real estate, various markets, or commodities like gold (which oddly should be good in a down trend...but isn't right now).  Think YANG, DRV, DUST, or EDZ.  Yeah, it's not long term buys, but this is a garbage market, and if you're looking to make or keep money, you're betting right for garbage.  For example YANG made 86% over the last 3 months.  Sure, going bear on China is kind of a sucky thing to think about, but this is the kind of stuff that's paying out right now.  When the recession hit late last December, it was oil paying out.  While the market tanked, you could have bet into oil and made 2x to 4x over just a few months.  At that time, that was about the only thing green.  Right now, green is betting on failure.  It's definitely a bear market, and (some) leveraged bears are making serious cash.\n\nBut if you want safe and stagnant, you can easily just shove your cash in SPY or any equivalent, and it will sit flat for a good while.  This was a reasonable choice to ride the down trend early in the year.  You didn't really lose all that much versus a lot of other choices.  And it's still a good buy to just sit on and forget for 20 years.\n\nAs for single companies, I tend to favor someone that's changing the world as we know it.  There's not a lot out there that I look at and think \"wow, they're really doing something amazing and pioneering the next decade, the next century.\"  Tesla's about the only one that stands out to me.  People want to say that it's overpriced still, but there really aren't many companies comparable.  However, it's a stock that's dead flat right now.  I'm also curious how hard other automakers are going to encroach into the EV space.  Tesla's kind of had the luxury of being solo in the space for about a decade.  That's going away.  But the company is well run, and they're the only company self producing batteries and have enough batteries to actually build their cars.  No other automaker is doing this.  Others can make EVs, but battery production for them is limited.  Plus very few are in the market at any real volume outside of a couple brands like Ford are pushing real volume numbers into this space.  While Tesla's producing a million cars, brands like Rivian are targeting like 15,000.  There is no comparison to the shear volume Tesla has in that space.  They simply dominate it.

But IMO, trading on fundamentals is only valid for stocks that aren't heavily manipulated. Sometimes this is difficult to judge; but Tesla is an outlier. It's WILDLY manipulated, to the point that looking to fundamentals is just silly.\n\nI'd imagine most folks here know that Tesla was heavily shorted in it's early years. I'm not totally sure why, but it was a really popular play, and I'm talking years ago. It's become public knowledge that even Bill Gates is hugely short (and imo probably has been since 2019 or earlier). For example here is him publicly shitting on tesla somewhat in Feb that year:\n https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1121555_bill-gates-calls-tesla-an-amazing-product-doesnt-see-electric-trucks-working-quite-yet\n\nNot definitive proof, I know, but according to some sources Bill Gates alone has a multi-billion dollar short at this point. Such as:\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-28/musk-says-gates-has-multi-billion-dollar-tesla-short-position\n\nWe know Michael Burry has been short a while too, and you know that plenty of fund managers probably followed his lead. The point is, shorting Tesla was a \"smart money\" play long before it's price exploded.\n\nSomething that's *extremely* interesting, IMO, is that someone has been building massive, obvious variance hedges called \"replicating portfolios\" using options. Basically big players can really closely simulate a variance swap (or other form of volatility swap) using lots of options contracts and it can be seen in the OI. After GME blew up in Jan 21 the same thing started appearing.\n\nIf you ask me the reason that TSLA is so \"overvalued\" based on fundamentals has more to do with large players having to hedge massive short positions than anything else. Some of the last several years of surge was undoubtedly short covering but reporting on shorts is so purposefully opaque that it's really hard to know what's still there. I mean. It's clear that Gates is still short, so my guess is that many other big players are too.

If you are doing this, you are going to be so way off.\n\nJust to give you first my background, I am an accountant, so here is the perspective from an accountant.\n\nTesla and legacy car companies, the financial structure is heaven and earth so difference, and this is why tesla's value is so much more than a regular car company.\n\n1. The value of an EV car company = the future profits MINUS the TOTAL COST OF GETTING RID OF THE OLD ICE CAR BUSINESS. Tesla has a lot of the former, as it is projected that they will be the most profitable car company in the world next year beating out Toyota and VW. They have ZERO of the latter as they do not make non-EV cars.\n2. Legacy car companies and actually a lot of legacy companies in general from decades ago, they were built differently in terms of capital structure. A lot of these companies have debt, some of them have more than $100B in debt. A quick google and from a July 2020 article, VW has $151B in debt, Toyota $138B, Ford $122B, BMW $114B. How much is Tesla's DEBT? Not even $3B as of June 2022. It is even more crazy that this number is so low as usually one of the valuation metrics that is often looked at is debt to the value of the stock and since Tesla's value is much higher, this metric Tesla just demolishes. This is an IMPORTANT metric especially in the face of a recession as it reflects the risk of the company going bankrupt. This means Tesla has close to zero chance in going bankrupt, while other companies, not so much. If you remember, many of these companies were on the verge of going bankrupt in 2008 before the government saved them. I am  not sure the same treatment will happen if it happens in the future as the world has changed a lot since.\n3. Supply chain - Tesla has almost a monopoly on the supply chain of EVs, and even in the face of challenges, they are the only car company that is able to put up Tech company- level growth of over 40% consistently in this environment. If you look at the other car companies, other than the EV companies, they all have either sub-10% growth or worse, negative. Growth = higher PE. Longer track record of growth = even higher PE, check out Amazon in the last 20 years. But Tesla also has locked down supply of batteries and has one of the most reliable sources of batteries. Whereas every car company trying to make EV cant seem to get enough of batteries, Tesla can as they have already locked this down years ago.\n4. The product itself, Tesla;s cars packs a big value even at its price point, before COVID, they grinded down by lowering price as they have also managed to cut significantly the cost of building EVs. VWs CEO has admitted that Tesla basically can build the same car, not only faster than VW, but also cheaper for the same level. You know what this means right? big profits, and ability to churn out more. This mean higher PE.\n\nAll in all, if you look at Tesla's profit growth, it has been doubling or tripling sometimes. And if you understand how caiptal intensive businesses work, once you past the breakeven point, the profit growth is massive, hence why their profit is growing at like 100%+ even though revenue is only growing 40%+.\n\nI have not even talked about labour unions, dealership network, vendor network that is bringing down the value of the other car companies, as that is another long post of its own. \n\nAs we get into the recession, you will see how reliable Tesla's profitability is going to be, which is why its valuation is it is.

Tesla in H1 2022 has sold ~550K cars, at ASPs of $57K and a net operating margin of ~17%. On top of that they had some other earnings, but let's ignore that for now. This adds up to ~$5.3B in net income.\n\nFor H2, Shanghai was recently upgraded and is now producing ~85K cars a month after producing ~120K in July+August. Fremont will probably increase Model S/X production a bit, and otherwise stay the same at ~150K per quarter. Giga Berlin and Texas averaged out at about 1K units per week by the end of Q2. They are both slowly ramping up towards 5K per week by the end of the year, so let's average that out at 3K per week.\n\nAdding all of those up, they should be delivering ~838K cars in H2. ASPs will increase a bit, since the latest price increases did not hit sales yet due to the long order backlog, so let's estimate ~$58K. Margins should be increasing too, since Shanghai is a lot more profitable than Fremont and will grow from ~50% of total production to ~65% of total production, so let's low ball it at 21% operating income.\n\nUsing all of those numbers, H2 should be around $10.2B, with total earnings in 2022 coming in at $15.5B. With the current market cap of around $900B, that's a PE of 58 with earnings growing ~182%. That leads to a PEG ratio of 0.32 when 2-3 is normal for large caps. Now naturally Tesla is still quite early into its profitability, so earnings growth will come down over time, but at least in the short term, Tesla is quite cheaply valued.\n\nLooking a bit further out, you can use my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/) to see how even at a $1T market cap, Tesla's on course towards a PE of between 15 and 31. Since that post, Tesla had some pretty big headwinds with the China factory shutdown, but 2023/2024 remain unchanged. I don't believe that those kinds of PEs have ever happened for a company growing earnings at ~50% a year, especially a large cap. Nor would a PEG of 0.3-0.6 make sense. So safe to say even in the mid term, through 2024, Tesla's stock is very cheap and will need to go up significantly before we get there.\n\nNow of course looking out even further, you get into FSD, Tesla Bot, Energy, compact car, Autobidder, etc. territory. I've done plenty of research to be confident that many if not all of those products will become successful as well, and that people will look back at the \"Tesla is just a car company\" argument with complete disbelief in 5-10 years. But even if you don't believe any of that, and you don't want to look more than 3 years out into the future, I believe my numbers above show how Tesla is a huge bargain right now and has at least 100% upside between now and the end of 2024.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "i gots putz", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Really?

I can see Bitcoin sticking around as \"digital gold\", but that's about it. Half the DeFi projects turn out to be rug pulls, and regulation would kill off many of the rest.\n\nCrypto is too slow to be used for most mainstream applications. You can tack on a faster layer, but that introduces centralization (which defeats the purpose).\n\nAlso, transacting in crypto results in capital gains (under current regulations). This limits adoption because you don't want to complicate your taxes every time you buy a sandwich.\n\nNFTs of jpegs came about in part because there were too few applications for crypto and too little liquidity. High-value digital collectibles fit the bill because volumes were reasonable, but demand seems to have stalled.\n\nI think NFTs will find some niche applications, but they are not going to be used for real estate, medical records, stock trading, and the like.\n\nBe careful what you wish for when it comes to regulation. If the SEC determines that tokens should be regulated as securities, that could introduce a lot of friction.\n\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Depends how you look at it.

Just ask Steve Wozniak or the guy who accidentally sold his Bored Ape to a bot for 1/1000 of the value because of a typo.\n* If you do a transaction without a 2-day waiting period or escrow arrangement or regulated centralized exchange, your only protection is \"trust me, bro\". This may be fine for large overseas remittances or buying a used car, but it won't work for mid-range purchases at scale.\n* Bitcoin is capable of around 7 transactions per second (globally). The lighting network can add transactions to the queue very quickly, but they still must be resolved.\n* Direct Bitcoin transactions are rare. Usually those who \"accept Bitcoin\" are going through a service layer that may or may not be secure and is definitely centralized.\n* Why would you want to spend a volatile, deflationary asset and wind up like the Bitcoin pizza guy in five years?

Just ask El Salvador. Otherwise it would have already have happened. Fixing the problems will require (at a minimum):\n\n* Full, seamless integration and regulation of stablecoins as part of every transaction.\n* Adoption of high-speed wrapper layers (centralization).\n* Legal recourse and liability for players at every level.\n\nCongratulations! You now have PayPal with more steps (and the same fees and limitations). Blockchain is just a buzzword at this point.\n\nThe *only* thing that crypto offers now is resistance to censorship. That's good if you want to sneak money to Iranian protestors or get your money out of China, but prior to NFTs, crypto was primarily used for ransomware, extortion, money laundering and drugs (NFTs weren't a big improvement). \n\nAs a libertarian, I think drugs should be available to anyone, but I can do without the other use cases.\n\nI implore you to watch this video.
