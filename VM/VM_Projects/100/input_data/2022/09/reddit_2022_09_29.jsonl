The U.S. unemployment rate, which had hit a 50-year low (3.5%) in February 2020, hit a 90-year high (14.7%) just two months later, matching Great Depression levels. In response, Trump signed the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) on March 27, 2020 which helped maintain family incomes and savings during the crisis, but contributed to a $3.1 trillion budget deficit (14.9% GDP) for fiscal year 2020, the largest since 1945 relative to the size of the economy.

Growth of employment and median wages slowed in 2018 and 2019 relative to the pre-TCJA years of 2016 and 2017. The much-vaunted bonuses that some firms provided employees at the end of 2017 were tiny relative to wages. And they appear to have been motivated mainly by political considerations or by the opportunity for firms to accelerate pay into 2017, when costs could be deducted against a 35 percent corporate tax rate, rather than 2018, when the deduction was worth only 21 cents on the dollar.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTwo years later, however, business investment is actually declining. Factory closings and mass layoffs have not ended. Wage growth is tepid, despite the continuation of the economic expansion that began 10 years ago, and gross domestic product (GDP) growth is slowing and projected to revert to its long-term trend or below. Meanwhile, budget deficits are higher due to revenue losses‚Äîwhich have largely been triggered by the massive corporate tax cut at the heart of the TCJA.‚Äù\n\nThe simple fact is, Trump inherited the best economic period this country has ever seen, his TCJA did not work for anyone aside from corporations and the 1%, and he left the country infinitely weaker due to his own inability to face the threats our country faced, largely due to his own inadequacy to properly lead.

Think about that, the leader of our country, REFUSED to wear a mask, and even ask Americans to wear them. His absolute bungling of half assed business closures, his inability to distribute supplies such as N95‚Äôs (which he put Kushner in charge of, for some reason) had states and cities out bidding themselves on PPE gear.

How does that relate to the NBER's recession dates?\n\nA: Most of the recessions identified by our procedures do consist of two or more consecutive quarters of declining real GDP, but not all of them. In 2001, for example, the recession did not include two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. In the recession from the peak in December 2007 to the trough in June 2009, real GDP declined in the first, third, and fourth quarters of 2008 and in the first and second quarters of 2009. Real GDI declined for the final three quarters of 2001 and for five of the six quarters in the 2007‚Äì2009 recession.\n\nQ: Why doesn't the committee accept the two-quarter definition?\n\nA: There are several reasons. First, we do not identify economic activity solely with real GDP, but consider a range of indicators. Second, we consider the depth of the decline in economic activity. The NBER definition includes the phrase, ‚Äúa significant decline in economic activity.\" Thus real GDP could decline by relatively small amounts in two consecutive quarters without warranting the determination that a peak had occurred. Third, our main focus is on the monthly chronology, which requires consideration of monthly indicators. Fourth, in examining the behavior of production on a quarterly basis, where real GDP data are available, we give equal weight to real GDI. The difference between GDP and GDI‚Äîcalled the ‚Äústatistical discrepancy‚Äù‚Äîwas particularly important in the recessions of 2001 and 2007‚Äì2009.\n\nQ: Typically, how long after the beginning of a recession does the committee declare that a recession has started? After the end of the recession?\n\nA: Our determination of the trough date in April 2020 occurred 15 months after that date, in July 2021. Earlier determinations took between 4 and 21 months. There is no fixed timing rule. We wait long enough so that the existence of a peak or trough is not in doubt, and until we can assign an accurate peak or trough date.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Cool man, now go copy/paste the old definition instead of the spin here.

Of the 34 total papers, 12 were also working papers and had not undergone peer review. The most recent data in all 34 studies were from April 2021. The Delta variant began widely circulating in the United States and Europe after this time.\n\n\n>There were 7 studies examining lockdown stringency, and the authors that, on average, the lockdowns reduced mortality from COVID-19 by just 0.2%. Just 1 of the 7 studies found a significant and substantial effect. The remaining 6 studies found little to no effect.\n\n\n>There were 13 studies estimating the effect of SIPOs. Of these, 7 looked at multiple NPIs, with SIPO being just one, and 6 studies analyzed SIPO vs no SIPO in the United States.

The definition of specific NPIs varied from study to study‚Äîfor instance, one study reviewed nonessential business closures and bar/restaurant closures, while another study reviewed business closures but no bar/restaurant closures‚Äîmaking a comparison difficult, the authors noted.\n\n\n>Based on the studies reviewed, the authors concluded ‚Äúgenerally there is no evidence of a noticeable relationship between the most-used NPIs and COVID-19.‚Äù\n\n\n>Mandating face masks had a large effect of reducing COVID-19 mortality by 21.2%, according to 2 studies.

{"title": "The Coming Crisis - an update for those it may concern.", "selftext": "\\[***TL;DR*** *- This all should have been obvious because complex adaptive systems like the economy always break down, just like in 2008.  It was not obvious because we understand the economy through a flawed framework.\\]*\n\nHi folks,\n\nAbout a year ago I wrote this piece called [The Coming Crisis](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/oy57s2/the_coming_crisis/) which got a big response (both positive and negative) here in r/stocks.  I was encouraged by user /u/cristhm to make a follow-up, so here goes.  It's late right now so I'll try to make this relatively concise while still hitting all the major points.\n\nIn short, most of what I said then and what I'm saying now can be summed up by economist William White in this video:\n\nLook up **\"William White - Conducting monetary policy in a complex adaptive system\".**  I can't post YouTube links here.\n\nDon't worry, the talk itself is only about an hour and well worth it.  I found the questions at the end to be interesting, too, but the important part is only the first hour.\n\n**Summary of Mr. White's talk:**\n\nThe economy is not linear (the traditional model used by economists), but rather a complex adaptive system.  Think of it like a garden.  You plant the seeds, and you can water it and stuff, but you never really know what's going to happen.  There can be a flood.  A snake can get in.  There can be an invasive species.  Weeds pop up here, flowers die there, etc. The system is too complex for you to entirely understand, because there's too many variables, and not only that, but each one of those variables interacts with the others and has the ability to adapt given changing conditions.  Forgive me if I didn't explain it 100%, I haven't read any work on complex adaptive systems myself and simply try to paraphrase Mr. White.\n\nAn example I love to use is the book / film *Jurassic Park.*  The idea was that the owners had the whole park under control, what with security fences and cameras and the dinosaurs not being able to breed or survive without a special food from the handlers for more than 3 days.  But the system was complex and adaptive, so somehow the dinosaurs found a way to escape and to procreate and survive on their own.  If you think about it, it makes total sense. Obviously bringing back extinct dinosaurs from the dead and making a theme park was a horrible idea.  But it really goes to illustrate the folly of trying to \"play God\".\n\n*Jurassic Park* is a great illustration of how complex adaptive systems are unstable and tend to break down.  Another example of breakdown in these systems would be the ecosystem which included the dinosaurs (Michael Crichton wrote about this in the sequel, *The Lost World).*  \n\nHow does this relate to markets / the economy?  It's because, as I said, financial markets and the economy are complex adaptive systems, and the issue is that we haven't been treating them as such.  For decades people at the Fed and central banks have assumed that as long as prices are stable then we need not worry about macro stability.  William White argues that this is a grave mistake.  There are other issues, including asset price bubbles and rising debt stocks.  In fact, this was the entire cause of 2008.  William White wrote about this in 2006, 2 years before the crisis hit in full force:\n\n[Is price stability enough?](https://www.bis.org/publ/work205.pdf)\n\nHere's a quote from that paper:\n\n*\"Following on these arguments, an altered framework for conducting monetary policy would demonstrate more symmetry over the credit cycle. There would be greater resistance to upswings. This, in turn, would obviate the need for asymmetric easing in the subsequent downturn and the problems arising from holding policy rates at very low levels for sustained periods. One important effect of more symmetric policies is that they would also act to prevent financial imbalances from cumulating over time. This, in turn, would free the authorities‚Äô hands to respond appropriately to the upward phase of any given credit cycle, since there would be less fear of precipitating a crisis. In this way, a virtuous rather than a vicious circle might be more firmly established.\"*\n\nHe ends with a statement that was eerily prophetic for the year 2006:\n\n*\"One hopes that it will not require a disorderly unwinding of current excesses to prove convincingly that we have indeed been on a dangerous path.\"*\n\nIt's a statement that, in my view, applies just as much today as it did in 2006.\n\nHe also wrote something that applies very much to the situation we are facing now:\n\n*\"On the other hand, the Japanese reliance on ‚Äúquantitative easing‚Äù, in addition to very low interest rates, highlights a further complication as monetary authorities begin to tighten. Economic agents more generally will be aware of the extent to which banks have reserves well in excess of normal requirements, and could become increasingly concerned about their inflationary potential. This implies a delicate balancing act for the monetary authorities, in which tightening must be slow enough to avoid destabilising financial markets, but fast enough not to destabilise inflationary expectations.\"*\n\nFor more issues with QE and monetary policy, check out his 2012 paper:\n\n[Ultra Easy Monetary Policy and the Law of Unintended Consequences](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf)\n\n**So what's the solution?**\n\nThe truth is that we have backed ourselves into a corner.  We are between a rock and a hard place.  The solution, it seems, was to have never gotten here in the first place.  But now that we're here, I would argue, as would Mr. White, that we ought to have a serious conversation about what we've been doing for the last 20-30 years.  Given that complex adaptive systems are prone to breakdown, we ought to do our best to be prepared for that breakdown.  But that's not what we've done.  Instead of deleveraging after 2008, we've actually become more leveraged.  Government and corporate debt are through the roof.  Vulnerabilities have not decreased, they have increased, and greatly so.\n\n**How has our economic system broken down in the last 2 years?**\n\n\\-Coronavirus\n\n\\-Enormous and unprecedented liquidity (on top of already enormous and unprecedented liquidity post-2008)\n\n\\-Inflation that proved to be persistent rather than transitory (another failure of the Fed and central banks to forecast complexity)\n\n\\-Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n\\-Issues in bond and currency markets (pound, yen, euro, Bank of England buying gilts)\n\nIt seems that the Fed and central banks were always making their forecasts under the assumption that everything was simple and going to go according to plan.  But we have seen, obviously, that this has not been the case.  But this should have been expected!  This is the nature of complex adaptive systems, and to be a bit philosophical, it's the nature of life itself: uncertainty.  The fact that the Fed missed it in their forecasts is because their framework is flawed.  It's the same reason they missed 2008.\n\n**Where are the vulnerabilities now?**\n\nMe personally I've been worried about a strong dollar and what that means for sovereigns and businesses who have to pay their debt obligations in dollars. Mr. White mentions this as a potential issue in his video (remember, from back in 2018).  We saw some real weakness in the UK today.  Here's a good article I found.  It's a tabloid but it does a nice job of summing up what happened:\n\n[https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19943278/bank-england-drastic-step-stabilise-economy/](https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19943278/bank-england-drastic-step-stabilise-economy/)\n\nI don't think this is necessarily the tipping point, but it's a serious sign of instability.  There is likely much more that we don't know about yet.\n\n**What's going to happen?**\n\nI don't know.  Is there a possibility that we make it out OK?  Yes, absolutely!  But it's also true that we've gradually built up a lot of vulnerabilities in the system, and the longer we keep going down this path, the more precarious the situation becomes.  Herbert Stein said that \"if something cannot go on forever, it will stop\".  A colleague quipped back: \"but it will go on much longer than you expected!\"\n\nSo I can't tell you when the whole system is going to come undone, but what I can tell you is that we're on a very dangerous path.  It can't go on forever.  And I am very worried about the way things are looking right now.\n\n**What should we do as investors?**\n\nI'm not an expert investor, I'm a new investor who studied economics and continues to study it in his free time as a hobby.  That said, I don't think anyone should panic sell.  If you're going to sell, please do so after doing your own research, not after reading this silly Reddit post.  What I can recommend to everyone, and I think it's fair advice, is to be prudent.  Be honest about what's going on right now and do your best to try to understand it.  From there, make smart financial decisions that will be beneficial for you and your family regardless of what happens.\n\n**My addition to Mr. White's work**\n\nHonestly, I think everything you need to know is all there.  I have little to add.  The only thing I would like to say is I agree with him on humility.  I had a rough time growing up and that led me into addiction and alcoholism.  It was humility, and recognizing that I had a lot less power than I thought I had, that finally got me out.  I'll have been sober for 9 years this Saturday.  Humility was tough for me, but at the end of the day I found it to be more fulfilling (and more honest) than the alternative.  I think as humans we all struggle with this, and that's probably the reason why it's so hard for us to accept complexity.  It's scary to admit that we don't know.\n\n**Where I got it right from my last post**\n\nWell, things certainly look to be cracking.  Markets are way down.  Vulnerabilities are emerging.\n\n**Where I got it wrong**\n\nMy thesis wasn't fully developed, and I think I put too much emphasis on \"I don't know what's going to happen\".  That remains true, humility is a huge part of this, but I think more emphasis should have been placed on the topic of complex adaptive systems.  When you view the economy in that light, the underlying vulnerabilities start to make a lot more sense.\n\nSecondly, I obviously don't know how all this is going to play out going forward.  Today could have been the start of the next leg up.  I don't know.  The crisis hasn't fully materialized yet, but I still feel quite confident that we have been on a dangerous path.\n\nFinally, my actionable investment advice came off as green and I should have stuck to generalities rather than specifics. \n\n**How this relates to** r/stocks\n\nThis is not necessarily direct investment advice, but I do think it's relevant to this community.  Understanding macro is very important in order to be a good investor.  I heard Mohamed El-Erian say today that \"you can't have a great house in a bad neighborhood\".  So no matter how great you are at investing, macro will affect you.\n\nGood luck to all and thanks for giving me a platform to share.", "id": "xqtkd7", "created_utc": 1664412341.0, "score": 281, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 432, "comments": [{"body": "Very vague post", "score": 326, "replies": [{"body": "Solution: let‚Äôs have a conversation about these flaws.

The question for each participant is about their expectations, but the assumption is that most people have already positioned themselves to align with their sentiment before sentiment surveys are published. Most people don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI expect the economy to crash. Will probably move to cash next month‚Äù. It‚Äôs usually they‚Äôve already aligned their portfolio before even being surveyed, let alone published. This is literal ‚Äúpricing in‚Äù in action.

So even when these bearish predictions are right and the economy tanks exactly like they expected, there still isn‚Äôt any more sellers so prices still can‚Äôt go down. \n\nWhy we say stock market != economy\n\nIt‚Äôs not enough to predict the direction of the economy. This is where retail investors get frustrated and you see these posts everyday. Alpha comes from the difference between forecasts and results. \n\nA cigarette company is forecast a 2% decline in revenues. Smart money predicts a 5% decline. Retail expects ‚ÄúMaJoR dEClInE!‚Äù Like 20% So when the company reports a 4% decline in revenue and stock stays flat, puts expire worthless then the stock rises on market makers covering shorts, retail thinks they got cheated cause how can the stock go up after missing earnings?\n\nSo now when the economy slows a bit, but less than expected the stock market will actually rally and you‚Äôll see retail complaining and staying on the sidelines until they buy in again halfway through the next bull run\n\nSo my thesis isn‚Äôt that the bears are wrong about the economy, it‚Äôs just that the public can‚Äôt be right about prices.

But alas I must disagree again at least a bit. Professional fund managers do not move all of their funds to cash when they have a negative future outlook. There are a lot of reasons for this but I briefly discussed them above. Additionally, there are other reasons people sell. Cash flow requirements, margin calls, liquidity needs, etc. so despite bearish sentiment you will have sellers in most cases.\n\nAdditionally, the market may price in negative expectations, but that pricing in always leaves room for ‚Äúthe odds‚Äù. Relevant recent example, lets say the market believes there is a 99% chance the Fed raises rates by 75bp. Analysts adjust their models to include 75bp higher debt costs.

The purpose was to say \"hey, look, this was likely even though a lot of people said it wasn't, and it actually ended up happening.  More data needed.\"   I'm not sure if I was supposed to come up with a groundbreaking new theory or something, I was just sharing along the personal knowledge that \"hey, I thought this could happen, and it did - here's a source\".  This was not meant to reinvent the wheel, and a quick look at the typical content of /r/stocks tells me that it's likely that this new information for a lot of people.\n\nI also don't think it's fair to say that I'm only getting criticism because of the way I wrote it.  People are always dicks on Reddit, this could have been written by the FOMC and Redditers would be calling me an \"elitist dick\" or something.  You can't please everyone.\n\n>This is not an academic sub and it's never going to appreciate a write up that offers no solutions except to stay humble and vague calls to educate yourself. I recognize that r/economics is generally a terrible sub, but that would be a better place for this. Everyone here already knows we have a crisis, but it's a sub for stocks and investing. Telling them we have a crisis doesn't help them invest and most people generally aren't interested in complicated monetary and fiscal policy that even brilliant economists can't agree on.\n\nI see your point about /r/stocks, but disagree.

Or would you disagree?  So I don't think there's any reason why we should avoid talking about macro.  Again, that's my opinion, you may disagree.

They are threatened by the notion of uncertainty.\n\nI could be wrong, but given that this routinely happens to me regardless of the topic or writing format, I believe there's something to it.

We didn't do that in '08 and we didn't do that when we were running $120B of QE per month more than a year after the initial crisis.  This was inexcusable.

I am human and absolutely knee-jerk and jump to conclusions all the time, but at the end of the day I'm always willing to examine my beliefs and also recognize that maybe I jumped to conclusions or something like that.  Humility is actually the basis of my whole approach, that's why I like William White's work - a big part of his modeling is about humility and I think that's an area the Fed misses.  Humans and society in general miss it, and the Fed is just one manifestation of this, albeit a very important one.\n\nNot saying you're not humble, actually your entire attitude here shows that you are.  Just further explaining where I'm coming from.  It's interesting because humility doesn't mean I'm less capable of taking a position... in a way it makes me more capable of taking a position, because it means that any position I do take is based on thorough investigation rather than just surface evidence or beliefs given to me by others.  I think this is why I share things in such a self-assured fashion, because I genuinely put a lot of thought into this and it all points in one direction to me.

It shocks me that something so rational and evidence based could be tossed out so easily, and not only tossed out, but ridiculed and mocked.

This is going to be a shitty not fun to read cathartic rant.\n\nI sold at the top. It wasn't hard to time at all. In fact, it was one of the easiest tops to spot in a long while. We had recession signals flashing everywhere across the board. And even if the penny was going to fall the other way, the risk/reward ratio was completely off. There was no incentive to stay in the market. \n\nI've been lurking for a while on this sub reading typical  mantra's like \"buy when others are fearful, sell when others are greedy\", \"time in the market beats timing the market\", \"DCA into S&P500\", \"don't fight the fed\". The thing is, one day one Redditor will parrot \"don't fight the fed\" as a way of telling you that you should get out of stocks (effectively timing the market based on macro economic events), while another will say \"time in the market beats timing the market\" (effectively advising you against timing). The truth? These statements were made by professionals in a certain context. They are now taken out of context and used by beginner investors and applied as the end all be all general rules you should live by. You think Warren Buffet doesn't time the market? He definitely does. Even though his famous mantra says you shouldn't, he does it himself. Yes. Between now and 2020 he sold everything and went full into cash. He did the same thing in the 2008 crisis. Full cash. Sold all his positions and waited it out to rebuy at the bottom. Morale of the story: these mantra's only work in context. And now with current economic climate, that context changes. So the rules change. And if you listen to the average Redditor on this sub who still goes by the old rules you'll make mistakes. \n\nHell, last week I saw a thread \"should I start DCA'ing now or wait for crash?\". OP apparently completely missed the irony in that question.\n\nAlright, about this current market top. \"Buy stocks to avoid inflation\". Well, we live in a time of modern economic theory where the FED and ECB dictate what the markets will do. Raising rates will have an inverse effect on stocks and inflation and a direct effect on the strength of the dollar. So naturally, sell all your stocks and trade on the Forex market for dollars. This was the easiest play to spot. \n\nWhat's going to happen next will depend on the state of the economy. Example: In the UK the Bank of England has just announced they will turn the money printer back on. Their economy can't take it anymore so they're pivoting. Printing money has an inflationary effect. Yes it will boost their stocks and help businesses, keep employment rate up, yada yada yada. But it decrease the value of the pound. It's a given. It's cause and effect. So if you want to make money, there u go, short the pound. US could face a similar problem within the next 6-12 months. Powell said they'd be raising rates throughout 2024 I believe. That's only going to happen if the economy can take it. While they continue to hike rates stocks will go down, dollar will go up, unemployment rate will increase, debt delinquency will rise, and at some point mortgage defaults will rise. You should be short on stocks, long on dollars. UNTIL one of the above mentioned breaks and Powell is forced to pivot, like the bank of England, because the economy cannot take it anymore. When that happens, when you see him on TV saying they're decreasing rates/turning printer back on, you reverse your strategy. Into stocks, out of dollar. If Powell does this, that buys the US economy one more economic cycle. Do note that we will be in a hyper inflationary market period if that happens. And then probably around 2030 it all comes crashing down. When Powell 2.0 then is forced to go Volcker style on the rates, he will be on TV again and it will be your sell signal. Can't miss it. Until you see Powell pivot, you stay the course.\n\nTL;DR: fuck rule of thumb mantra's, learn about macro economics", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I‚Äôm only down 22% but just look at it as a buying opportunity to dca lower.

It seems US degrees aren't comparable at all to what we get in Europe. I studied business administration and energy management in Denmark. I also had plenty of other helpful classes like organization, econometrics, risk management (within limits it helps to see weaknesses in certain industries but most importantly it familiarizes you with the concept of risk and diversification as well as establishment of proper procedure which is also crucial to a good investor ) , stakeholder management (makes it easier to see how companies may be vulnerable or well positioned because it opens your eyes to consequences of stakeholder issues and interconnectedness ),.. . Of course there are limits to what you can learn in three years but there's a lot of value in the degree. Some people pass who don't actually understand the logic behind it all, these people obviously wouldn't make good investors, however I'd argue that those who have an interest in investing will be enabled greatly by the degree and know exactly what knowledge gaps are left for their investing.

The math classes in first year were hard and rightfully so because the math needed for corporate finance was way more difficult. Our bachelor degrees really shouldn't be three years. Even our finance prof said that, she said the work load would actually require twice the amount of time we had (for a certain class, so the BA ought to be 4 years) But almost every student ends up taking a masters degree afterwards anyway, those who were really good in some classes and enjoyed those then typically specialize in them, like specialize in accounting or finance or management or marketing or something entirely different.  But honestly, its not actually necessary to take finance classes to invest. CAPM and IRR, NPV and whatever isn't particularly applicable and the options pricing models and lots of other models require knowing things that in itself are impossible to just know. We did learn option strategies and pricing as well as free cash flow bla bla and the book mentions many useful topics, securities for example or cash flow spikes liquidity blabla etc. Furthermore finance models only work in a rational world and as you might well know, the stock and financial markets (and politics) are full of idiots irrational emotional behavior and odd occurrences unpredictable events and lots of uncertainty. you can't just price a risk like you learn in finance. Warren buffet made fun of those models as well and for good reason.

Knew the long term bull market had to end sooner or later, so completely pulled out 2 years prior to the pandemic, while investing cash in 3 year CDs averaging 3% during the 0% interest days.  Was a decent move, for a  portfolio nearing rerirement.  But I failed to reinvest and missed the bull run during the height of the pandemic.  Didn't forsee that at all.  \n\nThen I made the biggest mistake of my investing life, when I invested six figures into BNTX after seeing it scream upwards every day on the ticker.
