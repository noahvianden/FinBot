The adjusted closing price for the stock would then be $18.50 ($20-$1.50).\n\nIf XYZ Corp. announces a 2:1 stock dividend instead of a cash dividend, the adjusted closing price calculation will change. A 2:1 stock dividend means that for every share an investor owns, he or she will receive two more shares. In this case, the adjusted closing price calculation will be $20*(1 / (2+1)).

Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and do not have a firm fifth.  It use to be Meta but I see more and more Meta business going to Google.\n\nMeta trouble is driven by privacy.  Google has just so a better model.  With Google people are willing to come to them and whare what is on their mind.   Where Meta has to track you to try to figure out what ad.\n\nThis is just one of the reasons Google is #1.   But more because Google just has a massive runway to work with.  Built on all of Google assets that they have yet fully moentized.   Should easily fuel double digit growth for at least the next decade.\n\nLook at the last reported quarter.   Google has the strongest growth of any of the big tech companies.  I do have Apple #2 but Google growth was over 5x bigger than Apple.\n\nWhere I am different from many is between Microsoft and Amazon.  It is close but I put Amazon ahead but I would bet in a poll on this subreddit you would find more put Microsoft ahead of Amazon.  Both are still pretty pricey.\n\nAnother huge advatage with Google is how cheap it is compared to the other three.  So the fastest growing, biggest runway and has the cheapest price.\n\nI think a big reason is because some think Google will be slowed down by antitrust.  But I am not convinced the US government will do anything.   I think if the mega tech companies were smart they would be screaming what about China?   We can't hurt the US mega tech companies because it would better position China in terms of tech including AI.  Fear mongering works.  Mega tech should learn it.\n\nThe other reason is because if you really get down to it Apple is a lot more anticompetive than Google.  In the past Apple got a pass because they had so little market share.  But that is really not true any longer.  So I think this will help Google some.  Remove some of their scrutiny with more moving to Apple.\n\nJust some examples of the difference.  On Android Google allows any browser.  On iOS Apple only allows skins and you can NOT use anything but Apple.   On Android you can use whatever store.  With iOS you can ONLY use the Apple store.  Google allows sideloading   Apple does NOT.  Then a big one is iMessages and all the shannigans Apple has pulled with it.

{"title": "Apple is gaining on Facebook and Google in online ads after iOS privacy change, report shows", "selftext": "The Google-Facebook online ad duopoly may be breaking up. According to a study published Tuesday by Appsumer, Apple is gaining momentum in digital ads, while Google and Facebook appear to be losing steam. The research, based on an analysis of the online ad budgets of over 100 different consumer app companies, found that Apple‚Äôs ad business has benefited from the company‚Äôs major iOS privacy update in 2021, which made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track users across the Internet. Apple‚Äôs search ads let people advertise on the iPhone maker‚Äôs App Store. Advertiser adoption rate for the second quarter rose almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier to 94.8%, while Facebook adoption fell 3 percentage points to 82.8%, Appsumer said. Google‚Äôs rate declined 2 points to 94.8%.\n\nApple has ‚Äújoined the duopoly of Facebook and Google at the top table of advertiser adoption,‚Äù according to Appsumer, which is owned by InMobi. Shumel Lais, general manager at Appsumer, attributed Apple‚Äôs improved standing to an increase in the number of app developers willing to pay big money to bolster downloads. At the same time, Apple‚Äôs App Tracking Transparency (ATT) update has limited the amount of data ad-based apps like Facebook can use to help brands with their online ad campaigns. ‚ÄúOne of the things that‚Äôs quite interesting is the ATT measurement limitations that are kind of put on the wider network doesn‚Äôt exist in the same way for Apple,‚Äù Lais said. ‚ÄúSo you could say Apple has slightly more visibility or an advantage across the other channels on iOS.‚Äù\n\nApple‚Äôs rise in online ads for developers mirrors Amazon‚Äôs position in e-commerce, as retailers spend more money to promote their products on the site they rely on for customers. In terms of overall app developer spend on online advertising, referred to as share of wallet, Google remains at the top, with 34%. Facebook is second at 28%, followed by Apple at 15%. Amazon wasn‚Äôt listed because it‚Äôs not a platform for developers. At the lower end of the market, TikTok overtook Snap, which has also been hammered by ATT. TikTok has 3% market share, and Snap is at 2%, Appsumer said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/06/apple-is-gaining-on-facebook-and-google-in-online-ads-after-ios-change.html", "id": "x71h0c", "created_utc": 1662440037.0, "score": 517, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 178, "replies": [{"body": "History is very consistent on this point.\n\nCompanies form extremely powerful moats.

{"title": "Meta has been fined $402 million by the Irish Data Protection Commission for its handling of children‚Äôs privacy settings on Instagram", "selftext": "check this out\n\n[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6lyop/meta_has_been_fined_402_million_by_the_irish_data/)\n\nA fat fine ‚Äî of $402 million ‚Äî is headed Instagram‚Äôs way after European Union privacy regulators came to a decision on a long running complaint related to how the social media platform handles children‚Äôs data. The penalty is for a breach of the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nMeta was contacted for comment on the penalty.\n\nWe understand the final GDPR decision on the Instagram enquiry was sent to Meta, Instagram‚Äôs parent, Friday ‚Äî ahead of formal publication on the websites of the company‚Äôs lead data supervisor in the EU, Ireland‚Äôs Data Protection Commission (DPC); and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body which helped coordinate a decision review process involving other interested EU data protection authorities ‚Äî however the size of the penalty for Meta appears to have leaked early, via a report in Politico, which contains the fine figure (which shakes out to around $403M at current currency exchange prices) but no further details of the decision.\n\nIreland‚Äôs DPC confirmed the level of fine to us. Deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: ‚ÄúWe adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of ‚Ç¨405 million. Full details of the decision will publish next week.‚Äù\n\nThe Instagram penalty is the largest GDPR penalty the social media giant has been hit with to-date (though not the largest ever GDPR fine; that one landed on Amazon) ‚Äî following a $267M penalty levied upon the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp last September for violations of the GDPR‚Äôs transparency principle.\n\nThe Instagram complaint focused on the platform‚Äôs processing of children‚Äôs data for business accounts and on a user registration system it operated which the DPC found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to ‚Äúpublic‚Äù by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to ‚Äúprivate‚Äù.\n\nThe GDPR contains strong measures requiring privacy by design and default generally ‚Äî as well provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children‚Äôs information specifically, as well as ensuring that services targeting kids are living up to transparency and accountability principles (such as by providing suitably clear communications that children can understand).\n\nThe reasoning underpinning the fine for Instagram is expected to be released in the coming days, when the final decision gets published next week (assuming it doesn‚Äôt leak early).\n\nWhile today‚Äôs headlines are going to make painful reading for Meta, TikTok is another social media firm likely to be watching developments closely since it‚Äôs under investigation by the DPC over its own handling of children‚Äôs data. But that enquiry was only opened by the DPC a year ago so it‚Äôs likely to have some time to run before a decision is reached.\n\nThe Instagram decision took extra time as other DPAs raised objections to Ireland‚Äôs draft decision ‚Äî triggering a mechanism in the regulation designed to settle disputes which can add many more months to the timeframe.\n\nIreland‚Äôs WhatsApp decision also went through a review process after objections were raised to its draft ‚Äî and in that case the size of the penalty was substantially raised as a result. But it remains to be seen whether the same has happened here, with Instagram.\n\nSource: [https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/05/instagram-gdpr-fine-childrens-privacy/](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/05/instagram-gdpr-fine-childrens-privacy/)", "id": "x7gd8d", "created_utc": 1662485102.0, "score": 2959, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "They always go after the kids.", "score": 269, "replies": [{"body": "It's the modern equivalent of tobacco.

That resonates with me personally, and there are a lot of other downstream benefits to Apple from that too.  \n\n3) new products. Apple has feet in R&D for a few things I think have good future potential. Apple car and VR/AR being two of those. \n\n4) wearables. They keep expanding the wearables options and at least where I live I constantly see people with them. I love my air pod pros. I know there are competitors but Apple has an edge with compatibility and integration of products. Whether or not someone more tech literate can dispute this, the average consumer definitely seems to believe it, which will drive future sales. \n\n5) Apple chips. I wish I had more technical experience here, but from what I‚Äôve read casually the Apple chips are performing really well, and this gives Apple further verticals integration for their products. \n\nFinally with regards to the phone market specifically, there are still a lot of android users out there that could be converted. That said, I do think they‚Äôve hit closer to saturation, but I Ben if phone sales slow they won‚Äôt decline significantly long term. And the trade-in program definitely helps spur upgrades sooner. I think this will be solid revenue to fund development of new consumer goods and R&D into new tech (at least this is my hope).\n\nI‚Äôm also a sucker for a dividend, which they finally give albeit not much. \n\nI used to be very bearish on Apple and have been consistently proven wrong.

It was just the coolest gadget I ever owned and was my most prized possession. At the time the share price was probably around 10-18 dollars. Apple went up and up and up and I remember getting enough profit to sell my Apple shares to buy the new iPod which I really wanted. So I sold em. Now looking back on it, hard to calculate exactly how much I would have today if I never sold and just held, but it would probably be around 40-80k or even more. Kicking myself, I think about that all the time.\n\nYour friend is an idiot. Apple is not just about iPhones anymore. First of all, Apple is the premiere product designer, developer and manufacturer on the planet and no other company even comes close. That means Apple can try their hand at any other type of electronic product and become a market leader. If Apple wanted to make an electric can opener, it would be the market leader for can openers instantly. That is the power of the brand. Apple is the name you think of for the premiere option of laptops, smartphones, wireless earbuds, watches and tablets. They are also about to add to their portfolio an AR/VR headset device and a car. When the Apple car comes out, it might be game over for Tesla, Apple instantly becomes a market leader in the luxury car space.  Apple's M2 chip is the best performing chip ever for mobile tech, and immediately gives Apple a power advantage when they come out with their VR headset. When the AR/VR headset comes out, it's going to embarrass Zuckerberg and his unsexy nerd machine Oculus and whatever else Meta can come up with.\n\nApple Airpods alone make billions of dollars of revenue, and more than many tech companies like Twitter, Uber and Snapchat. (It's been debated, but conservatively, 7.5 billion)\n\nIn addition, Apple is making a huge play at payments. Once you start paying for everything with Apple Pay, you take the market share of Venmo and Paypal, you become the market leader for e-transactions and Apple takes a cut.\n\nApple takes a huge cut for every app sold in its marketplace, and still Apple is the gatekeeper for the gateway for all your access to third party apps.\n\nApple is making a huge play in the media space with Apple TV and Arcade, they only need to be relatively competitive and have extremely deep pockets. They can keep throwing money at content and they can easily become a top 3 streamer. Apple One is the big play for subscriptions which will be a huge game changer. If Apple can get everyone subscribed and paying a monthly fee for content, bundle that with the phone or whatever other gadgets, Apple suddenly gets you to open your wallet every month. You'll be paying that Apple One fee and it's worth it, rather than paying for Netflix or Spotify or whatever else (Apple TV + Apple Music and Apple News and huge cloud access? Sign me up) .\n\nFinally, Apple's either the number one or number 2 most cash rich company in the world. It's got money in the bank to try things, and they have a laser focus, so they don't try things without carefully considering their moves. They can sit on their asses and be patient to come out with great products while others rush around and knock heads.\n\nApple has been dedicated to making the greatest products ever since Steve Jobs came back and turned the company around. That moment I laid eyes on that iPod I shoulda known and put my whole life savings into Apple. It might have been the greatest consumer electronic product ever invented up till that point. It was just so damn cool compared to everything else on the market. That dedication to products first still lives on past Steve Jobs, and the brand is never going to stray from that idea. I think that only Amazon is any real threat to Apple in terms of controlling the media market landscape, and if you have a little of both, then you shouldn't have anything to worry about as a tech investor.\n\nI ask you this, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google know Apple is their biggest competitor. After all, many people can't access Amazon, Google or Meta products without their Apple device. Apple holds the keys, and they take a big cut to allow you to pass through the gate to access Amazon, Meta and products. If they know this, why don't they find someway to compete or bypass Apple?.... They can't. Quite simply, that combination of knowledge, skill, design and engineering talent is impossible to compete with. Amazon tried to make a device with the Fire, they failed. Meta is trying with the Oculus, so far it's just a novelty. Google and Samsung have Android devices and yes, Android is successful, but it so far is still seen by the general public as a second-class device to the iPhone and the M2 chips just blow away the competition. The integrations Apple has built in with cloud in the laptops, phone and Airpods just make it that much harder to leave the Apple ecosystem which works so seamlessly.\n\nApple has the rare combination of hardware and software genius and integration. Google and Microsoft may be competitive and even stronger in some areas when it comes to software and AI, but they don't have the total package to be able to make seamless product integrations currently. Amazon controls much of the media landscape and owns massive amounts of servers and is second to none in supply chains, but they can't deliver digital media to the masses without Apple products.

They've also diversified a little since then and now services are a much larger proportion of revenues.\n\nThe question going forward is how can AAPL expand into new categories (AR/VR, EVs, ads, etc) and can AAPL continue to raise prices. I think there's clearly some room to expand into new product categories - an AR/VR headset seems very likely. I think there's also room to continue to raise prices around some of their services. However I don't think they have much room to raise prices of phones and laptops at this point and these categories combined make up the majority of their revs currently.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that there's room to grow, but it's probably limited, at least compared to what they've been able to do historically.\n\nThe other thing you need to consider here is buybacks. Buybacks will continue support share price growth, but when you're $2.5T company the buybacks need to be much larger to make any dent. Buy backs are much more impactful when you're trading at a 14 PE compared to a 28 PE and I think this is often not appreciated here. Any benefit of continued buybacks is priced into the stock at this point.\n\nIt's not a bad company to own though. I just wouldn't expect anything that far above a market return over the next decade.
