Would I rather get $25 of a $50 option back or $0.50 of a $25.50 option?\n\nFollowing my assumptions, I figured the cheaper option was better because, for example, $10 per dollar increase on a $10 option is better than $50 per dollar increase on a $100 option.

Ray Dalio: Expect a 20% sell-off in the stock market if rates keep rising.**\n\n\"With inflation well above what people and central banks want and the unemployment rate low, it's obvious that inflation is the targeted problem, so it's obvious that the central banks should tighten monetary policy. Everything will flow from that,\" Dalio said on Wednesday.\n\n\"I estimate that a rise in rates from where they are to about 4.5% will produce about a 20% negative impact on equity prices,\" Dalio said.\n\n**2. Scott Minerd (Guggenheim CIO): A 20% decline in the S&P 500 could happen by mid-October.**\n\n\"It's really stark to see the price-to-earnings ratio where it is... given where seasonals are, and how far out of line we are historically with where the p/e is, we should see a really sharp adjustment in prices very fast,\" Minerd said last week.\n\n\"It appears people are ignoring the macro backdrop, monetary policy backdrop, which would basically indicate that the bear market is intact. We may very well already be in a recession... with YoY core PCE now at 4.6% and S&P 500 trading at \\~19x, we should see stocks fall another 20% by mid-October,\" Minerd said.\n\n**3. Jeff Gundlach (DoubleLine Capital founder): The credit market suggests both the economy and stock market are in trouble.**\n\n\"The action of the credit market is consistent with economic weakness and stock market trouble. I think you have to start becoming more bearish,\" Gundlach said on Tuesday, adding that he agrees with Scott Minerd's call that stocks can fall 20% soon.\n\n\"You always want to own stocks, but I'm a little on the lighter side...buy long-term Treasurys, because the deflation risk — in spite of the fact that the narrative today is exactly the opposite — the deflation risk is much higher today that it's been for the past two years,\" Gundlach said. Gundlach believes the Fed should hike interest rates by just 25 basis points next week.\n\n# The Bulls\n\n**1. Tom Lee (Fundstrat founder): Inflation has already peaked and that means you should buy stocks.**\n\n\"Even for those in the 'inflationista' camp or even the 'we are in a long-term bear' camp, the fact is, if headline CPI has peaked, the June 2022 equity lows should be durable,\" Lee said on Friday.\n\nAugust's higher-than-expected CPI report \"does not mean stocks have to break below the June lows,\" Lee said, as he reiterated his view that S&P 500 will rally more than 20% to new highs by year-end.\n\n**2. Jeremy Siegel (UPenn Wharton professor): Inflation is falling and whoever wanted to get out of stocks already has.**\n\n\"It seems like everyone that wants to be out of the market is out, and everyone that wants to be tactical is short. Therefore the surprises are going to be to the upside... when everyone has sold, only the buyers are left, and the shorts are exposed,\" Siegel said on Monday.\n\nSiegel said if the Fed says rates will be higher for longer, \"That would be a policy mistake. I think they're going to look at the economy, and I hope they understand what the statistics are and what on the ground inflation is.\"\n\n**3. Marko Kolanovic (JP Morgan Chief Global Strategist): The stock market will rally as inflation resolves itself.**\n\n\"Given the lag it takes for rate hikes to work through the system, and with just one month before very important US elections, we believe it would be a mistake for the Fed to increase risk of a hawkish policy error and endanger market stability,\" Kolanovic said on Monday.\n\n\"Our expectation that the global economy will stay out of recession, increasing fiscal stimulus, and still very low investor positioning and sentiment should thus continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, despite the more hawkish central bank rhetoric recently,\" Kolanovic said.", "id": "xhczwt", "created_utc": 1663496348.0, "score": 1823, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 493, "comments": [{"body": "basically perma bull and perma bear each have a story from their side, gotcha.", "score": 503, "replies": [{"body": "Both sides have been wrong too many times for either to be reliable opinions.", "score": 128, "replies": [{"body": "Well they could be right, my understanding is the market could go up but it could also go down", "score": 127, "replies": [{"body": "When stagflation was hitting in the mid 70s to 80s it was a very choppy sideways market.

The Fed can't fix that with interest rate hikes. However, the Fed can slow economic growth with interest rate hikes, which impacts inflation in ways not necessarily effective for managing government-policy-caused inflation factors (like trade wars). \n\nThis means the Fed can easily fall into the trap of the 1970's, where the growth slowdown caused by its interest rate hikes appear to be working to slow inflation, but since the interest rate hikes don't actually solve the root causes of inflation drivers, if the Fed stops hiking, inflation will reassert itself. \n\nIt also means that inflation is not out of control, on the other hand, because our government could stop doing those things that are actually driving inflation, like create a more feasible energy policy (than our current unrealistic approach of reducing hydrocarbon energy production without reducing energy consumption). We could also drop the inflationary aspects of our trade war vs China, like tariffs that don't reduce our imports from China (which have kept growing) but do reflect an inflationary tax on consumer goods, or semiconductor chip embargoes we have imposed in attempts to slow China's technical advances that threaten US dominance of tech. Or we could stop throwing money & weapons at Ukraine/Russia conflicts and halt our massive weaponization of the Far East to counter China's growing military threat. \n\nAnother inflationary government policy is restraint of immigration of blue collar workers. America's economy has grown on the labor of generations of immigrants who will provide skilled labor in conditions of significant economic inequality, and America's service & production economies can't run effectively without massive infusions of disadvantaged immigrant workers. The US would have to develop more European style safety nets & wages in order to have a functional economy without exploiting immigrants. To solve the inflationary labor issues, the US would have to change its immigration policies to allow massive amounts of blue collar immigration from Latin American countries or change its labor policies to reduce inequality so that US born citizens are more willing to work at skilled labor & service jobs. \n\nIn short, there are a lot of things that the gov can do to slow or stop the inflation that it is causing with its policies and actions/inactions, so inflation is not necessarily out of control, either, as the gov will certainly do some of these things (that it can do) to correct or moderate inflation drivers under its control if people get pissed off enough or if leaders become alarmed enough. \n\nThe truth is, the Fed can't control inflation directly or well using interest rate hikes & QT alone, since the government is causing most of our inflation problems with its infeasible ESG energy policies, trade wars & NATO warfare actions & immigration/labor policies. But neither is inflation out of control, because leaders can tweak their actions & make changes to their inflationary policies to do just enough to keep people from revolting or voting them out of office. \n\nWe are in a period of highly manipulated national economies, and have been so since the start of the pandemic. Government leaders will continue to use the opportunity to manipulate the economy to pursue trade, spending and program agendas for as long as then can until people revolt and kick our leaders out of office, and that won't happen so long as most voters are OK with an economy that is just short of stagflation, and wealthy people & white collar workers are managing to stay afloat.\n\nAs far as stocks are concerned, the only reason they've held up so well so far in the 2nd half of the 2022 is that other investment markets in the world have sucked worse. Every time Europe's economy tanks some more or Xi imposes COVID-zero lockdowns in China some more, people pull money out of other markets & put it into US stocks. While our leaders muddle through what they are doing, US stocks should perform about the same as they have been in the past couple of months, trading sideways, with inflation neither under control or out of control. The US stock market won't tank unless there's a big shock to the system (a Lehman type event), European and/or EM economies rebound from their current recessionary crashes enough to provide reasonable investment alternatives so people pull money out of overvalued US stocks, or something negative happens to erode the US stock market & USD safe haven status.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "God I have never seen so much garbage typed on Reddit all at one time", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "You haven't been around reddit much then.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Long enough to see this is probably one of the most ridiculous comments ever typed", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I love hyperbolic, vague descriptions of very detailed posts.

The Fed didn't want to aggressively raise rates this year, the data forced them too. They also didn't want to cut rates to zero and double the balance sheet in 2020-2021, again the data forced them.\n\nYes, the Fed can decide if it's going to be a 75bps or a 100bps hike at next weeks meeting, but what the terminal rate will be, or how aggressively they will continue to hike is entirely dependant on the data.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is unless you're trader nothing the Fed says really matters. Within some boundary of error they'll do what they have to do based on the data. Whether the market rises or falls 20% from here will really depend on what happens in terms of inflation and energy imo.\n\nIf inflation continues to come down and oil prices don't spike again then I think we're probably at or near a bottom here. My concern now is really just that inflation won't come down quickly enough, or maybe even start to rise again, which will force the Fed to stay higher for longer. All we really need for that to happen is for oil to spike again at which I suspect the combined impact of higher oil prices and tighter monetary policy is likely to break something in the economy.\n\nWith debt-to-GDP at 130% rates higher than 5% for a sustained period of time are basically infeasible. The Fed simply can't go much higher without causing significant problems for the economy and that's without adding any additional energy shocks to the mix. In such a scenario we will likely see earnings tank and a Fed in a position where they won't be able to provide the support needed to the economy.\n\nI personally think the bear case here is much more than 20% down. If I price a 4% terminal rate and a 10% earnings decline I end up with an estimated 30% decline on the S&P500 from these levels. The bull case is slightly harder to make because it would require both decent earnings growth and peak yields. To get a 20% rally I'd need to make some fairly silly assumptions like the 10y yield falling back to 2.5% in an environment where earnings growth is better than expected. I don't see that at all, but then again the 10y did fall to 2.5% from these levels just a couple of months back.

Putin is murdering Billionaires in an effort to eliminate all opposition inside Russia. Generally, it's is a bad sign when a country's leader goes down this path. This makes it more likely than not things will get escalated in the war in Ukraine and with the cold energy war with Europe. The uncovering of mass graves in Ukraine recently is yet another sign that there is no end in sight to the conflict\n2. Europe will have a recession. With energy prices what they are, there's no way the economies will be able to hold. They are talking energy rationing, energy hoarding, government takeovers of energy infrastructure, and massive energy subsidies from the government. Businesses are taking 5-10X increases in energy prices. And winter is coming\n3. The U.S. economy is slowing and the housing bubble is about to burst\n4. There is no real wage growth in the U.S. thanks to inflation\n5. The sentiment on wall street is negative, generally, and many firms are sitting in cash waiting\n6. Supply chains are improving\n7. Shipping rates are back to pre-covid levels\n8. Global demand for goods is slowing\n9. Global demand for semiconductor making  equipment has slowed\n10. Used and new car prices increases have flattened \n11. Commodity prices have fallen across the board\n12. Peak inflation has occurred\n13. Covid is contained and China has vaccinated its population, though with an inferior product\n14. U.S. - China tensions over Taiwan will impact markets occasionally \n15. For Q3 2022, the estimated earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 3.5%--the lowest earnings growth rate reported by the index since Q3 2020 (-5.7%).\n16.  For Q3 2022, 65 S&P 500 companies have issued negative EPS guidance and 40 S&P 500 companies have issued positive EPS guidance\n17. The percentage of SPY companies issuing negative EPS guidance for the year is 54%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on this, there's mostly indication of a choppy market for months. The best catalysts would be several month over month CPI reports showing inflation coming down steeply paired with labor reports of rising unemployment as that will get the Fed believing their job is done raising rates. The other good catalyst would be for the war to end in Ukraine and Amazon and Costco and Visa to report things are still great with the consumer. \n\nLikely we haven't seen bottom yet but it's worth taking small calculated long term purchases on bad news days and trading on the news when opportunities present .", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "It’s not gonna go 20% in any which direction in such a short time", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Hmm, from June lows S&P rallied 13% and NASDAQ rallied 25%….before Jackson hole.\n\nCycles are getting shorter.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Yea but ahead of next week’s fed meeting?

Gods Unchained should he dropping even sooner but that’s still a very small MTG/Hearthstone type game and will take more time to penetrate if it’s going to. \n\nWe gotta see how it goes. If I’m wrong I lose a lot of money, if I’m right I’m retired. I got no problem with that gamble.\n\nEdit: I said especially indie devs would be incentivized. I don’t know if you’ve seen Illuvium but that doesn’t look like an indie game to me and the plan as I understand it is to release 3-4 games in that world where assets can be transferred and traded from one game to the next. It seems like a big ask, but I think it’s more backwards to dismiss the idea that devs will put forth projects like this and others that ‘intertwine’ worlds so to speak than it is to gamble on the possibility of it working.

As an investor you should be terrified that the only way they can make money is by selling shares and diluting current shareholders rather than, you know, from running their actual business. How long does that billion dollars last them based on their current burn rate? 18 months? Well its already been over 18 months since the beginning of the \"transformation\". What makes you believe the next 18 will be better than the previous. \n\n\n> They retired all debt early and have leased a 700,000 square foot distribution warehouse with plans on leasing more warehouse space in the future.\n\n\nYes they wiped out their debt by diluting their sharesholders and selliing share of the company rather than making a profit. And yes they leased a warehouse. Wow amazon 2.0 confirmed. Afterall they do need more warehouse space to house all of the inventory that they cant manage to sell. But im sure housing inventory that you are have trouble selling doesnt cost them anything. Right?\n\n\n> They have an entire section dedicated to PC gaming including peripherals and individual components, with prices comparable or even below that of amazon.\n\n\nHow is that section performing? What are the numbers on it? \n\n\n> They have shut down low performing stores while simultaneously cutting its c-suite bloat, using that money instead as a compensation package for its front line retail workers.\n\nGuys layoffs are a good thing when its the company I like who is doing it. Please forget the endless bragging from apes about all of the new executives they poached from other companies. Now its actually bullish that they are laying them off. These are signs of a healthy company. \n\n\n> They have a board of directors who actually listen to their shareholders, and a shareholder base who actively communicates their needs to the board.\n\n\nCan you give some examples? Which great ideas have shareholders communicated to the board that the board and listened to and enacted? Ill I have seen are tweets about literal poop and penis jokes from the chairman of the board (PBUH)\n\n\n> Their current negative EPS is a direct result of an increased investment in transforming the company\n\n\nTotal bullshit. They had negative EPS long before apes got involved and this \"transformation\" happened. Go read through their earnings. Prove to me they are losing money for those reasons. Show me how them losing money is now for different reasons than pre squeeze.\n\n\n> hey have not only created a marketplace for buying and selling digital assets, but have also created their own wallet and been partnering with pioneers in the space such as Loopring, IMX, and most recently FTX.\n\n\nThe marketplace had a revenue (not profit) of about $800 over the last 24 hours. If you ignore the first week or so when apes just bought a bunch of used jpegs because they are dumb, their daily revenues are significantly below their operating costs of the marketplace. Every day that they keep the marketplace open it is losing them money \n\n\n> The e t h merge has just happened, reducing the energy cost of transactions by 99.8%.\n\n\nHow is this at all relevant to GME stock. \n\n\n> Public short interest currently stands at ~51 million shares or 25% of the float, still extraordinarily high.\n\n\nAnd? The stock has been on a downward trend for quite some time now. It is very likely that the vast majority of open short positions are highly profitable currently. \n\n\n> Investors in GME have Directly Registered 23% of the entire company as of GME’s Q3 10-Q.\n\n\nOnce again, And? What exactly do you believe this is accomplishing? And please explain how and why. \n\n\n> If Gamestop were in real financial trouble they could issue another stock sale, only 300m of the 1bn authorized shares are currently in the market.\n\n\nYes once again when gamestop runs out of money because they are running a terrible business they will either have to take on debt or further continue to dilute shareholders.

Account growth has basically been linear at around [330 new accounts each day since Jan 22](https://i.redd.it/0ozpndm480o91.png). People that DRSed are buying more and the average shares per account is rising.\n\nLets be conservative and assume that all apes have already DRSed, all DRS growth is from buying new shares and all new accounts after 195,000 are just second/third accounts from apes that already DRSed and are transferring more. At a 0.75% weekly share growth rate (from computershared.net) and $30 average share price over 13 weeks retail is pumping $18.7 mil per week into the stock and $245 mil each quarter. Using that growth rate, \\~8 mil DRS shares last quarter came from new share buys and \\~12.5 mil came from transfers out of a total of 20.5 mil shares DRSed last quarter.\n\nEventually shares will get scarce and the price should climb since retail is responsible for the lack of supply and for continuing demand. If we hold steady at 15-20 mil shares per quarter and growth doesn't continue accelerating it'll take 7-9 quarters to finish locking up the other 137 mil shares.

Don't just go shopping around and buy one by accident. \n\nHave a budget in mind. Right now many stealerships are ordering vehicles and putting just about every accessory they can to inflate the sticker price. They then basically tell you to take the vehicle or go kick rocks. Oh and they stack on a price hike because, reasons. \n\nFinancing is one of the few places you have some leverage on. Don't go to the lot waving cash around or bragging about paying cash like some goon, that don't impress no one least of all the dealer. The dealer makes money off financing Call your bank and every bank and credit union and ask for their car loan rates, and car loan refinance rates. Take the best deal. But also keep in mind that refinancing soon after buying may be a smart move sometimes as some banks will offer great first time loan rates or refinancing rates. \n\nOk so one thing to keep in mind is once you agree to buy a car from the salesman the \"sale\" is not complete until you are done with financing. The finance guy's job is to squeeze every last penny they can out of you. This is where homework can save you a lot of money. Say no to up sales like extended warranties and extra protection it's almost never worth it. But the loan shark is going to try and get you into a loan the benefits the dealer and gets him the most commission. If they offer you a loan more than what you have already found outside inform them you already have financing. If the finance guy tries to give you problems say you are going to walk and let your salesman know that the finance guy is going to cost him a sale. Let the salesman fight it out with the finance guy or lose his commission and sale. Do not be afraid to walk away. There are always other cars as other car salesman willing to make money.
