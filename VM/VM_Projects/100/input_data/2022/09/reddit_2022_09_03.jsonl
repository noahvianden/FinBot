No prediction of market crash.\n\n2019: Warns of passive investment strategies over inflating markets. Again this is warning of stresses building up not predicting an imminent crash. markets always inflate before they go into a downturn cycle so hes just pointing out the common phenomenom but signaling where he sees the risks. again no mention of imminent crash.\n\n2021: Warns of over inflated valuations. this is the clearest indication of an impending crash. suggesting that valuations are too high to be maintained. this is his first quote which actually implies the market is coming to a tipping point because valuation cannot be maintain. everything before this was warning of negative market activity and building of a bubble but this is the first suggestion that market valuations have gone to far.\n\n2022: markets already down 15%. touched 20% in march.

Michael Burry is not. He actually a very intelligent and successful trader that wall street hates because he calls them out on their bullshit. so wallstreet media tries to skew his comments to make it seem like he has always been wrong when in actuality his comments have been accurate from a technical standpoint and hes giving the market credible financial warnings. only spoke of or was implying an imminent crash in 2021 and here we are in 2022 down 15%.

It was really hard during this year. Because you had no income, you had to tighten your belt and control spending however you can. There were lots of hungry nights during this year.\n\nThen, in July of this year, you found a job that has an annual take-home salary of $36k.

That means For the past 12 months my annual salary was only $3000. How can I live on $3000 a year? That's only $250 a month! That's way below what I need, I have to tighten my belt again.\n\nYou see how this doesn't make sense? It's because you are looking at the wrong number! Once your situation has changed, and you are now taking home $3000 a month, you shouldn't be budgeting like you were making $3000 for a whole year.
