No prediction of market crash.\n\n2019: Warns of passive investment strategies over inflating markets. Again this is warning of stresses building up not predicting an imminent crash. markets always inflate before they go into a downturn cycle so hes just pointing out the common phenomenom but signaling where he sees the risks. again no mention of imminent crash.\n\n2021: Warns of over inflated valuations. this is the clearest indication of an impending crash. suggesting that valuations are too high to be maintained. this is his first quote which actually implies the market is coming to a tipping point because valuation cannot be maintain. everything before this was warning of negative market activity and building of a bubble but this is the first suggestion that market valuations have gone to far.\n\n2022: markets already down 15%. touched 20% in march.

Michael Burry is not. He actually a very intelligent and successful trader that wall street hates because he calls them out on their bullshit. so wallstreet media tries to skew his comments to make it seem like he has always been wrong when in actuality his comments have been accurate from a technical standpoint and hes giving the market credible financial warnings. only spoke of or was implying an imminent crash in 2021 and here we are in 2022 down 15%.

It was really hard during this year. Because you had no income, you had to tighten your belt and control spending however you can.

That's way below what I need, I have to tighten my belt again.\n\nYou see how this doesn't make sense? It's because you are looking at the wrong number! Once your situation has changed, and you are now taking home $3000 a month, you shouldn't be budgeting like you were making $3000 for a whole year.

If it were that easy then everyone would be doing it and not, historically, buying on the way up, closer to the highs. \n\nFact remains that home prices are stabilizing and slightly decreasing. Used car prices are coming down. Energy prices are coming down. Commodities, in general, also are falling. --- Are they falling significantly enough that inflation is heading from 8.5% to 2%, absolutely not, however, you have to start somewhere and, as I've reiterated many a time, these hikes that the Fed is implementing typically do not take \"real\" effect until 3-6 months afterwards. \n\nI'm a long term investor with my core portfolio being in the SPY. I've been investing since about 2006. There is ZERO indication that there is systemic risk that is going to lead the market 30% lower from here, ZERO. Could it go down another 10-20%, sure, but again, if the rebound in July taught investors anything, its that when the market comes to terms with the headwinds, it will restart its bullish trend and rebound rapidly. Why? Simple, really. Where else are you going to put your money? Lock it into the 2 year or the 10 year? No thanks. Play risky option strategies, no thanks. Stay in 50% cash and wait for a bigger dip, no thanks. I'll just keep buying on down days and, in 5-10 years time, when these short term headwinds are past, the investors who stayed the course will reap the reward. \n\nThe caveat to everything above is if you're in retirement and you really believe that the market is going to be in a prolonged pullback, then I think you need to take a different approach, however, for us younger investors, I don't see any reason to get negative, rather, I see reasons to be bullish, for the mid-to-long term where, thanks to these dips, people who stayed the course will see outsized returns rather than those sitting on the sidelines waiting for good headlines to consistently come out and, thereby, missing the easy 20% to be made. \n\nGood luck to all and LONG: SPY, GOOG.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "I am just waiting for the Fed to pivot.
