What That Means for Stocks", "selftext": "A soft landing is becoming a more likely outcome for the global economy than a recession, according to strategists at JPMorgan Chase. The avoidance of a global recession, along with moderating inflation and wage pressures among other factors, should continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, they added in a note. Within equities, the firm favors cyclical stocks, which it said should benefit from the gradual easing of inflation. They also like small-cap stocks and remain bullish on China and emerging-market stocks. \n\n‚ÄúWe maintain that inflation will resolve on its own as distortions fade and that the Fed has over-reacted with 75bps hike. We will likely see a Fed pivot, which is positive for cyclical assets,‚Äù they said. The bank‚Äôs strategists said economic data and investor positioning were more important factors for the performance of risk assets than hawkish central bank rhetoric. ‚ÄúThe data appear to be increasingly supportive of a soft landing (rather than global recession), given moderating inflation and wage pressures, rebounding growth indicators, and stabilizing consumer confidence,‚Äù said the bank‚Äôs global markets strategy team.\n\nThe U.S. consumer-price index is due to be released later Tuesday and economists expect it to show that annual inflation cooled to 8% in August, from 8.5% in July. That would be the second consecutive month of decelerating price growth, and the lowest rate since February. ‚ÄúOur expectation that the global economy will stay out of recession, increasing fiscal stimulus (e.g. China and energy support in Europe), and still very low investor positioning and sentiment should thus continue to provide tailwinds for risky assets, despite the more hawkish central bank rhetoric recently,‚Äù they added.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/stocks-economy-soft-landing-recession-jpmorgan-51663056229?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/stocks-economy-soft-landing-recession-jpmorgan-51663056229?mod=home-page)", "id": "xd1w4n", "created_utc": 1663057411.0, "score": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "I‚Äôve predicted ten of the last two recessions.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "And I've seen 17 of the 3 variations of this quote 248 times over the last 13 months.", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "This aged well.", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "The finest milk left out in a warm room", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Look I‚Äôm pretty optimistic for a soft landing and or stagflationary sideways period over recession myself, but for anyones that lived through and or studied recessions knows how hollow these sorts of analyst forecasts are. \n\nThey even say their thesis rests on a fabled fed pivot when without fail every single week every single fed board member has been telling the market a pivot is not going to happen. \n\nGetting real 2007 early 2008 era ‚Äúthe federal reserve is not currently forecasting a recession‚Äù and ‚Äúthe us economy has a strong labour force, excellent productivity and technology, and a deep liquid financial market that is in the process of repairing it‚Äù vibes from this forecast", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "I've gone back on archives and looked at CNN in 2007-2009 and a recession was 100% predicted.

Canada is printing as much CAD as the US is printing USD, but Canada doesn't have a reserve currency. Canadians are getting hit harder by inflation from imports, rely more on imports, and have a less diversified less dynamic economy in general. \n\nIs Trudeau working overtime behind the Tim Hortons dumpster or what? What's the secret?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "The real answer is that we actually have very very strong regulatory systems that mean it will take a lot to cause economic crisis on interest rate hikes alone, for now.\n\nThe underwriting is strong and we're actually a very fiscally conservative nation as it relates to home ownership, which has made the current housing thing a double edged sword. Plus we have a very strong home ownership culture so affordability, for now, is much moreso a political rather than economic problem.\n\nFor some context, More than half of all homeowners have no mortgage right now. Fully paid homes. In Canada we don't lock in rates for the life of the mortgage, instead we lock them in on multi year terms at a certain rate and over a 30 year amortization we get new rate terms. More than half of the remainder are on fixed terms that aren't going to be renewed for a few years yet and most people do 5 year terms. So the only people feeling the higher rates right now are people who probably have fixed mortgages from 2017 at 3ish % renewing at 6% and those on variable mortgages. \n\nMost people who bought in 2017 do not have monster mortgages from the nationwide runup in 2021/22, as the crazy prices were mostly in 2 large urban areas of Vancouver/Toronto and each city's surrounding region. \n\nMost variable rate mortgages have fixed payments. What changes as rates change is the principal/interest mix, not the monthly outlay. Of those on variable that have seen increases, if they started in 2017, would have had years of below starter rate interest payments in 2020/21/part of 22. That means they paid more principal making renewal sting less. \n\nNow the people who are hurting in the absolute short term just started really hurting this week. We raised the overnight rate to 3.25, another 75bp last week here. Variable rate fixed payment mortgages have what we call a trigger rate, probably similar in the US, where if the monthly payments no longer cover the interest on the loan the monthly payment is unilaterally increased to some predetermined level based on mortgage contract to ensure at least some principal is paid down. \n\nMind you, that only happened this last week and only hit the variable rates that were made at rock bottom rates mostly in 2020/21. \n\nAlso, I think back in 2017 or 2018 our banking regulator became worried about the possibility of rates increasing in the future, back to some level of historical norms. They made a rule where people could only qualify for a mortgage if they could handle 2% over their posted rate. And if that rate was below 5.25% they had toqualify at 5.25% mortgage rate. If using a big bank or other federally regulated bank. Not all lenders fall under this but most mortgages are under this rule. So for me, the offer was 2.79%, 2.79+2 is 4.79%, and since it's below 5.25%, they ran the underwriting.at the 5.25 for me and my wife. \n\nSo the theory is that most people are only now starting to hit possible worry zones for their *mortgages*\n\nWe also don't need to refinance to extend our amortization schedules on renewal. We can extend up to original amortization schedule max without having to run the numbers again... For now unless something changes. Canadian banks really hate foreclosures and it's extremely unlikely for it to happen because in all but one province can a person walk away from a mortgage. If someone sends their keys to the bank here, the bank won't take them and the person is still on the hook for payments up until the bank does foreclose and any difference remains a debt on the individual until they pay it off or declare bankruptcy. So people are highly motivated to do whatever it takes to keep their mortgage paid, or at least call the bank and work something out. Given someone can take their 20 years left and make it 30 again even if they have no job to spread the payments thinner to use their savings accounts or credit or whatever else until they get a job, houses don't foreclose on *owners who live in them* very often. \n\nThat doesn't mean it's for sure sunshine and rainbows though. The number of investment properties skyrocketed the last few years all over the country. Housing is down 10-20% in most places from peak. Level of household debt in this country is at record levels. People have borrowed against home equity run up into the peak of February to go buy second third fourth homes for investing. So there are probably some, but mind you very far from a large %, of homes that had a leveraged 20% down payment. Investment properties here have to have 20% down. There are many people who's parents borrowed to provide down payments and whose parents are co-signers on mortgages. These are likely mostly in the \"house paid off\" category but it's still a risk.\n\nHeck even that stress test that's good on paper, calculated 5.25 based on debts at approval. Getting a car loan after that, doing renovations, running up credit cards, inflation pressures, job changes - all that is blind.to.the stress test so even at effective 5.25 variable rates I'm sure many are feeling the pinch. \n\nRates are not going down any time soon.\n\nSo TLDR: housing here is stable and well regulated. It's why we didn't have a 2008 housing crash or significant recession like the US did. Much of it isnt exposed to the rising rates and credit tightening. But the last 2/3 years in particular about half those folks are super vulnerable to it and the bite for them is only starting now. The bite for the other half is 4 years away. Investors are most likely to be hurt and run. Home owners who occupy their places have more options to keep their homes especially if they've been there a long time.\n\nEdited to add: We haven't had big layoffs yet either, but I think we'll see cracks over the winter with big natural gas heating bills, higher rates and possible recession impacts. But we aren't even in a technical recession, Q1 and Q2 were positive GDP here.\n\nOh and we are a net exporter of energy and raw materials to you guys, so we have a trade surplus with the US. Which is helping a lot for oil and gas. We have a lot of natural gas. So broad economy is probably on a very fine line doing a very tough balancing act. Once panic hits our housing market though that's when the bubble gonna pop.\n\nEven then though, we have high immigration and tons of internal movement to Vancouver and Toronto and they have massive supply crunch for housing of all kinds. So they might have rents go up as prices for housing go down, but who the fuck knows how much of rentals are people priced out by rates or prices out by sheer nominal values and what the mix would be if prices plummeted and renters left to go buy.", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Your real estate market works differently though no?

Inflation had peaked per CPI as I expected coming in a 8.3% vs. 8.5% previous, however, market honed in on year over year and month over month core. Year over year core had not gone up since April this year. I took a calculated risk with the information I had and honestly with what I knew then I woulda made the same play. Win some you lose some‚Ä¶ this is why plays like that should be small in size. \n\nThe worst part is prior to the bullish pop last week in the market I was bearish going into the CPI meeting and was expecting a dump. Got shaken out and bull trapped with the lower then expected consensus and forecast‚Ä¶ the psyops continue. \n\nAnyways moving on!

This morning markets realized inflation did not peak (per core), the 75bps rate hike might not be enough to fight inflation so a 100bps hike could be needed, and they are also accepting more and more that a soft landing is not going to happen. \n\nMarkets are not in a rock and a hard place. They were previously rallying on news that few were going to pivot (July to august run) and then Jackson hole slapped markets to reality that was not going to happen. However, markets were feeling pretty bullish going into this CPI. Now that markets realize there is nothing to be bullish about this is where things get interesting. \n\nIs this the start of a capitulation like sell off we saw in June around that CPI (remember it dropped 10.3% in 3 days) or was this a massive market over-reaction to a potential 100bps rate hike that was not even mentioned to begin with? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xg2fd3fyton91.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff1a3b52ce9ad7e5c32a7d777b5deb92997d8066\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olcyivwyton91.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=d107a4730e71ec34fe9c097aabec05a8b4af2fef\n\nToday we broke down and opened below the 405.2 daily resistance level and didn‚Äôt quite make it to that 390 level.

This is where I suspect if the bulls are going to put up a fight that it happens. However, if we are to close a candle in the 380s tomorrow or later this week then it would appear we could be in a bigger sell off until FOMC. \n\nKey supports tomorrow- 391.1 -> 390.5 -> 388.5 -> 386.8 -> 382 -> 368.3\n\nKey resistance tomorrow- 395.3 -> 400.4 -> 402\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp1ysjgzton91.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f47e77e7e570fe7b04635df99b4084d825b8e14\n\nSPY weekly is starting to show more and more of this current black weekly downward channel.

In addition it closed back below the daily 200ema and closed lower then any of the candles last week during the sell off. \n\nBlack bear support line comes in at 139 and blue bear support comes in at 148 for the EOW potential targets. \n\nKey supports tomorrow- 151.5 -> 148.7 -> 149.4 -> 147\n\nKey resistance tomorrow- 157.4 -> 159.9\n\nUnlike SPY (thanks to apples huge 4% day yesterday) there is no gap left on the daily chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1y0t7km1uon91.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=61cb2a0add86a0d1831cc3cbc85a4e61cd0967d3\n\nIn terms of bearish and clean looking charts this apple weakly chart does look extremely clear in what trend we are clearly in with a break in the weekly support line. \n\nKey support- 150.2 -> 148.8\n\nKey resistance- 157.5 -> 161\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgw37j52uon91.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc2c9cdbbe1cb56c3092a22a940fcef3ce2d07ca\n\nThe VIX is where things are going to get a little interesting. You can see how many times we have found ourselves over this 26.9 level but unable to push any higher. There is an obvious reason to suspect we are still in a bullish channel up on the VIX, however, previous to today that channel was breaking down and we were trending clearly back under 25.5. \n\nWhile a 14.33% green move on the VIX is big when we look at other VIX days from this year we have plenty of 20%+ moves on the VIX. There was even part of the day today where the vix showed weakness and had even broke back below 25.5 before the EOD push up on the VIX and down on SPY.\n\nKey level to watch tomorrow for the VIX is 28.3 and 26.8. I am wondering with how disconnect the VIX has been from reality and the markets since really the June lows if we could see a major sell off on the markets without getting the vix back to 35-40. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsm9kmr2uon91.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ec8177b4bd3ed9c28b51d011ea2b9512800f799\n\nYes my call was worthless‚Ä¶ yes it sucked.
