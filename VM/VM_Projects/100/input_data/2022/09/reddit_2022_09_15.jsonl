{"title": "Balance Sheet is $9,000,000,000,000 and Fractional Reserve Banking Has Ended", "selftext": "Obviously there has been a lot of talk about the Federal Funds Rate decisions and Quantitative Tightening/Easing, but it's been troubling why more people aren't talking about the Fed balance sheet.  \n\nBack in 2008 when Bernake/Paulsen agreed on terms and congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act it was agreed that the Fed would buy $700b in mortgage back securities from the banks which led to the Act being nicknamed the \"bank bailout of 2008.\"  \n\nAlso at the time it was said (by everyone) that eventually those emergency policies would need to be rolled back. FOMC member Charles Evans said \"once the economy recovers and financial conditions stabilize, the Fed will reduce the size of the balance sheet.\"  \n\nSince then, not only was the balance sheet not reduced, the total has ballooned to $9 trillion (43% of GDP). And in 2016 Bernake himself wrote a paper completely changing the original opinion and saying that they would just grow the balance sheet infinitely:  \nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2016/09/02/should-the-fed-keep-its-balance-sheet-large/  \n\nObviously people can see the issue here, what was once considered a $700 billion bank bailout has quietly become a $9,000,000,000,000 balance sheet and the S&P 500 has been directly 1:1 correlated with the growth of this \"balance sheet\" amount:  \nhttps://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/posts/2021/07/Fed-Balance-Sheet-vs-SP500.php  \n\nAlso at the height of Covid in March 2020 the Fed decided to abandon factional reserve banking completely, setting the reserve requirements to 0:  \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm  \n\nSo now that we are seeing persistent and extreme inflation isn't this absolutely a case of taxation without representation?  The banks have given themselves $9,000,000,000,000 which required no congressional action and now people are paying for it in the form of higher prices on goods, services, housing, transportation, and energy etc.  \n\nWhy aren't more people talking about this, when TARP passed in 2008 it was headline news.\n  \n  \n-———————————————————————  \nEDIT: \nSeems like some people are noticing a conflation of TARP and the balance sheet so wanted to clarify.  Both TARP and Quantitative Easing were initiated at the same time at the end of 2008.  TARP was the fiscal policy (by congress/the Treasury) and Quantitative Easing was the monetary policy (by the Fed buying MBS).  \n\nWhile TARP ended, Quantitative Easing continued and has since ballooned on the Fed balance sheet to $9 trillion dollars. It was initially thought that normalization (balance sheet run off) would occur but that hasn't happened. And Bernake's paper linked above as well as a book he released in May of this year (21st Century Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve from the Great Inflation to COVID-19) suggests that the balance sheet will never be normalized.  Money on the Fed balance sheet went into bank reserves and when combined with lowering reserve requirements seems like a never ending infinite bank bailout.", "id": "xeiwl9", "created_utc": 1663204027.0, "score": 1939, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 360, "comments": [{"body": ">Since then, not only was the balance sheet not reduced, the TARP bailout has ballooned from $700 billion to $9 trillion (43% of GDP). \n\nNo, TARP is over.

Amtrak announced it’s canceled all long-distance travel starting Thursday,  which includes trips to Chicago and Miami.\n\nIt’s because some of the Amtrak traffic relies on tracks owned by Freight Railroads.\n\n\"I think that there’s an effort right now, on part of the workers, they see there’s a shortage of workers. we have had high inflation,\" said Janell Townsend, Oakland University. \"This is an opportunity for them to make a stand.\"\n\nOut of the 12 unions, nine have tentative deals with the US Freight Railroads. The three unions still at the bargaining table would like better pay, better work schedules, and more time off.\n\nIf a deal isn’t reached by Friday, some union workers said they’d go on strike.\n\nTownsend, the chair of OU’s managing and marketing department, spoke about what the fallout could be.\n\n\"If the railroad workers go on strike on Friday, it will be devastating to the economy,\" she said. \"Because there is so much of our freight that goes through the rail system; especially in the business-to-business background, that we don’t see.\"\n\nTo put the strike into perspective, look at how freight trains impact some our favorite foods. The Association of American Railroads says one rail car carries enough wheat for 280,000 loaves of bread, enough corn for 480,000 bags of Fritos.\n\nAnd the impact of a potential strike doesn’t end with this - it could impact the beer we drink, thousands of car parts, and many of the things we buy in stores.\n\nBut before any of us panic buys, listen to this:\n\nFOX 2: \"If I’m at home, and have my family with me, this isn’t a situation where I need to run to the grocery store or pick up something right away, right?\"\n\n\"No. I don’t anticipate it being an immediate situation,\" she said. \"It’s highly unlikely this will last very long. the reason being is that the federal government will step in and will require some terms to be met.\"\n\nProfessor Townsend says the president or Congress could use emergency powers to step in and resolve a potentially catastrophic blow to the US supply chain.\n\nSource: https//www.fox2detroit.com/news/expert-says-railroad-worker-strike-would-devastate-economy", "id": "xek4gw", "created_utc": 1663207488.0, "score": 84, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|104|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|31|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xek4gw)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xek4gw)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "We could build a massive hill and roll goods and services down the hill in carts across the us.
