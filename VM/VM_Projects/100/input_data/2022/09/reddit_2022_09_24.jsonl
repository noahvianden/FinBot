Trust your strategy until you can't) Your tools change as the market changes. Meaning, if one indicator or TA was working during a bull market it will no longer work as-is during a bear market. This lesson i'm glad I learned early on as I liquidated entirely in December 2021 when I realized the bear market was coming. This allowed me to preserve capital all year while I started from scratch to test what new tools could give me an edge. It took 6 months to find that set of tools that works for me and I have to remain ready to start from scratch again if these tools stop working once again. It's about having confidence in your strategy but not being married to it if you notice the signals are off.\n\n2) (Learned from Tasty Trades. Learn non directional strategies) Non directional plays will always be the highest probability strategies even if they aren't fun and sexy. Selling premiums and having theta work for you will keep you green at a much higher rate. \n\n3) (Retail traders are stupid) I've grown contrarian in my trading style as I realized how stupid retail traders are and have always been. Every crash has had the same \"buy every dip and hold\" people the \"it can't fail\" gamblers and they are always vocal, always convincing, and always the wrong people to listen to. What's made this worse is the internet. The other day I read a comment from a 60 year old redditer trapped in a GME yolo. Imagine being convinced to yolo your retirement by a 17 year old Taco Bell employee. Shut off the outside noise and understand that retail traders are stupid. When it comes to calling tops and bottoms and DD... they have no idea what they are doing. Only you are responsible for what you decide.\n\n4) (Timing is everything. Learned by experience.) Bear markets are hard to trade, period. What makes them especially hard is the timing. It's like Jazz music. It's so offbeat. You can slowly grind for days while theta/iv crush your short option positions, it will give you a beating on your short stock positions, and then plummet after you can't take anymore. In the same way the move down is violent having you chase only to stop for just enough time to again destroy your short dated short positions. Bear markets have a way of convincing you that you missed the bottom and then convincing you that the world is ending the same week. Being reactionary during this time is basically suicide. There is a reason Michael Burry didn't just buy 2 month out Spy puts for the Big Short. Because that is just giving money away. The big boys who are truly shorting the market are doing so in commodities that don't have greeks, they are doing it some form of time protection. In the same way during bear markets EVERYTHING seems to be on sale and the \"timing is everything\" stands here too. Just because NFLX was $390 last year doesn't mean it will be $390 ever again. Too many people are thinking \"this is too cheap not to buy\" and again not taking into account their overall account goals. If you are looking to hold NFLX for life and hand it to your grand kids sure by all means, but if you think you are going to double NFLX based on last years pricing your timing is off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways that's all I got.

I never buy any stock that’s close to ATH. \n\nAnd when I see a stock getting hammered in price, I become more interested (HOWEVER, I have to do some research to decided if it’s oversold or justified) A lot of people seem to think just because X stock is down in price you should just buy.

I was mentally prepared to keep buying and holding stocks during that time when many were selling and FUD was everywhere.\n\nNow fast-forward to 2022, I sometimes see people apply the phrase “be greedy when others are fearful” to this 2022 bear market as they continue to buy in.

The way out of this dilemma is clear to me as i \"merely\" need to establish clear rules and more knowledge and experience from watching the market, allowing myself to be more confident as well as objective, I'm slowly getting there but unfortunately as I am a very limited energy guy, its quite slowly. The issue is also that I can't mentally handle the stress and distraction of having many balls in the air at once, i can't have exams, build friendships, go to work and on top of that follow the stock market closely to not miss anything and to make a good swing trade. it's just too much for my fragile human brain. In 2020 i actually did trade a little bit and doubled the money i had risked, thereby avoiding needing to work to cover my living expenses that year but it took so much time that i couldn't work that year. this year i chose to work to get work experience so I'm more employable later on. I am currently refining my mathematical model and odds system purely theoretically and then i guess I'll test it with fake money for a while. Maybe next summer I will have time to progress. I won't have any vacation and many exams between now and summer. besides the market is very unpredictable right now and it's not the ideal conditions for a newb to try out strategies and to learn handling the stress of high leverage financial risk.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "OK Goldman Sachs.

Membership fee to remain flat.", "selftext": "A top Costco Wholesale executive confirmed the big-box retailer has **no plans to change the price of its $1.50 hot dog-and-soda combo at its stores despite months of decades-high inflation.**\n\n**Costco CFO Richard Galanti reiterated the cheap price point on the fan-favorite deal would stay in place during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday.**\n\nAn analyst asked whether Costco was adjusting prices in other parts of its business to maintain sales margins for its hot dog-and-soda deal and other value offerings.\n\n“Lightning just struck me,” Galanti joked when the combo was mentioned. He added that higher-margin businesses such as gas and travel sales help Costco maintain its value deals.\n\n“Those things help us be more aggressive in other areas, or as you mentioned, hold the price on the hot dog and the soda a little longer – forever,” Galanti added.\n\nCostco and other retailers have hiked prices over the last year, passing along the higher costs of commodities and goods to consumers. Inflation has slightly declined in recent months but was still hovering at a hotter-than-expected 8.3% in August.\n\n Galanti estimated that price inflation at Costco was about 8% during the fourth quarter, with increases “a little higher on the food and sundries side.”\n\n**Costco doesn’t have any immediate plans to hike its membership fees**, according to the executive. Annual membership dues at the retailer currently start at $60.\n\n Still, Galanti noted that **membership price increases were likely at some point in the future. Costco has generally hiked its fees roughly every five to six years**.\n\n**“Our view is, is we are confident in our ability to do so and at some point, we will. But it’s a question of when, not if,”** Galanti said.\n\nDespite the inflationary environment, Costco topped analysts’ expectations in the fourth quarter. The retailer posted quarterly revenue $72.09 billion and earnings per share.\n\nSource: [https://nypost.com/2022/09/23/costco-to-keep-1-50-hot-dog-and-soda-combo-forever-despite-inflation-exec/](https://nypost.com/2022/09/23/costco-to-keep-1-50-hot-dog-and-soda-combo-forever-despite-inflation-exec/)", "id": "xn1ibc", "created_utc": 1664047110.0, "score": 7156, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 631, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The poster I originally replied to claimed their material costs for the combo are ~$0.45. [Average QSR \\(quick service restaurant = fast food\\) net margins are, at their highest, ~15%](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/QSR/restaurant-brands/net-profit-margin). If we believe that Costco is currently making that on this product, then the rest of their expenses must be $0.83 for a net profit of $0.22 per unit. We'll just assume those other costs are all labor for simplicity here, though as you'll see below, it doesn't make too much of a difference. \n\nBut lets take this back in time to the mid-'80s when they launched the product. The price of the combo was the same: $1.50. However, their inputs were much less costly. [Adjusted for inflation](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/), the ~$0.45 in material cost was ~$0.16 in 1985. The labor link I provided previously shows that median income today is $37,522, and in 1985 was $11,008. Looking backward, that's a change of -71%, which tracks pretty closely with the -65% provided by the inflation calculator for our material costs. Apply that to the $0.83 in other costs we calculated above, and that gives us $0.24 in other costs for this product in 1985.   \nRevenue of $1.50 per unit minus $0.16 in material cost and $0.24 in other (labor) costs gives us a net profit of $1.10 per unit on $1.50 in sales. A whopping 73% net profit margin. Do you really think Costco magically discovered an untapped gold-mine hot dog industry in 1985 providing 73% net margins? Of course not. They launched the product because they could make reasonable money on it such as a 15% net margin. Their costs, both material and labor, have gone up over the decades, but their price has not, and they now keep it as a loss leader for branding/marketing purposes.\n\nWe can back into the same math from the other direction. 15% net margin on $1.50 sales with $0.16 in material cost gives us other costs of ~$1.11 in 1985. Inflate those other costs to 2022 dollars along with $0.16 going to $0.45, and they're spending something like $4.23 to make $1.50. That's in the realm of -182% net margin. If you use the more conservative inflation values provided by the general calculator, the non-material costs still climb to $3.20 per unit for a net margin of -143%.\n\nThere is no rational reason to believe they are making money on this product in 2022.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">There is no rational reason to believe they are making money on this product in 2022.\n\nLet me reassure you then.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I read that earlier this year and remember them still making $0.04 profit.

I can imagine a world where that might work, and with the Fed raising rates now's as good a time as any to be skeptical about the trajectory of things.  Not saying that's 100% either, but honestly, nothing is.\n\nWhen I started in Feb. 2021 I honestly felt like I was going through some psychological shit.  I was worried we might be in an unsustainable bubble and actually made a post about it.  I remember the top comment was \"it can't be a bubble if everybody is saying we're in a bubble\".  But that was the top voted comment, lol.  So what the fuck!?  Is everyone saying it's a bubble or are they not?\n\nI really had to grapple with that. I had to grapple with people saying monetary policy was fine and sustainable, and then people saying inflation was transitory, vs. people saying it was an absolute disaster and inflation was here to stay.  There's people who worship Michael Burry and there's people who say he \"predicted 20 of the last 3 bear markets\".  People were very adamant on both sides of the aisle.  But what do *I* think?  I can understand why people tend to follow dogma and what not: it's much easier than thinking for yourself.\n\nAt the end of the day I settled for a middle of the road approach.  For some people, it may appear to be too defensive, but that's also reflective of my needs and risk tolerance.  I decided I would not try to time the market, but at the same time I would get into defensive, dividend paying stocks.  That way, if it went up, I would still get some gains plus dividends.  And if it went down, I would theoretically go down less than the market and still collect nice dividends.  I don't like to see my portfolio in the red but right now I feel like I'm well positioned.\n\nAnyway, the reason I did that was because I basically figured \"all I know is that I know nothing\".  I think humility can only lead to one approach: being prudent.  I disagree with the people saying monetary policy is all fine and just buy VTI and the market's never gonna stay down.  We don't know that.  I was skeptical about the path we were on last year, it seemed unsustainable, and so far it seems like I may have been right.  But I also disagree with the people saying the world is going to come to an end.  We simply don't know, and prophecies of doom and hellfire always seem a little cheap to me.  Therefore I choose an approach which acknowledges my limitations and leaves me well-prepared for anything (in theory, at least).\n\nOf course, these are the conclusions I drew for myself.

There's two things 'investors' like we see on this sub don't understand: time value of money and market trends. If you trade against the trend, you'll lose money. In 10 years you might have a positive return, but in real terms it's a negative return. Let's say SPY is $450 in 10 years. Right now it's $360. That's a 25% ROI, pretty good right? You made a smart move buying the dip. Now let's adjust that ROI based on an inflation rate of, let's (generously) say the fed lowers it to 2% by end of next year, so 5% year 1 and 2% years 2-10. for an average of 2.3%. 1.023\\^10 = 1.255. Oh, look at that, your 25% ROI is actually -0.5%! In all likelihood we'll have inflation rates over 4% for the next two years, assuming the government doesn't do anything to make it last longer.  \n\nA corollary point to this is the benefits of a positive return. If you invest in something that appreciates, the proceeds can then be used to fund other things that may appreciate. There's a compounding effect to investments that don't lose you money. So you can stick with DCA and suffer the opportunity cost, the real negative returns, and the pain of working an extra few years or more at retirement, or wisen up your investment strategy. I guess the latter doesn't come with all the glory of acting like anything outside boglehead is trying to time the market though. Tough choice.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If you really feel you have the ability/edge to time bottoms and tops, then go for it.  The average person does not have that edge.  You can very easily miss the trend reversal.  Anyone who missed the rebound in 2020, even if they got the initial sell right, they had about 1-2 months to switch from short to long or the entire crash was negated by the recovery.\n\nIn my opinion, it's easier to time the tops than the bottoms.  The top you're selling near ATH's.  Valuations can reach levels that are unsustainable, like we had in 2021.  100 Price-Sales, perfect monetary conditions, and looming inflation.  A lot of people were calling the top.  Some were a bit early.  But it's better to sell early than late.\n\nOkay, so you nail that trade.  The harder part is getting in at the bottom.  Bottoms always feel terrible.  There is so much negativity.  Usually you're in the middle of the event that brought you to the bottom when the market recovers.  When the market bottomed in 2009, there was little reason behind it at the time.  Things were still hugely fked up.  \n\nSame in 2020.  Once again, maybe you are capable of timing these tops and bottoms.  If you are able to time tops and bottoms over the long run, you will be one of the most successful traders in the world.  Not saying you need to hit perfectly either.  Even if you're within 10% on either side.  If you timed 2008 top, 2009 bottom, 2020 top, 2020 bottom, 2021 top, your return would be:\n\nAssume we start with 100 SPY:\n\n**sell SPY \\~155 (2008) - $15500**\n\n**buy SPY \\~70 (2009)  - 221 SPY**\n\n**sell SPY \\~330 (2020) - $72930**\n\n**buy SPY \\~250 (2020) - 292 SPY**\n\n**sell SPY \\~460 (2021) - $134.32K**\n\n**SPY today (370) - 363 SPY**\n\nSo if you just timed those 6 top / bottoms, your return would be 3.63X the market (or 866% on your initial $15500 sale of 100 SPY).  Annualizes to about 62% average return without compounding.\n\nSome of the best investment managers are lucky to make 20% returns over long periods of time.  If you averaged a 50% return compounded over your investing career (call it 40 years), you'd end up with over 11 million times your money.\n\nSo I think it's quite clear that nobody is able to time tops and bottoms over the long run.  Nor are they able to capture the majority of trend reversals.  If they could, they'd be looking at unimaginable returns.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with you. I think the average person has neither the time or interest to try and determine where the market is at and is better off DCAing than nothing (because even that -0.5% return is better than the -25% holding cash.) However, we are on a market-centric forum here, so I assume some level of time/commitment is involved for most people. Nailing the perfect top and bottom is definitely a ridiculous proposition, but keeping your finger on the pulse of market sentiment isn't. Not to dive too deep into the minutia, but 2020 is an outlier event in terms of the V shaped recovery and the means by which that happened is largely responsible for how much pain we're in for with this current recession. I wasn't investing in 2008 so I can't argue with you there with certainty, but I suspect it wasn't a recovery out of nowhere. If I was in the markets at the time, after the smoke cleared from the bailouts I'd be feeling bullish again. The banks were, and not to understate the severity, the primary factor the 2008 recession. Once it was clear they'll be kept solvent then it becomes a road to recovery. The timeline I would suspect follows that trajectory -- but I'm just spitballing, feel free to let me know how it really was and prove me wrong haha. I've dug into each recession pretty deeply in order to prepare for this one, so these are my takeaways -- further, I'd liken this one more as a combination of the 2000 bubble + the 70s stagflation, with some major differences in both. The P/E values weren't anywhere near the 2000 bubble, but were still far overvalued, and I think our government has learned what NOT to do regarding inflation from the 70s so we won't have it stretch on for a decade this time around, but inflation dies slowly no matter what you do.  \n\nBack to the original point: for someone interested but not willing or able to devote a ton of time into research my suggestion is to simply watch the factors that are currently causing the recession (inflation and high levels of debt) and wait for them to show signs of recovery. I would argue interest rates don't need to lower before a recovery (or in other words, the recovery will happen before interest rates are lowered) since they're being raised to combat those two factors. Until those factors are tamed the market will continue to tumble. In the meantime, my suggestion is to replace buying your favorite index fund with an inverse of it. You don't need to cash out, just stop buying more of a depreciating asset.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Couple points here.  First, inflation is a comparative metric.  If we really get the recession everyone is bracing for, it will nosedive in a hurry.  Prices can't stay elevated if we get a major recession.  We've already seen commodities come way down.\n\nOil's at 77 today.  We were at 120 in June.  In a recession, that number comes down further.  Other commodities will follow suit.  You can't have a recession without the labor market cooling down either.  You can't have a recession when everyone's employed and wages are rising.\n\nSo there goes another part of inflation.  The tricky part is rentals.  Mainly because housing is so sensitive to interest rates.  No easy solution here.  Fed policy also discourages new builds at the moment.  That may change as building costs continue down to drop and counteract the rise in rates.\n\nAmerica's housing market is unique because so many homeowners have long term fixed rate mortgages.  In this environment, with interest rates way up, it just freezes the market entirely.  People are basically stuck in their current mortgages.  So nothing moves.\n\nCanada, on the other hand, has mostly 5 year mortgages.  You've already seen the housing market start to adjust to higher rates.  Prices have been coming down.

He added that higher-margin businesses such as gas and travel sales help Costco maintain its value deals.\n\n“Those things help us be more aggressive in other areas, or as you mentioned, hold the price on the hot dog and the soda a little longer – forever,” Galanti added.\n\nCostco and other retailers have hiked prices over the last year, passing along the higher costs of commodities and goods to consumers. Inflation has slightly declined in recent months but was still hovering at a hotter-than-expected 8.3% in August.\n\nSource: [https://nypost.com/2022/09/23/costco-to-keep-1-50-hot-dog-and-soda-combo-forever-despite-inflation-exec/](https://nypost.com/2022/09/23/costco-to-keep-1-50-hot-dog-and-soda-combo-forever-despite-inflation-exec/)", "id": "xn1dnv", "created_utc": 1664046791.0, "score": 625, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|16|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|9|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xn1dnv)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xn1dnv)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The last time they brought this up, a few years ago I think, didn't the CEO threaten to throw the guy out the window if he brought that shit up again?", "score": 128, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.today.com/today/amp/tdna192310\n\nCo founder threatened the ceo he’d Kill him if he raised the price", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "Price stability on the threat of death.

Might be for an hour, a day, or a week, but a bounce is coming. \n\n**Why would the market bounce?** \n\n* Markets don't move in a straight line, we have been going straight down since the Fed meeting \n* Shorts are going to cover (if they didn't already in the last hour on Friday)\n* People who bought puts in the last 3 days since Powells speech are going to close them for gains now that they got the down move and VIX is elevated \n* When people close out long puts, VIX comes down\n* 3 day rule applies: the third day after the Fed meeting is Monday 9-26\n* People say \"the market doesn't bottom on a Friday\" so expect another gap down at open or the June 17th lows to be tested early in the AM \n   * The dumb retail traders who are late will read the news over the weekend, and the fear sets in, so they sell on Monday (in theory)\n* In the last hour of the day expect a rally as shorts cover and figure that the down move is at least over for now \n   * \"They\" are going to want to sell their puts while VIX is still high - or close their equity shorts before the other guy does \n   * Once one short covers, another short is going to want to cover as well before their gains are wiped out\n   * We all know what a short squeeze is, right?\n* Markets hate uncertainty, but the big event (Fed speech) is over now\n   * Uncertainty has been reduced \n   * All the other central banks just finished a global coordinated rate hike - that is behind us now \n* No more Fed meetings until Nov 3rd. Pow has been hawkish 3 times in a row now, \"rumor\" is he has to be more dovish next time right? Aren't we feeling the pain now? \n   * Buy the rumor they say \n* Oil died so that feeds into the \"inflation is coming down narrative\" \n* The last CPI was a surprise because people were expecting a \"better\" number\n   * Now everyone is scared and is expecting a \"worse\" number so any data that comes in not as bad as expected, will send the markets higher \n* Rates on the 2yr and 10yr have been on a straight up rally, so it is more likely they \"revert\" than continue (at least in the short term) \n* At some point the cash sitting on the sidelines comes back into the market \n   * Remember everyone that sold the last few days? They didn't buy bonds (check the rates), they didn't buy gold, they didn't really buy \"safe\" stocks either - they went to cash and they bought puts. Cash gets spent and puts get closed\n\n**Look at this primitive cave painting I have prepared for you:**\n\n[I made lines on a chart that confirm my bias](https://preview.redd.it/g26q3sdx1vp91.png?width=1307&format=png&auto=webp&s=6452399bac3693d8d7b3ff1267c2eb518011936f)\n\n* Whenever RSI gets to these levels (orange circles), we get a major bounce\n* The next trading range:\n   * Spy 360 seems to be level we were fighting over in the past (red dashed line)\n   * SPY 340 was peak before COVID (blue dashed line)\n   * SPY 320 is the bottom of the level we were fighting over in the past (green dashed line) \n* The bear market range:\n   * Red line = top of the range, good place to be selling \n   * Green line = bottom of the range, good place to be buying (or at least not selling) \n\n**Could we go lower?**\n\n* The chart looks terrible, and all signs point to continued downside moves. \n* There is no \"macro\" reason why the selling would stop \n* The market hasn't completely priced in the current interest rate levels \n* The bond market doesn't seem to believe the Fed's projected terminal interest rate. Either the fed or the bond market will be wrong and change their opinion \n* Powell is in the bond market daily unwinding the balance sheet, that pushes up rates, and requires stock earnings to be further discounted \n* More companies could pre-announce downside revisions to earnings - FEDEX and Ford sent the market lower and more downside revisions are probably coming \n* Russia could use nukes \n* Natural disasters, food shortages and other macro issues continue to deteriorate and that will cause commodities to be in short supply, that means prices going up, which means inflation is going to go up \n* The dollar is strong and shows no signs of slowing down \n* Financial conditions are tightening and money supply is coming down - assets can't go up if money itself is going down \n\n**What should you do?**\n\n* Don't buy calls: If you buy calls, and VIX comes down, you are not going to see the gains you expect, even if the market moves up. \n   * You will win on delta, lose on vega, lose on theta \n* Do sell puts: If you sell puts you get to win on three greeks: \n   * you win on delta, win on vega, win on theta \n   * give yourself 2 weeks of time to realize this bounce because it might not start for a few days if it doesn't start on Monday \n* If you like shares, then consider the tripple leveraged ETFs for a short term trade \n   * If you are capable of thinking past this week, get long on growth equities, but only get companies you can see being around still in 2 years (SHOP, NFLX, META)\n\nDon't believe me?

Central Banks took the brunt with temporary bandaids (QE, ZIRP, loan programs like TLTRO), while the curmudgeons in power fought among themselves. There was nothing left but to immediately step in, pump money like the world was going to end, and deal with the consequences later. Now we are in the consequences phase, made worse with the war.\n\n\"Runaway\" is exponential process. This is no way near exponential. We are still in linear inflation growth territory. And this is still on a lagging indicator. The devastation brought in this quarter will take time to register. This will be a dark (and cold in EU) Christmas. After March of 2023, I see the first signs of soothing followed by maybe a Fall 2023 that shows promise of beginning the upward trajectory in markets.
