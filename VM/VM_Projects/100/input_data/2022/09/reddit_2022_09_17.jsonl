The remaining EE's from Microsoft were hired by Google for their AR headset.\n\nToday, MSFT is #1 in **already-deployed** AR (corp. customers) for their version of Metaverse.\n\nNext up, I feel Google will deploy once they have any hardware capable of merging reality with the virtual world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNomenclature:\n\nVR - Virtual reality (example Occulus), where you are essentially watching a celll phone in an enclosure. What's funny is YT videos of people doing stuff while watching VR. The person wearing this is not reality-aware.\n\nMR - Mixed reality. Watch some real life through the VR goggles by mixing the real world video through a video camera. Blend the 2 video streams for some interesting intersections between the real and virtual worlds, only when the software wants you to do so.\n\nAR - Augmented reality. The holy grail. The HoloLens is a prime example. This projects a hologram of the virtual world in your line of sight and does not overpower your senses. This is key, as the other two (VR & MR) disconnect you from the real world. Watch YT videos of HoloLens - both the people doing studies with it, the IVARS (military version) and other mining and commercial applications. The HoloLens has an output that others can use to \"see\" on a monitor, what the wearer of the device is seeing (the blended video).\n\nFor people to comment here about what the meta verse is about and what its capable of, you should actually try out the HoloLens and the oculus to imagine what the world can be. Once you try out the HL, there's no comparison whatsoever with any VR device. You can walk, talk and do whatever while wearing the headset whereas you're likely to trip over something with a VR headset. The military is building their meta verse with the mil-grade HoloLens (IVARS) where they can overlay objects in a soldier's line of sight around corners etc.\n\nThe tech is shrinking - HoloLens is still a pretty beefy device, but the end goal is to make it like regular glasses. The Google glass (new version) will get to this form factor sooner with projection of text as an overlay on what the human can \"see\" (lower technology compared to the HL, but getting there). \n\nIf you remember how Gmail started with text ads in the free email, Google might have a better story of growth from glasses to full blown AR.\n\nIn the long play, GOOGL and META will target consumers with their ads, and MSFT will rule the corporate/military world (once again). Given that most of the HoloLens engineers went to META, I see inter-operability between the two meta verses (maybe the military will actually DEMAND this).\n\nIn the meanwhile, Apple will do their own meta verse which allows entry only if have an apple device and barely any interoperability with the others as they will let you see only what they want you to see.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "There is also a partnership agreement between meta and msft teams if I recall as well.

The best advice that I can give you is to learn to trade options. There are ways to do this safely. (You can dramatically lower risk compared to investing in SPY, for instance.) I recommend studying the research and free education that TastyTrade puts out.\n\nThe stock market doesn't necessarily need to go up. It just needs to be stable. As options traders, we can make money as long as the stock market doesn't unpredictably open trapdoors beneath us. Why would this happen? Pull up SPY's chart going back as far as you can go. Notice how it has become extremely overvalued. There's no way that that can keep going without something bad happening, ultimately resulting in a reversion to the mean. What the Fed is doing, if it keeps going like this, is going to have a devastating effect on share prices, but unless it does it, we'll have an even bigger problem with inflation, which has to be subtracted from any capital gains to get the real rate of return. Basically, the Stock Market Game is completely out of whack because of out-of-control monetary policy (among other reasons), and, like Windows, there's only one way that this is going to end: a market crash.\n\nWhat should we do? Hoard cash. Inflation is the least of our worries in these market conditions. I'd rather lose 10% to inflation than 30% in the market. Acquire and hoard as much cash as you can from a job and every other source of income, and wait. My best guess is that we're going to see a slowly burning crash. People won't recognize that a crash is happening because, like the proverbial frog, they're going to be boiled alive one degree at a time. They won't know what's happening before it's too late.\n\nI think that it would be insane to go long on anything right now (except, possibly, certain inverse ETF's, but that has its risks, too). Hoard cash, and let's see where we are on 1 Oct 2023. By then, I expect that the market will have mowed down an enormous number of investors and traders. Once the fighting at Gettysburg ends, then, and only then, let's assess the carnage and figure out the best way forward.\n\nPersonally, I'm not doing anything with my long-term portfolio other than waiting for stability to even consider making any moves. With my trading account, I'm executing very, very short-term trades: scalping SPY or SPX at times, shorting way OTM puts when a prominent tech stock suffers a devastating crash, and occasionally running *Long Call* or *Long Put* spreads, along with some low-risk, low-reward \"artisanal\" options plays here and there to keep things interesting.\n\nBecause market conditions are unpredictable, *Strangles* run right toward the end of the trading day right before the CPI is released or before the FOMC announces its latest rate increase and The JPow speaks half an hour later, will reliably make money. If you don't know anything about options, it's important to take the time to learn, but this is usually a process that takes multiple years, not days or weeks. If you don't learn properly, you can annihilate your entire account. Until you understand how to interpret and take advantage of the Greeks, please don't even think about trading options.\n\nI've written extensively about what's happening, and what will continue to happen, as the result of what I call the **POW**cycles. You can find all of my posts by following the links at the top of the [most recent one](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/vo71hf/powcycle_trapdoors_into_the_abyss/). (Yes, they're very long, but if you want to know what's going on and why, I try hard to explain.)\n\nThe bottom line is this. Unless and until one of two things happens, we're screwed. The two things are:\n\n1. A staggering amount of money is deleted from the money supply; or\n2. The population grows substantially and corporate earnings growth with it so that the market grows into its (insanely high) valuation.\n\nI hate to say it, but the former is already happening, and it's going to get much worse. The latter would take a very long time.\n\nIf you're a pessimist, there are various dark scenarios to be entertained, such as the wealth gap creating social instability and allowing another country, such as China, to become the dominant world power. It doesn't seem likely for a variety of reasons, but the world is in the process of reconfiguring itself, and no one knows what the new political order will look like, or where capital is going to go. All sorts of barriers that used to be relaxed will go up again.\n\nI think that investing in foreign markets is a bad idea. I'm willing to sink or swim with the US, because I think that it's the best market in the world and will remain so. We're the only ones with a true culture of innovation and vast capital. If that doesn't save us, then it honestly doesn't matter where we put our money, because it's all going to become worthless if we can't pull the nose of the plane up from its nosedive, which is something that's happening to varying extends in every country.\n\nThe money-printing accelerated various internal problems, and the consequences of Russia's isolation by much of the rest of the world and its responses (principally, shutting off energy supplies to Europe) are going to cause huge global economic problems. Until the various puzzle pieces reconfigure themselves into a new political and economic order, we're going to struggle.\n\nPrepare for this to last a long time. No one—absolutely no one—knows how it will unfold. But my guess is that when it's eventually over, perhaps five or even ten years from now, the US market will take off like a *rocket* and blow every other country away. The problem is that it could go way, way down over a long, long period of time before that happens.\n\nMake your main goal to *protect your capital* because—believe me—you, like the rest of us, are going to *need* it!\n\nArtem", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "fear. uncertainty. disinformation.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Let me make the bull case.\n\nThe fed are pussies.

I recently consolidated 401ks and 403bs from various schools into a rollover IRA where I had invested about 60% of the funds into mutual funds following the seven-sector style Gerald Appel outlines in his book Opportunity Investing. A lot of libraries carry it. It's easy to find a pdf online. I have been slowly deploying the remaining 40% on down-market days.\n\nI am still contributing to the top three sectors Utilities, Energy, and Blue Chip Value. I believe our cycles are speeding up as our world gets more interconnected. So I think we are in a recession, but it will be much shorter than pundits predict. I am kicking myself because when everyone was talking about Powell's Jackson Hole speech, I told myself I should buy some inverse fund stock, but I didn't do it! Recently when we were up a bit, I think it was Wednesday. I considered it and didn't pull the trigger. I do believe one day we are up, and I think there is a clear event that will drop us. I may try that. \n\nBut for the most part, I don't think we will buy another rental for two years as we see what rates will do. I think the market and I Bonds are where my extra funds will go. I am toying with paying down my mortgages, but with 2.99 and 3.4 interest rates, I think I would rather invest the funds. We are in San Diego, Ca, so I feel are housing market will stay strong.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "not so much bullish as optimistic? I'm thinking about 5-6 yrs into the future.
