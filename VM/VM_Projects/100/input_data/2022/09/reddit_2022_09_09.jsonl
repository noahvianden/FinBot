I interviewed and it was basically asking what your income and total investments are since I'm a non-accredited investors and the SEC (stupidly) limits how much I can invest in illiquid investments. \n\nI read a bunch of articles for and against Masterworks, reviews, etc. Aside from their fees (which are pretty high at 10% upfront cost, 1.5% annually and 20% cut of profits from future sales), the information they provide is pretty foggy, I think intentionally.\n\n* They said the minimum investment was $15,000 but they were having a limited time offer of $5,000 even though even though they claim to have a wait list on their website and say in some places you can invest in art for as little as $20.\n* They show on their website that contemporary art has outperformed the S&P 500, real estate, and gold since 1995 and that it outperforms also during inflationary periods. In the fine print, they state the art data is actually only using pieces that have been sold at least twice at auction. Meanwhile, during my interview, the interviewer told me multiple times, after I said my investment style is high risk growth, that art never outperforms broad market indices and should never be compared to stocks. That is antithetical to what their own website says.\n* They show on their website that they have a net annualized return of 29.03%, pretty incredible, until you read the fine print where they state they have sold a grand total of just 6 paintings. They do show their \"Net Track Record (across all vehicles, realized and unrealized gains)\" which is 15.3% but again, in the fine print, they state the estimated fair market value of their unsold paintings is appraised by themselves. That seems like a conflict of interest if you're going to advertise those potential returns.\n* One critical review of Masterworks pointed out the below.\n\n>Inside their disclosure they share ‚ÄúMasterworks relies on a single investor, Scott Lynn, for substantially all of its capital and liquidity. If Scott Lynn were to cease funding Masterworks for any reason, Masterworks may not be able to identify additional sources of capital.‚Äù\r  \nI‚Äôm not sure what happens to the business and your existing investments if the Scott gets hit by a bus. Key man risk in any business is a major red flag for institutional investors and they usually won‚Äôt go anywhere near it. This is not a common risk that a typical investor faces and the ramifications of its realization are hard to value. \n\n* They don't clearly explain that the Masterworks art is stored with the CEOs own personal collection, which The Observer pointed out in an article on the company. That was also quite concerning to me as a potential investor. Beyond that, there are no rules in place that say the CEO or any other insiders can't sell their own artwork to Masterworks at an unfair premium which is then pushed to Masterworks clients.\n\nI emailed my interviewer a week later and asked non-judgemental follow-up questions about the information I had come across, hoping to have some of my concerns alleviated. They didn't respond so a week later, I sent another asking for a follow-up on my questions. Again, never responded. I stopped trying at that point.\n\nI still had a tickle to try art investing so I threw the $250 minimum at a Banksy painting on StartEngine lol. It's still in its investment period so I've recognized no appreciation or returns and I'll be happy if I get my $250 in a few years.

The Fed is already signaling that it is going to aggressively raise interest rates.  While this seems somewhat counter intuitive because higher interest rates will slow the economy and may send the economy into recession, this also means that the Fed is not going to ignore or prolong the inflationary period by half-ass interest rate increases.  \n3.

Low rates make riskier investing more palatable by lending agencies, and when rates increase it is more difficult to justify risky investments. That's actually all there is to it, really.\n\nIn 2000, raising rates led to a rapid shaking out of vaporous businesses with no business being valued at all, let alone at their valuations.  If you had .com after your business, you were valued as actual gold, regardless of the fact that you had zero sales or plans to become profitable. So of course when the free money train ended, they were going to implode.\n\nIn 2008, the mortgage market was rife with fraud through and through, and the *entire* economy was over-leveraged into absolutely horrendous lending patterns that could only exist at the low interest rates of the early 2000s. The rising interest rates, again, is what catalysed the implosion (a lot of idiots who got NINJA loans thought they would be able to refinance down the road at a better rate or sell before the rates hit), but it was not the cause.\n\nIt's important to understand the difference between something being the *catalyst* versus something being the *cause*.  Raising rates, by itself, will not cause a market implosion like we saw in 2000 or 2008. It will certainly lead to economic downturns, but economic downturns don't necessarily mean crashes.

One person has $28k sitting in a checking account with no investments. I told them to withdraw $1k every month and pour it into VOO or SPY until they are down to $5k in checking. We can all disagree on if it would be better for them to just stick $23k of checking into VOO or SPY right now... \n\nMy other friend is already heavily invested. He is like most people down about 18% YTD and tells me my advice of the past years \"dollar cost averaging\" is not cutting it for him. I feel bad he is down 18% YTD, but so is almost everyone else. \n\nTell me why, if it is, that DCA is wrong. I think it is the best way to invest, and call me evil in bad times like this year, but it just is the best possible route. Both of my friends made me feel small today because they are certain we are going to have a 20% dip thanks to some of the talking heads out there saying things like the soon to come rate hike will lower stocks. \n\nTell me - is this time around different? Should we have all sold in winter when we began to see slippage in the S&P 500? \n\nMy current portfolio: \n\n68% VOO ($21,000) \n\n8% TSLA ($2,470) \n\n7% TQQQ ($2,100) \n\nThe remaining 17% is in cash ($5,250) right now. Should I myself sell everything and wait for a dip? If I do this I will lose out on my dividends payments to come in many weeks for VOO... My one friend said it would be wise to not VOO long term but instead buy the last day I can every few months to get the dividend?

As a result, some offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily File and may result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale to total volume.\n\nA common example is where a firm is facilitating a customer order to sell long. The firm may elect to first sell an equivalent number of shares from its own trading account to another firm and then purchase the shares from the customer at the same price to fill the outstanding long sale order. Trading in this manner reduces risk for the firm by enabling it to manage its inventory and lock in a price for the customer execution. Although this trading model involves two separate trades‚Äîone between the two firms and one between the firm and its customer‚Äîthe two offsetting trades are executed at the same price to fill a single customer order. Thus, FINRA rules provide for the public dissemination of only one of the trades (the trade between the two firms) so as not to overstate the reported volume.5 If the firm facilitating the customer long sale order has either no position or a short position in the security in its trading account, the trade with the other firm is reported as short and included in the short sale volume calculations in the Daily File. The volume associated with the firm‚Äôs purchase from its customer, however, is not reflected in the Daily File. Thus, the firm‚Äôs short sale is included in the short sale volume calculations without any indication that it is associated with an offsetting purchase to facilitate a customer long sale.\"", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Lol.  hey you might want to read my post first because I already linked to that exact page, as well as talked extensively about it.

Console makers own their digital marketplace and in the future can shut off access to the consoles entirely. No more rentals, no more used games, etc. If they decided to do that, GME can pound sand - nothing they can do about it. PC game sales are through Steam, Epic Games, and GOG. No console maker, digital distributor, or video game developer has any incentive to change these trends and no incentive to include a middleman failing brick and mortar retailer into their sphere to give them a cut of their action. They are all heavily incentivized to lean into digital and cut off the rental and used game stuff that eats their profits. Clear as day. That's which way the winds have blown and where they will continue to blow and why they blow. That's why, imo, the only way GME survives as a company long-term is if they can basically reinvent themselves to the point where they don't have to sell video games anymore. But then what is really the point? Why not just invest in any random ass company trying to do something different? Selling video games was the core competency of GME and we're basically saying that's now worthless. So what is the point of investment in this idea anymore? And, what's the best response GME shills can give? NFTs? That's the solution to basically having an existential crisis of having your business scooped out from under you and having zero leverage to change the macro conditions?

I tried to convince myself that one day you'd stop making stupid decisions and fucking up, and that you'd eventually start to win, but the day never came. \n\nFor the past two years, I have been cheating on you with other men. Men with fast cars and yachts and private jets. Fine liquor. Pure cocaine. And the kind of big dick energy that comes with consistently being on the right side of trades that ruin the lives of countless WSB plebs.\n\nYou say we need some time apart but the truth is that we can never reconcile because you're just not enough for me. I wish you all the best and hope that you will find a woman with lower standards who might accept and love you for who you are. In fact, I have a such a friend named Wendy who is in the restaurant business. You should look her up.\n\nSincerely,\n\nStock Market", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "9:30 sharp", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Dear Stock Market, you single? asking for a friend", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Beautiful, can‚Äôt live with her, can‚Äôt kill her ü´°", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Monday is just another day away!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yeah nice dramatic shit but see you monday", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
