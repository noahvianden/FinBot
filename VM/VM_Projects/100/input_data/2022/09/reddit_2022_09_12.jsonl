You didn't say anything about the times you rolled and then lost money vs. just holding.

Studies have shown that when SPY has an annual gain that is above the 7%-10% average, the vast majority of the gain happens in just a few days, or even just one day, so if you miss that day by waiting to long or rolling too soon, you miss out on most of the gains for a whole year.\n\nTwo things to watch out for:\n\n* You may be increasing risk without a commensurate increase in reward. This would be indicated by a decline in your Sharpe Ratio.\n\n* You are realizing what could have been long term cap gains as short term, which introduces tax drag.\n\nRather than buy 2 years out and then roll up and down at random intervals, instead try buying 60 days calls and rolling at 30 day intervals. This allows you to use monthly expirations with better liquidity and prevents you from chasing gains, while still allowing you to adjust to market conditions more often than just holding for 2 years without rolling.

That's *why* they cost less, because they are long shots that rarely pay off.\n\nSo the reason you pay $30 instead of $5 is because you are more likely to make a profit.

In general the expected return on an option is equal to it's price. However a good deal of that value of the expected return lies in the tails. This means you have to be able to survive a while in order to see your account balances stabilize to zero even if you're just randomly buying options and holding until expiration.\n\nGo ahead and write a simulation for what happens to under-priced options (and anyone who can't should probably study a bit more), most of that mispricing is going to happen at the lower probability events, and take a fairly long time (and a bit of luck) to be realized.\n\nEven if you have particularly good strategies and *are* able to predict major market movements fairly well, you'll still have to make sure that variance doesn't wipe your account before this advantage is realized.\n\nAdditionally options trading doesn't have to focus on speculation. I buy puts on stocks correlated with my company to protect my RSU grant (since you are typically not allowed to buy options for the company you work at) in the case of industry plunges. I \"lost\" 700 this week in options but gained 2000 in RSUs. If CPI news tomorrow sends my sector plummeting I'll lose a bunch of RSU but those options should help dampen the loss.\n\nSo I think that *studying trading* is absolutely not a waste of time, but ironically should lead many potential traders to similar conclusion that you are making.\n\nAnyone who only has $500 to work with and can't rely on consistent refreshes is asking for an account to blow up simply due to variance.

The TLDR is that I wait for, very most often, very specific points to buy at and then take gains very quickly. Most often trend lines on the 5 min chart for scalps, enhanced by patterns, dojis, and some technicals/studies which is mostly MACD and stochastic slow, with some RSI/reverse RSI. \n\nI also only trade options with thin margins. XOM is a favorite, as it’s spread is usually just like .78-.81 for options. I’ll trade Netflix but it can make me a bit nervous as the spread can be wider at like 3.10-3.25. That’s harder to land a good fill and sell point, especially with how I’m trying to get in and out super fast usually. \n\nSince I buy at very specific points, if I’m down 5% on a scalp, I know that most likely I’ve lost this one/I was wrong and so I bail. But that doesn’t happen often. For any being longer, like holding for weeks or months, my rule is a bit looser. This has been working for me very well. May or may not help/work for you but would be happy if it did!\n\nCopy pasta:\n\nI’ve been scalping almost exclusively the past few months cuz I haven’t really trusted spy, so I haven’t done any 2-3 week stuff which I’ll do as well normally.\n\nThe basic just of my strategy is just “take gains”. Im not trying to get to 100%. Been there, lost in the past cuz of that. Was up 30-70%, held and end up selling for loss.\n\nBut the rules are about the same, maybe a little more lose for longer out plays.\n\nIndicators I use are SMAs (50,100,150,200), RSI and reverse RSI, VWAPs, MACD, stochastic slow.\n\nThen there’s dojis, trend lines and patterns.\n\nMy main focuses are MACD, patterns, trend lines and I love the stochastic slow in combination with MACD and RSI and sometimes patterns.\n\nI rarely take “arbitrary” positions, like just because something is flagging doesn’t mean I’m going to buy it relatively wherever. I’m going to buy it when it touches my trend because from that, it’s clear that if it breaks up or down in a bad direction, I’m out, usually with just a 5% loss.\n\nIf something is making a pennant, I’m not going to just buy anywhere, I’m only going to buy when it touches the trend.\n\nAnd I definitely miss plays ALOT because it just doesn’t quite hit my fill. A good example from today I that AAPL raising wedge on the 5 min chart. I missed buying puts on the last green candle when it touched my trend line. I Was hoping it would touch again but it never did and even though it was breaking down, I never got into it because I only want to buy at a spot where if it’s going against me, it’s very clear and I can sell by 2-7% loss. At the same time, maximizing room for profit.\n\nI also almost always take gains by 10%, even 3%. I use webull so there’s no fees. I also just do this cuz I often aren’t buying enough contracts to make scaling real worth it. If I’m making money and winning as well as I have, I’ll start to scale out to get more gains, but overal I’m not trying to get to 100%, I’m happy with 5-10% gain.\n\nIn what world is a 5-10% return on investment within 15 minutes a bad thing?

Do you agree that it is illegal?", "selftext": "Google pays billions of dollars to other companies -- Apple, Samsung Electronics, etc. -- to keep its search as the default option on phones and in browsers, something the Department of Justice (DOJ) believes creates an illegal dominance over the search market.\n\nDeals like this ensure companies like Apple stay out of the search business. The practice has gone on for years. Google, at one point, paid Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion annually to appear as the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices, according to a law suit filed in 2020.\n\nDOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer didn’t disclose the amount Google spends to remain the default search engine on browsers and U.S. mobile phones, but described it as “enormous numbers,” reports Bloomberg.\n\n“Google invests billions securing defaults, knowing people won’t change them,” Dintzer told Judge Amit Mehta during a hearing in Washington, admitting that Google buys “default exclusivity because defaults matter a lot.”\n\nIn 2019, Google began giving Android users in Europe a choice to select a provider to power a search box on their device's home screen, and as the default in Chrome when installed. The changes complied with a competitive European Union ruling. The EU fined Google, saying it had an unfair advantage by pre-installing its Chrome browser and Google search app on Android smartphones and notebooks.\n\nThe change gave users with a phone running the Android operating system and Chrome browser an option to customize and personalize their device, choose and change their search engine based on their preference. It included selecting the apps to download.\n\nGoogle, for example, added private, decentralized search engine Presearch as a default option on all new and factory-reset Android devices in the U.K. and Europe.\n\nSince Google added Presearch 2021, its daily searches have grown from about 200,000 a day to more than 4 million, said Alex Carrabre, head of growth at Presearch. “At the peak it was 6 million per day in the past 20 months,” he said. “It’s just in the Europe economic area.”\n\nCarrabre estimates Android has about 70% of smartphone market share in Europe, which means there’s strong potential for the fledgling search engine to grow its user base.\n\nGoogle’s private contracts with companies like Apple, and Samsung form the basis of the DOJ’s antitrust lawsuit, which alleges the company has sought to maintain its online search monopoly in violation of antitrust laws.\n\nThe trial isn’t expected to start until next year. Thursday’s hearing was a daylong tutorial where each side laid out its views on Google’s business.\n\n[https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/377584/google-exclusivity-and-dojs-battle-over-search.html](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/377584/google-exclusivity-and-dojs-battle-over-search.html)\n\nThe DOJ says Google (Alphabet, Inc: GOOGL) creates an illegal dominance over the search market by paying billions of dollars to other companies to keep its search as the default option.

{"title": "Biden to hit China with broader curbs on U.S. chip and tool exports", "selftext": "The Biden administration plans next month to broaden curbs on U.S shipments to China of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence and chipmaking tools, several people familiar with the matter said. The Commerce Department intends to publish new regulations based on restrictions communicated in letters earlier this year to three U.S. companies — KLA, Lam Research and Applied Materials, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The plan for new rules has not been previously reported. The letters, which the companies publicly acknowledged, forbade them from exporting chipmaking equipment to Chinese factories that produce advanced semiconductors with sub-14 nanometer processes unless the sellers obtain Commerce Department licenses. The rules would also codify restrictions in Commerce Department letters sent to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices last month instructing them to halt shipments of several artificial intelligence computing chips to China unless they obtain licenses.\n\nSo-called “is informed” letters allow the Commerce Department to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to put controls in place quickly, but the letters only apply to the companies that receive them. Turning the letters into rules would broaden their reach and could subject other U.S. companies producing similar technology to the restrictions. The regulations could potentially apply to companies trying to challenge Nvidia and AMD’s dominance in artificial intelligence chips. Intel and startups like Cerebras Systems are targeting the same advanced computing markets. Intel said it is closely monitoring the situation, while Cerebras declined to comment.\n\nOne source said the rules could also impose license requirements on shipments to China of products that contain the targeted chips. Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer make data center servers that contain Nvidia’s A100 chip. Dell and HPE said they were monitoring the situation, while Super Micro Computer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/biden-to-hit-china-with-broader-curbs-on-us-chip-and-tool-exports-reuters.html", "id": "xc17d8", "created_utc": 1662950594.0, "score": 922, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 207, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why couldn't they refinance their loans? In the 2003-2007 housing bubble, demand for single family homes skyrocketed, in part due to relaxed lending standards to encourage renters to become first-time homebuyers^(1). Given permission to relax their underwriting, banks and mortgage companies were ever so happy to do so. Short term adjustable rate mortgages and balloon mortgages were common. [Federally backed mortgages fell sharply as a proportion of total home loans](https://americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RootsOfRecession-fig2-693.png)^(2)...a concerning trend because federally issued mortgages have statutory creditworthiness requirements and a mandatory mortgage insurance premium.\n\nThe banks knew they were loaning money to people who lacked the creditworthiness and income to pay back the loan. To hedge their risk, loans were securitized: thousands of individual loans were sold to commercial banks who pooled the risk into tranches. This is similar to how life insurance and health insurance works -- one person might be a risk of catastrophic loss, but the loss is covered by the other 999 homeowners who were expected to pay on time.\n\nHome prices were rocketing due to demand, and even if buyers weren't flipping their own homes and moving often (they were), the price increases meant that buyers were gaining equity in their own home much faster than they were paying principal down. As a result, it became common to take out junior mortgages (second mortgages or Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC)) to pay for vacations, ATVs, motorcycles, or luxury goods^(3).\n\nBy late 2007, the writing was on the wall. Millions of short-term adjustable-APR loans were due for a rate reset^(4).

The subprime market collapsed, billions of dollars were lost by traditionally staid bondholders such as Harvard's endowment fund and the State of California Pension & Retirement System, faith in the banking system was shaken....all at a time when the post-2002 bull market was getting long in the tooth and the business cycle was due for a contraction and a pullback.\n\nCombine waves of foreclosures with job losses due to a slowing economy, and you have a perfect storm that nearly spread to a global financial contagion.\n\nAnd we learned nothing from it.

Some people are even already doing that at 3.3-3.5%, albeit with smaller amounts.\n\nThat will cause demand to drop out (less spending, more saving, more shifting away from equity into fixed income, govt or opportunistic high yield corp bond, higher cost of capital so more unprofitable companies will shed jobs or go busto) and that's where we get the full on.

{"title": "AST Spacemobile ($ASTS) - A long-term, asymetrical bet", "selftext": "**TL/DR** *I like the stock !* 🚀\n \nAllright listen up retards, and listen well. I'm an OG and I have some hard to swallow truth for you. This sub has been overtaken by nefarious actors, bots and actual retards since the GME drama. Squeeze this. Squeeze that. Squeeze my fucking dick and fuck betting on lame has-been retail companies and fucking silver. \n \nIt's time we reclaim this sub and start posting proper autistic bets and DD again.\n \nNow, for those of you cowboys with at least a braincell remaining, boys do I got a bet for you. Something asymetrical and long term. *ewww, long term*, I hear you say? Well, perhaps I can change your mind about that!\n \nAs many here may already know, AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS) is a pre-revenue company aiming to deliver world-wide satellite-based direct-to-cellphone broadband. That means 2G/3G/4G/5G all over the world, from space, on the device in your hands right now. No more dead spots.\n \nI could talk for hours of the benefits and desirability of this service, the adressable market of billions, their partnerships and MOUs for distribution through cell-phone service providers, their 2400 patents, their amazing CEO and how he personally funded ASTS' beginnings, the marvels of technology they have built, how stupidly faster than GSAT IRDM AAPL and starlink it will be, how they launched yesterday their first satellite and are about to demonstrate their tech in the coming weeks, etc., but I'm going to take you by the sentiments. *Let's talk money*.\n \nASTS plans to deploy 168 sats. Sats will cost somewhere around 16M and launches 5M. Each sat will be able to give 1.8M GB per month. \n \n*Yes, but how much is a GB of space internet worth?* I hear you ask?\n \nWell I kid you not, Globalstar and Iridium are managing to sell their GB for more than *2000$* a pop. That's fucking right. And they're slow af, not even comparable.\n \nNow, for the sake of pessimism (🌈🐻), let's imagine ASTS and their partners decide to sell at a much lower price and ASTS gets half. Say 20$ per GB, so ASTS gets 10$. And again for the sake of pessimism (🌈🐻), let's say they sell only 10% of their capacity.\n \nOnce the full constellation is up (likely before 2030) that means a yearly revenue of 10$x168satsx1.8M GBx12 monthsx10% = **3.63B$**\n\nYeah, *that's fucking right* **.** My 🌈🐻 case is 3.63B$ per year for a constellation that will cost about the same only once to build. They may *very well* be able to sell *a lot more* at a *much higher* price. I'll let you do the math and come up with stupidly high valuations by yourselves.\n \nIf we give that a 10 years valuation that's 36B$. Currently stock is trading at 10.76$ with a 1.97B$ market cap. \n \nThat means a 2030 share price of **196.7$** or 18.3 times today's price share.\n \nSo here's the bet. **>**18.3x in 8 years if ASTS succeeds, or zero if they fail.\n \nPosition: Long shares, warrants, 2024 leaps, and other calls.\n \nDisclosure: Forward looking statements, Not financial advice, Do your own DD, don't trust strangers on the internet, Gambling is risky, yaddi yaddi yadda.\n \nNote: For those curious to learn more check out r/ASTSpacemobile", "id": "xc08j1", "created_utc": 1662947797.0, "score": 197, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|52|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xc08j1/ast_spacemobile_asts_a_longterm_asymetrical_bet/) \n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xc08j1)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xc08j1)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">\\>18.3x in 8 years if ASTS succeeds, or zero if they fail.\n\ni'm still mulling over activition arbitrage and that as a shorter time horizon.

Comparing to Geostationary communications is idiotic. Those are very limited services that people have high demand for and will pay excessive fees for. Extrapolating that to a constellation of LEO satellites sold to the masses is like extrapolating Bugatti car prices to Camry buyers.\n2. Your math is wrong. Using your own numbers it is not $3.63B but $1.8B\n3. The GB a month availability per satellite is based on what? I saw estimates of 40 gbps, which would come to 540,000 GB a month, far less than 1.8 million GB's a month. Plugging 540,000 GB a month into your calculation gets you $540M a year in revenue.\n4. Assuming 10% of capacity is sold is a pipe-dream. Most of the world is covered in water so about 70% of capacity is going to be unused because of that. Then there are vast sparsely inhabited places on earth (e.g. the Sahara) that would not have enough users to saturate the service (i.e. because if it was used to capacity there, it would be overextended in more dense places). No idea what % of capacity would get used but 10% is probably the most bullish scenario you can come up with.\n5. At $10 a GB, people will limit use of the satellites for talk and sms and not use it for data. It would just be too expensive. Not working through the calculations but would assume actual capacity used ends up being under 5%... so even assuming $10 per GB that is now $250 million in revenue a year. Realize this service is being envisioned as an add-on to a land-based service. Very few people are going to be willing to pay excessive amounts on top of their expensive cell service for this.\n6. Beyond anything above, the simple physics of it says that providing broadband via your 5G smartphone is not a very economical business as the number of satellites needed to be launched would be in the tens of thousands, not 168. What does work is basic phone service (talk, SMS, and some data). There are I think over 8 billion cell phone subscribers in the world if each can pay $1 a year that is $8 billion in potential revenue to ensure basic coverage worldwide. Providing such service will be competitive between any player putting up satellites for this and the actual revenue will be determined based on how reliable your network is and what is the lowest cost you can charge for it. So rather than even that $8 billion dollar number perhaps this whole industry will be worth at most a few billion in revenue a year.\n7. SpaceX will be putting up satellites that are already being used for internet service and adding on the phone services is a low cost addition. So consider that your competition. There are also other companies vying for this space.\n8. I have to wonder about the speed assumptions made about ASTS... my mind tells me a lower bandwidth satellite that covers a smaller area (e.g. the SpaceX ones) will likely be better suited for being able to saturate that bandwidth over a bunch of connections as opposed to a single higher bandwidth one listening in to more connections. I am not an expert in the technical aspects here, but I suspect my thinking is right here. If correct, the bandwidth projections for ASTS are based on a few connections and not numerous connections, which is kind of a huge deal as it might very well mean their are underestimating by far the number of satellites needed.\n\nBasically the revenue assumptions here are wildly optimistic. This is literally a bottom of the barrel value added service that pricing will be determined based on who can provide it the cheapest and most reliably. I am guessing that the reason T-Mobile said they should be able to provide this for no additional cost (or maybe some minimal amount) is because SpaceX realized that this is not a service you can charge much for. As to why SpaceX would go into this business then; well for one, since they are already sending up satellites this is a small additional cost and two, this may be related to providing connected service to all their cars which is important for self-driving. Cars should have larger antennas built in that would enable faster communication and enable remote connectivity anywhere.\n\nBottom line, investing in this service at current valuations is simply idiotic and you will lose your money long-term when the economics here are clearly shown to not work out.
