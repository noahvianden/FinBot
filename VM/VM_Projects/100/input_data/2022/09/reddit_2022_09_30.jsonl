Look at shipping rates that were causing literally everything to cost more, they are now back to pre pandemic levels. Rent and shelter fell for the first time in 2x years this past month. And retial inventory is on super sale (see Nikes and target earnings on liquidating inventory) as you will see if you go on almost any retial site right now (Amazon is having another prime day). \nSo there is more but I’ll let you check it. Bottom line is that the CPI lags a few months. When wheat dropped hard, those costs won’t be reflected in food for 3-4 months becuase of the production lead time to get it on the shelves and getting rid of the current inventory at higher prices.

He is raising rates too quickly and saying shit like “sustained inflation will be more detrimental to the lower and middle class if we don’t stop it in its tracks” - we’ll ask the middle class/lower class if they would rather pay $100 more a month for goods/services or if they would rather lose 50% of their 401k when they panic and liquidate it when Powell goes too far.

So around 4.5 years ago.\n\nSmall/mid caps tend to bottom a lot earlier than the rest of the market, and they have been pricing in a recession for quite some time. That's why I've been quite bullish on adding to my small cap (value) indices.\n\nI think earnings per share will be a lot higher in the future than in June 2018.\n\n> In 2022 small caps suffered their worst first-half drawdown since the inception of the Russell 2000® Index in 1978, falling 23.4%\n\nand\n\n> As the data in the chart below show, small caps (as represented by the Russell 2000® Index) led both large caps (S&P 500®) and mid caps (Russell Mid Cap®) following the last six recessions, returning over 31% on average the following year. At the same time, small-cap returns during those recessions averaged a relatively resilient return of roughly -4%.\n\n[Source](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/considering-small-caps-in-an-economic-slowdown/)\n\nNow the reason I don't buy the standard small cap stocks is that in this asset class, small cap growth tends to do very poorly. Moreover, targeting quality stocks is more important, because a lot of 'junk' out there holds down average returns. SCHD is a large cap value fund, but it applies profitability/dividend history filters to ensure you are getting the highest quality stocks. AVUV/AVDV from Avantis do something similar.\n\nThey look at profitability (measured by profits/book equity) as well as valuation (price/book equity). They also account for bias from 'goodwill,' which pushes up book equity after mergers/acquisitions. This way, you target companies that organically grow. They also target companies with low investment rates, because it turns out that small cap growth companies \"tend to raise capital when their discount rates are low (meaning\ntheir prices are high relative to fundamentals) causing subsequent\nunderperformance.\" And they tend to give weight to momentum, because you shouldn't just throw out a company from an index because it is doing *too* well.  Thus, you get a diversified (>600 companies in AVUV) exposure to some of the cheapest, small cap companies out there, that are highly profitable, organically growing, invest conservatively, and (may) have positive momentum. In contrast, the S&P 500 is highly dominated by a few enormously sized companies that engage in large amounts of acquisitions. Not that that's a bad thing.\n\n[You can read about their approach to investing here](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/dam/ac/pdfs/ipro/viewpoint/iuo/scientific-approach-to-investing.pdf).", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "and this is why I, as a long term investor, still read this sub and the daily thread. thank you for bringing the quality posts in a sea of noise.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm beginning to think we need to just ignore every stock price movement from March 2020-January 2022.

I prolly bore people here talking about Gold; but after both 2001 and 2009; Gold and the Russell 2000 both rallied first.  So this is what I am personally looking at.

That's why I like AVUV, for instance. It's diversified yet not bogged down with garbage like S&P small cap funds. And you're picking down companies that are objectively undervalued and profitable--no TSLA or Zoom. A fully passive approach would fail for small cap stocks, and that's why a little bit of screening helps out. This screening is even more important in the international AVDV fund, which has heavy weight in the UK and Japan, for instance.\n\nThe fund history is short, but Avantis funds are derived from a much older class of funds from Dimensional Fund Advisors.

If I was american, since I would save my money in dollars and dollar gained value, I would see it as a 25% crash but as a european it is 11% crash.

Given that the world stocks rn go up and down pretty much correlated. Lets say all stocks go up 10% after I buy, but if this happens usd probably loses 5% or sth so my net gain would be smaller compared to investing in european etfs. \nI don't believe that EUR/USD goes up without S&P going up.

{"title": "A Summary Of What Is Happening In The UK With Pension Funds, Gilts, and Bank of England", "selftext": "There has been a lot of market volatility this week largely driven by what's happening in the UK. It has a lot to do with pension funds, gilts, and the Bank of England. I put together an easy-to-understand summary. The entire situation is a bit more complicated and I might have missed a point or two, but I tried to keep this as high-level as possible.\n\n* Pension funds have to pay retirees a fixed amount\n* They purchase UK government bonds (gilts) because they are one of the safest investments (gov’t backed)\n* The gilts’ value fluctuates based on interest rates so pension funds need to employ a strategy to hedge against those fluctuations\n* Pension funds turn to Liability-driven Investment (LDI) funds to manage an LDI strategy, which uses derivatives such as interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations\n* But in order to enter into and secure these contracts and swaps, you need to post an underlying asset as collateral (i.e., your contract has to be backed by some sort of asset), which in this case is gilts (and some cash)\n* As part of a swap agreement, there are margin requirements, meaning the value of the underlying collateral has to meet a minimum required amount\n* But gilts suddenly collapsed in value (due to selling off) when the UK chancellor and prime minister announced their tax cut strategy last week\n* Why did the UK chancellor and prime minister announced tax cuts? Because they wanted to “spur economic growth”\n* People became fearful for several reasons:\n   * a tax cut means that the government will have to take on greater debt at a time when interest rates are rising to fund whatever projects or spending they require\n   * More debt leads to fears of greater inflation\n   * Greater inflation leads to potentially greater rate hikes\n   * Greater rate hikes mean greater cost to borrow\n   * It is a vicious loop if not managed properly\n* As a result of fear and uncertainty, and low confidence in the future, people began dumping the pound and the value of the pound plunged. The UK market and markets in general sold off\n* Gilts, which are supposedly one of the safest investments in the UK began to sell off and collapse in value as fear set in\n* When the value of gilts collapsed, pension funds had to post additional collateral (margin call) to meet those margin requirements per the swaps contracts\n* This meant that pension funds had to find cash to provide to LDI funds to meet the margin call, or slash positions in gilts in order to get hold of cash\n* Most pension funds did not have the necessary cash reserves to meet those margin calls -- no one expected such a sharp drop in gilt value\n* If pension funds aren’t able to pay up they get kicked out of their derivatives positions. When they are kicked out, they then have naked exposure to further sharp moves in in rates and therefore value of gilts\n* This would potentially have been disastrous given that pension funds might not have been able to meet their future liabilities (payments to retirees). This is a big deal given the size of total pension fund market (in UK \\~$3.59T). Imagine tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands?) of people relying on their pension fund for retirement and potentially not being able to receive their guaranteed amt. Imagine in the worst case scenario where \\~$3.59T is wiped out, pension funds become insolvent, and the trickle-down implications it could have for the broader economy. This is why some compared this to an almost Lehman Brothers event\n* Pension Funds asked the Bank of England (BOE) to step in and intervene\n* BOE states they will temporarily buy gilts and do whatever necessary and pledge unlimited purchases to help stabilize the situation\n* How would this stabilize the situation? Because purchases of gilts would prop up the value of gilts (think increase in demand to meet large supply) and reduce or eliminate margin calls for pension funds. No margin calls = pension funds can keep their derivative positions to continue hedging against interest rate volatility\n\nLots of uncertainty and fear right now.

To enable that vision, CoStar recently acquired Ten-X, the world’s largest CRE auction website\nwith 90% market share. We believe Ten-X unlocks a transformational revenue opportunity\nfor CoStar. Real estate is the US’ largest spending category but has been the slowest to move\nonline (nearly $1 trillion of CRE transaction volume annually, 98% of which is done\noffline). As online penetration grows, Ten-X’s dominant share suggests it will be the largest\nbeneficiary, with a revenue opportunity 3x-4x larger than CoStar’s entire business\ntoday. And while Ten-X’s auction platform has always offered a compelling value\nproposition for owners and brokers (particularly in the underserved long tail of smaller CRE\ntransactions), its penetration was historically constrained by weak distribution.\nEncouragingly, though, our research suggests it has experienced dramatic traffic growth\nduring the past few months as CoStar has started to cross-sell the Ten-X platform into its\nmuch larger installed base. As Ten-X scales, we believe CoStar should be able to accelerate\nrevenue growth from mid-teens to 20% and drive EBITDA growth from 20% to 30% over\ntime.\n\n**Finally, we believe CoStar will be a material beneficiary of impending COVID-induced\ndisruption in the CRE market. As has been well-publicized, COVID is expected to drive\nunprecedented changes in demand for office space (via relocation & de-densification),\nhospitality/retail real estate (due to tenant distress), and other CRE sectors. However, the\nresultant market impact has been delayed by a combination of government stimulus and\nlong-duration commercial leases. As underlying demand disruption becomes more evident,\nwe believe CRE arms vendors like CoStar will benefit from the increased need for property\nadvertising (to lease vacant spaces) and transactional platforms (to buy/sell distressed\nproperties).** (https://thirdpointlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Third-Point-Q1-2021-Investor-Letter-TPIL.pdf)\n\nThe bolded was maybe a bit too early. Offices are still not back to pre-pandemic levels in many areas. Wreck the economy and perhaps you start getting more distressed office space and other commercial RE, which Costar will benefit from in the 10x regard.\n\nFrom the company's last conference call:\n\n\"CMBS delinquencies at 30, 60 and 90 days continue to decline in the second quarter, we anticipate that the rise in interest rates will create difficulties with loan maturities and refinancing in the months and years ahead.

In no way am I doubling down on anything; I'm not sure where you got that impression.\n\nJust like any other trader/investor does on a regular basis, I simply made positioning changes due to a high-conviction thesis that we were going to enter a bear market between November and January after the Fed would be forced to raise rates faster than the market anticipated. Valuations were clearly out-of-whack and consistent high inflation almost always precedes rate increases. The Fed was previously saying that no rate hikes were coming in 2022, except maybe 25bps at the end of the year. I called BS on that.. simple as that.\n\nExcept in Europe it seems, rates cannot go below zero. Being short bonds was almost a no-brainer, which also worked in my favor. Rates could only go up, meaning that valuations, generally, would go down. And given how egregious some valuations were, that way down is quite large.\n\nSeeing inflation go up month after month from the summer to Q3 and Q4, and also seeing rather strong circumstantial evidence that the Fed was cherry-picking the best data points for m/o/m and y/o/y comparisons, the non-transitory outcome seemed highly likely. Also the supply side commodity complex was primed for at least a short-term boom, which would only make inflation worse. Ukraine exacerbated it, but I still believe a similar outcome would have resulted.\n\nSure, it could have gone the other way. But it just didn't make sense to me that it would. Stimulus was running out; tapering was working its way through; valuations were sky-high; rates couldn't go lower; bonds were overpriced; extreme euphoria with the greater public bidding up prices (see the psychology of a market cycle)... looked like it could only go one way.\n\nIt doesn't mean the same strategy is going to work next time. Nor was that outcome guaranteed; I just thought it was highly likely. Obvious, even. There are a lot of parallels to the dotcom era. You can see similar patterns throughout history.\n\nHindsight bias assumes one is going to have an increased confidence to predict the next event. This particular phenomenon may only happen once or twice in my lifetime. I'm not seeing where you think I'm doubling down and going to predict the bottom or something else. I have no idea where the bottom is.\n\nNor did I time the top perfectly; I missed about 3%. That last run-up in November was surprising. I just made a high-conviction bet that it was going to run out of steam and the Fed was going to be forced to take action sooner than previously anticipated. I was right, but that doesn't mean I will be next time. So, I'm not seeing where the hindsight bias is.\n\nThe original point was the Fed could tell you when the top/bottom is. It wasn't perfect timing, but if you generally followed the cycle, there's a decent argument that paying attention to their speech can make a big difference. When they clearly pivoted in November, it seemed that the rate outlook was going to change with high probability. I assume this is why the market analyzes every single word out of Powell's mouth. It's not going to work every time or be perfect, but the market seems to agree that it matters what they say.\n\nAlso, saying that the market will always go up over a long period of time is, by definition, a form of hindsight bias. It has in the past, sure, but it may not keep doing that.\n\nu/Screwyball", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You're incredibly naive.
