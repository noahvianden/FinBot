{"title": "Great Depression?", "selftext": "Firs off, i would like the begin by saying that i have been doing this almost 4 months so any constructive criticism is appreciated, i see it at an opportunity to learn. With that being said, enjoy my book ü§£.\n\nPersonally, a recession has seemed unavoidable based on the Feds decisions and the economic data supporting those decisions. Now we are beginning to understand the magnitude of repercussions that will follow while the Feds attempt to tame inflation. \n\nDuring the Fed meeting today we heard from representatives for some of the different business sectors, wholesale, transportation, etc. As of todays meeting, we no longer have to speculate if we will see a recession. Businesses expressed hardships revolving around wages, supply/demand (be that too much or too little supply/demand), overhead costs, ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù decline in profits, environmental concerns that have negatively affected different crops, and one i didn‚Äôt expect to hear, mismanagement of PPP funds. \n\nThere was little spoken by the Feds though they did have some key comments and questions. First off Powell began by reiterating that they have been very transparent with their stance on inflation. In addition to that, at one point when the reps had neared the end of their comments and concerns, a Fed member asked one of them if they had anything that they could help them with, implying none of these problems being presented are their priority. I believe this is key because it says that everything they‚Äôre saying is stuff they already understand to be a consequence of the fight on inflation. It‚Äôs not the Feds fault a business grew too fast, it‚Äôs not their fault that a business has failing practices, it‚Äôs not their fault businesses mismanaged their PPP loans. At another point Powell had asked one of the reps if these additional expenses are going to be passed onto the consumer. When companies choose profit margins over stability for consumers, that‚Äôs an issue. Companies need to eat some of these expenses, some companies will have prepared better than others however that‚Äôs just how this works. As Powell said before ‚Äújobs will be lost, households will suffer‚Äù. The train is full speed and not set to stop in the near future. Add in foreign tensions on-top of this and we could be in for a very bumpy ride down, especially considering Putin doesn‚Äôt seem to be changing his mind anytime soon.\n\nIf you made it this far then thanks for taking the time to read this long ass book üòÇ, look forward to any comments and questions.", "id": "xmbyqx", "created_utc": 1663973850.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "Let be clear.

Interest rates are numbers that fit into equations quite easily. Goldman Sachs ran their equations and came up with 3600 as a year-end number for the SP500. Seems reasonable, and not horrible (given we are almost there.)\n\nThe issue is what we might not know about. When economic conditions are shifting this quickly, you have businesses making irrational decisions due to a squeeze (in inventory, in labor, in cash on hand, etc.). Those irrational decisions will not have been anticipated by others in the economy, and can catch them by surprise, in turn squeezing them, and so things can escalate. This is what happens in really bad economic situations. Things spiral out of control. No one can anticipate these, not even Goldman Sachs.\n\nThere's interest rates, and there's the proper functioning of the financial system. Those are different things. Proper functioning of the financial system means that credit is available to responsible borrowers who need it, bills are being paid in a timely fashion, payments are being cleared quickly, etc. I think that's what was meant when they asked \"is there anything we can do to help\" in the meeting - the Fed's primary responsibility other than interest rates is making sure that money keeps flowing in the ways the economy needs it to in order to function.\n\nIf you think of what is happened as an earthquake, what we don't know is whether it's just a matter of riding out the earthquake of the spike in inflation and interest rates, or if gas and water mains are breaking and a tsunami being created that will spawn thousands of unanticipated side effects.

Been at this just over 3 months. \n\nThe market began in a descending wedge when Powell spoke about aggressively combating inflation. Since then any rally has been on false hopes of a soft landing that would be crushed by data supporting the likelihood of us entering a recession. Some traders attempted to make sense of the rallies by saying the Feds are either bluffing, not in a position to do it and then up till this week, the last hope of a .5 interest rate hike. That is if you believed they were bluffing, or that they didn‚Äôt have the tools to combat inflation, i.e strong employment, the highest competitive wage market in my young life, and the trillions injected into the economy. \n\nIf you look at SPY (which mirrors or inverses all the huge stocks), you‚Äôll see that the market was respecting the 30min 50MA since before Powell spoke. Ever since then it only began respecting the 30min 50MA when it would rally for a false breakout. If you look at the last rally before we confirmed with more data that we will be seeing a .75 rate hike, we dropped back under that 30min 50MA in a single day, not only did we drop under the 30min 50MA but we also broke back into the edge we were out of for the largest decline the market has seen in a single day since the pandemic in 2020. In addition to this, every single one of those rallies were after dividends payouts. I theorize that the larger money are rolling their dividends payouts into shares at a discounted rate due to tax laws. They are then buying both low and selling high in the form of puts. Each rally is just an opportunity for shares to be dumped on unsuspected traders. ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù money bought 3x the number of puts compared to before the 08 crash at the top of the last rally of hope for a .5 hike followed by a .25 finishing the hikes and decreasing interest rates next year. Since then we have now seen data that absolutely confirms we will be seeing a recession, on a global level. Now that the rest of the market is on the same page, we only have one place to go and that‚Äôs down. The Feds not only gave us a .75 basis rate increase but forward projection indicated another .75 followed by a .5 with more to come into 2023.

So when they finally started earning profits (Q4 2017) they have a portion of losses carried over from previous years that offset some of their tax liability.  \n\nThe government allows this for 2 main reasons.  \nFirst, a company that is losing money BECAUSE it is investing capital into expanding its business is a good long term investment for the government.  The investments will return more tax revenue long term and allows businesses to grow.   \nThe other major reason is risk/reward.  Every investment is some ratio of risk to reward.  If the business or person can't claim a loss, theyre going to be much less likely to invest a lot of capital in something.  \n\n\nAmazon is also smart and has been negotiating deals with local cities and states for distribution centers, warehouses etc.  AOC famously opposed the $3 billion tax credit Amazon was seeking and claimed that money could be better used elsewhere, but thats not how tax credits work.   Tax credits are something local governments give corporations to lure them to their city/state.   The $3 billion doesn't come out of the pocket of the government, that's less money the company owes.  It's like a pizze placr offering a $5 off coupon on a $20 pizza.

Based upon the current state of the correction in comparison to 2008, it is clear to me that a 50% overall drop from the highs is highly probable.  We still have a long way to go to get to 50%.  Good advice at this point in my view is to not attempt to catch the falling knife.  Wait until the next inflation report, there is a lot of white noise that the inflation is rapidly cooling, and we know there is a delayed reaction between the cooling and the announcement which firmly confirms it.  The next number might be the all clear signal, even if the Fed stays the course and still whales forward with two more .75% raises.  There will be so much speculation that the Fed will back down if the inflation number retracts in a more than insignificant fashion.

Globalization was good for risk assets since it meant we could cut costs by exporting labor all around the world. It also meant we could have a massive and connected global supply chain where certain regions specialize in their own product and sell it to others.\n\nDeglobalization is the opposite, where jobs get moved back onshore (look at, for example, the initiative to subsidize US chip manufacturing, and stop relying on China for this resource). This alone will make inflation a more \"permanent\" deal since it's going to inevitably cost more to produce chips on US soil which is a price that basically gets offloaded to the consumer. The businesses won't do well with that either, and their growth will have to be slower than it was during a globalizing market. Other examples of this deglobalization playing out are the Europe energy shortage, the Ukraine war, and more. Supply chains will be repaired, but it will be a slow process and at the end of it, we will be paying more. This is why I don't buy the idea that inflation will just go back to 2% and stay there.\n\nTo clarify this point, I do think inflation will fall. I even think it will fall pretty rapidly, and we may end the year 2022 at around 6-7% for the YoY CPI number. After that, I would say 2023 is between 3-4%. But not 2%.

Instead of printing money and cutting rates to boost the economy, central banks will now have to deal with governments that seem more willing to spend than ever, bringing ‚Äúhigher growth, higher inflation, and higher interest rates across the curve,\n\nIf Edwards is correct, it will come as a shock to investors who are used to stocks going up most of the time, and a Fed that always had the market‚Äôs back. It will also require more than a simple buy-the-S&P-500-and-hold strategy. Stiefel strategist Barry Bannister has argued that investors will need to be more tactical, buying when the market is weak and selling when it is strong. Dividends, too, will be far more important. It‚Äôs one reason the S&P 500 could lose 5.7% from its 1968 high through its 1982 low and investors could still emerge with a positive return, at least before adjusting for inflation.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-lost-decade-51663945507?mod=hp_LEAD_1_B_1", "id": "xmcpgd", "created_utc": 1663975783.0, "score": 143, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "I‚Äôm confused, how can they say we have had 40 years of stellar performance, AND acknowledge that we had a lost decade 20 years ago.
