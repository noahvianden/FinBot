A covered call is a literal contract to sell your shares at the specified price at or before the specified date. Your intention has to be aligned with the contract, or you'll eventually be punished for the misalignment. Like if your stock moons way above your strike price.\n\nPut another way, a covered call is a financial vehicle for exchanging future gains on your shares for cash today. So don't use a covered call until you are sure the cash you receive today will provide acceptable compensation for typical outcomes, including sacrificing higher gains.\n\nPut mathematically, only use a covered call when it increases your [expected value](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result) versus every other strategy you might consider. You can replace \"only use a covered call\" with basically any trade decision.\n\nPersonally, the only time I would use a covered call in a situation like yours is when (a) I'm ready to unload one or more 100 share lots for a gain, (b) I'm not in a hurry and don't mind if I miss out on further gains and/or I don't sell shares because I don't get assigned, which can happen if the stock ends up down from the time of opening the CC. Although you can use a collar to protect against the latter case.\n\n>I am attracted to vertical credit call spreads, because of the idea that both reward and risk is limited, and because the purchased option will stop things from getting out of hand quickly - if a position goes against me, I will take the loss, lick the wound, and start over with the same number of shares that I started with.\n\nThere is an added risk for short vertical call spreads. If the stock expires between the strikes of the two legs, you become a victim of worst-case risk. You can work out why yourself, just write out an experimental trade and see what happens at expiration between the strikes.\n\n>I will take the loss, lick the wound, and start over with the same number of shares that I started with.\n\nDid you mean a *covered* vertical call credit spread? That removes the risk I previously talked about, since the short call leg can be covered by existing long shares.\n\n>I also have heard of people putting stops into place to *attempt* to further limit their upside risk on these positions, but I haven't seen any math on how to properly do this.\n\nSee above link on expected value. Profit and loss exits, whether automated or manual, are what you use to adjust your expected value calculation to net to a positive value.\n\nFor example, if your break-even expected value (formula set equal to 0 and then solve for win$, win%, or loss$, whichever is the free variable) uses $2000 loss$ and you are heading for a $1800 loss, stop out at $2000. Or if your win% has trended down and you can't change the win$ (because it's a fixed credit and you don't want to roll), you can get your ev back to the plus side by raising your loss$ limit (basically lose less to compensate for the reduced win%).\n\nIf you want more math than you can shake a stick at, take a look at r/quant and/or read up on the volatility smile/surface.

Its price is constantly fluctuating, based on what traders are willing to buy/sell it for.  You might buy a share of stock right now at 50; this afternoon it might go down to 49, then tomorrow it might open at 52, go down to 50, then back up to 53.  A month from now it might be at 45, or 55, or anything.  It just depends on what people are willing to buy or sell it for.  If you happen to sell it when it's at 49, you'd have a loss.  If you happen to sell it when it's at 55, you have a gain.\n\nNow, you can short-sell stock too.  In that case, if you sell a share short at 50, you pocket $50 right then and there.  If you buy to cover it when it's at 49, you pay $49 to do that.  The $1 difference that you keep is your profit.  If you buy to cover it at $55, you pay $55 to do that, so you have a $5 loss.\n\nOptions work the same way.  Pick a random option; say an AAPL 11/18/22 155 call.  Right now it's trading for around 9.30.  Tomorrow it might be 9.00 or 9.60, or anything else.  It depends on how the price of AAPL moves, on the passage of time (theta,) and on volatility (vega.)  If you sell it short (which is what you're doing when you sell a covered call,) you receive $930.  If you happen to buy it back to close it when it's at 9.00, you pay $900, keeping $30 as profit.  If you happen to buy it back to close when it's at 9.60, you pay $960, so you have a $30 loss.\n\nThe difference between an option and a share of stock is that the option eventually expires. If, on 11/18/22, AAPL closes below 155, your option expires worthless, and you don't have to pay anything to close it.  It just ceases to exist.

So if my initial investment was $5k, I’d be up $2500 in this instance?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No. You make $.50 per share on each dollar gain *of the underlying share price*, but that's not the same a 50% of your investment, unless the share price was $1. Example: You buy a 50 delta call for $10,000 in a stock that cost $100/share and the stock goes up to $101/share. Your contract would be worth $10,050 ($.50 x 100) ignoring all other factors. That is not a 50% gain.\n\n> When does delta change and how does that change the pricing?\n\nDelta changes every time the contract price changes.\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"pricing\"? Pricing of what, the contract? It's the other way around. The contract price changes and that is reflected in a new delta.\n\nContract price is determined by the market, not by greeks.\n\n> So if my initial investment was $5k, I’d be up $2500 in this instance?\n\nOnly if the shares were worth $1.

So contract prices are similar to stock price in the sense that the market makes them move. Then the Greeks will move from there.

If you have a call with a $50 strike and the stock is worth $500 share at pretty much any DTE, the call ought to pay dollar for dollar what the shares do, since the call is so deep in the money.\n\n>How do you personally look at delta and theta when buying an option?\n\nPersonally they factor into trade-off decisions. Just about everything in options trading is a trade-off. Risk/reward trade-offs. Time vs. money trade-offs. Investment vs. opportunity cost trade-offs, etc.\n\nFor example, delta can be used as a rough estimate of probability of ITM at expiration. A 60 delta ITM call with 2 weeks to go has about a 60% chance to expire ITM. A 30 delta OTM call with 2 weeks to go has about a 30% chance to expire ITM. But since higher delta costs more, the trade-off is initial cost vs. probability of profit.\n\nI also use delta as an RoC metric. Say I'm comparing two calls, A vs B. A costs $4 for 50 delta, B costs $6 for 60 delta. If I calculate the dollar cost per point of delta, A is worth 4/50 = $.08 per unit delta and B is worth 6/60 = $.10 per unit of delta, which means call A is the better deal on delta, all else equal.\n\nTheta is like capital depreciation. The longer you hold an asset (long), the more you lose to time. I usually don't worry about theta when I trade long, since I don't hold long positions for more than 60 days and never near expiration. I use theta more when I'm a net seller/credit trader. Then theta is my rate of appreciation rather than depreciation.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "When does cash on hold for secured puts get released if the put options sold expired worthless? \nWanted to buy some stock in extended trading but saw that my cash is still on hold for OTM puts I sold.\nI’m using Charles Schwab", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Probably tomorrow, as options technically expire at 11:59pm.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Gotcha, thanks!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is a reason to buy to close,, so you can immediately start a new trade.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah that’s what I normally do, this time I just let it expire, didn’t think about when the funds would be released.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Is there a source where I can enter a specific date and see the chart of the data?

My targets for SPX calls are $4017 and $4120. so I will be  getting out of calls at these targets or before JPow speech whichever  comes first.My expectations are based on the chart levels below, the  market pumped on shit numbers and dumped on great numbers, the only  thing that has been consistent is the chart, they just tack on an excuse  for why the stock moved the way they wanted it to.\n\n**Watchlist for this week**\n\n* $ETH  has been channeling between $1700 and $1420 for the past week, I will  looking for a break of the channel either way for the position, till  that happens we can scalp within the range.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/604ru4hg04m91.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6e9e87326dd21d474096de1711815ff8023442\n\n* $MSFT  wins a $22B AR headset contract with the US army, I expect some more  pain in the market followed by a proper relief rally, $MSFT should run  hard on this news during the rally. I will take calls then, my target  would be the retest of the 50MA at $270.4, if the market tanks I'm  looking at $245 support as my first target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ieni1q8h04m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=85453d8dbdac1b28296d4df076c3fa67d3ab835d\n\n* $AAPL  event starts on Wednesday, expected to reveal iPhone 14 among other  things, could see a run, if the market runs. we are currently right at  the 50MA on the daily and $155.6 support. if the market runs target is  $166.5 which is the 21MA, and if it tanks we will see $130 quickly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ij6qhjzh04m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb51178430044fc682960729dc1e04c3cbcc0d8\n\n* $SAVA  3M in insider buys last month by directors and the chief medical  officer, if someone knows something about whether they pass the trials  or not, it would be this guy. more importantly, insiders sell for many  reasons but buy only for one, they think the stock will go up. low float  37M and 33% of float shorted, ran to $140 last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syeuqopi04m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=9038e92159a29baa9cc51e993dcde163eaa636de\n\nTaking  ATM calls here for Jan20 23 might wait for a drop to $15.4 support  before an entry, but we are at 50MA on the daily, so might take a  starter there. if phase 2 final data is positive, we can expect to hit  $65 resistance at least, phase 3 data may be available in early 2023.  I'm taking my time with entries here and may go for a longer expiry.\n\nSo  if you made it this far, I'm guessing this is what have been waiting  for, this is largely under the radar, but could play out Tuesday, and  book us a big win!\n\n**Possible 10 bagger play for this week**\n\nSo  the $DWAC deadline to merge with truth social is Tuesday 09/06, if that  doesn't happen, which thanks to the SEC investigation it won't, the  stock dumps back to SPAC floor prices which is $10.\n\nNow  the reason it's not already there, is that they have shareholder vote  for an extension after market close, but they need 65% approval to get a  6-month extension. with most people unaware of this, it seems unlikely  it will happen.\n\nNot only that they  also have to put up $6m or $0.10 per share as collateral to get the  extension, which they don't get back if the merger doesn't go through.  we all know for political reasons will not go through in 6 months or  even a year.\n\nSo my play here is  $25p 9 Sep here, my thinking is that it won't pass. if it tanks to $10,  this could be a 10-bagger right there!\n\nAs  an important side note, please don't buy $10 puts, the floor price is  $10, and they will go to 0, even if the stock tanks to $10 because it  can't go below $10 (for the most part) so the market will price them as  worthless.\n\nAlright, so that's it  for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the  previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf  you have any questions let me know, non of this financial advice, check  my youtube channel, Twitter, and discord, they are free I don't sell  anything at all, and I'm getting very active across the board, all links  are in my profile.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!", "id": "x6s3zs", "created_utc": 1662413906.0, "score": 410, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "Love this idea and format, looking forward to following along if you continue.", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you kind sir, will 100% continue as long as you guys and gals like this", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Should post an end of week summary/conclusion as well!", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Actual DD that isn’t conspiracy focused nor penned by someone with an IQ < 50?!?

{"title": "Just Sold My House - Here's the Market Crash and Food Shortage YOLO & DD", "selftext": "So I'm the guy that wrote the DD about the housing crisis that made it to the front page of Reddit before sitewide admins deleted it and gave me a hate speech warning, there's a copy up on another forum you can get to in my profile that I can't link to here because the wall street firms running the various finance subreddits like drama. I started looking for a new place to live and listed my house shortly after posting that.  I'm also the guy who wrote [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vb7qjp/theres_going_to_be_a_global_food_shortage_heres/) about the coming food shortage.\n\n**TL;DR Market go down, food go up, bank account go up more, buy large pizza with profits.**\n\nGood news kids, there's no wannabe Riddler nonsense in this post, just straight answers and hard numbers, plus screenshots of my positions.  I've got five figures in already and more than twice that on the way waiting to clear settlement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# First, the Market Crash\n\nI'm going to try to keep this shorter, simpler, and more picture based than normal.  Here's the TA for the market crash, I'm going to show you the same picture twice in a row.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uizu3lilezl91.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=229b4aeda36926b5fba092bcdeb02aa69a7b2e9f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h271ldreezl91.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e542e2ab957901d10532ebacc6e1c4ced09903b3\n\nI have SPY going down to 300ish within the next two months - ie by the end of October.  Resistance around 390, 385, and 360 (plus maybe 340).  Once we lose the previous low of the year at 363, it should be a skydive run down to the new Morgan Collar floor, which I think is around 300.  The century long trendline/mean reversion point is a little under 200, pretty sure that's why Burry has the final low at 184.  I've got the final low at 60-90, ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/salggk/behold_your_new_god_manbearape_the_vice_president/) I've been saying this for awhile) because I think we dip well below that mean/trend before recovering.\n\nFor reference, my levels for the first bottom after the peak were 350-380, then a run up to 420-450, before the real crash started (the real crash is the part we're on now).  I did not think the run down from 430 to 390 would happen as fast as it did, so I've taken a lot of 10% profits that could have gone as high as 800-900% over the last few days.  Hey, nobody's perfect, and green is green, take profits people.  I can proudly say I hit the end of day and overnight bounce from 9/1 to 9/2 and flipped back short again almost perfectly, which is incredibly rare for anyone except Domino from Deadpool or Prince from Bullet Train - and more luck than skill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Second, the Housing Crash\n\nIf you haven't read ANY of my DD's about housing and why it's in trouble, ([here's one from a year ago on why the \"not enough houses\" narrative was bogus](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/)) well, they're all on my profile, but given that you probably don't care, this post someone else made about what they'd done pretty much perfectly sums it up:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxf16yorizl91.jpg?width=670&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bb7c5449ef9c60412525a4134b05ceb94aa8aab\n\nBasically, Wall Street is only responsible for about 1/3rd of the \"cash buyers\" of houses you're seeing in the market.  The rest are geniuses like this guy who used margin, asset backed loans, and inflated equity values to buy property with \"cash\" and accidentally loaded up all kinds of risk that nobody picked up on.  Also see the video of the \"4880 units, Boom!\" guys.\n\nBut I mean, basically everyone has gone from calling anyone pointing out the housing bubble chicken little to saying \"yeah man, everyone knew that\", so there are any number of idiots who can provide you with info on this, though I expect it'll take a few more months before the equity linkage comes up in the mainstream press.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Third, the Food Shortage\n\nThe first farm scout reports came in last week from the midwest, and they're pretty bad.  These aren't definitive numbers wise, but they're very good at identifying directionality.  Wheat, Corn, and Soybeans all came in about 4% under USDA estimates in the midwest breadbasket states.  (remember kids, this doesn't cover California, which is even more drought and heat stricken, and produces 25% of US food) Effectively this means US production can't offset the massive shortages occurring in Europe, China, South America, and India.  The situation in China is particularly brutal, they've had flooding, then went into the worst heat dome effect since the start of recorded meteorology - not a joke, 1876 is the last time things *might* have been this bad - back into what looks like a record monsoon season and more flooding.\n\nIf you want an idea of how seriously you should take the crop scout report, here's a snapshot of futures prices before and after it was released:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cm0oox95z1m91.jpg?width=1138&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b43bbea2505fe9cd64fe4a12dabd77ad1cbd2c1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzpgrp74z1m91.jpg?width=1146&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d2dc55289c9e5efb0a7e20ae9f85e241d7dc7bc\n\nRemember, it's worse in Europe, China, South America, and India and they all have significantly less resources to deal with this than the USA does.  I'm guessing the USDA only slightly revises their September yield estimates downwards, so we'll still have another downside surprise in American production when the harvest actually begins this fall.  Meanwhile, most worldwide grain production estimates I've been tracking are consistently underestimating the amount of production and distribution lost from the Ukraine war and the extreme weather from the third year of La Nina, while significantly overestimating the ability of countries like the US and Canada to make up the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Fourth, the Energy Shortage\n\nHere's a fun one.  [This is the first DD I ever wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqe5mt/betting_on_oil_gas_and_economic_growth/) for WSB.  Made myself and others a very nice chunk of change on it.  It's from around 18 months ago.  You'll notice that everything I pointed out in there about lack of CAPEX in the energy sector and incompetent, belligerent relations between East and West and how that would impact energy prices has played out basically EXACTLY as I predicted, except even more to the downside because the guys who failed out of clown college are now running the circus.\n\nI don't actually have any positions on the mess that is the global energy supply system right now, outside of a small one in Uranium (shares only) based on the theoretical hope that sanity at some point prevails.  Power use is going to drop as the summer heatwaves subside into autumn's cooler weather.  Everything with energy is just too priced in right now, except the possibility that this winter will be warmer than average.  I think we do get OPEC output cuts this fall, that will probably match up with the end of the US SPR withdrawals (remember, that's got to be built back up eventually), and I'll be looking to get in on energy around October or November, but for right now I'm not touching it.  YMMV.\n\nThe \"price cap\" idea we're seeing from G7 leaders is just a bad sketch comedy segment.  You can have price caps, or you can have supply.  You only get one, not both.  I mean, you see copium and hopium on these subs all the time (maybe my China investments will be profitable?) and other such nonsense, but the stuff the big boys pull is flat out ridic.  And to think, Putin got all of this with a small $1 million/year bribe to Gerhard Schroeder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Fifth, the next crisis, Political Unrest and Mass Migration\n\nI said in [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcqov5/this_is_how_the_financial_world_ends/) a couple of months ago about how we'd see an increase in protests, riots and political unrest as a result of increasing energy and food prices, and those would be blamed on racial or social issues rather than the true causes of said unrest - inflation, wealth concentration, and shortages.  The recent mass protests in the Czech Republic, in Paris, and whatever the hell the president's \"red speech of doom\" last week was are all examples of this.  (speaking of instability, it's worth mentioning that roughly 1/3 of Pakistan is currently underwater, but its fine, that's a very stable country with good relations with its neighbors, no corruption, no relationships with terrorist organizations, and no nuclear weapons)\n\nLook, remember the last time we had a big spike in food prices and some Tunisian fruit vendor set himself on fire starting the Arab Spring, and how like, half of Syria and the middle east walked to Europe and that just kinda fucked everything up?  Like every mass migration of people throughout the entirety of human history has?\n\nCivilization runs on Food, Energy, and Stability.  Take the first two away and the third goes right out the window.  Things are going to get bad in the first world and flat out apocalyptic in the third.  The only thing keeping Sri Lankans on Sri Lanka right now is the ocean.  Lots of places that don't have that barrier are going to see folks walking off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Sixth, My Positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/podpr14hw2m91.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef367a0add85a408dbf25110f9e2a87ccccc702f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esqydezhw2m91.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a3c69b3184b863bb6f9c9496575cc32629443c8\n\nI'll be adding a lot more once the rest of the money I have en route to my brokerages settles.  I also have a small shares only position in Uranium, some BBBY (I was buying shares and calls back at $4.30, and I sold some on the way up, and no, I don't think the stock with the 102% official short interest is done with volatility) and a rather silly amount of drs'd GME, including some $320/share bags that have made me incredibly strong over the last year+.\n\nFinally, because I always, always, always get asked about this, how do I find this stuff or research plays or figure out what to invest in?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t43o4u0ex2m91.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eec8d4568ef11243fb886ae997afcd8c440f4dd5\n\nThat's it.  That's how you do it.  You fucking look and do the research.  Good luck out there people.  Here it is, the sum of the last two years of my research and plays.  I'll keep providing updates on how this goes, profits or losses.", "id": "x6n41t", "created_utc": 1662401721.0, "score": 1492, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 667, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|30|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|304|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/opydwu/38_million_puts_how_all_of_wall_street_is_using/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcqov5/this_is_how_the_financial_world_ends/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqe5mt/betting_on_oil_gas_and_economic_growth/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6n41t/just_sold_my_house_heres_the_market_crash_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usfwhj/quick_macro_overview_the_fed_is_lying_to_you/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6jcq/a_follow_up_to_my_market_crash_post_specifically/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q03iro/were_all_fucked_the_gay_bear_porn_you_need_for/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vnxoyr/the_2022_real_estate_collapse_is_going_to_be/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/salggk/behold_your_new_god_manbearape_the_vice_president/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uflx06/the_2022_real_estate_collapse_is_going_to_be/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vb7jcm/theres_going_to_be_a_global_food_shortage_heres/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vb7qjp/theres_going_to_be_a_global_food_shortage_heres/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vb7n64/theres_going_to_be_a_global_food_shortage_heres/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok7hsx/update_on_market_crashing_soon_positions_and_an/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w7w6f3/the_story_of_texas_instruments_and_how_patent/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=x6n41t)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=x6n41t)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "yeah\nnone of that stuff is going to happen near term", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Zero % chance of spy hitting 60-90.

Had me laughing about some truly morbid stuff, although my outlook is not as apocalyptic as yours.\n\n1. I don't necessarily agree that the SPX is going to follow the bubble pattern. I do think there is an extended bear market that is not at all priced in. Some are still thinking the Fed \"pivot\" is incoming soon. I do think they will lose resolve but it won't be before the end of the year.  I am sort of convinced by some of the arguments that inflation is not really due to fiscal or monetary policy, but the general geopolitical climate around the world, and the Fed can't do anything to change that. There's an investor note I can share if people are interested explaining it. So, I anticipate that 1 year from now SPX will have traded overall sideways but with a lot of pumps and dumps, as people's expectations keep shifting based on whatever the latest data are. \n\n2. I am the opposite of you in that I tend to think the housing crash is mostly priced in and the energy crisis is actually NOT priced in. I say this because if energy shortages were priced in, Brent crude would be back at, oh let's say, $110-$120 level. If anything the energy supply situation has gotten even worse since it peaked at $140+ at the start of the war. And yet the price is down? This feels even less rational than when the vaccine came out and oil only pumped a bit when it should have returned to its pre-COVID price level. I am still bullish AF on energy. Although again I am the opposite of you, in that I got tired of my uranium stocks. They were too correlated to the general market without enough actually changing. They were just giving me heartburn and I wasn't sure when if ever the world is gonna get its head out of its ass with respect to nuclear, so I closed that position. \n\n3. Food. Bullish AF. Buy. Also buy fertilizer stocks. I like UAN.\n\n4. Completely agree about the oil price cap thing. If you really wanted to hurt Putin's bottom line, you would encourage all producers to flood the market with cheap oil to tank the price and the government would do something like sell \"price insurance\" for longer dated futures (ie., put options) to guarantee that producers get a decent price for CAPEX increased output in the future.

Not happening, unless they are divorcing or relocating. Or stupid. \n\n2. Institutional investors make up a large part of our residential real estate market now.  Single family homes are being treated like stocks. Stocks only go up. The institutes are not fucking selling. You’re fucked. \n\n3. Millennials don’t have shit saved up because it’s too expensive to live and wages are not rising fast enough. Recession is going to make that worse. You’re going to rent and a corporation is likely going to rent that house to you. \n\n4. New construction home supply is up big time.

{"title": "My Full Plan for this Week (5 Earnings Plays, 2 Economic Events, 4 Stocks & 1 Lotto 10x Play)", "selftext": "Hello ladies and gentlemen\n\nI'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, and my analysis usually does fairly well (check my post history for proof)\n\nI'm starting a thing where I post weekly my analysis and plays for the upcoming week, I will be going through my plays for:\n\n1. Earnings\n2. Major Economic Events\n3. My Watchlist\n4. My Week lotto 10 bagger Play\n\nThere  is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all  this, so you can check that out if you dont like reading\n\nOk so let's get this show on the road\n\n**Earnings this week that I will play**\n\nBut before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time\n\nHow i play earnings:\n\n* buy  shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or  the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before  earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes\n* lotto  size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go  as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don’t  go over 5% size on any earning’s play\n* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad\n\nSo now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it\n\n**Tuesday 6 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - GitLabs - $GTLB\n\n* DevOps software company\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.23) & Revenue $94m\n* Unusual Options: trade of 2500 $75c 12/10 in August nothing notable recently\n* Options pricing in a 16% move on earnings\n* $JPM downgrade knocked it down 18%, could be dropped to grab shares before a great earnings call, or could be something else.\n* 6 months+ after lock-up expiration, insiders of $GTLB only sold 288.5k shares (\\~0.2% of total outstanding shares)\n* My play: 09sep 49c it has massive potential to run if they beat, going with calls flow looks pretty bullish\n\n**Wednesday 7 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - NIO inc - $NIO:\n\n* EV car manufacturer\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 6:00 am EST\n* Estimate eps ($0.17) & revenue $1.45b\n* Unusual Options: trade of 9000 19c 09/09 expiry, on Friday.\n* Options pricing in a 10% move on earnings\n* On the latest delivery report, $NIO delivered 10,677 vehicles in August 2022, an increase of 81.6% YoY\n* They won't be affected by the chip ban, and are no longer in danger of delisting\n* My Play: $18c 9 Sep, following the options flow on this one, I think guidance will be good on this one\n\nAfter Close - Gamestop - $GME\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS ($0.41) & Revenue $1.27B\n* Unusual Options: trade of 7600 $20p 09/16 expiry in aug but nothing recent yet.\n* Options pricing in a 15.0% move on earnings\n* NFT  marketplace not making money, no major games or studio deals last  quarter, consoles sales slightly declining and Ryan Cohen screwed folks  on $BBBY\n* My Play: $24p 09sep, don't see how this one doesn't miss\n\n**Thursday 8 Sep 22**\n\nAfter Close - Docusign - $DOCU\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 & Revenue $602m\n* Unusual option: trade of  $65p 16/12 worth $3,792,570 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 19.8% move on earnings\n* Charts and options chains are screaming bearish on this one massive put block getting bought last week\n* My Play: $53p 09 Sep, gonna go with the flow here\n\n**Friday 9 Sep 22**\n\nBefore Open - Kroger - $KR\n\n* Estimate Earnings Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.42 & Revenue $602m\n* Unusual Option: trade of  $48p 09/09 worth $577,500 on Friday\n* Options pricing in a 7% move on earnings\n* My Play: $49c 09sep, $WMT, and $HD beat, I'm going against the flow here and going for calls following them\n\nSo  this wraps up the earnings for this week, I should have bought last  week to avoid high premiums from iv spikes, so I'm going to place all my  calls and puts on Tuesday at the open, remember lotto size only\n\n**Major Economic events this week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqgg3wooz3m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cbe5492878cfebe6c452aeda9fd851dd42d08d2\n\nSo  overall expectations are a relief rally this week all the way to JPow  speech at somewhere between $4017 which is major resistance and 50MA on  the daily and$ 4120 level which is another major resistance and 21MA on  $SPX and then the start of a major meltdown after that. so we have\n\nTuesday\n\n10:00 am - Non-manufacturing PMI aug\n\nWednesday8:30 am - Balance of trade July\n\n12:35 - Fed Brainard's speech\n\nThursday8:30 am - Initial jobless claims9:10 - 9:50 am - Fed Jerome Powell's speech\n\nFriday\n\n10:00 am - Wholesale Inventories\n\n12:30 - Fed Walker Speech\n\nAs  far as the short-term market reaction is concerned, which is what we  are interested in now, most of these are all nonevents, with the  exception of JPow speech and PMI read. they are all critical for the  overall picture but the idea is to play these events.\n\nMarket  reaction to numbers has been mixed. market dumps on good numbers and  pumps on bad ones. i believe that the market basically uses these events  to run or dump based on what the charts give us. going with that  theory, my plays will be as follows:I'm expecting a continuation of  the Friday dump premarket so I will take SPX puts when pm opens, target  is 3860 or before PMI whichever comes first.Before PMI I expect a  relief rally all the way into the JPow speech on Thursday, i'm not sure  whether the market collapse starts at the JPow speech or CPI numbers on  the 13th. My targets for SPX calls are $4017 and $4120. so I will be  getting out of calls at these targets or before JPow speech whichever  comes first.My expectations are based on the chart levels below, the  market pumped on shit numbers and dumped on great numbers, the only  thing that has been consistent is the chart, they just tack on an excuse  for why the stock moved the way they wanted it to.\n\n**Watchlist for this week**\n\n* $MSFT  wins a $22B AR headset contract with the US army, I expect some more  pain in the market followed by a proper relief rally, $MSFT should run  hard on this news during the rally. I will take calls then, my target  would be the retest of the 50MA at $270.4, if the market tanks I'm  looking at $245 support as my first target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgoqlyxlz3m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a9ab8bd363995221a115492efeddd859fd4cf26\n\n* $AAPL  event starts on Wednesday, expected to reveal iPhone 14 among other  things, could see a run, if the market runs. we are currently right at  the 50MA on the daily and $155.6 support. if the market runs target is  $166.5 which is the 21MA, and if it tanks we will see $130 quickly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzuwwcomz3m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dcc9faf7bd76b4d9db04798b92834768c9b453a\n\n* $SAVA  3M in insider buys last month by directors and the chief medical  officer, if someone knows something about whether they pass the trials  or not, it would be this guy. more importantly, insiders sell for many  reasons but buy only for one, they think the stock will go up. low float  37M and 33% of float shorted, ran to $140 last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7mqj7jnz3m91.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=93cea75efe201e45fbfe83e6aaa7bf9974975e29\n\nTaking  ATM calls here for Jan20 23 might wait for a drop to $15.4 support  before an entry, but we are at 50MA on the daily, so might take a  starter there. if phase 2 final data is positive, we can expect to hit  $65 resistance at least, phase 3 data may be available in early 2023.  I'm taking my time with entries here and may go for a longer expiry.\n\nSo  if you made it this far, I'm guessing this is what have been waiting  for, this is largely under the radar, but could play out Tuesday, and  book us a big win!\n\n**Possible 10 bagger play for this week**\n\nSo  the $DWAC deadline to merge with truth social is Tuesday 09/06, if that  doesn't happen, which thanks to the SEC investigation it won't, the  stock dumps back to SPAC floor prices which is $10.\n\nNow  the reason it's not already there, is that they have shareholder vote  for an extension after market close, but they need 65% approval to get a  6-month extension. with most people unaware of this, it seems unlikely  it will happen.\n\nNot only that they  also have to put up $6m or $0.10 per share as collateral to get the  extension, which they don't get back if the merger doesn't go through.  we all know for political reasons will not go through in 6 months or  even a year.\n\nSo my play here is  $25p 9 Sep here, my thinking is that it won't pass. if it tanks to $10,  this could be a 10-bagger right there!\n\nAs  an important side note, please don't buy $10 puts, the floor price is  $10, and they will go to 0, even if the stock tanks to $10 because it  can't go below $10 (for the most part) so the market will price them as  worthless.\n\nAlright, so that's it  for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the  previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf  you have any questions let me know, non of this financial advice, check  my youtube channel, Twitter, and discord, they are free I don't sell  anything at all, and I'm getting very active across the board, all links  are in my profile.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!", "id": "x6s01x", "created_utc": 1662413634.0, "score": 343, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=x6s01x)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=x6s01x)\n    \nHey /u/Flimsy-Willow-3086, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "FYI: GTLB is Gitlab not GitHub labs.
