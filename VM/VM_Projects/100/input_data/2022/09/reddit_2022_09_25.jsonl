I'd add that you are not building an options portfolio like a stock portfolio.  Options trading is a shorter duration way of trading for income, often with varied stocks and strategies.\n\nMy suggestion is to paper trade and learn some strategies.  A good place to start is covered calls.  Find a good stock where you can buy 100 shares of the stock, then sell a CC for a strike above the net stock cost.  There is a lot of training online for CCs, so check it out, but it is a very basic and simple way of trading.  \n\nIf the stock moves up and is called away you profit from both the call premium and the stock value increase.\n\nIf the stock doesn't move up as much then you keep the premium and the stock to sell another CC to rinse and repeat as they say.  \n\nKeep track of the premiums to know the net stock cost and be sure to always sell CCs above that cost so it profits if called away.

{"title": "Buying the Stock-Market Dip Is Backfiring This Year", "selftext": "Share prices continue to plunge, denting a strategy that soared in popularity over the past decade\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-the-stock-market-dip-is-backfiring-this-year-11664064845?mod=hp_lead_pos1\n\nIt is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  \n\nInstead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.\n\nThe extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buy-the-dip trade, a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightning-fast pandemic recovery.\n\nMajor stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records, convincing many investors that any downturn would be short-lived—and an attractive opportunity to buy.\n\nThe trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.\n\nMany investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans’ behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. \n\nThe volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. \n\n“I’ve really been taking a beating,” said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. “I’m uncomfortable.” \n\nMr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market—including on Friday—only to see his positions quickly sour. \n\nOther investors said they are hanging on and haven’t yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. \n\n***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. \n\nU.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. \n\nYet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** \n\nMeanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders’ activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.\n\n***“The frenzied, frothy behavior isn’t there,” said Lule Demmissie, U.S. chief executive of the brokerage eToro. “But that long-term thesis of investing for the long term is.”***\n\nSome of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. \n\nOn Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed’s interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. \n\nThe ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. \n\nCaleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. \n\n“I fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,” he said. \n\nStill, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. \n\nMr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters’ college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. \n\n“I started off feeling very greedy,” Mr. Tafarella said. “I thought, I can probably turn this into $100K within a year.”\n\nSince then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. \n\nOne factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed’s rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.\n\nClaire de Weerdt, a 34-year-old consultant and business owner based near Vancouver, British Columbia, said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings, though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market. She has also parked some cash in a fixed-income investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession. Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  \n\n“I think it’d be silly to sell stocks,” Ms. de Weerdt said. ***“I don’t care what the markets are like in one or two years. I care what they’re like in 30 years.”***\n\n---\n\nI want to contrast this article with one posted earlier this year:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ummmp3/buy_the_dip_believers_are_tested_by_markets/\n\n>>Individuals’ willingness to backstop markets throughout this year’s selloff demonstrates that the group—for now—has been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.\n\nThis current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor.\n\nAlso, the CAPE is currently still at 27.  CAPE is simply the way Ben Graham uses PE ratios in the value school of investing, CAPE being an aggregate measure.  The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.\n\nhttps://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe", "id": "xnot88", "created_utc": 1664116047.0, "score": 751, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 591, "comments": [{"body": "It's backfiring this year if  your time horizon is....less than one year.", "score": 1782, "replies": [{"body": "This lol\n\nAverage recession length is 17 months, so half of all recessions are much longer than that.

With the \"art\" part of it being how you arrive at a discount rate using Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and some Risk Free Rate (RfR) of your liking. \n\nYou can set up an Excel sheet following a good tutorial on DCF and WACC. Once you have that setup it takes less than 5 mins to input the data required which is all callable directly inside Excel or Sheets and also publicly available at any finance website like Yahoo Finance.  I personally just scrape the data I need from FinViz directly into my template based on whatever ticker I enter. \n\nOnce I arrive at an intrinsic value (discounted 5 years or so out back to the present) I'll tack on a Margin of Safety of something like -25-40% based on macro market conditions. If the current stock price is below that price then it's a buy, with a ballpark expected return. \n\nThis is the basic \"value investing\" method for finding undervalued companies. For growth stocks there's other things to consider like momentum, cycle, PE and sector disruption. \n\nAnyhow, in this entire thread I haven't seen one comment mention what their expected or target CAGR is over whatever their time horizon is.  You always hear that \"the market\" returns, on average, ~6-8% YoY. But that's looking at the average over 100 years.  If you've got 40 years before you expect to draw on your investments it's not gonna matter that much what you do.  If you've got 20 years, +/- 1% can make a pretty significant difference.  (Not all redditors are 25-35 yrs old).  Plus, you never know what can happen, beyond the safety of your emergency fund, if you have an emergency fund. \n\nIf it sounds like I'm suggesting trying to \"beat the market\", I'm not.  Well, not technically. But I am interested in attempting to maximize my return on capital.  So any investment decision I make I'm going to be comparing it to \"the market\" , such as SPX.  If that's my benchmark, and I make an educated guess whether it will outperform or underperform in a given year or cycle, I'm willing to adjust my strategy vs blindly DCA into it.\n\nI have a shorter time horizon than what seems to be the median on here and other circumstances that have me taking this approach.  But my point is, it's worth taking a look at what you expect/hope/must get out of your investments.  The bulk of it is really just saving.  Nothing better than regularly saving a fixed % of your income esp as it grows over time.  But I like to look at the numbers such that, ok, if I save X amount per month for Y years, that's Z amount saved.  Then, if those savings were going into SPX and I expect a 8% CAGR over those years, that equals this much more above having just saved.  Well what if the RFR is projected to be 4% for the next 2 years? Is there an investment that can return more than the 4% above that that SPX would give me? Maybe another index is looking better at 5.5% or something.  What's the risk? Etc\n\nGranted, ends up being more active than most ppl want to be and doesn't guarantee better performance but I expect it to and hope it works out.  I look at some folks even older than me who only recently retired and the last year + inflation + prospects of a long sideways market is not being kind to their needs, when just a bit of portfolio optimization would have gone a long way YoY.   \n\nIn conclusion, bitcoin fixes this.  Nah, it doesn't, just playin'", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "The intrinsic value could be described as how much you would be fairly paying for a particular business to not sell it and instead run it. Understanding it like this, you can avoid the age old mistake of telling yourself you are buying long term and selling in a panic after you see it drop a lot in a pinch.\nBut to be more precise, how I calculate it changes from business to business, as a bank has different ratios than a factory production company, a chip maker or a retailer. The main point is to buy what you can understand and quantify, so buy a business you believe you could run, at a price you would be sure to get your money worth in business value. \nIf company A an average company in a sector you understand, say, an industrial with full integration and a fairly good chance that its costumers would not drop its products off if the prices kept growing over time with inflation, you have a chance to look at the companies earnings, and determine how much the business is worth by its Price/Earnings ratio. Let's say that the company has a growing revenue over a period of 20 years, but every 4 or 5 years it seems to drop a bit, and with it, it's price. This company would be a cyclical, with a 4 or 5 year cycle. This is quite common with car manufacturers, or other iron transformation industries. The way you would determine the price is like this: find the average earnings for the last long reasonable period, say at least 5 years, but preferably 10 or more and find the cagr if you still thing it is reasonable for the company to grow (when I say find, I actually want you to do some math as the numbers from websites vary wildly a d might not even have the same calculations you want to use) and now you have a large part to the intrinsic value formula I use for industrials. Say the company has debt, take note of how much net debt or net book value you se in its ballance sheet ad divide it by the number of shares. Now you can start the actual intrinsic value calculation: value = [[(avgPE 0 growth company) * 2CAGR]/ current interest rate] + net value of tangible assets per share - liabilities per share} \nSome explanations: for average PE of zero growth companies (over long periods of time) you should expect it to be 8.5 most of the time, so this can safely become used in most times you do this calculation.\nCAGR is the permanent rate of growth you expect for the holding period, and you multiply it by 2 in order to have it increased to simulate a long period of holding this stock. After that you take the cost of oportunity in the form of how much you could earn currently for companies graded as the one you are looking at. Why buy a stock if the bond yields a satisfying return and the stock doesn't?\nThis is not the only way, but this can be used in a broad selection of stocks, and to read more you can read the intelligent investor or security analysis. \nImportant note, what you can reasonably expect to earn is the difference between intrinsic value and what you pay below it. It might not work with just one stock, but in a portfolio of 20 it should more than suffice to be a good predictor of earnings.

Its not slowing, its still maintaining. \n\nDCA is still, by far, the most effective method for us low money investors, and that's going to hold true no matter what.

Depending on your marginal tax rate, this tax asset could be quite valuable. It may also allow you to realize large gains in the future without having to pay much or any tax (the realized losses would partially or fully offset the realized gains, and of course, return of capital is tax-free). \n\nIt may also help to keep in mind that shares represent an ownership stake in a real business which, like a farm, or an apartment complex, or a local McDonald's franchise, produces income year after year, and sends you a check representing your share of the profits. Some years are good and some are bad, but so long as the business produces a profit - even if it is lower than last year's - some portion of that is yours to keep. In most cases, one doesn't sell an otherwise-productive farm simply because the value of the real estate it's on went down, or because drought rendered the crop unusually sparse for the year. You might think of equity ownership in a similar way. \n\nTax-loss harvesting, as described above, is simply a house-keeping chore you can perform in taxable accounts to create a tax asset while maintaining your equity stake. It's less about selling for the sake of cashing out, and more about exchanging one equity position for a similar-but-not-identical equity position with similar performance in order to realize losses that can lower you tax burden or offset gains elsewhere in the portfolio.

The answer to which is : increase production. \n\nThis is basic basic basic economics. \n\nIn a market with many companies doing the same thing there are two strategies companies take. High volume low margins or low volume high margins. \n\nAn easy example is cars. Kia produces a high volume of cars with the lowest production cost and highest volume they can manage, with a low price to ensure demand will be high. Lamborghini and Ferrari produce fewer cars with as high a profit margin as they can possibly manage. This ensures lower demand and requires less production. But they remain profitable due to the high margins. \n\nThe concept is everywhere. Budweiser obtains profits with massive volume and low margins on their product. A company that sells $20K bottles of wine does the opposite. Which company is fulfilling the most peoples needs? When it comes to lifesaving drugs, do you want a budweiser situation or the other one?

I also think corporate tax should be adjustable based on the pay gap between CEO and average worker. Just like if we make big money fast we get higher taxes (short term cap gains), it's only fair.
