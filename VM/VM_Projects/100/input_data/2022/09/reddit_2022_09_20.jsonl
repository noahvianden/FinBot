They beat Lazada (backed by Alibaba) at their own game and kicked Lazada down to 2nd place. Shopee pay is not as dominant as say Mercado Pago because of the amount of competitors in the South East Asian E wallet space. Garena is a gaming company but it's been in decline since revenues have dropped since the Covid gaming boom. I believe SEA LTD is weaker and riskier than MELI but that is definitely reflected in the stock price and valuation.\n\nBoth MELI & Sea Ltd are very close to their historical lowest Price to Sales ratios and if there is a time to buy, it's now. They are pretty risky so I'm only comfortable with a small bite. Hope they turn into the Amazon/Alibaba of the future. I'm not big on Electric Vehicles because their valuations are still expensive. E-commerce/E-wallets may be boring, but they are proven to be essential to everyday life since that is usually the cheapest & easiest way to buy things/send money.\n\nI'm not that convinced by EVs as electric vehicles are optional and once people realize how much it costs to keep replacing their lithium batteries, the demand growth may not keep up. Also the scalability of EV production is IMO over estimated. There is a limit to global Lithium/rare earth mineral production. EV company prices are still taking into account huge growth rates and high scalability. I am not convinced. I prefer to stick to tried and true working business models.\n\nSemiconductors are very cyclical and also it requires in depth technical knowledge to be able to make good decisions IMO. Intel vs AMD is difficult, I don't know enough about semis to be confident that Intel can make a comeback. I also don't know if AMD & TSMC can keep growing at their break neck pace. If I had to pick one, I'd go with boring- Micron. I'm not buying at the moment but it it drops below 50 and is close to a P/B ratio of 1 I'll take a small piece.  Memory/Ram is basically a commodity with only 3 big players. It is still very cyclical, but it's predictable and Micron has been through enough cycles that I'm confident it can survive a semicon oversupply.\n\nMetaverse is a crap shoot. VR adoption is not as fast as many people expected and it's quite under the radar now. META is super cheap in valuation. At this price, I like the risk/reward. Even if the Metaverse flops, growth can still come from monetizing Whatsapp & Instagram. I see that they are planning to roll out grocery purchases through Whatsapp in India. Having Whatsapp as a Global super app is a huge monetization opportunity that Meta hasn't tapped yet. It seems that they are finally following in Wechat's (Tencent) foot steps.

First off, the people using P/E clearly don't understand the purpose of P/E. You don't use P/E to measure the profitability of a company that isn't quite designed to be as profitable as possible. This same reason is why many of you would have never bought Apple, Amazon, etc., at their early stages and would have made enough $ to retire by now. \n2. \"BUT THEIR MARKET CAP IS HIGHER THAN ALL THE OTHER AUTOMAKERS COMBINED.\" That's because traditionally, auto companies have never been valued highly in the market. Why? Because it's a low-growth business... the market was saturated with ICE vehicles, no differentiation between products, and a lack of innovation. Hence, people didn't really care for the auto companies in the markets. It was boring and while they made good profit that was being distributed via dividends, people largely stayed away from auto companies. Just look a their historical stock performance... the ATH for Ford was two decades ago. And a lot of you might not realize this but in 2008, GM and Chrysler got hit badly. Why? Because consumer financing with a broken economy meant GM and Chrysler had a pile of debt that consumers couldn't pay off. These auto companies are highly leveraged. A bad economy means they will have piles of vehicles that consumers can't afford to finance again.\n3. Tesla changed the auto industry. This is undeniable. Ask yourself, when was the last time the auto industry was this interesting? When was the last time you saw these auto companies actually start to innovate? Never, until Tesla shook the market. And that's why people are betting highly on Tesla. They're the ones innovating in a brand new industry. And yes, EV's are a brand new industry. It's why auto companies are spending billions trying to revamp or create new manufacturing plants. It's why they are having huge supply chain shortages particularly for EV's. It's why GM had to pause sales on their Chevy Bolt for over 7 months because they had an exploding battery issue. New industry, not the same as ICE. Same way renewable energy products are different from oil. Both can be used as energy generation fuel but they are entirely different in composition. Ford's CEO even openly admits that they are trying to copy Tesla. GM's CEO, Mary Barra, her entire EV strategy is literally what Tesla did..... like 6 years ago.\n4. What's the P/E of VW, Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, etc., if you only include their EV segment? Because that's what matters here and that is what many of you are are missing. Tesla isn't in the business of competing against other EV companies as much as they are in the business of taking market share from ICE companies. Right now, outside of luxury EV models such as the Porsche Taycan, there are no profitable EV's other than Tesla's. And it will be that way for many more years. So if you're going to be fair and start comparing P/E of these EV initiatives, at least look at the broader comparison. Why compare ICE vehicles, a dying industry, to EV vehicles? Look across the board: Almost every auto company in the world are looking to stop selling ICE vehicles by 2040 (latest). California already plans to ban ICE sales by 2035. Using the P/E and market cap of an ICE company to compare against an EV company is the same logic as saying 'Why buy Apple stock when they released the iPhone instead of Nokia?' They both sold phones and Nokia had a much larger revenue/profit than Apple at that time. There were many Apple pessimists who made such claims... stating that no one wanted a touch screen phone, it's a fad, it won't last, etc., \n5. Tesla already has the highest margins in the auto business outside of exotic luxury vehicles. Think about it from this perspective: While other auto companies lose money for every EV they sell, Tesla makes the highest in the industry for every EV they sell. That's because Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto company in the world dating back to the fact that many of their parts couldn't be purchased elsewhere and they had to use cost-saving measures due to the fact that they were on the verge of bankruptcy. That mindset led to Tesla constantly innovating in engineering. Their gigaStamp is a revolutionary process in creating the vehicle chassis and significantly reduces costs. Even the car seats are made by Tesla. The software, made by Tesla. Batteries are made by Tesla and with strong emphasis on 4680, they will likely be one of the biggest battery makers in the future as well. Auto companies historically do not do this type of shit. They are just assembly lines. They get the parts and build the car. While that's a good thing for ICE, it's a bad thing for EV's. Software is the biggest key here. VW recently came out and stated that their software will likely be outsourced to Apple instead... AKA, Apple Carplay. They don't even know how to improve their software. Meanwhile, Tesla is capable of creating software allowing them to play Steam games, push OTA updates to perform self-driving features, improve vehicle performance, improve firmware for their cameras. Much like how you would buy a laptop or phone, the software capabilities for a vehicle will largely be the differentation as competition increases.\n6. Tesla is already going to be the most profitable auto company in the U.S. by this year. By next year, they will be the most profitable auto company in the world. For reference, Tesla only became profitable on an annual basis in 2020. So in a span of five years, they would have went from being unprofitable to being the most profitable auto company. The numbers are insane when you look at it... Per vehicle sold, Tesla is already the most profitable company. Automakers like VW and Toyota largely made vehicles that are low profit-per-unit but they earn money through high volume. If they can't push towards more EV sales in the future, they are going to be toast. BMW and Benz are high profit automakers. Yet, neither of them sell any EV's that are affordable compared to their ICE version. The performance of those ICE versions also significantly outperform their EV's so in a sense, there is no incentive to purchase their EV's currently. Toyota doesn't even believe in BEV's. They are still of the mindset that hydrogen fuel is the way to go because after spending billions of $, they are too stubborn to admit it was a failure. All they push out are Hybrids and they did so because they wanted to meet the regulatory standards and not be hit with a carbon tax. They are falling BEHIND..... So let me guess, Tesla is a cult? In two years, they will be the most profitable automaker in the world while selling a product (EV's) that other automakers will  be losing money selling. Sign me up!\n7. I've been investing in Tesla since 2014... Believe me, the amount of criticism that Tesla gets today pales in comparison to what they received in 2018 when they were on the verge of bankruptcy. This is peanuts. It went from, 'EV's are a fad, Tesla can't mass manufacture EV's, they will be bankrupt, they're only profitable because of regulatory credits, other competition is coming (Oh, really, the same automakers who pledge to go fully EV in 15 years but the competition is coming...?). Heard it all by now. This isn't anything new. \n8. Not even going to go on about their energy storage capabilities, supercharging network, AI expertise (currently the largest AI company in the world), robotics (watch their AI event next week), Tesla insurance, no dealership model, FSD, etc.,... Those are things you can either choose to believe or not believe in. I'm more focused on the fact that they are the only company even willing to engage in all of this. That shows me a company that is constantly innovating. The very fact Tesla does all this while other automakers don't should tell you one thing: They don't have the expertise nor are they focused on shareholder value. Hence, why auto companies have been terrible performers in the stock market for the past two decades until Tesla ignited the EV formula and now you're seeing companies like BYD, NIO, XPENG, LUCID, RIVIAN, etc., all pop up trying to take market from the ICE segment. Remember, they are not competing against each other as much as they are competing for the ICE sales.\n\nThis dude runs a company that builds rockets and wants to take civilization to Mars....

There are limitations on what can be done in producing batteries based off of how much lithium can be mined. Unfortunately, lithium is going to be the best electro-chemical battery we can get, so I wouldn't expect huge jumps there unless we find a new form of storing electric charge. This also limits the utility of electric vehicles, so an actual electric Semi won't make any sense at all either-\n\nBattery Storage issues: https://youtu.be/3K43XC9J82Q\n\nSemi issues: https://youtu.be/56862W24HK8\n\nLithium production issues: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/electric-vehicles-world-enough-lithium-resources/\n\nIn regards to AI: for an autonomous humanoid robot, you have a lot of hurdles to overcome to pull off compared to autonomous driving. Both are very difficult, but the pure number of tasks, communication requirements, and environments puts a humanoid robot servant in an entirely different league requiring a very general AI compared to the specialized one you can create for autonomous driving. You have a lot of the same basic problems to solve of navigating environments, but a humanoid robotic servant also has to solve tool usage, communication, a more accurate and general form of object recognition, balance, and finer control of everything they do. You wouldn't grab an egg with the same force you would grab a vacuum cleaner. Even on the subject of vacuum cleaners, you either have to make a custom one, and a set of custom tools, for that specific robot or have a general enough AI to be able to learn how to plug it in, turn it on, adjust settings on the vacuum cleaner itself to the specific environment, know what specific obstacles to avoid in order to not jam up the vacuum cleaner, etc. Then to boot they also have to learn other tools and similar rulesets. Autonomous driving is not anywhere near as difficult as making a robotic servant because it's so much more specialized.

But a few stocks do so well that buying an index to make sure you get the good ones will give pretty good risk-adjusted returns on average.\n\nMost investing these days is some kind of indexing, but for people who are picking stocks, you really have to remember that this is what returns look like. The goal isn't to buy the good half of the market. The goal is to make sure you absolutely buy at least one, or maybe a couple, of the great performing companies. And then don't buy too many average companies (stinkers) to water down your returns. The biggest mistake any investor can do is to pick stocks in a way that misses all, or significantly underweights, the few good companies.\n\nAnd the truth is that some people are going to recognize great companies before most people, and they're going to pile in and invest a huge percent of their portfolio in these companies. And that's going to start driving the price up \"early\" (before the financial statements show the results of their good management/engineering/IP/branding/etc.). And it'll make the best companies look \"overvalued\" for two reasons:\n\n* Investors who rely on ratios will be looking at the price compared to past metrics and will underestimate the potential growth/returns that really great companies can deliver\n* Investors will compare the great companies to average companies and wonder why the average companies look so cheap in comparison (it's because they're stinkers)\n\nUnless you're insanely early, you're almost always going to have to pay a premium to own the stock of a great company compared to an average company. That's because we're competing against experts with a ton of knowledge and resources and data and some of them are going to spot these great companies before we do, and they're going to buy and buy and buy.\n\nAlso, if you expect all companies to perform about as well as an average company (plus or minus an order of magnitude maybe) then it's easy to think you've missed the boat. For example, lots of people saw Tesla 10x between 2012 and 2014 and thought they'd missed the big returns. Getting 10x from an average company is an amazing return, but getting 10x from the handful of great companies in the market is just the beginning. People thought the same thing about Tesla when it 10x'd again in 2020, they thought they'd missed all the good returns and so now they're seeing Tesla strongly outperform the market again and are wondering what's going on because there's no way *most* companies could ever deliver those kinds of great returns after the run-up we've seen the last couple years.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is one of the easiest and simplest answer to give. There are currently many uncertainties in the broader market right now due to the state of the economy and inflation.

A valuation of a company is based on many many forces in the market, its industry, itself, etc. The force of evolution in the auto market is relatively strong compared to the general market. So other companies, their value is going down because of these uncertainty and most of the companies you mentioned are mature, and therefore is more exposed to these effects than a company that is part of an evolution / revolution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla's growth trajectory in terms of sales is one of the most reliable in today's market. As in the last year, despite the many supply chain issues plaguing the whole industry, both EV and legacy auto, Tesla still managed to grow by 40-50% or more. No other car company in the world is doing this consistently quarter by quarter like Tesla, in fact no other company. This is because of this revolution that Tesla has spearheaded and it has become the main beneficiary of this revolution and downturn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink of it this way, when the world decided to adopt cellphones, or touchscreen phones, did the state of the economy prevented these things to happen?

Namely INTC failed miserably when it came to the 7nm processor.  As a result since they were vertically integrated going back to the drawing board basically killed them, since that meant they had to re-tool the fabs (which they owned and operated) which not only takes years, but costs a shit ton of money.\n\nAMD didn't have to deal with any of that, TSMC makes their chips.\n\nIt got so bad, that Intel is now going to TSMC for chip manufacturing.  Nvidia is attempting a similar strategy by releasing the Founders Editions and the failed aquistion of ARM.\n\nThe problem is that Nvidia may be running into serious issues with distribution. Huge issues actually.\n\nFor one, the allocation of resources traditionally would fall on the shoulders of the AIBs.  With one of the biggest and most well known AIBs out of the picture (EVGA) they'll have to pick up the slack when it not only comes to that, but also dealing with the end product experience.\n\nWhile before they had to deal with the Founder Editions, which was a premium product, they now will have to deal with a larger swath. That means higher than anticipated costs in manufacturing (energy prices going up, rare earth minerals are more in demand) and also in distribution. Not just with retailers and vendors either, we are talking about everything from warranties, to bugs and defects.\n\nWhile before they could easily offload this to their AIBs, if they become the main source of manufacturing then they will also have to take this part of the business on.   As seen by the exit of EVGA more AIBs may see this as a moment of leverage to move against Nvidia as well, which means that Nvidia may have to either give up control to the AIBs which can translate to less profits.\n\nFinally, the AI and data center markets are largely going to require cheap chips, not expensive chips. It's what made Nvidia so good at AI in the first place.  AI requires a lot of simple calculations done very, very quickly. Similar to bitcoin mining.  Which again, is why GPUs are so excellent. They are great for executing simple commands, at very large volumes, at very high speeds. \n\nThe question is will the market want to spend a premium for a card/chip that can do that? Or will another manufacturer that is a bit slower, that can handle maybe fewer processes become more relevant.\n\nDon't forget, AMD still isn't the fastest, Intel is, but plenty of people like the price point, the easy upgradibilty of the echo system around the CPU and are perfectly having a slower chip with more cores to deal with the the tasks they have.\n\nWhich is why the ARM deal was such a huge deal. They would have basically owned the low end and the high end of the market. Hence why it was rejected as well.\n\nSo Nvidia has lost its value for good reason, also similar to Intel.\n\nLeaning too heavily on vertical integration and the failure to implement their strategy being the main ones.  Same things Intel did.  \n\nAlso, and this is a big one, cloud computing is more and more viable and mobile gaming is the largest sectors of the gaming market.  Meaning that if Nvidia can't penetrate those markets then the decline is inevitable.\n\nYou don't need an Nvidia chip to play Candy Crush (which is one of the most profitable games still today, literally over a billion dollars *per year*).

Which is why I could see why they went so hard after it.  \n\nThe question is what are they going to do now?  Stick with GPUs?  If that's the case, will they go into manufacturing? If so, then what happens to the AIBs, will they part ways like EVGA?  \n\nIt would reduce costs greatly, but at the same time, it would bring up a bunch of issues from distribution, to allocating resources.\n\nTo give you an example, Apple has teams dedicated to finding sources for materials for manufacturing.  They also have a tremendous amount of power in marketing and in the past had a stellar repuatation for the end user experience.  That took a long while to take off and it was under the vision of Jobs.

Now that is gone, are they willing to risk the value of the brand on the shoulders of manufacturers like MSI or Gigabyte? Are they willing to take that onto their shoulders if they make their own cards that become the majority of the cards out there?\n\nBecause you better if you're selling a single piece of hardware that costs more than the latest and greatest smartphone or other pieces of consumer tech out there that can do thousands of things, while your GPU can only do one.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Thanks for the detailed answer.

They have to keep the cost down for consoles to be affordable.

Your comment that they can just use more, less efficient chips does hold up because of the electricity cost to run the chips AND cool the data center. Data Centers need the most efficient and powerful chips to keep the Electricity costs down.  The hardware is a one time cost.  The power cost is re-occurring and becomes a huge deal. If NVDA chips are so much better that you need 10 of their GPUs for a certain application but would need 15 that were less efficient/powerful that is 1.5x or more the power usage which is a re-occuring cost.\n\nThe other major item is that individual companies like Amazon, Google etc should NOT be developing their own chips unless it is a competitive advantage for their business and something they can monetize.  Let's say for a minute they could do it.  Once you account for the lower number of chips they would make and the ongoing support costs around new versions, code updates etc you will very quickly reach a point where making your own chips is more expensive per unit because you are spreading the R&D across fewer units.\n\nThe other big issue with other companies trying to make their own chips is they will need someone like TSMC to make the chips.  TSMC is already producing at  full capacity so you would need to wait for more capacity to come online or pay a lot more to buy the capacity to support making your chips.\n\nThere are HUGE barriers to entry in the Semiconductor space especially if you make your own chips.  It takes tens of  billions and years to get a foundry up and running.\n\nAapl decided to make their own chips because they sell enough units to make it worth while because they are consumer facing products and have magnitudes more than a data center would have.

Huang currently serves as the company’s CEO, Malachowsky remains a senior executive and Priem retired from the company in 2003.\n\nNVIDIA invented the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in 1999, a high-performance processor that generates interactive graphics for virtual reality, high performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNVIDIA reported its first $1bn-revenue quarter in 2007 and shipped its 1 billionth graphics processor in 2011.\n\nIn September 2020, the company announced plans to acquire UK chip designer Arm from Japanese investment firm SoftBank (9984) for $40bn. However, the deal collapsed under opposition from UK regulatory authorities, with NVIDIA announcing the termination of the transaction on 7 February 2022.\n\nOn 6 May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreed a $5.5m settlement with NVIDIA over the company’s failure to disclose in 2018 that cryptocurrency mining was a significant source of revenues from sales of its GPUs designed for gaming.\n\nNVIDIA stock slumps on as trade war compounds slowdown\n\nBased on NVDA stock historical prices, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $334.12 on 29 November 2021, with lockdowns around the world increasing demand for computing and entertainment systems. The stock had been trading around $51 in March 2020 at the start of pandemic-related restrictions.\n\nThe share price began to retreat as technology stocks sold-off heading into 2022. NVDA started the year at $301.21 a share and dropped to $219.44 on 27 January. It rebounded to $267.05 on 9 February and $286.56 on 29 March, but began to fall sharply in April as analysts started to downgrade the stock on signs of slowing consumer demand for GPUs and concerns about the impact of high inflation.\n\nTechnology stocks have borne the brunt of stock market selloffs, as central banks, including the US Federal Reserve (Fed), have begun aggressively raising interest rates and some investors have shifted from stocks to fixed-income assets.\n\nThe NVDA share price fell to the $161 level in May and despite an uptick to $195.92 in June, continued to decline, reaching $145.23 on 1 July. The stock rose to $192.15 on 4 August, but was unable to hold at that level.\n\nOn 24 August, NVIDIA reported revenue for its fiscal second quarter ended 31 July of $6.7bn, up 3% from the same period in 2021, but down 19% from the previous quarter. Earnings per share fell to $0.26, down by 72% from a year earlier and 59% lower than the previous quarter.\n\nJensen Huang said:\n\n“We are navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment and we will get through this.”\n\nThe share price rose from $171.81 on 23 August to $179.13 on 25 August, but at least 14 Wall Street analysts downgraded their ratings on the stock on 25 August amid expectations of lower projected growth, weighing on the share price as investors sold the stock in response. The share price ended the month at $150.94.\n\nNVDA dropped to $139.37 on 1 September in response to an SEC filing that the US government had informed the company on 26 August of a new license requirement for exports to China and Russia for the company’s A100 and H100 integrated circuits and any products that incorporate them.\n\nThe government indicated that the license is intended to “address the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a ‘military end use’ or ‘military end user’ in China and Russia.”\n\nNVIDIA said that it “does not sell products to customers in Russia,” but “the new license requirement may impact the Company's ability to complete its development of H100 in a timely manner or support existing customers of A100 and may require the Company to transition certain operations out of China.”\n\nBased on the outlook NVIDIA provided for its third fiscal quarter in its results on 24 August, approximately $400m in potential sales to China could be subject to the new license requirement, the company said in the filing.\n\nThe NVDA share price subsequently dropped to $134.65 on 6 September, its lowest level since March 2021. The stock then ticked higher to close at $139.90 on 8 September.\n\nWhat is the outlook for the NVIDIA share price after the selloff? Can it rebound or will it remain under pressure? Let’s look at some future predictions from analysts.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts downgraded their stock expectations in response to the US government’s licensing requirements.\n\nAnalysts at Sanford C. Bernstein lowered their price target to $180 from $210 on 1 September. On 2 September, Daiwa Capital Markets reduced its target to $133 from $215, downgrading the stock from outperform to neutral, while Needham & Company lowered its stock projection to $170 from $185.\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank declined to provide a forecast until there are more details available, noting:\n\n“At a time when demand uncertainties are already rising across the semi sector, and rapidly expanding from Consumer markets to the Data Center, we expect these new trade restrictions to add additional investor angst regarding chip demand/growth prospects. We expect the impact on NVDA to be largest amongst the US processor companies, given the company’s leadership position in HPC/AI.”\n\nWhen evaluating any NVIDIA stock 5-year forecast, you should keep in mind that analysts’ forecasts can be wrong.

Like not prioritizing who gets to sell when prices are high, forcing the general public to wait for prices to come back down before they get a chance to sell. Fraud prevention and data verification.
