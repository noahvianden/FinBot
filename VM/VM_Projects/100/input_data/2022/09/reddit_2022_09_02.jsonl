This was the second-biggest increase ever, according to data from the Federal Reserve.\n\n\"Remember the savings glut problem? No more. Covid helicopter cash taught people to spend again, and it's addictive. Winter coming,\" Burry added.\n\n\"Winter coming\" seems to refer to the HBO series “Game of Thrones.\" Characters used the phrase as a warning.\n\nNearly three weeks later, the financier did it again with a very gloomy prediction for the markets.\n\nIndeed, he seems to say that a stock market collapse is a matter of when, not whether.\n\n\"And yet I keep getting asked 'wen crash?'\" Burry tweeted on Aug. 31, with a Bloomberg chart showing the movements of the S&P 500 since 2017. \n\nOn the graph he highlighted the fact that the stock market benchmark has fallen 18% since its high in December.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ylesvnt1zfl91.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf3c14901cb5bfc6c3b24cd60a1702cc36be6c00\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/ccz5l78wzfl91.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=774ab77bacf2778bd54ee467bf19a1ca04b3c152](https://preview.redd.it/ccz5l78wzfl91.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=774ab77bacf2778bd54ee467bf19a1ca04b3c152) \n\n**Burry Has Already Been Right This Year**\n\nBurry seems to feel that a stock crash is shortly going to happen.

At last check the index was around 3,908; from there his call would be a drop of 52%.\n\n\"Re: paradigm shifts/speculative peaks, the SP500 bottomed 13% lower than 2002's bottom in 2009, 17% lower than 1998's \\[Long Term Capital Management\\] crisis low in 2002, and 10% lower than 1970's low in 1975. 15% lower than the covid low is SPX 1,862 \\~Shiller PE of 16, nominal PE of 9. In historic range,\" the  Scion Asset Management chief executive posted on Twitter on May 3.\n\nThe cause of his pessimism is that the \"greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things\" has been created since summer 2021.
