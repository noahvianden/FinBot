Its pretty engaging from a point of view of someone who loves storytellers. Or the special he said he didn't know how he was going to bring it together but he drew a piece of paper out of fishbowl and it said \"Kick her in the pussy\" And you forget about it until the very end and he expertly fuckin ties it all together and says, if I ever saw her, I would kick her in the pussy.

You could argue Forbes was presumptuous, even fantastical in their estimations, but there weren't really any facts they were overlooking. \n\nForbes never contended he actually had liquid money or assets, they were assessing his net worth based on the calculated worth of the endorsement deals he lost post antisemitic insanity.

We don’t though, the list of owners of $500m+ yachts isn’t very long and would be very easy to cross reference. If journalists and governments could not identify the owner using this information, it is safe to say it was unaccounted for previously. Unless you have information that they do not, in which case you should present it at this time.\n\nNo, it isn't, because we could certainly know whoever the owner is has such a yacht without knowing it's specifically the one seized. \n\nI have plenty of sound logic you do not, but that's nothing new. \n\n>There are, I just didn’t think I would need to point out every example. Plenty of non-western billionaires have undisclosed assets look at China’s political party members and business tycoons or unknown cryptocurrency wallets. There is nothing new or novel about untraced assets. There is plenty of documentation of this happening for centuries.\n\nThe existence of such undisclosed assets is not proof of other such assets. That's basic logic. If there are, it is not proven by having located these assets. If you want to contend Alisher Usmanov, or any other particular oligarch, dictator, whatever, has anything else hidden, you would need proof of that ownership, which has been the point the whole time. If you don't have it, you're in no position to confidently say any such person has a Forbes list-topping fortune. It's just conjecture. \n\n>I’m sure this isn’t news to you, rendering this a bad faith argument.\n\nMy whole point is that I, nor you for that matter, know to what extent, if any, there are other hidden assets, hence why speculation about obscene hidden riches is pointless, which you've agreed to, so more \"I know you are but what am I?\" is even more idiotic\n\n>Ad hom\n\nNope, see above. \n\n>Your entire tirade only included one valid argument and it’s been rebutted.\n\nYour entire rant include not one single rebuttal or effective argument. You've clearly misunderstood the argument from ignorance fallacy and don't have the decency to admit you confused the fallacy with the dictionary definition of ignorance.\n\nYou created straw men such as \"you said you can't prove a negative\" which I never did, and conveniently forgot to mention those asides again after I pointed out what you misunderstood. \n\nYou failed to demonstrate why anyone should speculate about other hidden assets based on uncovered hidden assets, and you shifted the goal posts on what you were contending, such as the ignorance inherent in Forbes' calculations when called out.\n\n>Everything else was an ad hominem, red herring, or strawman. \n\nNope, explained why you're wrong several times. See above. \n\n>You present yourself to be an expert on logical fallacies\n\nNo, I pointed out where the argument was committing logical fallacies. I don't need to be an expert to do that. Go ahead, link to where I \"presented myself as an expert\". I'll wait until my teeth fall out because you never will. Now that's ad hom.\n\n>yet you commit them at a higher rate than anyone else in this thread. Please stop.\n\nTell you what, stop making things up and I'll stop raking you over the coals for your poor logic and equally poor conclusions. Deal?\n\n>I’m trying to have a productive point-counterpoint conversation\n\nNo, you're not, and insisting you are repeatedly won't make it so. \n\n>not something that more closely resembles an argument between children on the playground.\n\nThen stop being such a child.

You need to find new business models and products, but for social media your products cannibalize eachother. People only have so much attention to give per day and so much patience for ads. If you have the ONLY social media platform people that currently use (think 5 years ago), then all you can do is go down as more competition (Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter) takes your customers attention away. Cheap money and passive 401k investors and pipe dreams let them carry on for five years longer than they should have. \n\nThey did they only thing they could do - slap a device (oculus) on their social media platform to try and extract more dollars than ad revenue from each user, and expand their platform so that more people could use it more often (at work, when you shouldn’t be on social media). \n\nAmazon is similar. If they didn’t have AWS now they would be wholly fucked. If they don’t find another thing like AWS that can scale immensely, that everyone uses (think healthcare sized), they are also fucked.

Instead, she’s been scooping up shares of the struggling cryptocurrency exchange in the wake of the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.\n\nWood’s Ark Investment Management funds have bought more than 1.3 million shares of Coinbase since the start of November, worth about $56 million based on Monday’s trading price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shopping spree, which started just as FTX’s demise began, has boosted Ark’s total holdings by roughly 19% to about 8.4 million shares. That equates to around 4.7% of Coinbase’s total outstanding shares.\n\nCoinbase initially rebounded in the days following Ark’s first purchase on Nov. 8, due in large part to softer-than-expected US inflation data which sent risk-assets surging globally. That rally, however, was short-lived for the crypto exchange, with its stock price falling for four consecutive days, including an 8.9% drop on Monday to close at a fresh record low.\n\nThe majority of Ark’s Coinbase holdings are from its flagship ARK Innovation ETF which has nearly 6 million shares for a weighting of about 3.6%, the fund’s 13th largest position. While the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF and ARK Fintech Innovation ETF each only hold just over 1 million shares, Coinbase’s weighting in the two funds is far higher at 5.4% and 6.3% respectively, according to data on Ark’s website.\n\nArk’s renewed interest in Coinbase stands in stark contrast to the sentiment emanating from Wall Street for the better part of the last six months. Analysts from firms including Bank of America and Daiwa Securities have downgraded the stock this month, leaving it with just 14 buy-equivalent analyst recommendations, its lowest number since August 2021.\n\nRead more: FTX Collapse Is Shaking Wall Street’s Conviction in Coinbase\n\nWood has also been adding to stakes in other crypto-related assets in recent weeks. Her ARK Next Generation Internet ETF purchased more than 315,000 shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust last week as its discount relative to the value of its underlying cryptocurrency continues to widen. That buying was followed later in the week by a purchase of about 140,000 shares of crypto bank Silvergate Capital Corp.\n\nThe increased buying comes as cryptocurrecy-exposed stocks have plunged this year amid a deep selloff by tokens including Bitcoin and Ether. Coinbase and Silvergate Capital have both shed more than 80% of their value this year. Those losses are even deeper than those suffered by the world’s two largest cryptocurrenices -- their prices have declined by more than 65% in 2022 with the plunge accelerating this month in the wake of the FTX collapse.\n\nThe Coinshares Block Index, which tracks 45 global stocks with varying exposure to the cryptocurrency sector, fell 2.5% Monday.", "id": "z1ieuh", "created_utc": 1669085648.0, "score": 706, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 366, "comments": [{"body": "She’s betting on Crypto surviving this mess and Coinbase being the last exchange standing", "score": 881, "replies": [{"body": "Which isn’t a bad bet tbh.

Shares rose as much as 1% in extended trading following the announcement.\n\nHP is the latest technology company to announce its intent to slim down given economic challenges. Facebook parent Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce are among those that have made similar changes. HP is responding after a deterioration in the sales of computers, which followed brought on by the Covid pandemic, where people rushed to buy computers to work and play from their homes.\n\nIn a statement, HP said it expects the changes to result in annualized gross run rate savings of at least $1.4 billion in the next three years, with around $1 billion in costs including restructuring. Of that $1 billion, $600 million will come in the fiscal 2023 fiscal year, which ends Oct. 31, 2023. The rest will be split evenly between the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years, HP said.\n\nAs of October 2021, HP had around 51,000 employees. In 2019 HP announced that it would eliminate between 7,000 and 9,000 employees.\n\nHP said revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, declined 0.8% year over year to $14.80 billion. Revenue in the Personal Systems segment, which includes PCs, fell 13% to $10.3 billion, as units dropped 21%. Consumer revenue in the segment slid 25%. Printing revenue, at $4.5 billion, was down 7%, as units fell 3%.\n\nIn the previous quarter, Personal Systems revenue declined 3%, and Printing revenue moved down 6%.\n\nAlso on Tuesday HP announced downbeat earnings guidance.\n\nThe company provided a range of adjusted fiscal first quarter earnings from 70 cents to 80 cents per share, below the consensus of 86 cents among analysts polled by Refinitiv.\n\nFor the 2023 fiscal year, HP called for $3.20 to $3.60 in adjusted earnings per share, below the Refinitiv consensus of $3.62 per share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/hp-laying-off-4000-6000-employees-globally-over-the-next-three-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/hp-laying-off-4000-6000-employees-globally-over-the-next-three-years.html)", "id": "z26c8b", "created_utc": 1669154136.0, "score": 2274, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 198, "comments": [{"body": "They're doing it over the next 3 years because it takes forever to print all the firing letters using HP printers", "score": 597, "replies": [{"body": "And their subscription for said printer costs more than the staff they’re sacking.", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "whoever came up with the idea of ink subscriptions deserves a special place in hell", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "The money is in the ink.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "\"Sorry, I only accept firing letters in cyan...\"", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Zing", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "sigh.. upvote lol", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol, I do like my HP laserjet, but especially if thier using one of the inkjets, you arent kidding.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "One of the best things I’ve ever done was buy a laser printer.

Streaming Services ain't what they used to be.\nTake a look at the Netflix ticker or Disney's losses in the streaming sector and it should be obvious to everyone that streaming services require more than ho-hum original content to survive. \n\nDisney made the mistake of thinking that because people like Disney content, they'll pay for a DVD player that only plays Disney content. A large number of people will, but making and maintaining that line of DVD players isn't easy or free.\n\n4. Political BS\nWhether you think Disney's gone too woke or conservative parents are hypersensitive bigots, it doesn't matter. The fact is there is a segment of the population that doesn't trust Disney to provide safe content to their children... which is like the whole reason Disney exists.\n\n5. Bob Iger is a genius.

{"title": "VIX is Broken -> What comes next.....................", "selftext": "Anyone who has been following the VIX knows that it's not acting normal right now.\n\nSince markets bottomed in March 2009, the S&P 500 and the VIX have consistently maintained an inverse correlation, with the volatility index typically drifting steadily lower as equities powered to new highs (think 2017, when the VIX fell into single digits amid steady stock market gains) while bouts of volatility and short-lived selloffs in the stock market saw the VIX spike higher. Digging into this relationship deeper, when stocks made new meaningful lows below exceptional support levels, the VIX would almost always rise to new highs beyond those that corresponded with the previous lows in stocks. \n\nFor example, as the S&P 500 (SPX) dropped below the lows from late 2018 (2,346) during the Q1 ’20 Covid-19 crash, which carried the index down to 2,191, the VIX blasted through the late-2018 high of 36.20 and peaked at a staggering 85.47. The uncertainty associated with the first pandemic in 100 years certainly amplified the move higher in the VIX in that example, but it does illustrate the point of the traditional inverse correlation between stocks and the VIX very well.\n\nNow, the actual formula and process used to calculate the VIX is very complex and involves some high-level math, but in the simplest terms, the index measures price activity, mainly demand, in the options market. That is why in normal market conditions, the VIX rises amid increasing demand for puts as the broader stock market declines, and this is also the reason it is often referred to as the market's “fear gauge.”\n\nBut at both of the most recent major market peaks that occurred in 2000 and then again in 2007/2008, that historically consistent inverse correlation between the stock market and the VIX broke down as new meaningful lows in the S&P 500 were not met with new highs in the VIX. And it has happened again this year. \n\n**The logical question to ask here is: why would this happen?**\n\nAs stocks make new meaningful lows, as they first did in February, then again in May and June of this year, sophisticated investors were actually liquidating long-term, long equity positions as opposed to holding those positions and just adding hedges to manage risk and downside exposure.\n\nSo, what we are seeing in the VIX and the S&P 500 right now is the same thing we saw in both 2000/2001 and 2007/2008 in the early stages of those respective bear markets. And the bad news is that this dynamic only persists during the “distribution phase” of market cycles when sophisticated investors are liquidating to retail investors attempting to “buy one more dip.” Once the VIX finally breaks the downtrend of “lower highs” and begins to move meaningfully higher, the real breakdown and capitulation in stocks begin.\n\nLooking at the dot-com bubble, the downtrend in the VIX was broken in September 2001, and the S&P 500 proceeded to decline another 30% or so, as the VIX ripped higher, finally bottoming in late 2002. During the financial crisis, the VIX downtrend was not broken until September 2008, and the S&P 500 fell another 47% to the March 2009 lows (of course, the VIX ripped higher as well).\n\n**Algorithm Data:**\n\n**Set to start buying at 4247**\n\n**Set to start dumping at 3857**\n\n**That does NOT seem bullish to me.**\n\nEDIT: I'd also like to note that the SOFR rate was higher than the 10 year treasury rate today.  That is weird!  Banks are getting a higher rate to park their money overnight with the Fed than buying 10 year treasuries?  Last time this happened was January 2020.\n\nTL;DR: The bottom isn't in, and this bear market is just getting started.  Institutional investors have liquidated their long equity positions to retail so they aren't buying puts as a hedge which means the VIX isn't properly gauging the fear in the market.\n\n[Not a perfect downtrend but we're still in the process of making lower highs since the start of the year.](https://preview.redd.it/t46vm8ulji1a1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=33636cbd067e48ef414fc8db525df18551393dfa)", "id": "z1ukr9", "created_utc": 1669126305.0, "score": 362, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|219|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z1ukr9)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z1ukr9)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \n>TL;DR: The VIX isn't acting normal right now because institutional investors are selling their long positions in stocks, instead of just hedging them.

Don't do it.  The stock numbers are down because smart investors know the airline industry is about to crash (figuratively no pun intended).  We are already in a recession and likely facing a depression.\n\nExpect layoffs and furloughs at all the airlines starting 1st quarter. It's bad enough we don't have enough pilots to go around as it is. We have a severe captain shortage in the regionals. FOs are getting job offers from the legacies straight out of IOE. LCCs are hiring CFIs right at 1500 hours.\n\nI expect to see at least one regional maybe two fall 1st half of next year. Rumor is Mesa will be the first to file for bankruptcy, but probably only to get out of contractual obligations with a certain customer. All are hemorrhaging money right now. None are able to keep up with demand. There simply are not enough pilots to go around.\n\nOn top of all that. With all the companies laying people off, where is the demand going to go for business and pleasure travel if there is no one who needs to fly? No one has money to go to Disney world right now, hence the reason their numbers are so bad. Few people are going to go to Grandma's house here this Christmas because they can't afford the cost of the tickets for a family of 4.\n\nExpect the same for business travel. If there is one thing Covid taught us is that you can do a deal over video. As cost cutting kicks into high gear expect business travel to drop significantly.\n\nAirlines are a bad play any way you slice it.\n\nYou can watch this in near real time by following these websites.\n\n[https://www.transtats.bts.gov/traffic/](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/traffic/)\n\n[https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput)\n\n[https://www.icao.int/sustainability/Pages/Air-Traffic-Monitor.aspx](https://www.icao.int/sustainability/Pages/Air-Traffic-Monitor.aspx)\n\nBut don't follow this year to last year.

Business travel is only back to 70% of where it was pre-covid, so I'd assume those revenues are not back the same way.\n\nMy flight to LGA used to be $212.90 for a round trip flight (last flight before the pandemic was Feb 25-27), and I haven't paid less than $291 (most have been north of $350) since October 2020.  \n\nI had heard that 70% of high demand seats were presold for Christmas by the first week in October, so it sounds like people are trying to plan travel further out now.\n\nThanks for the info.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "My understanding, but I don't have numbers to prove it, is that we are fully back to pre-covid numbers.  \n\nPrices have certainly gone up and significantly.  I am fortunate that I don't usually have to buy tickets.  I can nonrev for most of my travel unless I absolutely need to be there.  Having said that, I priced tickets to go see my sister recently and they were three times what they were pre-covid.  Same for every time I have gone to get my medical renewed out in Colorado.  So based on my antidotal single person experience, I would expect prices to have gone up at least two to three times what they were.  Which makes sense.\n\nWe lost a lot of pilots over covid due to early retirements who are not coming back.  We were already short pilots before covid and this just made it worse.  Cost for employees have gone up significantly as well.  Some regionals are not offering higher first year pay than the legacies 1st year pay and offering a year salary as a sign on bonus.  So that is driving ticket prices up as well.  Then add in the increased cost of fuel and the difficulties getting parts due to supply chain issues and its just bad all around. \n\nAnd there are fewer seats to go around.  There are still a lot of planes sitting around without crews to operate them.  We just don't have enough pilots.  So that causes flights to sell out quickly.  The people you are referring to purchasing tickets earlier are only doing so because they suspect the flights will be sold out.  Which they often are due to management making a choice to over sell flights in the hopes that some people just won't show up.  \n\nThe holidays are an odd time to use as a basis for forecasting.

Mesa is a minimum of nine months from first day on property to passing IOE on the E175.  \n\nThere are not enough instructors or simulators to meet the demand.  It's so bad that a weird situation has developed where we have too many FOs and not enough captains to fly and allow those FOs to build enough hours to upgrade to the left seat.  So, lots of FOs are sitting around getting paid to not fly while captains are flying their asses off and quitting over their schedules.  \n\nAll of this is based on \"forecasts\" of continued demand into the future.

For the most part what people see are charter companies (135) and then on the airline side (121) regionals (baby airlines) and legacies.\n\nThe regionals who are contract airlines who do most of the state side flying, have Delta, American and United colors on the side of the airplanes but are not Delta, American and United, have paid too low for decades and suddenly to meet the demand are paying more than the legacies that hire them to do the flying.  They can't meet the demand for flights and are contractually obligated to fly routes for Delta, American and United.  These regional airlines, Mesa, Envoy, Endeavor, PSA, Republic are fighting over pilots by raising pay rates beyond what they can afford to do based on the contracts the have with Delta and the others.  Thus they are loosing money in trying to meet the demand.  Eventually the legacies, Delta, etc, will either bring that flying back in house or one or two of the regionals will go belly up and the remainder will pull the needed pilots in.\n\nThus the demand is so great the company can't afford to meet it.  Does that make more sense?\n\nSo now with all that demand the are scrambling to hire pilots left and right.
