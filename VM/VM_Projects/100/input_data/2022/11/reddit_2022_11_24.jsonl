{"title": "Tesla regains the \"hearts and minds\" of Big Morgan and Citi after plunging more than 50%.", "selftext": "Tesla (Tesla Inc.) market value in two months evaporated nearly $ 300 billion, but now, a growing number of Wall Street analysts have begun to say that the company's shares have fallen enough to advise investors not to miss this round of buying opportunities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs of Wednesday's U.S. stock close, Tesla was trading at $183.20, up nearly 8 percent, the biggest one-day gain since July.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMorgan Stanley (Morgan Stanley) analyst Adam Jonas said earlier that Tesla is approaching his \"bear market target price\" of $ 150, which provides investors with the opportunity to buy at a lower price. Citi analysts also raised the stock's rating to neutral from sell, saying the stock's more than 50 percent decline this year \"offsets short-term risk/reward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJonas wrote in a report that Tesla is the only electric car maker in Morgan Stanley's survey that is profitable through car sales, despite challenges such as slowing demand and price cuts in China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe analyst reiterated his $330 price target. He also highlighted the potential for Tesla to benefit from consumer tax credits in the United States.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo coincidence. Citi analyst Itay Michaeli also upgraded the stock on Wednesday, giving him a $176 price target, one of the lowest on Wall Street. The analyst said he has become more optimistic because Tesla's plunge means some of the stock's overly optimistic expectations have now been repriced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla's shares have plunged this year due to rising raw material costs, production and sales problems and customer budget pressures. Recent distractions from the company's CEO Musk, who is focused on turning around Twitter, have also dampened market sentiment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJonas said that to stop the decline in the stock price, it is necessary to end the disruption caused by Twitter. He wrote, \"There has to be some form of sentiment 'meltdown mechanism' around the tweets to calm investor concerns about Tesla.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite all the challenges Tesla has faced this year, Wall Street has remained largely optimistic. Most Tesla analysts have a Buy or Neutral rating on the stock, although the stock is currently 57 percent away from the average analyst target price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition, Tesla's plunge this year has reduced the stock's expected price-to-earnings ratio from more than 200 times in early 2021 to 31 times now.", "id": "z3bp4r", "created_utc": 1669268824.0, "score": 200, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 224, "comments": [{"body": "I'm always skeptical when the firms are pushing certain stocks.

That's unfortunately rare on Reddit these days.\n\nI could write a 10 page essay on the reasons why Tesla has a bright future, but I'll just try to sum up a few of them into bullet points.\n\n* Tesla is the only carmaker currently making money on EVs. Not even BYD - which is Tesla's biggest (and I'd argue only) competitor - is selling them profitably, and they even had to raise prices this week despite a recession and collapsing Chinese economy.\n* Not only is Tesla making money on EVs; they have the highest margins by miles of all the high volume car manufacturers (including ICE). Tesla is currently around 28% gross margin, while the next best is BMW at 16.5%.\n* Tesla's has many things coming up that will increase their margins even further. They recently introduced a single-piece casted rear underbody, where other OEMs are building them out of hundreds of parts. Obviously this is a huge time and cost saving, and other OEMs have announced they are switching to this technique too, but don't expect it to be read before 2028. Tesla is currently bringing it to front underbodies as well.\n* They also managed to reduce the production cost of their battery by ~$3,000 with the new batteries, but are expected to get another $2,000-3,000 reduction when they get the dry battery electrode working.\n* And most importantly, they are still at relatively low scale and will be able to leverage increasing economies of scale as they ramp up. For comparison, they're currently making roughly the same net income from 343K unit sales as Toyota does from 2.2M.\n* Speaking of ramping up, their Shanghai factory is currently at a run rate of 1M+ cars per year and expected to ramp to 1.5M. The factories in Berlin and Texas are both much larger than Shanghai, and will eventually do 2M a year or more. Those three factories together with their first factory in Fremont would be able to produce 6M+ cars when fully ramped, which will probably happen by mid-decade at the latest. On top of that, Tesla is expected to announce one or two new factories in the coming months.\n* Tesla is currently already roughly tied with the most profitable automaker on the planet. Next year they will almost definitely be the most profitable automaker by a fair margin (the others are declining while Tesla is roughly doubling net income), and in 2024 or 2025 they'll do more in net income than all the other automakers combined.\n* Tesla already has the highest ROIC of any automaker, and is rapidly approaching the companies with the highest ROIC in the world.\n* According to my projections, which are slightly higher than the analyst consensus (that has been underestimating them for 14 out of the last 15 quarters), Tesla currently has a forward PE of ~46, and 3 year forward PE of 17. That's entirely too low for a company growing 128% and 52% respectively (my expectations).\n* Tesla just made their FSD beta available to anyone in the US or Canada. I've checked with a whole bunch of people who have the software, and almost everyone who had previously unlocked it admitted to using the software almost every drive. Even if it's not fully autonomous yet, it has huge value to users.\n* I believe robotaxis are only a matter of time, and likely coming before the end of the decade. I've run the numbers on them, and if this is true Tesla will instantly become the most profitable company in the world by a rather large margin.\n* Tesla's energy department has always been constraint because all the batteries went to Teslas car division. Since Q3, this is no longer the case, and we saw a huge increase in Energy revenue as a result.\n\nI'm sure I missed a bunch more here, like how I've driven a whole range of EVs and nothing is close to Teslas. There's also the whole competition aspect, where legacy OEMs have had tremendous difficulty scaling down production lines of car models that were only selling <50,000 units per year without bankrupting their suppliers. When they start trying this with high volume models, I don't think people realise how big the consequences (and costs for OEMs) are going to be. They're going to have to choose between no longer servicing high volume models like Corollas or Golfs, which they're currently making a lot of money from, or sinking billions into keeping the servicing running not to piss off customers.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "One other thing I'd add that is pertinent to this macro landscape ‚Äî Tesla culture is that of a startup with a horizontal management structure. No red tape, no wasted time/ideas. \n\nTheir \"offices\" are intentionally exposed to the factory. If you have information that's important you can bypass the chain of command to get things moving. Example of how size can bloat a company would be Google. Ex employee tweeted the other day that when he was there in the late 2000s there was about five levels between him and the CEO. Fast forward about five years and there was ~14. \n\nThis brings me to the second point, with Google still being a great example. You can search headlines and you'll see that over the years, good times or bad, Elon and Tesla management regularly exfoliate unproductive/unnecessary workers, especially white collar. Look at Google and how bloated their numbers are over the last decade. Texas Roadhouse has offered a better return than Google. That should say something. \n\nTesla also doesn't believe in meetings simply for the sake of meetings. Elon's said it many times (for those who care to listen) that it's disrespectful to yourself and company time to stay in a meeting that offers no value to you or those in the room. Walk out and get back to your work (or avoid the meeting all together). \n\nThis isn't to bash on Google or other large cap companies. The bottom line is Tesla is very efficient in terms of labor, ideas and expectations. It's a gigantic startup with basically no debt, no risk of ruin, unlimited capital for expansion and the ability to pivot when necessary. \n\nWhile a lot of this does translate into profit it's something I find greatly underappreciated by most people, even Tesla investors.

In case it's not clear how it will unfold, or anyone thinks there's a chance we will have a soft landing, heres how it all happens -- a tale as old as time. Also note how if you take the time to check, everything I say is strongly supported by decades of data.\n\n**STARTING STATE**\n\n1. The economy starts out strong, real strong. This is indicated by:\n\n* Very low unemployment - [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)\n* Potential real gdp (Maximum capacity) divided by actual gdp (current operating capacity) is close to 1 (have to divide by real gdp yourself) -[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPPOT](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPPOT)\n* Credit conditions are loosey goosey and everyone is buying houses and cars ON CREDIT (see 2021) - [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRTSCLCC](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRTSCLCC)\n\n**THE INFLECTION POINT**\n\n2. Obviously, the fed is like wtf everyone is employed to the tits, but inflation is like 8%. We need to keep inflation anchored or else everyone gets fucked. Lets fuck the poor so they lose their jobs, demand collapses, and the rich/upper middle class stay happy. To do this, they raise the fed funds rate, making debt reaaaally expensive - [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FF](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FF)\n\n3. The above changes credit conditions. The economy doesn't run on cash. It runs on credit. By raising the fed funds rate, banks are forced to restrict access to credit, the yield curve inverts, and it makes much less sense to make any investments that would yield cash flows far into the future - see the tightening in action: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRTSCILM](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRTSCILM)\n\nAnd the yield curve which has never been wrong (set time period to max): [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y)\n\n**THE PAIN (To be seen)**\n\n4. When credit dries up, businesses start laying people off in anticipation of less access to the debt they've been using to pay salaries. Whats literally happening is future money becomes worth less and less desirable to pursue - so theres no need for all those workers chasing it.  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)\n\nWhen unemployment upticks, people get scared and stop buying shit they don't need.

Thus inflation returns back to 2%.\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nThat, my friends, is how the economy works. That is what is currently unfolding. 1. Start Strong -> 2. Fed Tightens  3. Credit Conditions tighten in the retail space -> 4. Mainstreet feels the pain. We are in the middle of stage 3, where conditions are tightening but it hasn't been felt on main street yet. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE STOCK MARKET STILL THINKS THE ECONOMY WILL SURVIVE. This bear market so far has been all about adjusting discounting rates of discounted cash flow valuations while keeping projected earnings the same.\n\nA recession will happen, and it will start getting priced-in in the next 6 months or so.

The Fed's been expanding capital into the market since the 1930s, so while 2008 saw a massive expansion in the balance sheet, there's no explicit reason why the Fed has to pick a date to go back to inherently because the capital requirements of a future economy will reflect existing inflationary pressure and market changes... meaning that reducing back to 2008 levels would actually be tragically BAD economic and monetary policy.\n\nAnyway, the Fed is telling us that they're not targeting 2008 levels in any case when they say they're targeting a 2% inflationary rate.\n\nTo target 2008 levels of capital, they wouldn't just have to pull money out of banks, but also pull money out of consumers at a massive rate, and businesses, and the equity market, **AND the bond market.**\n\nSince 2008, the Federal debt has increased from $10T to $30T.\n\nThe vast majority of that is the bond market, with intragovernmental debt only increasing a little $2T in that time period.\n\nDrawing the bond market (public debt) from $24T down to $6T (2008 numbers) in order to remove all of the money they put into the market since 2008 would not just bankrupt the United States government, but also put the entire global economy into a depression by reducing the balance sheet by many magnitudes and causing an international credit and monetary valuation crisis, among numerous other crises.\n\nThe Fed Funds rate is a relatively minor factor in QT at these low rates. The bigger effect is the bond and MBS portions on the program, designed to draw these down, BUT they operate mostly by letting this stuff mature out and not get replaced.\n\nThey could theoretically sell bonds, but that wouldn't necessarily be a positive impact to what they want to deter, which is bank lending.\n\nSee, the Fed's entire strategy is not to drastically draw down the capital to 2008, but rather to incentivize banks to use their existing reserves to refresh bonds rather than lend to consumers, and by the time we get to anything even remotely approaching a significant drawdown, the economy will enter a deepening recession as the credit markets tighten, and then the Fed will have to follow its other mandate as inflation crashes down close to 2% (but they'll be happy with 4% because that's close to the baseline inflation rate over 50 years) and as unemployment rises to 5-6%.\n\nAt that point there'll still be years of excess capital left in the banking system... probably 2024-2026+ levels of capital projected on the meanline from 2008 on in the balance sheet.\n\nIf they did get down to 2008 levels, it would be a MASSIVE deflationary event, not just getting us to 2% inflation, but seeing a massive asset depression and devaluation to the tune of 200-400% deflation, which is not what you want to see in an economic. That's a \"the nation's economic economic engine is dead and nobody can buy anything\" level of economic tragedy because there'd be a massive capital imbalance.\n\nSo with what the Fed is advertising and its strategy, you're \\*never\\* going to see a 2008 capital level drawdown... and no, it doesn't have to happen.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "They will, sure, but the Fed has the benefit of being the sun around which the financial world orbits.

Tesla's current p/e ratio is around 50! From my understanding much of their profit in the past was from regulatory credits but that's now changing.\n\n50 is not high for a company growing as fast as Tesla. Fucking Chipotle is 50. Regulatory credits nowadays represents less than 10% of their profit, and it's getting smaller every quarter. It's pretty much irrelevant to their value now, although it does help their cashflow a bit. \n\n>  Maybe Tesla will be the main EV producer for the next 20 years if they bring a middle class car to market but I think they'll end up being a high end vehicle manufacturer\n\nTheir entire business model is to continue to make cheaper cars. They are currently designing a new car that will be $25-$30k, something they can mass produce for the masses. They have no intention of having expensive vehicles forever. That's an unsustainable business model. \n\nSo how is Tesla worth $500b? \n\nFirst off, to be only worth $500b, you have to assume FSD is non-existent. FSD alone is probably worth $2-$4T. It would literally change the entire world. So let's put FSD aside and assume it will literally never happen - but keep in mind, if you only give FSD a 10% chance of success, that should add $200-$400b to Tesla's valuation. \n\nA big reason why they are valued so high is their high likelihood of future profits continuing to grow at the rate they have been. \n\nTesla has literally every advantage imaginable when compared to competition. The technology, the factory, the manufacturing process, the actual tech, the vertical integration, a better supply chain. \n\nBut most importantly is they can scale faster than anyone else, and it's not even close. Conservatively, their estimated P/E for 2023 at current stock price would be in the 20s. This is extremely low. \n\nAlso keep in mind their energy business which is growing massively and is even easier to scale than their car business. \n\nThey have the highest margins in the industry. Even if they cut their prices by 10% next year - they will still make a shitload of money, since they are reducing costs significantly as they scale existing factories. \n\nCompanies like Ford won't be profitable until mid 2025 - by their own estimates. That's their base case scenario. \n\nTheir Cybertruck will make them billions and billions. Ford being 'first' is completely irrelevant. There was a battery shortage due to war/covid, so Tesla focused on their existing product. But more than that Cybertruck is designed to be made in a way where they can make them cheaply and quickly. No manufacturer will be able to make a pickup truck anywhere even close to the same price as Tesla's Cybertruck. If you look at last quarter, Tesla made $5b. That's $20b per year. Next year they will probably make north of $30b. A growing company making $30b profit per year should be worth $1.5T.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Lmao toyota has so much debt and no margins why in hell would you compare both financial statements and balance sheets?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If Toyota has no margin then how does it make $3 billion profit?

The growth is far more absorptivity which is relevant to the long-term systematic abundance of increased capital. The 2001-2005 value increase indicates macro trend. However, to state this contributed to CPI (inflation) is unclear. It could be suspected that an increase in capital for asset markets reflects positively within real consumer purchasing power, but it is unclear due to the limit liquidity in the market. When institutional investors park funds, it is no longer chasing goods and therefore removed from effective circulation (and consumer prices). \n\n\nHowever, the question is are these funds being released from asset markets and entering into market competition bidding (supply chain markets)?
