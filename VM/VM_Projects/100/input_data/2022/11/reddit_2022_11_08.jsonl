I know in freedom land you guys have a bit of a weird concept of freedom of speech. Your constitution only really protects it against government suppression, not private entities.

You understand that \"speech\" is literally speech right? Different laws can apply to things which are written and things which are said? This isn't difficult to understand.\n\nAs such when a social media platform removes something you have written, you can say you are being censored but what you have written isn't actually protected by free speech laws, it never has been. This is part of the reason web service runners aren't held accountable for the content posted by their users, if they were they would be open to all sorts of legal issues surrounding the things written by their users as they would be acting as a publisher of that content. Also, given that these tech companies operate as private entities, separate to government, they can decide what is and isn't shown on their platform. The contention comes from them acting like an editor whilst simultaneously not being responsible for the content hosted. I'm sure you've thought a lot about all of this though and how your rights interact with online content.\n\nYour reply is telling though, this was never an argument, I asked you to explain why you thought you had this right and your response has been anything other than to answer that relatively simple question.

They do an economic survey every 3 years on the overall health of the consumer. And use that data to do various calculations of economic health. There is one coming out this year but looks like it hasn't been released yet so the last one I can find was in 2019. \n\nAnyways. From that survey they concluded that 24% of households had less than $400 in liquid savings. They define liquid savings as accessible checking or savings accounts, cash, prepaid cards, and directly held stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. \n\nUsing that same data they concluded that over 70% of households didn't have enough liquid savings to cover 6-months worth of expenses. \n\nLooking at the FED data right now Americans have about $580 billion in savings.

Had their fucking house financed at 14% (this was like 2018).  His mom thought she was smart and was rolling the credit card debt.  Got caught short and had a tax lien on their house.  I also had them sell a small vacation property they hadn‚Äôt used in 3 years.  With that and refinancing the house equity to 80%, I got them to a 4.5% mortgage.  Was able to eliminate all of the but about $10K of the card debt.  The mortgage payment at 80% including escrow, was less than the previous mortgage payment.  I had them cancel all the credit cards - except the one with debt - and put them on a $1000 a month payment plan.  When I got done, they $700/month in disposable income after all expenses (utilities, food, etc).
