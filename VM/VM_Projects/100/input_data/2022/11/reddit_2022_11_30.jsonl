The Akzo case was regarding, if my memory servers, a specific kind of chemical supplying company operating in the EU. That's something completely different from the smartphone market.\n\nIf you keep reading the article you provided you'll see that the CJEU have used vastly different percentage points when defining what a \"monopoly\" and/or \"dominant position\" is.\n\n*Generally speaking* if there are only two or more huge market share holders in either the same economic and/or geographic zone ([oligopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopoly)) you'll require a higher percentage to be classified as having a “dominant position”, than if there is just one major company on the market with a huge number of smaller ones competing against that behemoth (in which case a smaller percentage would be acceptable). In the case where there’s a single huge company in a specific field I wouldn't be surprised to see the CJEU go as low as 40% to claim that a company holds a \"dominant position\" in that specific field.\n\nThat's not what we're talking about here thought. Rather we’re taking about whether Apple would be considered a monopoly with a 50% EU market share. Currently Apple is holding roughly [23% of the EU market share](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/02/28/apple-maintains-second-place-spot-in-europe-smartphone-market-in-2021) which is far below even the lowest estimate of a dominant position. But even if it held 50% they’d still not be considered a monopoly.\n\nAlas, when determining whether a company holds a monopoly or not we can't really stop at just geographic market share, we’d also have to consider what kind of product the company is selling and whether there are viable alternatives to that product (among other things). Remember though that the term “monopoly” and \"dominant position\" ***really*** isn’t the same thing which the seminal *[Hoffmann–La Roche case](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:61976CJ0085&from=EN)* makes quite clear.\n\nWhether Apple would be considered holding a dominant position on the EU market is sketchy  at best but these are complex issues and a simple %-point won’t answer that question in a proper manner, I won’t even attempt to try—I'm just trying to give examples as to why it's very risky to give definitive answers when discussing competition law (my previous comment should thus be seen as \"this is where we generally place the different limits, as the late Ulf Bernitz (Professor emeritus in European Union Law at Stockholm University) would've put it.\n\nBut although this is a complex subject matter here is [an easily digested excerpt](https://introduction-to-european-law.schutze.eu/download-file/313/) from the book \"An Introduction to European Law (3rd edn)\" by [Robert Schütze](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/robert-schuetze/) (Professor of European and Global Law at Durham University) that might be of interest.\n\nHope that makes it a bit clearer what I meant by my post.\n\nI'd still strongly argue that there is no way that Apple would be considered a monopoly on the mobile phone market in the EU, even if it held 50% of the market share (presuming that Android held the other 50% that is). However, if Apple would hold 50% and a ragtag of other corporations held 2-5% each of the remaining 50% then yes, it's very possible that Apple would be considered holding a **dominant position** (but not a monopoly) within the EU.\n\n**Edit**: a few clarifications and spelling mistakes.\n\n**Edit 2:** re-wrote parts of my comment.

What is her life expectancy?\n\n*Err on the side of caution.* You don't want mom to be 90 and have to make the decision of working a second job or signing mom up to be a Walmart greeter.\n\nYou can take general health and family history into consideration. Health costs tend to go up as you age. Some people have a family history of living to 100+. Others the women tend to live 20 years longer than the men, etc. Others everybody tends to have strokes or heart attacks or cancers, diabetes, etc.\n\nOnce you have a basic cost of living and a life expectancy, you can setup a table to see what kind of cash flow is going to be necessary to continue that lifestyle for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.\n\nIf you are looking at less than 10 years, the stock market is a risky bet. Bonds would be a far safer option. 15 years, the stock market gets pretty darn safe about beating bonds. 20 years or more, the stock market is a no-brainer and kicks the snot out of bonds.\n\nIf the goal is to live frugally (significantly below her means) and leave a sizeable inheritance to children/grandchildren, all equities makes sense. Just be certain to setup a will and revocable trust with a lawyer so as to avoid probate and contested claims on the inheritance from your absentee aunt or 2nd cousin, twice removed.\n\nA DCA into an index fund with the lowest fees you can find for the equities portion is the intelligent investment for someone who is ignorant about investing. Bonds can also be dollar cost averaged into, and US Treasuries are a sensible option.\n\nThe weighting is up to you, but partly it would depend on how much principal is available and how much income is needed from that principal to cover living expenses each year.\n\nThe US stock market will historically return about 7% per year, in a mixture of dividends & growth. The next 100 years are not guaranteed to look like the last 200, but history is all we have.\n\n***Avoid managed funds.*** Pay a ***flat fee*** and buy an hours time with a reputable fiduciary financial planner.

{"title": "Fed Chair Powell says smaller interest rate hikes could start in December", "selftext": "*  **Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead and could start in December.**\n* **But he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.**\n* **“We will stay the course until the job is done,” he said during a speech in Washington, D.C. at the Brookings Institution.**\n\nWASHINGTON – Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead even as he sees progress in the fight against inflation as largely inadequate.\n\nEchoing recent statements from other central bank officials and comments at the November Fed meeting, Powell said he sees the central bank in position to reduce the size of rate hikes as soon as next month.\n\nBut he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.\n\n“Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability,” Powell said in remarks delivered at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe chairman noted that policy moves such as interest rate increases and the reduction of the Fed’s bond holdings generally take time to make their way through the system.\n\n“Thus, it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down,” he added. “The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.”\n\nMarkets already had been pricing in about a 65% chance that the Fed would step down its interest rate increases to half of a percentage point in December, following four successive 0.75-point moves, according to CME Group data. That pace of rate hikes is the most aggressive since the early 1980s.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is where the Fed goes from there. With markets pricing in the likelihood of rate cuts later in 2023, Powell instead warned that restrictive policy will stay in place until inflation shows more consistent signs of receding.\n\n“Given our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level,” Powell said.\n\n“It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time. History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” he added. “We will stay the course until the job is done.”\n\nPowell’s remarks come with some halting signs that inflation is ebbing and the ultra-tight labor market is loosening.\n\nEarlier this month, the consumer price index indicating inflation rising but by less than what economists had estimated. Separate reports Wednesday showed private payroll growth far lower than expected in November while job openings also declined.\n\nHowever, Powell said short-term data can be deceptive and he needs to see more consistent evidence.\n\nFor instance, he said Fed economists expect that the central bank’s preferred core personal consumption expenditures price index in October, to be released Thursday, will show inflation running at a 5% annual pace. That would be down from 5.1% in September but still well ahead of the Fed’s 2% long-run target.\n\n“It will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining,” Powell said. “By any standard, inflation remains much too high.”\n\n“I will simply say that we have more ground to cover,” he added.\n\nPowell added that he expects the ultimate peak for rates – the “terminal rate” – will be “somewhat higher than thought” when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee members made their last projections in September. Committee members at the time said they expected the terminal rate to hit 4.6%; markets now see it in the 5%-5.25% range, according to CME Group data.\n\nSupply chain issues at the core of the inflation burst have eased, Powell said, while growth broadly as slowed to below trend, even with a 2.9% annualized gain in third-quarter GDP. He expects housing inflation to rise into next year but then likely fall.\n\nHowever, he said the labor market has shown “only tentative signs of rebalancing” after job openings had outnumbered available workers by a 2 to 1 margin. That gap has closed to 1.7 to 1 but remains well above historical norms.\n\nThe tight labor market has resulted in a big boost in worker wages that nonetheless have failed to keep up with inflation.\n\n“To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2% inflation,” he said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/fed-chair-jerome-powell-says-smaller-rate-hikes-could-come-in-december.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/fed-chair-jerome-powell-says-smaller-rate-hikes-could-come-in-december.html)", "id": "z8zew5", "created_utc": 1669833873.0, "score": 1759, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 398, "comments": [{"body": "So that’s where the massive volume 2min ago came from..", "score": 636, "replies": [{"body": "Lol yup.", "score": 114, "replies": []}, {"body": "Market makers (who also own most of MSM) move the markets, not investors or institutions.\n\nThese jpow rallies are to mislead people into calls.\n\nNothing about our economy is looking good, nothing about the banks and markets are looking good.\n\nJpow is sticking with the data and remains hawkish, yet MSM is touting a pivot (again lol) while the \"markets rally\"", "score": 488, "replies": [{"body": ">Jpow is sticking with the data and remains hawkish, yet MSM is touting a pivot (again lol) while the \"markets rally\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou step in front of the train first.", "score": 92, "replies": [{"body": "heard there are nickels there", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Sometimes dimes", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Worth a look, I reckon", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "That’s a fuckin bar", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Sure.

Forward indicators don't mean anything to the Fed anymore. Forward indicators showed goods inflation should've actually caused deflation to offset the increase in housing inflation, but it didn't. Actually, the Fed was pretty frustrated at the fact that goods deflation didn't deflate even more. The big frustration with the Fed this year and even last year was that forward indicators take a really long time to show up on the data, and you never know if the forward indicators are correct or not.

So now, there's no more people to go back to work unless if immigration increased (unlikely), or if retired people get out of retirement (Powell also said unlikely and won't be counting on them). So this essentially leaves the Fed with one option, and Powell + multiple other Fed officials have publicly said it, that they won't be hoping for increased labor supply anymore, so they have to bring down labor demand (which is essentially suppressing the economy with higher rates and increase unemployment).

This later forced every FOMC members to walk back on Powell's words (they literally say they don't understand how the market interpreted Powell's words as dovish), but market didn't listen unless if it comes from Powell. We'll see tomorrow if the FOMC starts walking back on market's interpretation again, but I'll be frank I have no clue how the Fed can be hawkish to the market without outright saying \"The Fed will engineer a recession\" (which they can't say because Congress would skin them alive).

The central bank has increased its benchmark rate half a dozen times this year, taking the overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 3.75%-4%, and is expected to hike a few more times before stopping.\n\nIn recent days, Fed officials have said they expect smaller increases ahead than the four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases, the most recent of which came in early November. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is addressing the public Wednesday afternoon in a speech to be delivered at the Brookings Institution.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/elon-musk-says-the-fed-must-cut-rates-immediately-to-stop-a-severe-recession.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/elon-musk-says-the-fed-must-cut-rates-immediately-to-stop-a-severe-recession.html)", "id": "z8s90k", "created_utc": 1669816872.0, "score": 132, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 353, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|95|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z8s90k)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z8s90k)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Elon Musk is worried that the Federal Reserve's attempts to bring down inflation could cause a severe recession.
