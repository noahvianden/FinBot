When you have a website that deals with a crapton of traffic globally, your engineers will mostly be working on ensuring the site doesn't go down.\n\nA large website depends on countless third-party libraries. Every new day there's a new exploit somewhere. They need to ensure this doesn't affect their users. They need to deploy changes worldwide. They need to maintain servers worldwide. They need teams that speak different languages in every continent.\n\nIf they maintain a website, an API, an android app, and an iphone app, every new feature needs to be implemented by four different teams, and tested, before being deployed, or else you get a situation like Reddit where the app can post images in comments but the website can not.\n\nBasically all these engineers are working to ensure that their minimum product doesn't explode, and they need all that staff on payroll because every year hardware needs upgrading, software needs updating, new regulations need to be addressed, etc. It's all just to keep up with all these changes at a global scale in a stable way.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "This is completely untrue, DevOps is in charge of making sure it doesn’t go down. There’s also infrastructure engineers.\n\nDon’t tell me Frontend engineers and Backend engineers in product teams are 24/7 just at keeping the product from exploding (which isn’t even their job) this would defeat the purpose of even having teams in general.\n\nNot to mention if this was true there’d be 0 reason to have almost any designers, to have most Product teams (besides some managing maintenance tasks, and other business roles) because the company would never be growing. In reality there’s teams in every dept working specifically on R&D wether it’s small feature adds to existing services or modules or entirely new ones.\n\nSure teams have to do maintenance, and as the other person mentioned compliance could be a legitimate maintenance cost. However your argument is really in the weeds.\n\nThis is not how businesses work in general, this is not even how investors work (who always seek growth). Businesses find new ways to improve profitability wether it makes processes more efficient for internal employees (wasting less time and therefor money) or identifying ways to increase user interest, activity or other KPI’s. Reality check that businesses are never stable, by this deduction nothing would ever get done.\n\n\nAlso no, that’s not how it works to “add a new feature”. First off there’s 3 kinds of features in general FE, BE, and end to end. UI can be updated without BE involvement, backend can be updated without FE involvement (though they usually are), and end to end features only require 2 sources the service to be updated or created and then the FE teams to add it. Once a feature is spun up on the service there doesn’t necessarily have to be a coordinated release between 3 apps. To your Reddit example it may not make sense to you but doing a rolling release on the most used platforms is a 100% valid business strategy. How many people use Twitter in the browser? Idk but if I was to guess the majority use the app and in that the majority very likely use the iOS app.\n\nThis is a list of excuses imo, and is a great explanation of why Twitter would be unprofitable.

The entire point of old Reddit is to more or less stay like old Reddit…\n\nAfaik you wouldn’t know if Reddit is profitable because it’s privately held which is a huge difference in it of itself, Twitter is public obviously.\n\nYou don’t need to break production to release a feature?? Even if we were to argue a buggy or imperfect feature gets released, as long as it doesn’t touch in-place systems in a critical way it really wouldn’t affect much outside users being potentially annoyed at the new feature not working entirely. Either way most features aren’t these massive changes or aren’t even necessarily these critical huge features.\n\nRegardless of the current Twitter fiasco, we saw how long it took Twitter to update Twitter Blue… not that long and you could easily argue that was a pretty big update/feature, and that’s just to say change is entirely feasible, normal, and even necessary to most companies. The lack of adapting is in part what has led Twitter to sink with a minefield of bots while they clearly haven’t beefed up their protections speaking of maintenance.\n\nCompanies like Netflix have built their own entire CDN’s among other things in the last decade speaking of things that are insanely hard, rolling out a feature on Twitter doesn’t hold the faintest candle to something like that.\n\nI’m going to end with that though because it’s not that there’s 0 good points to be made but I’m chasing irrelevant arguments at this point.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">  There’s actually no way you can claim there haven’t been new features without going out of your way\n\nBut you're talking about a dev's point of view. From the point of view of the user, what they want are tangible features they can actually use, not decorations.\n\nFor example, the \"edit\" tweet button. That's probably going to mess with a lot of twitter infrastructure that assumes the data is immutable. Users want it regardless. They don't want to see how many active users are in a twitter thread, who cares about that. Features for them is how many things you can do, rather than how much info you can get.\n\nSimilarly, the removal of character limit is crazy because I bet there's so much stuff optimized to work on 280 characters that the best they could do was double from 140 to 280 last time they changed it. For the average person this limit seems completely arbitrary when it could be literally the only way for twitter to function at the scale it does, the way it does.\n\nBack to reddit, awards are a thing, I guess, but it barely has anything to do with reddit's core functionality. \nSame with avatars. Avatars are such utterly useless feature that I only learned that the new reddit has them when people were complaining about the NFT ones. Nobody cares about the avatars, or the profile bios. Features that would benefit reddit would be subforums, for example, or the ability to have more than 2 pinned threads, or a way to quickly recognize prominent posters in a subreddit. Instead of such features that would benefit the subreddit system of reddit, reddit instead chases peripheral features just because other social media have them.\n\nThis happens because reddit is the only website that works like reddit. They have no incentive to improve their reddit-ness because there is no competition. You could easily outreddit reddit by having the features I mentioned, but you wouldn't have the users.

The fundamentals seem stable.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I see two major ways that this could directly impact Tesla to some degree. Less from a day to day operations standpoint and more from a long term growth standpoint.\n\nOne is that Tesla has been trading at a significant premium for a few years now based on the expectation that it has serious potential to grow into something bigger than it already is. At least some of this belief rests on Elon Musk’s track record of promising seemingly unlikely or implausible feats and then having them come to pass. I think, for instance, that the success of SpaceX has helped Tesla’s share price despite not being directly related because it bolsters belief in the idea that Elon knows what he is doing and can successfully pull off some serious long shot ventures.\n\nThat reputation has gotten a little bit dinged over the last few years, but his successes have been large enough and failures minor enough that I think he’s more or less been able to shrug that off.\n\nOn the other hand, if he buys Twitter at a significant premium going into a recession and immediately crashes it into the ground, that’s going to be a business failure of unprecedented scale for Musk. \n\nEvery successful business leader gets to where they are through a combination of their own savvy and luck. The question is always how much of each went into it. If even a significant portion of investors start thinking that they may have misjudged the ratio in Elon’s case, and especially considering how tightly he has tied the Tesla brand to his personal brand, this could bode poorly for Tesla’s long term prospects and result in a drop in share price as investors reassess. This would, in turn, make it harder for Tesla to raise capital for future growth.\n\nLikewise, it’s not just Elon’s money tied up in Twitter. Because he sought outside investment to help him reach the contracted price, he’s also risking other people’s money. If he winds up effectively setting it on fire, that’s going to make lenders in general more hesitant to work with him than they would have been otherwise, which again raises his capital costs for future growth. Especially with interest rates going up, that’s not great timing.\n\nFinally, this could also impact recruitment of engineers to his other companies if it dissuades up and coming engineers from wanting to work with him. But his attitude towards and expectations for his employees aren’t some big secret that has suddenly been revealed and the people working at Tesla and SpaceX by and large knew what they were getting into, so I doubt that will be a very large effect if anything, unless he manages to *truly* tank his personal brand during all this, which I’m not expecting to happen.\n\nIt’s going to take a hit, though, and the close ties between his brand and that of his companies is going to hurt them to some degree.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "A third impact would be Musk directly recommending people vote for Republicans.

Their multiples are excellent, but are that way because it has the possibility of an insane leader priced in. Risk adjust accordingly.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "My apologies that I haven't been able to respond to your post until now. In terms of Meta's leadership in the industry, they most certainly do have a substantial lead on other companies. There massive userbase gives them a leg up almost immediately, and this is not an advantage to be taken lightly (as competitors have to build a userbase from scratch). Even Instagram, which already had a userbase of its own, benefited from Facebook's larger userbase when they were bought out. It isn't a small advantage, and it's part of what has kept Meta on top for so long.\n\nBut I don't think it's necessarily something that is guaranteed to stay that way either. The internet changes FAST, and alternative social media networks (or even alternative paradigms entirely, such as TikTok and BeReal) are popping up and are growing very popular despite the initial disadvantage they face with having to build users from scratch. Part of this, in my opinion, is a result of the broad level of distrust that many people have of Facebook. Constant scandals and controversies (along with advertising and monetization practices that tend to favor algorithmic content generation over posts from friends/family) have frustrated a lot of its users and have (especially) pushed Gen Z largely off of the platform in terms of active daily users. This, too, is a trend that could change, but facebook's values are pretty much antithetical to the values of the largest group of active social media users as it stands now. These are the users who are the least likely to forgive Facebook's misgivings, and aren't likely to swing to Facebook en-masse just because they copied a popular feature from another network.\n\nIn fact, despite Facebook's attempts to copy TikTok and BeReal, both efforts have largely failed, despite Facebook arguably having a significant advantage right out of the gate in terms of having a large userbase by default. This should have been a slam dunk for Facebook, but these were significant failures for the company that point to less-than-promising trends for the company. People are looking for alternatives, and they are looking for alternatives enough to go through the effort of creating accounts en-masse on other networks. Facebook still has an advantage because it's the largest general purpose network on the planet, but the grounds are riper than they've ever been for another company to attempt an alternative.\n\nCould Meta thrive in 10 years? I do believe they could, with a change in strategy (along with efforts to regain public trust). But their current strategy has been less successful in recent years than it was in the past. People are starting to value more authentic social media experiences with their friends and their families, and Facebook has been pretty much going the opposite direction from that trend. There is nothing stopping Facebook from doing a U-Turn, but it would result in a lot of unhappy shareholders because it would probably cost them a lot of advertisement revenue, and so their hands are tied if they are unwilling to face short term pain to ensure long term stability.\n\nIn other words, Facebook might be doing great today, but I think that future growth opportunities might be much more challenging than we might have previously assumed. They do still have a significant advantage in terms of market leadership, but all it would take is for one formidable, decently sized general purpose competitor to arise, and Facebook would quickly lose much of its competitive advantage.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The entire point of asking about valuation is that it's literally QUANTIFIABLE.

Nobody KNOWS what a company tomorrow will do (and I don't claim to either).\n\nYou said in your last post that stock market values ARE quantifiable, and if you're referring to the price of the stock, then you are right. A company's current worth is, of course, determined by its current stock market price. But if we are discussing which stocks might be overvalued, how can we discuss that if we can't discuss what we think a stock SHOULD be valued at? Is this value the same value as the company's current stock value, or are we discussing two different things?\n\nIf we're discussing what we think a company's stock SHOULD be priced at, can we find a way to quantify this just as easily as we can quantify the company's current stock price? If so, how do we determine it? Do we take an average of X number of analysts and their predictions over X months, and determine what a stock SHOULD be priced at to determine whether it's undervalued or overvalued? How do we get one single quantifiable and reliable number that tells us whether a stock is overpriced or underpriced?\n\nWe can't because these are two separate things. As investors, most of us do buy stocks based on what we think companies will be worth in the future (unless we are investing large sums of money solely for the sake of being on the board of directors or are just investing for dividends and don't care about a stock's long term outcome). We are, at best, making very educated predictions, and those predictions take into account more factors than just the amount of profit that a company makes today. Some companies that are profitable today will remain profitable many years from now, others won't. My point is that market and consumer trends are equally important things to look at if we are trying to make informed decisions about a stock's future valuation.

Then, mysteriously in 1997 he has record of getting two of his degrees after a merger took place in '96. These aren't accusations. This is directly from the subpoena from penn state's records.

Elon was still talking - https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1593405187745619975\n\nI think the Twitter fiasco takes attention away from Tesla and should give people who worship him some pause. Eddie Lampert took over a decade to destroy Sears and literally slow walked through trying to tear the company apart piece-by-piece in order to try and benefit himself. Elon is basically speedrunning his attempt to destroy Twitter and how that is to his benefit I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nJohn Legere - the guy who turned around T-mobile and did a pretty spectacular job at it - tweeted at Musk that he would run Twitter. Musk's reply? No. Why in the world wouldn't Musk want someone like that ASAP?\n\nIMO, the Tesla-related concern is also the politics. Telling people who to vote for when you're running two consumer facing companies is an absolutely insane thing to do in this day and age.\n\nAs for Twitter, I've thought for a long time that it would be better off in someone else's hands - 1) apparently not Musk's and 2) maybe that time has already passed; this is a much more unforgiving environment and you've now saddled the company with more debt and seem to have no plan, even tweeting that the company will do lots of dumb stuff in the coming months and will keep what works and drop what doesn't. That...doesn't sound like there was a clear plan in mind to begin with and given the state of the company, \"try some stuff and see what works\" is not going to work in this environment for very long. \n\nMusk basically came into Twitter acting like he was going to make things up as he went along. He's already spooked brands, which isn't great when your business is primarily ad space. Subscriptions? Apple gets a big part of that. With what Apple did with advertising and iOS, it feels like the social media business was impaired to some degree before Musk bought. Facebook's attempted Metaverse pivot is because they have to.\n\nIf the easy monetary policy of the last decade or so is truly over for many years to come it will be interesting to see how Musk fares.\n\nTLDR: Nothing about the Twitter fiasco has been positive for Musk, from the distraction of it, the lack of a clear vision for Twitter, the speed in which it seems to be falling apart under his leadership and there's nothing good about it for Musk \"the brand.\" Also, for someone who has something like half a dozen companies, he has a lot of time to tweet - he's Tweeted so much more since buying it.

The biggest spin-off (Seritage) has gone badly - if Buffett still owns it in his personal account he's lost a ton. Eddie was doing loans against the best real estate (\"heads I win, tails I win\") and in the end, Sears lost and Eddie is still rich but he didn't really win either - AUM at ESL cratered since and he turned Sears into a mess. 2008 recession did absolutely change things, but there was still maybe a short window where he could have dumped it. Instead, he rode it right into the ground. \n\nAll that said, if you watched all the discussion about the Sears saga when it played out, there is one similarity: overconfidence/unquestioning belief in a billionaire. He's the king hedge fund manager, how could he fail? There were so many SeekingAlpha comments that were basically some variation on \"Eddie has to have a plan!\" Eddie did have a plan - for Eddie (and even that plan didn't work out well.) \n\nLampert had fanboys sure he was going to make it work all the way to bankruptcy. The Fairhome fund (which had been at one point Morningstar Manager of the Decade) lost most of its AUM on a decade+ bet on Lampert that included Fairholme's manager on the board oF Sears.) Fairholme lost a fortune on Sears, not to mention opportunity cost given the length of the saga.\n\n Eddie Lampert was a very great hedge fund manager.

If you normalize the time when tesla pays its own suppliers compared to other car companies, Tesla doesn't have higher margins. \n\nFurthermore Tesla did not face competition until basically this year.

EVs and energy products do not exist in a vacuum.  In 2012, Model S had competitors in the Mercedes S-Class and BMW 5-series.  Consumers could have chosen to buy something other than a Model S, and most did.  Remember that a decade ago, the Supercharger network did not exist (or any large-scale DC Fast Charge network for that matter).  Today, Tesla's Megapacks compete with Gas and Coal fired peaker plants for grid balancing. \n\nEVs are not a category on their own.  They are cars and compete with other cars for market share.  \n\nThe conventional wisdom is that competition will catch up to Tesla, but that is based on a false assumption that Tesla is decelerating or standing still.  My personal assessment is that Tesla is *accelerating* away from the competition in terms of production capabilities, software, computer hardware, and overall ecosystem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Good luck.  \n\nThanks.

Tyson Foods is an established, successful, and dividend paying company.  They saved a net 200 million in operational costs through using Palantir Foundry to gain insight into where they could improve business efficiency.  They paid about 6 million/year for the software service license.   \n\nMost people believe that Palantir isn't scalable because they compare it to consulting firms that write custom code for each client.  Palantir's platform is generalized though -- Foundry can be used for anything from health care management in the UK's NHS (was used for Covid vaccine logistics), to Food processing and supply chain at Tyson.  \n\nIf Palantir's business can in fact scale (and **this is by no means guaranteed**), they have the potential to become as critical to government and private enterprise as Microsoft and Amazon AWS today.  \n\nIt is a big risk, but not one that I take lightly", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Please look at dilution and at the Competition of Tesla.

Here's the TL;DR: Financing remains healthy despite high mortgage rates; consumer spending on remodeling is high and balance sheets are strong; supply is limited as is new construction; banking system is more robust; defaults are low. And not mentioned, but most Americans locked in low interest rates / refinanced and aren't actually paying 7% mortgage rates. So we could see housing prices weaken and fall, but it's not as likely as 2008 to translate into a severe recession, or financial meltdown.\n\nPoint 1:\n\n> Today, as in 2008, sales are declining from exceptionally strong levels. But the sudden stop in financing and sustained shift in credit standards that undermined housing transactions in 2008 are unlikely this time. Mortgage rates have shot up, shrinking how much house the same payment will buy, but financing remains available\n\nPoint 2:\n\n> Next, spending on residential remodeling is running at a 60-year high. This speaks not only to the pandemic-induced need for more home office space. It also speaks to households’ strong balance sheets, where wealth has grown across the income distribution with pandemic stimulus and the inability to spend freely. Though household wealth is coming under pressure—just think about the drawdown in equity markets—balance sheets are unlikely to be structurally impaired this time around. \n\nPoint 3:\n\n> in a critical difference to the mid-2000s, there just isn’t enough housing supply today. Today’s low housing inventories are consistent with continued building activity even against a backdrop of higher rates, because the risk of being unable to sell homes when there are few on the market is lower\n\nPoint 4:\n\n> Today credit quality, access, and financing costs look different. Unlike 2008, defaults are low, nonperforming loans are rare, and the banking system is in robust health with high levels of capital and profits. This has helped keep credit accessible, after a brief tightening at the beginning of the COVID crisis, for the same type of borrowers that had access before COVID struck—even if that credit is now more expensive. \n\nSummary:\n\n> Households’ balance sheets are extremely strong, and housing leverage is modest; credit standards have been healthy and there are few signs of credit stress; and banks are profitable and strongly capitalized.

There are always flash-in-the-pan hype companies that appear and rise up really fast in every crypto bull market, and they tend to die off in the bear market, like we're seeing. The reason why companies like FTX, Celsius, etc are going bankrupt is because they were lending out user assets and backing it with their own worthless tokens.\n\nCoinbase does not have its own crypto token, nor do they lend out user assets. In fact, they're a publicly traded company, so you can see their exact assets and liabilities on their balance sheet - they have $95b in user crypto assets and $95b in user crypto liabilities, exactly 1:1.

SpaceX are also amazing but they are not public so I can't invest in them and lately Elon Musk has done a lot to tarnish his reputation, so I'm concerned about their leadership as well.\n\nRKLB on the other hand seems to be quite competent at what they do, they have actual flying rockets and a backlog of missions and are on track to develop a partially reusable and much more capable rocket. In addition they don't focus solely on launch but on in-space services too and other hardware (for example the recent Artemis I launch carried their photovoltaic panels) and are even working on interplanetary missions. From what I gather their goal is for the majority of space based hardware to carry RKLB logo on at least some of their components and I really like that goal.\n\nOverall I think that the space-based economy is going to grow significantly in the next several decades and they are positioned well to take a nice slice of it, even if they don't become leaders.\n\nRKLB are the high risk/high reward part of my portfolio - if they realize their potential I expect that my investment in them will give me very good returns but at the same time I realize that it's by no means guaranteed so I am conscious not to invest a big of amount of money there. Generally I plan to buy some shares every now and then and hold them for the long run (like 10, possibly more years) and see how it goes.
