Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.\n\n[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/)¬†stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.\n\nEarlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of¬†Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.\n\nMusk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.\n\n \n\nAmong other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.\n\nMusk‚Äôs Twitter distraction has shaken some of¬†Tesla‚Äôs most stalwart bulls.

On top of that, algos are set to jump at the slightest hint of any \"doveish\" comment by the Fed. Remember, the Fed giveth and taketh, so the stock and bond markets have learned to follow the Fed.\n\nBut the entire reason the Fed is raising rates to far and so fast is because of excessive inflation. Therefore, at the slightest hint of \"peaking inflation\", markets pop. This has been happening since spring / summer 2021. Inflation is worse than thought, market tanks; inflation is better, market surges; inflation is better but Powell says something scary, oh gosh, up down up down up down.\n\nKeep in mind, money has to go somewhere. In most market downturns before, the money left stocks and went into bonds, housing, or something. But this time has been different. Bonds and stocks have been selling off bad since the beginning of the year. That is now in cash or money market funds ready to rush into stocks. Some of it is also in \"safe\" or \"defensive\" stocks like healthcare, which is why those went down some today (frankly, they're way overpriced).\n\nHere's what I'm looking at. The Fed projects overnight rates in the mid to upper 4s throughout 2023. The rate is 4.0 now. December will push to 4.5. Bond yields fell yesterday to start the day, which investors view as bullish for stocks (unless it means recession). In fact, the sharp bond yield crash yesterday morning may have been what really triggered to stock algos to go nuts. But now the 20 year is below 4.3. There is no way 20 year bonds can stay below 4.5 if the overnight rate is going to get above 4.5 this December. So that means TLT (etf that tracks 20-year bonds) must come back to 90 (it's presently at 98). And if bonds sell off again, and yields rise, I expect stocks will fall, as well. The only way this doesn't happen is if the Fed gives clear indication that they will drop rates starting next year, or they see a lower terminal rate. If that happens at the December meeting, stocks to the moon. It will be interesting to see.\n\nWill SPY / QQQ hit a new low? In a recession, yes. With more surprise inflation upside, definitely yes. Otherwise, probably not. Will they get lower than they are today? I think SPY will, but QQQ may have bottomed. TLT is definitely going lower.

We are being told to anticipate/plan for another 10% in input cost increases for next year because of things like diesel and urea and labor.  Urea/diesel will not normalize until the Russian/Ukraine war ends but not until that is over imo.

{"title": "BULLS LOOK AWAY: Highly regarded WSB legend Michael Burry is a full fledged bear through at least Q1 2023; Says market could fall to 15% below the COVID lows", "selftext": "Intro:\n\nI don‚Äôt know about you guys but I have a lot of respect for Michael Burry and his recession predictions. He has nailed them time and time again. He might be the smartest regarded investor known to man. He has been sounding the alarm about an inflationary crisis since as early as February 2021, and I believe that after the run up we had yesterday that it‚Äôs only a matter of time before we see a bunch of giant devil dicks all over our investing apps. I will detail some of his DD for his predictions.\n\n1. 2022 Q3 Earnings\n\nEarnings reports for big tech companies were shite in Q3. Microsoft‚Äôs growth slowed substantially, Amazon‚Äôs operating income got cut by almost half and reported their slowest revenue growth for AWS since they began reporting it in 2014, Meta Platforms revenues are down 4% and costs up 19%, Google‚Äôs revenue growth came in at just 6% compared to 41% 1 year earlier. Burry called this.\n\n2. Disinflation is just temporary\n\nInflation appears in spikes. It resolves, fools people, and then comes back. After the first inflation spike, there tends to be a second larger one. An inflationary cycle generally spans years, and sometimes decades. It always comes back, just like us degenerates come back to YOLOing on FDs.\n\n\n3. White collar employment bubble\n\nWhen white collar employees are working remotely, they are unproductive. I work from home and can confirm I am a worthless sack of shit when working from home. I‚Äôm sure some of you can relate. This forces multiple employees to work a 1-man job. Burry thinks the white collar employment bubble is bursting right before our eyes and will lead to a huge increase in unemployment. We have already seen this taking effect with META, Amazon, Twitter (LOL) and other large companies having mass layoffs in the past month or two.\n\n4. Margin bubble\n\nJust like some of you dumb fucks who were inspired by the highly regarded legend of GUH, more investors are using margin now than ever. We are currently in the largest margin bubble in history. Also, plays are more risky. Single stock options volumes are now larger than the volumes for normal shares. Due to increased volatility from alternative investments, margin calls will occur easily. This dropped the asset prices, causing a chain reaction of margin calls. To make matters worse, credit card debt has exploded over the past 5 years to $4.6 billion. Goldman‚Äôs Apple Card lends more than a quarter of their credit loans to subprime borrowers.

And so far based on GDP we don't have a recession, or if we did it is over. Q3 and projected Q4 GDP growth is quite strong. Consumers are still spending. There are no signs of crisis in credit markets (save ponzicoins). Government spending is coming down which is less inflationary.
