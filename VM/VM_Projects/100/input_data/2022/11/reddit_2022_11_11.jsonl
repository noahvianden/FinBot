Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.\n\n[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.\n\nEarlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.\n\nMusk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.\n\n \n\nAmong other things, [Musk wants Twitter to generate half of its revenue from Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/read-elon-musks-first-email-to-all-twitter-employees.html), and to become less reliant on advertising revenue.\n\nMusk’s Twitter distraction has shaken some of Tesla’s most stalwart bulls. For example, [CNBC Pro reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/wedbush-removes-tesla-from-its-top-stocks-list-says-twitter-deal-an-albatross.html), Wedbush Securities has removed Tesla from its top stock list.

That’s the slowest inflation since January, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine kicked off a spike in energy that drove up the price of everything else with it.\n\nIt gives the Federal Reserve scope to slow down interest rate increases. While it won’t be enough for a pivot to rate cuts, and won’t deter a half-point hike in December, it at least raises the possibility that Chairman Jerome Powell will come off tightening autopilot early in 2023.\n\nPerhaps most uplifting is that inflation is starting to slow significantly, even before an economic slump looks likely to turn nasty. Kinks in supply chains have mostly been ironed out, while demand is only slightly weaker. A soft landing might still be tough, but maybe rates won’t need to go as high as previously thought.\n\nAdding to the exuberance was China’s decision to relax some Covid-19 restrictions, a sign the global economy has a chance to run more smoothly.\n\nStock traders get it. Equities posted their best gains since 2020, with the S&P 500 up more than 5% and the beaten-down Nasdaq Composite climbing more than 7%.

Therefore, at the slightest hint of \"peaking inflation\", markets pop. This has been happening since spring / summer 2021. Inflation is worse than thought, market tanks; inflation is better, market surges; inflation is better but Powell says something scary, oh gosh, up down up down up down.\n\nKeep in mind, money has to go somewhere.

Some of it is also in \"safe\" or \"defensive\" stocks like healthcare, which is why those went down some today (frankly, they're way overpriced).\n\nHere's what I'm looking at. The Fed projects overnight rates in the mid to upper 4s throughout 2023. The rate is 4.0 now. December will push to 4.5. Bond yields fell yesterday to start the day, which investors view as bullish for stocks (unless it means recession). In fact, the sharp bond yield crash yesterday morning may have been what really triggered to stock algos to go nuts. But now the 20 year is below 4.3. There is no way 20 year bonds can stay below 4.5 if the overnight rate is going to get above 4.5 this December. So that means TLT (etf that tracks 20-year bonds) must come back to 90 (it's presently at 98). And if bonds sell off again, and yields rise, I expect stocks will fall, as well. The only way this doesn't happen is if the Fed gives clear indication that they will drop rates starting next year, or they see a lower terminal rate. If that happens at the December meeting, stocks to the moon. It will be interesting to see.\n\nWill SPY / QQQ hit a new low? In a recession, yes. With more surprise inflation upside, definitely yes. Otherwise, probably not. Will they get lower than they are today? I think SPY will, but QQQ may have bottomed. TLT is definitely going lower.

{"title": "BULLS LOOK AWAY: Highly regarded WSB legend Michael Burry is a full fledged bear through at least Q1 2023; Says market could fall to 15% below the COVID lows", "selftext": "Intro:\n\nI don’t know about you guys but I have a lot of respect for Michael Burry and his recession predictions. He has nailed them time and time again. He might be the smartest regarded investor known to man. He has been sounding the alarm about an inflationary crisis since as early as February 2021, and I believe that after the run up we had yesterday that it’s only a matter of time before we see a bunch of giant devil dicks all over our investing apps. I will detail some of his DD for his predictions.\n\n1. 2022 Q3 Earnings\n\nEarnings reports for big tech companies were shite in Q3. Microsoft’s growth slowed substantially, Amazon’s operating income got cut by almost half and reported their slowest revenue growth for AWS since they began reporting it in 2014, Meta Platforms revenues are down 4% and costs up 19%, Google’s revenue growth came in at just 6% compared to 41% 1 year earlier. Burry called this.\n\n2. Disinflation is just temporary\n\nInflation appears in spikes. It resolves, fools people, and then comes back. After the first inflation spike, there tends to be a second larger one. An inflationary cycle generally spans years, and sometimes decades. It always comes back, just like us degenerates come back to YOLOing on FDs.\n\n\n3. White collar employment bubble\n\nWhen white collar employees are working remotely, they are unproductive. I work from home and can confirm I am a worthless sack of shit when working from home. I’m sure some of you can relate. This forces multiple employees to work a 1-man job. Burry thinks the white collar employment bubble is bursting right before our eyes and will lead to a huge increase in unemployment. We have already seen this taking effect with META, Amazon, Twitter (LOL) and other large companies having mass layoffs in the past month or two.\n\n4. Margin bubble\n\nJust like some of you dumb fucks who were inspired by the highly regarded legend of GUH, more investors are using margin now than ever. We are currently in the largest margin bubble in history. Also, plays are more risky. Single stock options volumes are now larger than the volumes for normal shares. Due to increased volatility from alternative investments, margin calls will occur easily. This dropped the asset prices, causing a chain reaction of margin calls. To make matters worse, credit card debt has exploded over the past 5 years to $4.6 billion. Goldman’s Apple Card lends more than a quarter of their credit loans to subprime borrowers. They will default soon once the bad credit regards fall to the rising inflation.\n\nTLDR:\n\nBurry believes the coming recession could be worse than 2008 and has been warning us since February 2021.\n\n• Earnings for big tech were ass in 2022 Q3, worst is yet to come.\n• We haven’t seen the peak of inflation just yet.\n• White collar employment bubble from regarded unproductive employees, leading to more/continued layoffs\n• Largest Margin bubble in history, produced by regards who can’t pay their credit cards and autists that use margin to YOLO on FDs.\n\nBurry predicted the cryptocurrency crash, meme crash, SPAQ crash, 2000 crash, 2008 crash, and now the 2022 crash which is just getting started.\n\nThat being said, I will be buying $QQQ and $SPY puts next week.", "id": "ysji3z", "created_utc": 1668193096.0, "score": 243, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 202, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|6 days ago\n**Total Comments**|6|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 days|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ysji3z)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ysji3z)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If I had maintained puts for as long as burry has been calling for another crash, I would already be broke.", "score": 300, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, he has always been talking about a crash.", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "unfortunately this is a blatantly false statement... he has only warned against potential bubbles building in the market and unhealthy investing tactics over the past 10 years that would be problems in the long run... he has only brought up the reckoning of an imminent crash in 2021 because everything he had suggested over the past decade was reaching critical mass... the only reason people mistakenly think hes a doomer is because they are dips that only read headlines on corporate media articles that try to paint him as uninformed and wrong because they always want the upper hand when shit actually hits the fan... unfortunately too many people are dumb as fuck and trust the same people that screw them over and not people like burry who is giving you a massive playbook on how to escape the inevitable recession and where to put ypur money to bet against it.... hes not a \"perma-bear\"... if he was then he would never invest any money in the market or be as successful as he has been", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Everyone knows it will eventually puke.
