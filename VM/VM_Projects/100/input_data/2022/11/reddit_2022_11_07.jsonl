{"title": "The US Northeast Is Hurtling Toward a Winter Heating Crisis", "selftext": "(Bloomberg) -- In the most densely populated corner of the US, temperatures are about to drop after a stretch of unusually warm weather. And the signs of a winter crisis are already multiplying.\n\nHeating oil delivered to New York is the priciest ever. Retailers in Connecticut are rationing it to prevent panic buying. New England’s stockpiles of diesel and heating oil — the same product, taxed differently — are a third of normal levels. Natural gas inventories are also below average. A Massachusetts-based utility is imploring President Joe Biden to prepare emergency measures to prevent a gas shortage.\n\nAdd some cold to the mix, and in the best-case scenario, Northeast consumers will shoulder the highest energy bills in decades this winter. The Biden administration, under pressure to tame prices ahead of the midterm elections, is considering ways to stash more diesel and gasoline in New England. In the worst-case scenario, a cluster of states with a combined economy bigger than Japan’s will run out of fuel to keep the lights on and heat homes and businesses. \n\n“It’s going to be pretty bad,” said Marcus McGregor, head of commodities research at Conning Inc. “Diesel, heating oil and natural gas prices are through the roof. When you’re on a fixed salary, how does it impact your overall budget? It has to be bad.”\n\nThe Northeast is no stranger to fuel constraints. Its dearth of pipelines and refineries means the shale fields of Texas and Pennsylvania might as well be on the other side of the world. But now, a global supply crunch intensified by the war in Ukraine is putting the region at risk of an energy disaster to rival the one menacing Europe. The Northeast will compete with countries across the Atlantic and around the world for fuel to generate power, fill up trucks and keep the cold at bay.\n\nRocky MacDonald, a father of three and realtor in Stoneham, Massachusetts, expects to pay over $500 for heating oil to keep his three-bedroom ranch house warm this winter.  That’s about 20% more than last year. To save money, MacDonald and his wife are cooking dinner at home more often. When they do go out, they skip the bottle of wine.\n\n“I just can’t believe it. The monthly expenses are crazy amounts,” said MacDonald. “I’m trying to hoard every penny.” His family’s total spending has climbed to $10,000 a month from $8,000 last year, and he’s worried that rising interest rates will trigger a housing-market slump, eating away at his income. \n\nFor Rocky and other consumers grappling with historic inflation, the outlook is increasingly dire. Americans are poised to spend the most on heating in at least 25 years this winter, government estimates show.\n\nIn the Northeast, a typical family is expected to pay $1,094 to keep warm with natural gas this winter, 23% more than last year, the Energy Information Administration said. Homes that rely on oil for heat — primarily in New England and the Mid-Atlantic — will be hit even harder, with an average bill of $2,354. Northeast households using propane will spend about $1,970. Low-income consumers will suffer the most.\n\n “Some of the most at-risk people of suffering when heating fuel runs out are immigrants and refugees,” said Jeffrey Thielman, president of the nonprofit International Institute of New England. “We are very concerned about the coming winter.”\n\nThat creates a tricky political calculus for the Biden administration. US energy exports have surged amid pressure to help European allies replace sanction-hit Russian supplies. But Biden is also facing calls to curb such shipments to help consumers at home. For Republicans, inflation has proved to be a potent political weapon: A press release announcing a Donald Trump rally in Pennsylvania this month noted the state’s surging heating oil prices. \n\nSo far, the Biden administration is using one of the few tools it has at its disposal to tackle high pump prices: It’s releasing unprecedented amounts of crude oil from the nation’s emergency reserves. But that can only go so far. US refineries are already running flat out, and without excess capacity to process the crude into usable fuel, the extra oil releases don't do much good.\n\nOf course, much depends on Mother Nature. Meteorologists are predicting relatively mild temperatures for Europe and the Northeast this winter thanks to the weather pattern known as La Nina. Gas prices for next-month delivery have tumbled on both sides of the Atlantic as a warm autumn curtails demand. But in late October, the UK’s national weather service said the country’s chances of a colder-than-normal winter are increasing.\n\nAt the heart of the Northeast’s energy squeeze is natural gas. Even after Pennsylvania’s shale boom brought abundant supplies to the region’s doorstep, constraints have persisted. \n\nThat’s because New England and the Mid-Atlantic are more reliant on gas than ever. Coal-fired power plants have shut in droves, falling victim to environmental opposition and competition from cheap gas. Wind turbines and solar farms haven’t sprouted up quickly enough to replace them. And that bounty of shale gas in Pennsylvania? Concerns about climate change have scuttled plans for pipelines to bring it eastward. The Northeast’s dilemma reveals how the energy transition, at least in the short term, is ratcheting up the pain for consumers. \n\nAlmost half the electricity generated in New England and New York comes from gas. In extreme cold, heating may take priority over running power plants, which keep the lights on.\n\n“The New England region has been on a lousy carousel ride for about a decade now trying to address the risk that comes each winter because of its over-reliance on a single fuel source,” Allison Clements, commissioner for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in an interview.\n\nHeating oil and diesel are also part of the equation. The number of Northeast households that use heating oil has ticked lower as more switch to gas, but that’s little comfort to the almost 20% of homes there that still rely on it. The East Coast, the one US region dependent on foreign imports, has to vie with countries struggling to replace Russian supply.  Refineries from Virginia to New Jersey have shut after failing to compete with larger Gulf Coast rivals.\n\nA diesel shortage, meanwhile, can have devastating economic consequences.  The bulk of consumer goods moves on trucks and trains powered by the fuel, which is also used in manufacturing and food production.\n\nThe Northeast isn’t entirely isolated from oil and gas pumped from other US regions. It can pull supplies from pipelines snaking up from the Gulf Coast and other points west. Heating oil and diesel are also delivered by truck and train. In rare cases, they come by sea, though the law requires that only US-built ships deliver fuel within the country — and there aren’t many of those. \n\nBut in a deep freeze, the Northeast will need more supply from abroad. The bulk of it will come from Canada, and some will come from Europe, a region that will be hard-pressed to export fuel with its own energy security at stake as the continent pivots away from Russia.\n\nOther supplies will arrive from overseas. Cargoes of liquefied natural gas set sail each winter from Trinidad under a long-term contract and arrive at a terminal outside of Boston. Shipments to the East Coast have also come from Nigeria and a handful of other countries. \n\nOn peak days in the winter, as much as 35% of New England’s natural gas supply comes from LNG cargoes, according to New Hampshire utility Unitil Corp. And the US will find itself in competition with buyers from the UK to Japan.\n\nThat’s also true for so-called distillates like heating oil and diesel. Last year, more than a fifth of the East Coast’s supply came from abroad.\n\nEventually, the Northeast may be able to wean itself off foreign fuel by ramping up renewable energy. But in the short term, there’s little relief in sight. \n\n“It’s not gonna be pretty for the consumer,” said Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA.\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-us-northeast-is-hurtling-toward-a-winter-heating-crisis-1.1842673", "id": "yop9sf", "created_utc": 1667832785.0, "score": 1120, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 527, "comments": [{"body": "$10,000 a month expenses, skipping the bottle of wine out to eat must be tough on him.", "score": 1007, "replies": [{"body": "When I read 'skipping the bottle of wine' I did an eyeroll.\n\nThen 10k a month in expenses!?

I see Taycans, Lucids, Mach Es and a bunch of Kia's and Hyundais instead of the parade of Teslas 3 years ago.\n2. Tesla support costs will continue to rise as they don't have a dealership model to lean on.  This will inevitably eat into margins\n3. Tesla will eventually have to lean on marketing more heavily than it does today as the field becomes more crowded.  Today almost all Tesla customers are net new.  At some point, to keep sales up you'll have to entice buyers to return.

{"title": "Wall Street Newsletter S02E04 : The Real Truth about the \"Post Mid terms Santa Claus Rally\" what you should know about.", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b48thfpvxiy91.jpg?width=2970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26da1b2013ac463f4bb955763d102cd5c76273ef\n\n***Respected Traders and Investors,***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you are having a fantastic day. I wasn’t gonna post anything on Sunday but then i realized i have been slacking a lot recently. So today I am gonna bore y’all guys again with another one of my newsletter. It’s highly recommended you read this letter while you’re sober. Now wherever you read it, that’s not my place to say. You can read it in a stripclub or the toilet seat in a bar. I don’t mind at all but what I do mind is you read it, throw it away, forget about it and then later rekt yourself in a trade and then cry about how the market is manipulated and start blaming the people who fed you the narrative be it on Main-Street or Wall Street media. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Remember it’s always advisable to “Do your own research” “This is not financial advice”. So if you rekt yourself it’s your fault not anyone else.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today we are gonna talk about and not only just talk we are gonna visualize the past Santa Claus rally coinciding with the midterms election rally and draw meaningful conclusions from it. This post shall be based on manual interpretation and then finally we are gonna use the analysis what we have drawn to check whether it fits our theory called “The Great Financial Crisis in 99 days” For those who don’t know we released our most anticipated newsletter in a very long while. But unfortunately due to some technical issues with the Turing bot the post cannot be seen on Wsb. So you are advisable to go check my pinned tweet or you can hop on discord to get the letter. It’s completely free of charge but you have to work for it. I’m not gonna share the link here because some of you may find it inappropriate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWithout any further delay let us begin and dive into the visual analysis. An analysis you might have rarely seen on Wall Street.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Mid term x Santa Claus Analysis***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hypothesis :** \n\n\\- Since we are in a bear market then all the analysis should be taking into account a bear market.\n\n\\- We have taken into account that post midterms we are gonna crash till March 2023 so we are gonna look for till December end and the next yr end cases. I know it sounds confusing but you will see later on what I mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Procedure :** \n\nWe will be using the Dow Jones Industrial average since 1896 coz we are the only guys who do every analysis based on the past 120 yr. The vertical will be either in red ( Republicans Presidents ) , blue ( Democratic Presidents )  and gray ( Mid terms elections ). The gray line will have two variables i.e. H suggesting “House” and S suggesting “Senate”. + ve , -ve , = will be seats added, subtracted , or remained the same after election conclusion.\n\nNote : I forgot to remove = later on. So it will be either = +ve or = -ve or = =.\n\nWe also have a 4 points table of Santa, Evil Santa giving info about period b/w mid terms and yr end. And then there is Dragon King and Bull Market giving us info about period after mid terms till next yr end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Experiment :**\n\n1. 1896 - 1904 : \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmztjs8yxiy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ed1c1ce2799f71f90c2dc74493d6e36a12f9dd4\n\nSince we know we are not in a bull market so it makes sense to take bear market analysis. As you can see this contradicts our theory and says it’s after Feb first week you start crashing that means Santa Claus rally is coming but you can also see the power was under Republicans and not Democrats.\n\n**Result : Okay fine. Santa 1 , Evil Santa 0 , Dragon King : 1, Bull mkt : 0**   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2 ) 1904 - 1912 : \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vd19gvs4yiy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f96549f294e37e930185102f8d299fe35e8b5b8\n\nLook at these times. I wonder what was going on here that markets decided to for a lost decade. As you can see markets peaked in 1906 and then it was only until 1916 we went for a bull market. But we don’t care about the lost decade right now. All we care about is Santa. So as you can see our first condition i.e. be in a bear market is fulfilled. So we can do an analysis on this and observe with your own eyes that markets fell either -42% in next yr or just stagnated and went -14% by next yr. No Santa Claus rally here.\n\n**Result : Santa 2, Evil Santa 1, Dragon King 3, Bull mkt : 0**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) 1912 - 1920\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/koqvhaq8yiy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f1efc09817a2c7253227a5458468fcbf0f4afc9\n\n“I hate you i don’t wanna be a bear. I wanna go long with Dems in town” This is the analysis you get after you studying this period. I mean look at that midterms. Even if Biden loses both houses or just one by a -ve seats then the stock market would absolutely rip apart every bear in town. This is the hopium my friend “Tom lee” is smoking. Plus you get the added benefits of being in ⅓ inflationary period of all time. But bears will be like “I wanna exclude the first case because of its bull market”. No we cannot, we were in a bear market but midterms got us out of the bear market. And in the other case, there is no Santa Claus rally but there is a 2023 rally we cannot ignore. Also this election was special because it was the first time since the civil war that Democrats had total control of both houses plus President Wilson became two time serving Democrat since Andrew Jackson in 1828 - 1836.\n\n**Result : Santa 3, Evil Santa 2, Dragon King 3, Bull mkt : 2. And just like that bull mkt scored 2pts in an instant.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) 1920 - 1932\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/avkvw9tdyiy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1701543d422083b9791c1fc2406738bef17c9c76\n\nLook guys, I respect both parties and I have to be neutral. So Republican Presidents were you all asleep during 1920-30. Some of the news guys over here on Wsb who do not know their history would be like hey i wanna see how high that chart went up. Respectfully to those people quit trading and investing. So enough bad jokes. Let’s do this analysis. We are gonna exclude this bull market. You all know why by now. As for bear markets it is what it is even though i don’t want to give a single points to Santa rally but i have to give at-least one. As for dragon king in 2023 it clearly deserves 2 pts.\n\n**Result : Santa 4, Evil Santa 3, Dragon King 5, Bull mkt : 2. And just like that bull mkt scored 2pts in an instant.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) 1932 - 1944\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wa080oipyiy91.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=2477219fb481929d0ba78a54f5ffb890dfdc1587\n\nThe most loved Democratic President having total control of both houses did not have it easy where clowns at the Federal Reserve were running a freak show over 15 yrs of span. But i guess who can blame them when they had to face world war 2. Btw those who don’t know Ben Bernanke won the Nobel prize for understanding the great depression by making crayon drawings like me. Now since I made bears angry in my President Wilson analysis its time to make some bulls angry by calling the first midterms in the bull market. “No you cannot do that. That’s wrong we were in a bear market of depression” You see for me 1936 is the top that will be broken yrs later in the 1940’s decade. If i start taking the Great depression as peak my god we wouldn’t break even till 1954. So it does not make sense. That leaves us with two markets for midterms. The first one kinda fits our previous newsletter analysis where we do three touches and boom. So evil santa and dragon will receive the points here. As for the other depressing market it’s pretty obvious. Also key thing to note is half of inflationary ⅔ 1940-50 decade midterms was the driving force with Democratic president. I feel sad for Republicans being the most hated but they had it coming by sleeping on the wheels.\n\n**Result : Santa 5, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 3. Hmm interesting everyone got a step up.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6) 1944 - 1960\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zxuuwlyyiy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b29b9730bf68b5347c6c757a19164240c08ef2c3\n\nThis if you remember from last analysis is the second half of ⅔ inflationary period i.e. 1940-1950 high inflation. And then I have also added further mid terms. But to be honest I am just gonna  disregard them completely. I mean look at those raging bull markets in mid terms. I am seriously not gonna take the Post World War 2 boom market of 266% of 86 months into consideration engulfing two midterms and the last midterms coninciding b/w the Cold war bull market. Just not happening here. So that leaves us with this complicated puzzle of 1946-1948. We talked about this extensively in the last newsletter. Just look at the Democratic President stuck in a midterms where he will have -ve seats in both house and senate for sure. So I think even though this analysis is suggesting a Wyckoff accumulation beginning from the post midterms till the entire year 2023 with moves like up +14% then down -12% I believe first a -20% capitulation will come ( highlighted in yellow ) since three touches are complete. Seriously if you do your other macro analysis with your ML and AI algorithms you will always find yourself getting caught in this inflationary decade with high debt/gdp ratio. But since i have to adhere to the principles i constructed hence santa and bull market takes the point. Also no lower lows were formed.\n\n**Result : Santa 6, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 4.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7) 1960 - 1980\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2f9j03myyiy91.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=28599239b6be9e009eb06448bf0dac01a06e12c8\n\nThis is the most interesting mid term analysis I have come across. You can also call this 3/3 inflationary high decade. Anybody out there who calls the current market stagflation should do statistical analysis on this and other charts. It’s a slap on the face of everyone who compares 2022 with 1970’s stagflation. In every post midterms rally the market has already bottomed and it continues to go higher by the following year end. Santa Claus rally came in every single post midterms. I also did the average analysis for you guys coz i love you all so much. The answer is +21.66% by December end. And if you do oil and gold analysis the results are gonna be shocking. Btw for bears who are complaining no you cannot take that one or that one. Sorry guys i have to coz we were falling more than 25% in every two yrs creating multiple bear markets. As for why I took the first one. Did you forget about kick starting the bull markets part?\n\n**Result : Santa 11, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 9.**\n\nA freaking 5pt leap by the bull and Santa. Bears bend over now. Tbh guys now you are starting to see why the markets are holding too strong. I think they believe more in the post mid terms rally aka santa claus rally than they believe in Fed pivot. This is what must have caused such bullish returns on post mid terms statistical analysis which is being fed to us in the wall street media.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8 )  1980 - 1996\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytt733j6ziy91.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1248c7966db3df66f30dba953f76e8588a31c8e\n\nWhy was I with bears again? Lol. I mean look at those monstrous next year returns. I mean this is what you really call a booming economy. Joe beans i didn’t mean to offend you if you’re reading this. A monstrous 4pt leap again. Hmm i dont think so. Two of those are in the bull market. The 1990 ( kick started the bull mkt ) and 1994 are the only ones in -20% bear market. Now you’re starting to understand guys why the data is statistically favouring the bulls over bears. But I gotta roll with the analysis. Can’t make unnecessary changes. Sorry bears bend over again to bulls in front of these crazy returns.\n\nAverage return : +25.62% as opposed to +34.45% taking into account Aug 1987 (Those two overlapped returns )\n\n**Result : Santa 13, Evil Santa 4, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 11.**\n\nNow you guys should understand how hard it is to actually be short in the market. Your thesis should be inch precise otherwise you will be caught up in bear hopium and totally forget about riding the bull market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9) 1996 - 2012\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3u5o15j6ziy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba3daf658f3b40170eb7776ff303a61296b7026c\n\nFinally some slow down. Not your monstrous crazy return now from post midterms to next yr end. So you can clearly see two midterms are in the bull market. Remember this is Dow Jones so maybe for Nasdaq this wont hold true coz Nasdaq peaked in 2000 so it was at bear market in 2008 as well. But yk that in Great depression i cancelled out the high bubble part similarly i might have given a pass to dotcom peak as well. Since we know that we cannot take the bull market part so hence we will take bear market and in that one midterms had santa but other one did not. But still bulls get pts as mkt averaged +ve return yet again for next yr end. No points to dragon king in a long time. \n\n**Result : Santa 14, Evil Santa 5, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 13.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10) 2012 - 2022 part \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jm7dzi6ziy91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=29567d21788a581824dc125124bdb88858e97dcf\n\nChanneling my inner bear : \n\nMarket should fall by -89% in all indices. Seriously, I had enough. We had globalization because of Reganomics. Hence the market should go to Regan levels. I am just kidding guys. I thought I might find something useful by doing this analysis but instead I found hopium here. It’s hard to be a bear and if anyone on the Internet professes “it’s so easy to be bearish”  “ohh the market will fall -20% for sure” Tell these guys to show them their calculation otherwise everything is priced in. And if these guys cannot show their calculation they really don’t know anything about markets and hence i call them “Born out of dotcom bubble investors”\n\nOh i totally forgot gotta do these stupid analysis. So as you can see we have never been in a bear market coz we didnt went -20% in Dow Jones. We broke 2008 all time high just after my favorite president of the US got reelected. This 2022 perhaps will be in a long time where we fell more than -20% in Dow indices.\n\n**Result : Santa 14, Evil Santa 5, Dragon King 6, Bull mkt : 13. No points added.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\nAs you can see Santa Claus rally is coming and we will have bull market returns by next yr end from current levels i.e. markets will be higher than $3700 SPX by December 31, 2023. Tbh i don’t believe in this but this was the analysis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Result :**\n\nJust long guys. F these bears. They don’t know anything. Powell will pivot in December fomc 2022 -> market will rip higher with 50bps till when powell keeps rate flat or starts cutting. Disinflation trade will come soon. Cpi makes LL stock mkt will make HH & HL. Tbh i dont believe in this but this was the analysis result. I am not joining the Tom Lee camp period. You guys can join him. And if youre thinking of joining me, well think again about this analysis coz me and “Michael Burry “ will march to hell and has a probability of (6/19)\\* 100% of winning. I think I have forgotten how to calculate probability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBtw i totally forgot to solve\n\nQ. Where are we in regards to this Mid terms X Santa X 2023?\n\nAns. Well for that. Lets take our first initial condition i.e. a bear market. Second condition would be a Democrats and third condition will be high inflation. These all high inflationary bear markets say we have bottomed and the only move is to the upside till end of yr 2023.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Final Thoughts***\n\nSome of you might question if this guy is even human. Who does this kind of analysis rather just write some Python + ML code and then just extrapolate the data. You see guys first of all yes i am human but the thing is I haven’t talked to people like in ages. I just sit in my room and either talk to you or I am just watching an anime, tv show, movie, sports from all across the globe. In short you can say I don’t have a life. My souls are scattered over the Internet and soon it will be on Metaverse. Hence i am bullish on Meta i guess. I am also an old fashioned investor like Gann and Wyckoff who loves crayon drawings over the stock market. I can write code since I was a developer  but I like manual and visual calculations over coding. That goes for my technical analysis as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy your weekend guys.

Your value is currently 5 times what you paid. Last year they put out 900,000. This year they may hit 1.2 million. That is not 5 times the amount of production against 2020. Right now you hold TSLA only if you think it's going to be FIVE TIMES as productive as it was when you bought in. When is that going to happen? Will it ever? We all know Musk sold a whopping 7 billion in TSLA stock to fund his Twitter insanity after lying about not selling any more earlier in the year. If he has to he'll bleed TSLA of value to fund what he thinks is a much more profitable venture with Twitter and big data. Tesla is already overvalued far above competitors who produce more, serve many more customers, and produce more refined and reliable products and customer service. If you buy a Ford and it's got a major problem in the first month (it happens) they hand you another car. Tesla doesn't have them to spare so you spend ages in customer service hell. I want to believe in Tesla in the long run but their very well heeled competitors are catching up. There's blood in the water. As an investor, you have to take care of yourself. Buying, selling, or holding are not philosophical matters. They aren't a statement you're making about what you believe in. It shouldn't be personal. Just make the call. Is the company worth that much? No one is going to care about your investment choices. It's only going to matter to you if you made money. Personally, I think the right call is to get out of stocks run by people who are heavily leveraged and reinvest in financial services that are going to profit mightily as interest rates go up and people with boatloads of cash need help protecting their wealth. Those are the companies that will make you money in the coming years far better than companies that are leveraged. Value is coming out of TSLA and flowing into other companies. I don't believe that is going to help Tesla grow as other manufacturers compete more. TSLA is not as strong as it was ten years ago. Other players are entering the game. If you're up 500% what do you risk sticking around? How much more will it go up when it is obviously going down? TSLA should not have more market cap than companies that sell two, three, or six times as many cars when the only thing going for TSLA is being the only major EV manufacturer for so many years. All these much larger companies have to do is start manufacturing EVs. They don't have a monopoly the instant bigger and more well developed companies start competing. That is happening right now.

What will have an impact on Tesla however Are the hard realities of electric vehicles that are about to roll up and smack the world upside it's head and put it on it's ass. Lithium is extremely toxic to the environment for one, the battery of these vehicles only lasts 5 years and then you have to buy a whole new car- and poison the environment some more when getting rid of the old batteries. I mention this to point out the fact that electric cars are in no way environmentally friendly, which is the main selling point of them So that is kind of a big down factor coming down the pipeline on it's own. A factor that will only be exacerbated as governments continue to push WEF propaganda and agendas such as the electric vehicle movement.  I can go on and continue listing off factors and if you want me to I will, but the short of it is that the future of tesla is looking to be aiming downward.
