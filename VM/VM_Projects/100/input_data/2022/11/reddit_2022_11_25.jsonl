If he started liquidating his position in Tesla, or if he stepped down as CEO, their perceived value will obviously fall. Basically any scenario besides Twitter turning their exponentially growing year/year loses all the way around quickly will result in negative impacts to Tesla because of the way the deal is structured, and the man’s obvious disregard for the social impact of protecting his own interests. \n\nI’d welcome anyone to present me another scenario where the failure of Twitter to flatten losses at the very least will not impact Tesla negatively. I’m not holding a position either way, so my opinion has little weight or cause for bias. But I wouldn’t touch this with a 10’ pole myself until it pans out.
