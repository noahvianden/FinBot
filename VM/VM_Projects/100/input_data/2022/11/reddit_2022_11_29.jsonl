We need legislation to require phone producers to either make their stores completely open to all who want to make apps, or to make their operating systems allow third party app stores to install apps. The fact that you basically can't install third party apps on Apple devices is *utterly ridiculous,* as is the fact that if you get removed from the Apple app store you're basically blacklisted from almost a 5th of all smartphones worldwide and fully *half* of the US market. That's such an easy power to abuse, and as is being discussed around  Twitter they're absolutely willing to wield that power punitively. And to even get onto the app store is a difficult and expensive process. \n\nAnd yeah, I know if they ban an app they're going to cite their TOS. And I don't really care, because one company being a gatekeeper to half of the smartphones in the US is not a good thing, however they justify their gatekeeping with technicalities and legal bullshit. It can both be true that Apple has a legal right to enforce its TOS and also that the immense power they hold over the US smartphone market makes it not right for them to utilize that power. \n\nBut musk can't just say that like a normal person. Nooooo, he has to be a massive asshole about it and make people like me look stupid by association. I've been saying this shit for YEARS and now I sound like I'm skimping for Elon musk and it makes the whole conversation stupid. Twitter is just the latest app to be discussed around this.\n\nAnd the big apps to hit the news because of this have all been either mainly targeted at conservatives or owned by them, first Parker and now Twitter, so most people myself included don't hold a lot of sympathy for them. But that doesn't make it right either. I've been talking about smaller apps for years. My biggest problem with the app store by far is that Apple doesn't allow anyone to put apps on it, they vet every app and if it doesn't meet their standards, your work is in the trash. And if they don't let you on the app store that's 50% of the US market gone. Since they use a different programming language for Apple than Android, it makes choosing to develop an app for iPhone a BIG risk because they could just deny you in the end and you'd be dead on arrival.\n\nIt's all just shitty and I wish musk would shut his stupid mouth.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": ">We need legislation to require phone producers to either make their stores completely open to all who want to make apps, or to make their operating systems allow third party app stores to install apps.\n\nDo you want viruses, spyware, and bloatware?

I can see how overwhelmed/unprepared/unwilling parents turn their kids into monsters quickly.  \n \nThis morning was just one of those mornings haha. And it's funny, you have to remind yourself that a 2 year old is actively learning how to handle emotions and deal with expectations, all while trying to use language poorly to convey those things that they're feeling. What they often tell you is not actually what they want/are upset about etc. But that's tough to deal with sometimes when you're already running behind schedule and your wife has a headache and whatnot. \n \nMost times we would say \"hey bud, I heated up the waffle like you wanted, now it's warm. You can eat it when you're ready.\" And you deal with the 'fallout' from that. If you're consistent in how you handle situations, the fallout is usually very limited. Maybe he gets upset for a few seconds or walks away from the table for a minute. Maybe you redirect him slightly. If you're not consistent, then the kid can become a monster and minor things can become a nightmare. \n \nI just threw it back in the toaster oven to avoid the fight. Not really the right move, but I didn't want to deal with it. If I had a little more presence of mind and asked him a few questions, I would have figured out that he just wanted to hear the toaster oven 'ding' when it was done. He normally eats his frozen waffle cold (who the fuck does that?!) and I'm sure in his mind was something along the lines of \"when you do use the toaster oven, it's not done until it dings\" cause he's always watching what we are doing. If I realized that, I probably could have just said \"oh, do you want me to make it ding? I can make it do that with the knob real quick so you can hear it.\" and he would have been happy. He's normally reasonable as far as toddlers go. \n \nHaving a toddler is a trip.

The goods produced will fortify the strained supply chain, stabilizing core pricing and staving off inflation.

I started an LLC, borrowed about 80k for funding, and did a lot of the electrical work myself. I also forced my significant other to do the painting and GC jobs. Things I didn't want to fuck with, like the roof/plumbing, I contracted out, but I still gave myself a lot of work during what is usually a slow period (winter) for my primary business (and is super profitable, connect the dots). It took a few months and some sweat equity but it was finally ready to be rented out and refinanced. I got two nice families into this duplex and collected rent (well my property manager does ;D) until one family moved out in early 2020.\n\nTenant moved in during Covid and didn't pay me other than what she used to move in. Totally timed the whole bullshit law perfectly and wound up living for free for nearly two years. It totally sucked ass because I couldn't even evict someone who was doing drugs all day and sitting on there ass. Eventually there was an issue with them pissing a junkie off involving gunfire on the premises and BOOM lawyer got rid of them real quick. I had some damages, true, but ERAP eventually payed all back rent and I got a judgement for all the damage done.\n\nDuring that period of time I have been tracking the housing market pretty closely. It always peaks price wise in early spring with summer being still ok and subsequently getting worse until end of winter. So every year, at least in my market, it is better to sell in early spring and buy in dead of winter. What is happening right now happens every year to some extent. Anyone that owns a house and isn't desperate will always sell at their personal best time to sell (IMHO definitely spring but some markets may be different). \n\nWhat happens next? For me personally, I'm ecstatic. As a landlord you make money through rental income (duh), tax write offs, loan paydowns and appreciation. I have a lot of debt so inflation is actually helping me with loan paydowns; the money I owe is much lower compared to what I am now making. I was also able to raise the rent twice since buying, so cash flow is up. I was going for forced appreciation at the start not knowing Covid would fuck the world and TBCH it was already worth doing it for the tax benefits alone. Now I will definitely get fuck tons of appreciation in addition to those tax benefits, also thanks in part to inflation. So as you can see inflation actually helped me in all four ways. \n\nWhen I pay down the mortgage eventually I will take a significantly bigger reverse mortgage and start the whole process over again, since selling is probably the dumbest thing I could ever do. It was a rough year to live through but ultimately it will make me more money in the long run than a \"good year\".", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tbh.
