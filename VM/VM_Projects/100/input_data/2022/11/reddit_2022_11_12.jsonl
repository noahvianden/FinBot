The impact of bonds is that it forms a floor for equity valuations; a company with a PE of 20 has the same annual return as a 5% bond (1/interest rate), because for a 100 dollars worth of the share, the company generated $5.

{"title": "Another massive rally in this Bear Market - Where do we go from here?", "selftext": "So with another massive rally, many people are surely wondering if we've seen the bottom. Personally, I think we've seen the bottom for this year. It would take something new and unexpected to see new lows before end of year in my opinion.\n\nFor now, I think this rally has legs until January. Here's my rationale:\n\n* We've likely reached peak inflation fear now that CPI has started rolling over.\n* Fed rate hike odds and the fear surrounding that has also likely peaked, and appears to be priced in by bonds.\n* More certainty in the markets post mid-term election.\n* Hedge Funds / Money managers who need to \"catch up\" are going to press this thing. I expect a series of higher lows and higher highs like back in June-Aug.\n* Positive seasonal trends (Christmas rally, January effect)\n\nNow this doesn't mean we just rally non-stop, I think there's going to be a lot of chop and ultimately we can top out around S&P 4200. That said, after all that's done and the market has convinced everyone the Bear is dead, that's when we should start seeing the effects of the rate increases on the economy in Q2-4 next year. The only thing that matters at the end of the day are corporate profits and how high interest rates are.\n\nThe average forward P/E on the market over the last 10 years is 17x. That's with effectively 0% interest rates and QE. Before infinite QE and ZIRP, the average P/E multiple was around 15x.\n\nNext year earnings (EPS) for the S&P are expected to be at around 230, so at S&P 4000 we're trading at a 17.5x forward P/E multiple (historically high).\n\nEarnings will likely come down in 2023 as higher interest rates work their way through the economy. Looking at Analyst estimates for next year EPS, The Bear case is EPS of 200, Base case is 215, and Bull case is 230. \n\nUsing the Base Case middle of the road EPS range for next year (215), let's assume a 16x multiple (which makes sense in a higher interest rate environment). That would put the fair value of the S&P for 2023 around 3440.\n\nObviously there's much more to it than just P/E, but this is the framework I'm using to think about the potential trading range we could expect in the coming months.

In other words, the value of each dollar lost in those $50,000 is greater than the value of each dollar in the $50 pile, because of both the lost opportunities that $50,000 enables and the time it takes to recover it.\n\nHowever, for someone who's already very wealthy, the value of the dollars are the same, so it bears the same risk/reward ratio.\n\nThe one amendment I might add is that earlier, I suggested that the \"reward\" side is fixed, but that's not _quite_ accurate. It's possible that a large sum could have greater value-per-dollar than a small sum, such as if it'll be used to start another income stream (e.g., start a business).\n\nBut yes, when you start factoring in opportunity costs and individual desires and incomes, the value of a dollar changes.\n\nFor me right now, $50 is a value I can lose or gain without much thought, but losing $50,000 hurts a lot more than gaining $50,000, since I have a $30,000 loan that will be hit with absurd interest if it's not paid by EoY.

{"title": "Tesla officially makes its charging standard available to other companies in the U.S.", "selftext": "Tesla is sharing its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America.\n\nTesla said in a blog post Friday that its design and specification files are available for download. The company said it is “actively working with relevant standards bodies to codify Tesla’s charging connector as a public standard.”\n\nThe charging connector in all Tesla vehicles offers AC charging and up to 1 MW DC charging. Its compact design and performance is considered superior to the Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors used by most EVs in North America.\n\nTesla claims that its charging connector and charge port — which it now calls the North American Charging Standard (NACS) — is the most common charging standard in North America. It’s a stat based on Tesla vehicle sales in North America and the number of chargers at its branded Supercharging stations. Tesla has nearly 1,500 Supercharger stations in the United States. Each station has an average of nine chargers.\n\nTesla didn’t name any automakers or charging infrastructure companies as converts. In this highly competitive environment, in which virtually every automaker is now using the CCS, it’s hard to see GM, Ford and Stellantis switching to Tesla’s technology.\n\nHowever, at least one company — EV startup Aptera — supports the move. Earlier this year, Aptera called for the U.S. government to adopt Tesla’s Supercharger technology as the standard for all EV charging in the country. And EVGo has added Tesla connectors to some of its charging stations in the United States.\n\nThe company said in the blog post that network operators “already have plans in motion” to incorporate NACS at their chargers. If network providers like ChargePoint, EVConnect or Electrify America add NACS, it would allow Tesla owners to charge at these stations without a need for an adapter.\n\nIf automakers switch to NACS on its EVs, it would give owners of those vehicles access to Tesla’s North American Supercharging and destination charging networks. \n\nSource:  https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/11/tesla-opens-its-ev-connector-design-to-other-automakers/", "id": "ytlgev", "created_utc": 1668295064.0, "score": 2082, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 311, "comments": [{"body": "If the past is any indication the entire world will settle in a standard and the US will have a totally different, incompatible one.", "score": 892, "replies": [{"body": "They already have.

{"title": "You’re all a bunch of sheep", "selftext": "*Short term noise*\n\nA stock falls 5% and everyone screams to buy the dip like a Tostitos salesman, but during a bear market everyone thinks the world is ending. $TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. \n\nThe twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it’s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it’s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. \n\nElon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it’s stress maybe he’s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I’ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that’s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that’s not what I’m debating here. \n\n*”DD”*\n\nTesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. \n\nSo Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. \n\nTesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That’s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don’t look like a car maker. \n\nPeople love to talk about build quality. Clearly it’s not effecting sales but regardless it’s getting better and it’s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you’re delusional, it’s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. \n\nCheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from “luxury” but it’s durable and practical. For $50k it’s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it’s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don’t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. \n\nFord has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. \n\nVW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They’re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we’ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. \n\nTesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. “Some years will be a little less some will be a little more.” Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. \n\nSo the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. \n\nThe economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don’t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won’t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it’s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who’s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.\n\nChina is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They’re moving into Europe, I don’t see them moving to North American markets soon. It’s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they’re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I’d buy their stock if they weren’t IOUs from the CCP. \n\nI haven’t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn’t include  FSD because it’s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don’t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. \n\nThanks for listening to my TED talk, ik reading is hard.

I see you guys posting some serious gains a lot of the time and wanted to know what everyone thinks. I was reading an article this morning about META being at a historically low price in terms of value. I just want to know, do you guys think its time to start looking to deploy capital into some of these great stocks that are down 80-90%? Or do you think that things will keep on falling.\n\nI'm making this post to try and have a \"civil\" discussion on where we think the overall market is headed in the near term. Lets say one years time. Is it too early to start looking for these potential great opportunities in the market or is the time now. I know last week the inflation report came out lower then expected, but Its still very high compared to the historic average. That got me wondering if it was just a rally because we havent seen any form of good news in so long that even half good half bad news is enough to cause a significant rally? Anyways when im talking about opportunities, im referring to stuff like they outlined in this article I read this morning, basically it was showing that some stocks are at ridiculously low levels compared to value. The example used was META, its trading at the same price as in 2015 but now its doing $27B in revenue compared to $4B and the EPS in like 5X or 6X higher. I can drop the link to the article I guess, but im really here to discuss the future of the market.
