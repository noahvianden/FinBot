Musk warns of Twitter bankruptcy:** [https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-information-security-chief-kissner-decides-leave-2022-11-10/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-information-security-chief-kissner-decides-leave-2022-11-10/)\n\nOk, there's already a lot that has been said about how negative Twitter has been to TSLA. But I think people are still undestimating just how much worse it can get.\n\nTesla investors are definitely pissed at this deal. One, it drives Elon's focus away from Tesla. Two, it forced Elon to sell TSLA. Three, if Twitter can't shore up its cash flow, Elon will likely have to keep selling TSLA to fund Twitter.\n\n**Elon's erratic behavior is showing more than ever**\n\nI used to think that Elon would make Twitter better. Now I'm not sure. His erratic behavior is showing up more than ever.\n\nHe cut half of the engineering staff, realized Twitter needed some fired engineers, while trying to cram untested monetization features into production. He's flip flopping on ideas within hours.\n\nHis ideas are half baked. For example, plenty of people got verified as [Lebron James, Trump, Nintendo, Jesus, etc.](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23450289/twitter-impersonators-official-mario-musk-jesus-valve) The site is losing its credibility fast which will scare advertisers.\n\nUsers are also complaining about obvious bugs and issues. It's just the beginning.\n\nWorse, people are seeing live how Elon builds products and it's probably scaring Tesla investors that this is how he does things: half baked ideas, empty promises, erratic.\n\n**Twitter's debt repayment is huge and Elon will have to continue to sell TSLA to fund it**\n\nTwitter's debt payments are around \\~$1b/year according to some reports. Elon really needs Twitter to start turning the ship around fast and start becoming profitable. It looks like he's trying to throw anything at the wall to get Twitter to increase profits asap.\n\nIf advertisers continue to pull out, he's going to have continue to sell his TSLA shares.\n\nHe leveraged his Tesla shares to borrow to buy Twitter. If TSLA drops, he's going to have to provide more collateral or get margin called.\n\n**Elon probably doesn't know how to run a social media company**\n\nIt's increasingly looking like Elon does not know how to run a social media company. For example, he's demanding changes based solely on his opinion instead of running A/B tests to quantify the change. As someone who ran a ton of A/B tests for a product similar to Twitter's, there can be a lot of unintended consequences when it comes to monetizations. IE. It looks like your change increased revenue by 3% but it drops total revenue by 5% after 2 months.\n\n**tldr:** Musk desperately orders features in and out. Advertisers pull out or sit on the sidelines. Revenue falls. Musk tries even more desperate things. More advertisers leave.

Elon didn't cut 'half' of Twitter's engineering staff. Namely, a large % of them were already planned to be laid off before Elon took over. Hence, why Meta is also planning on laying off thousands of workers. It's an industry layoff. In Twitter's case, these workers were not needed because the projects that they had been working on were scrapped, thus, they aren't going to be working on Twitter's future plans. Most people in the tech community will tell you that they haven't been working much while at home. There's a reason... they really aren't adding much value to the overall company.

{"title": "$FLNG - Hold Onto Your Gas, Winter Is Coming", "selftext": "# Table of Contents\n\n1. Intro\n2. Supply & Demand\n3. Russia\n4. $FLNG\n5. Honorable Mentions\n\n# 1. Intro\n\nSup Sluts.\n\nBefore we begin, here is a very well organized database on Europe Energy Statistics Qualitatively sorted and it is critical that you comb through this, like I did, and understand every aspect and trend of this data...\n\n[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/data/database](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/data/database)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaha! just kidding you fuckers, none of that has anything to do with this play and I know none of you are going to read that anyway. I bet you aren't even reading this. Luckily all the bullshit commodity autistic research doesn't need to be done here because it is an indirect play on Liquid Natural Gas.   [Watch this instead if you're illiterate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AySC0LbRP7M&ab_channel=BloombergQuicktake%3AOriginals) \n\n# TL;DR:\n\nI'm not going to make you scroll to the bottom. Consider yourself spoiled.\n\nThis is a DD on a stock called $FLNG - Flex LNG. Uppies. They ship ~~Lickwafied~~ ~~liquafied~~ Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) via shipping vessels to Europe, and they are about to be in big demand. Europe wants to dump their toxic dealer Russia but can't quit cold turkey because they depend on the export of that gas like a degenerate gambling addict depends on a winning powerball ticket to see his kids again. Luckily, America is ready to answer the call, and make some good money while stepping in and becoming the new provider of LNG. I'm going to write out how we make money on it.\n\nAlright, so there is this stuff called Natural Gas. It comes out of the ground or whatever. It is used to generate electricity for a multitude of things such as light and heat. A lot of people waste their time trying to make money off of it. The big thing is Europe needs it. I would rather make money off the shipping of LNG than the production or rarity of the commodity itself, especially with rumors of price control on oil and gas. Big 🧠 stuff.\n\n# 2. Supply & Demand\n\nFirst, Europe consumes a shit load of this stuff, and they don't produce it themselves. They import it. They have been importing it so long, the entire continent, cities, and surrounding infrastructure were built on it. Wood burning in the cities have slowly been made illegal. Houses and apartments phasing out fireplaces. All part of the Agenda for the new world, which ideally, would never see a shortage of this stuff. Unfortunately, this has become an Achilles heel for Europe. LNG is an essential part of life, and SURVIVAL for European winters. Experts know this. They have been hurriedly trying to estimate and curb their usage in the past few months because the supply is dwindling and could become dangerously low. Then, to make matters worse, God goes and does this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Article Date is Oct 31st 2022](https://preview.redd.it/g9ybhhq5v5z91.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3f2aece46d4e94c2c4219320a6c68f8bde473f)\n\nNext, you need to understand the level of dependency Europe has on imported LNG. Basically, All of these countries need imported gas, and the demand is growing:\n\n>In 2021, the EU’s natural gas [Import Dependency](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/using-human-centered-trade-policies-to-end-violence-in-africa/95718) rate was **83%**... The impact of a potential import disruption needs to take into account the importance of natural gas in the overall energy mix. While the import dependency in Sweden, Finland and Estonia is near **100%**, the share of natural gas in the energy mix is relatively low (3%, 7% and 8% respectively). By contrast, the highest share of natural gas in the energy mix is in Italy (40%) and its import dependency is **94%**. The Netherlands has the 2nd highest share of natural gas in its energy mix, however its import dependency is much lower, due to its domestic production of natural gas. When compared with 2020, the largest increases in the dependency rate on natural gas imports were recorded in Malta (\\[increased\\] **from 96% in 2020 to 104% in 2021; +8 pp**), Ireland (**\\[increased\\]from 64% to 71%; +7 pp**) and Romania (**\\[increased\\] from 17% to 24%; also +7 pp**). At the other end of the scale, the largest decreases were recorded in Latvia (from 121% to 61%; -59 pp), Austria (from 73% to 51%; -22 pp) and Slovakia (from 88% to 69%; -20 pp). [Source 1](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20220419-1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Italy gotta boil da noodles👨‍🍳](https://preview.redd.it/9fdm5eg8v5z91.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e749e4cfcd47dd78e289a9917638dfa5455bf2c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn top of this, you have outrageous historic price gouging of European gas. [European Gas prices have soared above 340 euros ($332.6) per megawatt hour in late August, but this week dipped below $100 for the first time since Russia cut supplies. Before the war, the price had been as low as 30 euros.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/wave-of-lng-tankers-overwhelms-europe-and-hits-natural-gas-prices.html)\n\nSo how do you bring down the cost if you can't bring down the demand? You increase the supply! But we have ANOTHER problem...\n\n# 3. Russia\n\nRussia has been the main supplier via pipeline for a while now.\n\n>As for this year alone, \"Imports of ***Russian*** liquefied natural gas (LNG) into Europe and the United Kingdom rose by nearly 20% between March and October this year compared to the same period in 2021, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. \" Europe in the summer ramped up imports of ***Russian*** liquefied natural gas (LNG) this year trying to bring their storage to full capacity.\n\nWhat is full capacity? What happens when Europe reaches it? Check it out:\n\nHere is a \"live\" look at the storage capacity of LNG. You will see they are almost filled.\n\n[Live Chart of Europes Capacity of LNG](https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/EUROPE-GAS/zdvxozxzopx/)\n\nBut wait, isn't this a DD saying that we should invest in a company that ships LNG? It seems like Europe is full and doesn't need any more. The fleet will just be sitting in the water. 🤔\n\nAs a matter of fact, LNG boats are already sitting in the water. Europe is so full of LNG they can't possibly take any more. Stuffed to the brim. I'm an idiot for suggesting this play. Oh wait, their storage capacity is **still** not enough for them to make it to Spring. In fact for the EU, 85% of gas storage filled equals to 22.5% of the EU's **annual** consumption. This means that if everyday was perfect spring day, they'd have enough LNG for \\~82.125 Days (2.6 months) by the most conservative estimates. But it's not going to be a perfect spring day. It's going to be a hellacious winter requiring constant supply of LNG to keep price stability during a major recession, and the experts know it. It could turn deadly very quickly.\n\n>While the Russian share in Europe's LNG imports has decreased since the war began, the European Union still imported **11.8 million tons** of LNG from Moscow between **March and October** this year. That is **2 million tons more than in the same period in 2021**. The EU needs Russian LNG, so it is convenient for them to turn a blind eye on \\[Russian\\] LNG, while Russia continues to enjoy \\[the\\] revenues… so far, this LNG has been going mostly under the radar.\n\nThis was conveniently handled via [Pipelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0z8S2ZjSmc&ab_channel=Qyatryusjy-7577). Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipeline connects (connected) Germany and Russia. But it was recently taken out of commission....\n\n>Putin claimed that \"Anglo-Saxons\" in the West have turned from imposing sanctions on Russia to \"terror attacks,\" sabotaging the pipelines in what he described as an attempt to \"destroy the European energy infrastructure.\"\n\n[Europe’s Lack Of LNG Import Capacity Becomes Everyone’s Problem](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2022/10/18/europes-lack-of-lng-import-capacity-becomes-everyones-problem/?sh=3bbab6ab30e9)\n\n[Europe still can’t live without this Russian energy export](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/energy/russian-lng-imports-europe/index.html)\n\n[Pipeline Sabotage Suspicions Strengthen: Swedish Probe Finds ‘Detonations’ Caused Nord Stream Leak](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2022/10/06/pipeline-sabotage-suspicions-strengthen-swedish-probe-finds-detonations-caused-nord-stream-leak/)\n\nRussia is the world’s fourth-largest LNG producer, and you can bet your ass that Europe absolutely hates being dependent on them. It's like hey I know we are sanctioning you and trying to pressure you into stopping your war with Ukraine, but I need that gas and I'll pay you WHATEVER you want. It's kind of sad. Like hating your ex's guts, but the sex is too damn good. But there is good news! *The biggest swinging dick/Big titty goth gf is ready to rock Europe's world.*\n\n# Quick recap:\n\n* Europe needs LNG\n   * Like... a lot.

I saw the energy prices in Europe skyrocketing as well and thought, \"Gee Willikers that isn't sustainable\". They either need to find an alternative source of energy or let Russia have Ukraine. Interestingly enough, I found out that [Virginia Foxx(R)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Foxx#Committee_assignments) was investing in them. (I think we figured out who sabotaged that pipeline!). This got me down the rabbit hole of possible scenarios coming this winter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qw91b9wiv5z91.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=4992ac887f82e40cb1ad33c1aab30a31c16b23f2\n\n[So, Let's Meet The Fleet](https://www.flexlng.com/fleet-list/)\n\n13 ships, The earliest built in 2018. Low maintenance, sturdy, and ready to sail. You can FUCKING tell right away that this FUCKING website is pretty FUCKING professional. I literally went through and read every page they have under \"About Us\" and \"Shipping\" and I can tell they are ready for the future with green house gas compliant ships and a team of smart folks leading the way. It's extremely transparent for shareholders too, and I feel kind of warm and fuzzy looking at it. They also offer some pretty good and consistent dividends, which is surprising.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[In this Economy!?](https://preview.redd.it/zno3az0kv5z91.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=66b1af12304edbf881c99f05868b5ce1dcc3979f)\n\nThey have a list of podcasts that you can listen to, and nerdy stuff as well. You really should give it about 3 minutes. They even have a section for their stock chart. Speaking of which:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The \\\\\"X\\\\\" is Feb 24th, when Russia invaded Ukraine.

As winter approaches, we see lower lows. My play right now is ATM calls out to February, but if the CPI report tanks the market, I may just swap for shares because I believe in my thesis, and I like dividends 👴. Lower lows, winter coming, and this 2 days ago (which hasn't been priced in yet) [UK cuts deal with US for LNG to help get through winter without Russian fuels](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/uk-cuts-deal-with-us-for-lng-to-help-get-through-winter-without-russian-fuels/ar-AA13QBCJ).\n\nI am pretty sure this play is completely under the radar. Which is how some people like it. Global politics and economics and sabotage and backdoor deals with ostracized superpowers kind of makes the perfect storm for stocks such as this. As always, do you own due diligence. Maybe I found a gold mine, maybe I found a dud.
