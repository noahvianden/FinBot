Tesla did $3.3B in net income in Q3. Even ignoring how the quarter was suppressed because they stopped pushing for end-of-quarter deliveries, growing that at 50% a year for 5 years gives you a quarterly earnings of $25B (20% more than Apple currently does), or annual earnings of $100B.\n\nAt Tesla's current valuation, that would be a PE of 7. Even if you expect the growth rate to fall off to 30% after that, that's still a PEG of 0.23.

I agree there is currently a clear lack of supply for cars. I think supply chain issues is indeed one part, but that an even bigger part is how lots of people no longer want an ICE car, but there aren't enough EVs available to satisfy demand so people are just waiting with buying their next car. Especially in the budget and middle segments.  So I believe once that supply shortage is addressed, auto sales will start to recover.\n\nThat said, I also think more people are starting to realise they don't really need a car. Especially in Europe/China and cities in general. Once autonomous cars come around this will only accelerate. On the other hand, robotaxis will also be cars that need to be sold, which could increase car sales as there is more demand for ride hailing, or decrease demand as there are more people sharing the same amount of cars. It's extremely difficult to predict imo.\n\nSo for my Tesla valuation, I focus on \"How many cars can Tesla produce?\" and \"Can they sell all cars they produce?\". With the EV supply shortage for years to come, I think the answer to the second is obviously yes. Especially since Tesla has the best specs by far compared to the price, and the highest margins they can cut if necessary (where as other OEMs are already losing money on their already more expensive EVs).\n\nSo for next year, I look purely at how much they'll be able to build. I'm expecting between 2 and 2.6M vehicles. 540-640K from Fremont, 1-1.1M from Shanghai, 250-460K from Berlin and 190-400K from Texas.\n\nFor 2030, this projection is definitely a lot more difficult. I'm expecting anywhere between 8.8M and 18M, depending on how well the compact car catches on, and with my base case around 13.4M.\n\nFor the non core business, I'm working with rough estimations for energy, supercharging and insurance. For energy I think we'll be able to start modelling a bit more accurately after the next few quarters, as this business is finally no longer being held back by battery supply constraints.\n\nFor Software sales, I'm calculating the amount of Teslas on the road by 2030, multiplying that by the FSD take rate and price (ranging from 10% to 80% in the worst and best cases) and assigning an 80-90% software margin to it.\n\nSo for my $2400 2030 price target, I'm expecting ~50% to come from automotive, 25% from Energy, 15% from FSD, and 10% from other businesses. In the bull case, obviously FSD would be a much bigger percentage (~35%).\n\n> I am not sure next year on numbers, but I think mine look a bit more conservative than yours where i'm giving him a slower top line growth (to be conservative). However, I think he gets margin expansion. I think raw material costs and supply chain are dramatically better for him in all markets except the Berlin factory with freight charges going down.\n\n> Does that seem right to you? How are you thinking about that or are you more focused on valuation from a P/Sales basis? Do you think it will start to be more a Profitability based valuation that gets noticed or do you have some other framework?\n\nAs you can see above, I try to stay away from P/S as much as possible. Imo it's too unreliable, especially for a company whose biggest asset is its high efficiency and margins. So definitely more profitability based.\n\nI do agree what you describe is a possibility, although I find margins/ASPs a bit difficult to predict right now. You've got huge new incentives (at least in the US), improving efficiency and economies of scale, easing supply chain issues and materials pricing, new technologies at Berlin/Texas, FSD revenue appreciation, etc. putting upwards pressure on margins, but you've also got the upcoming recession putting downwards pressure on ASPs and consequently margins.\n\nSo right now I expect ASPs to come down a little bit, while margins will stay roughly flat ~16-20%.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "OMG. that's super helpful!!\n\nThank you so much for sharing how you're thinking about it.

I also am not entirely sure on the impact of Cybertruck/Semi yet. As in, does this mean they'll make fewer units (1 semi instead of 3 cars for example?) or will they be able to do both since the factory is so absolutely enormous?\n\nAs for European energy, Europe and Germany currently have their gas supply almost completely filled up. I believe it was already confirmed there were no industry restrictions expected for this winter unless it's a very extreme winter. Next year, I think Europe will largely have substituted their need for Russian energy with LNG, although I do agree that the European energy situation is a massive shit show that easily could (and should) have been avoided.\n\n> On your last comment, I hadn't thought about the impact to ASP if there was a reduction in raw material cost.

Turns out your *peers* are pretty dumb.\n\n**The top upvoted comment trying to prove me wrong can be disproven by a ten second GOOGL - but you won’t do that. You’ll just upvote it and continue losing money on a shit investment rather than actually doing some DD for once.**\n_____\n\nRyan Cohen as CEO and Chairman of the board of GameStop has what is known as a **fiduciary duty** to it's shareholders.  This is a legal requirement inherent in most every board/executive position in any business.  Business 101.  In fact, shareholders can sue if they believe directors and officers are breaching their fiduciary duty.\n\nIn a nutshell, fiduciary duty is all about ensuring that board members never allow any outside interests or personal affiliations or allegiances to interfere with their responsibility to shareholders.  Which of course means working towards a profit and value return to those shareholders.\n\nIt goes without saying that this means that the Chairman must defend the company from certain things, including even hostile take over.  For example we've seen the \"poison pill\" discussed a lot this year - a nuclear option board members have actually considered using to protect shareholders.\n\nApes claim hedgies are attacking GameStop through naked shorts etc and that Ryan Cohen knows.\n\n**Therefore, Ryan Cohen is a hedgie.**\n\nProof:\n\n1.\t⁠Directors and officers of a corporation have the duty to stop interference from outside forces.\n2.\t⁠If they do not, then they have breached their fiduciary duty.\n\n\n1.\t⁠Hedgies are interfering with GameStop. A board has a fiduciary duty to take action to stop the interference.\n2.\t⁠Ryan Cohen is the Chairman of the Board of GameStop.\n\n\n1.\t⁠**Therefore, Ryan Cohen has a duty to stop the hedgie interference.**\n2.\t⁠Speaking publicly about CRIME would not only help stop the interference, but also protect and inform shareholders.\n3.\t⁠**Therefore, not speaking publicly about CRIME is a breach of his fiduciary Duty to GameStop (this one's extra, not needed for the proof, but serves as an example)**\n\n\n1.\t⁠Ryan Cohen has not stopped hedgie interference.\n2.\t⁠**Therefore, Ryan Cohen has breached his fiduciary duty to GameStop Shareholders.**\n\n\nBut why?  There's only two explanations.  1) He just sucks at this.  2)  He is working for the hedgies.  Well, three explanations.

October 2021 was actually just the start of stronger mom increases of inflation so now that's having the opposite effect.

{"title": "Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Ken Griffin are sounding the alarm on US recession. Here are 12 economic warnings from BSDs. Idiots or agree?", "selftext": "**1.** **Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and executive chairman:**\n\n\"The economy does not look great right now. Things are slowing down, you're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors. The probabilities say if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon. Take as much risk off the table as you can. Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.\"\n\n\"The probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches.\"\n\n**2.** **Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter:**\n\n\"There's going to be probably a year or two of serious recession.\"\n\n\"Frankly, the economic picture ahead is dire, especially for a company like ours that is so dependent on advertising in a challenging economic climate.\"\n\n**3.** **Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel:**\n\n\"For the Fed to truly conquer inflation here, we're going to put unemployment somewhere in the mid-4% range. I find it hard to believe we're not going to have a recession at that point in time, sometime in the middle to back half of 2023.\"\n\n**4.** **Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's business partner and vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway:**\n\n\"I think the Fed is willing to have a little recession in order not to have out-of-control inflation. That's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to be the one guy at the party that doesn't hang around the punch bowl getting drunk.\"\n\n**5.** **Carl Icahn, chairman of Icahn Enterprises:**\n\n\"Whenever you have higher interest rates that have moved as they have here, you have an inverted yield curve, Treasuries at close to a 5% yield — you are going to have a recession. And I think we do have a recession already. There's a lot of things that have to happen to turn this economy around, to get us out of a recession.\"\n\n**6.** **Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan:**\n\n\"There's a possibility of a mild recession. Consumers are in very good shape, companies are in very good shape. And there's a possibility of something worse, mostly because of the war in Ukraine and oil price and all things like that.\"\n\n**7.** **David Solomon (AKA DJ SOL), CEO of Goldman Sachs:**\n\n\"Generally, when you find yourself in an economic scenario like this, where inflation is embedded, it's very hard to get out of it without a real economic slowdown. The US is most likely going to have a recession.\"\n\n**8.** **Jeff Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO:**\n\n\"Recession is easily 60% in the next six-to-eight months, and for the year 2023, I'd put it at more like 80%.\"\n\n**9.** **Leon Cooperman, CEO of Omega Advisors:**\n\n\"The combination of Fed tightening, quantitative tightening, a strong dollar, and the price of oil will create a recession in the second half of 2023. We've pulled forward demand because of very inappropriate fiscal and monetary policies, and ultimately a price is going to be paid.\"\n\n**10.** **Greg Jensen, co-CIO of Bridgewater Associates:**\n\n\"We are expecting a much bigger recession than the markets are expecting. 2023 will likely be the year of a very significant global recession.\"\n\n\"You probably won't see the bottom of the equity markets until they begin easing, six to seven months from now. You probably won't see the end of the bottom of the economy for another nine months or so after that.\"\n\n**11.** **Nouriel Roubini, NYU Stern economist known as \"Dr. Doom\":**\n\n\"History suggests it's going to be near mission impossible to avoid a hard landing. You're going to get not only inflation, not only a recession, but what I call the 'Great Stagflationary Debt Crisis.' So it's much worse than the '70s, and it's probably as bad as during the Global Financial Crisis.\"\n\n**12.** **Ken Rogoff, Harvard economist:**\n\n\"You really have to look at the world, which is in bad shape. It's very hard for the United States to resist that. I worry that not only are we going to get a mild recession, I think the chances that we get a significant recession are really pretty high.\"", "id": "z0eplx", "created_utc": 1668976991.0, "score": 250, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 172, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|59|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z0eplx)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z0eplx)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \n>TL;DR: Many experts are predicting a recession in the next few years.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "O'leary is still waiting for something to capitulate the crash, tried to martyr himself.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Given they’re all saying it I’m fully expecting a Christmas rally before it all dumps to shit then.", "score": 247, "replies": [{"body": "Let sure hope so.
