{"title": "Fed’s Bullard says rate hikes have had ‘only limited effects’ on inflation so far. Says funds rate upper bound could be closer to 7%.", "selftext": "St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Thursday the central bank still has a lot of work to do before it brings inflation under control. A voting member on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, Bullard delivered remarks centered on a rules-based approach to policymaking. Using standards set by Stanford economics professor John Taylor, Bullard insisted that the moves the Fed has made so far are insufficient. Even using assumptions he characterized as “generous” regarding the progress the Fed has made so far in its inflation fight, he noted in a series of slides that “the policy rate is not yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently restrictive.” “To attain a sufficiently restrictive level, the policy rate will need to be increased further,” he added in the presentation.\n\nThere’s little if any dissent on the Fed over whether rates need to continue to rise. Most members have suggested a few more increases over the next several months that will take the central bank’s benchmark overnight borrowing rate to around 5% from its current target range of 3.75%-4%. However, Bullard’s presentation argued that 5% could serve as the low range for the where the funds rate needs to be, and that upper bound could be closer to 7%. That is well out of sync with current market pricing, which also sees the fed funds rate topping out around 5%. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/feds-bullard-says-rate-hikes-have-had-only-limited-effects-on-inflation-so-far.html", "id": "yxqd7u", "created_utc": 1668691943.0, "score": 1418, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 319, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To finance WW2, the government had to raise an insane amount of debt, and on a relative scale was much more than during the pandemic. They did this by issuing bonds with the help of the Fed. The Fed bought up a lot of these bonds and held rates at near zero to make this cheaper for the Treasury. While the Fed was increasing the money supply, wartime policies were suppressing a lot of consumer demand. The war destroyed a lot of critical infrastructure and supply chains, so that when the war ended, you had the perfect storm of pent up demand being released from the soldiers returning home and restrictions being lifted (similar to the world reopening following Covid), supply chains severely distrusted (like Covid), and easy monetary policy to fund the war/stimulate the economy.

These things are not happening on a wide scale because the domestic supply is fine, and refining capacity is a far more massive bottleneck than domestic oil production considering we haven't built a new refinery since fucking Jimmy Carter. We get 95% of our oil from either domestic or Canadian markets, and we refine pretty much all of both ourselves; If you add the ~12.5 million barrels from the U.S and ~5 million barrels from Canada, you end up almost exactly at U.S refining capacity, which is about 18 million bpd.

Really?", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just a smooth brain’s two cents, but I think OP is onto something. \n\nFor anyone who can’t read, the underlying of VIX options is the implied volatility of SPY options. Upward movement in the VIX represents heightened expectations of unpredictability in price action on the part of market makers. Aka, the motherfuckers who allow us to trade options make those options more expensive when they don’t know which direction the price is gonna go. VIX goes up when their uncertainty and “fear” goes up. The question is why were market makers unable to make a decision on how stable price action was expected to be over time back in 08’? Aka, the little bumps on both charts. \n\nOne answer my guys is that they were becoming more aware the entire market was bullshit: the housing bubble (etc) and delusional optimism transformed into abject terror as the reality of an equities pop reflected itself more and more in hard economic data (joblessness, higher consumer debt-income ratios, etc). More specifically, they lost hope in the fed’s ability to control the market and everybody ran for the door. Also, It wasn’t just, “oh shit, the markets going down, better sell more expensive puts.” It was more like, “oh shit, it’s mostly going down, but it also blasts back up for a day, why can’t the fed control this? I don’t want any part of this shit.” For those that traded in March of 2020 does that sentiment sound familiar?\n\nThe fed stepped in during COVID and assuaged fear by blasting the markets with trillions in equity. JPOW printed an ungodly and irresponsible amount of dough that not only enriched our wife’s boyfriend, but even left some over for us. Remember GameStop? I remember 9/10ths of the sub saying “lol, sHoRtSQuuEze, DFV’s okay, but you’re all idiots!” Right up to the point that it rocketed into the legendary story of a thousand smooth-brains in the premarket chat watching it gamma ladder into infinity with a mighty, singular, autist roar. \n\n\nSo. Anyways. Did Jpow’s money printer make any of the raw economic indicators any stronger? \n\nNot to sound like a fucking communist, but anyone making less than $60,000 a year right now is in the majority of households and that number is growing exponentially. It’s showing up in raw data and inflation because consumer demand can’t keep up with equity inflated supply. I guess pumping money into ArkK’s holdings and making the cybertruck didn’t do much for Jim Bob and Mary-Jane Rotten Crotch on mainstreet. It was on the front page today that fewer consumer goods are being shipped to the U.S this year than the year before it. This is an example of where company’s have enough equity on hand to invest in their own goods, but consumers can’t afford them, so the shipments dry up. It’s also a vicious cycle and eventually deflates the top of the economy. Bubble goes pop!\n\nWe’re seeing MMs doing the same song and dance they did in 08’. One week they’re confident the fed is in control and the next week they’ve changed their minds completely. But can the fed really hold onto investor confidence as the bottom of the economy falls out? OP is onto something because a hill pattern in the vix represents slipping investor confidence in the fed’s ability to control price action. Also. Look at a fucking 20 year chart on SPY. Do you seriously think we’ve found the bottom of what would be a reasonable rate of growth for the global market since 2008? It looks like we’ve climbed down the first slope of the Matterhorn’s summit and are staring off a thousand foot cliff. \n\nYou get the point. Time to fap. \n\nTL;DR: The comparison of charts is meaningful. MMs are getting more and more confused at the feds ability to control downward price movement.
