At the very least, comparing the bid at open to the bid at the current date will give you a more accurate idea of the change in contract price over time.\n\n* Your delta is low. Sure, for a $2.10 favorable move you ought to make at least $.32 in gain, but only if the delta stays at or above that level the whole time. It could have dipped below .15 in the interim.

On assignment of a CC, the strike price plus the premium credit collected at open is used as the gross proceeds of stock sale. That's how the premium is accounted for in taxes, it increases the value of the sold shares. So if you subtract the cost basis of the shares from that summed value, you get your gain/loss for taxation.\n\nNow, this is why it's a bad idea to open CCs ITM.

You can only cover the assignment value, not the *actual value of the shares*. If you buy shares at $100, write a call at $90, collect $11 in credit, *but upon assignment the shares are worth $125*, you just gave up $24/share in gains for $1/share of net profit.\n\nSecond item: Writing ITM CCs gets you into the \"qualified covered call\" consideration for taxes. It's too complicated to explain briefly, so just read up on it in these articles. TL;DR don't write ITM CCs at all, but if you must write them, make sure they are more than 30 days to expiration.\n\nhttps://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/tax-implications-covered-calls\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/053115/tax-treatment-call-put-options.asp#toc-covered-calls\n\n> Behind the scenes does the \"loss\" on the stock part count toward any potential wash sale?

Will really appreciate it if i get an answer.\n\nFirstly, I have read the links that are suggested in the post, but i still have some questions. Maybe it was written there, but I might have missed it.\n\nSo lets say i sell a put option to open the trade (i write the put option). The underlying stock has 50$ value right now and the strike price of the option is 45$. The expiration is in 20 days. Lets say that person A buys this option, that i created. After 7 days the stock goes down to 41$. Person A decides to take some profits now. He doesn’t excercise the option, but rather sells it to a new person B. Here is my first question. Is this really the case? I’ve read that options are rarely exercised and that the buyer simply sell the options to capture profits. So then B holds the option, to which i am obligated. He decides to hold to the option, because he believes the stock will go down. After 5 more days the stock goes up to 47$. He didn’t exercise it. So now am i still making money. I should be making money, right? I still got the premium and the margin that my broker held, in case the option is exercised is still with me. So when i sell to open an option, as long as it is not exercised I have made money.\nNow we come to the day of the expiry. The stock is now at 40$. Person B sells the option. Or does he? If he sells it, who tf would want to buy it. So the question is to whom do you sell a option at expiry. And if the option is exercised then the margin that my broker held is now given to him in exchange for the shares of the stock.\nI don’t understand what is happening at expiry.

I'm curious how others use IV when selling options.  I try to only sell puts on stocks I really want to own, and then sell covered calls to generate a little extra income, but I've always been curious if the data shows this works.  So I started backtesting.\n\nI've been running backtests on some popular stocks (TSLA, HOOD, COIN, DIS) selling calls and puts over the past few years. It's been a strange time full of volatility with the pandemic, the stimulus, and now the bear market. Anyway, my backtests have shown that selling options on these stocks with the lowest relative IV have done really terrible. But selling options with the highest IV have done really great.\n\nI'm justifying that to myself like so... When its happening, you don't know if you're in the lowest or highest IV range. When you run a backtest grouping all legs by IV, you're seeing a part of the future. When you sell options with the highest IV in a timeframe, you're setting up a situation where the IV is almost certainly going to stay about where it is, or go down during the lifetime of that contract. So in general that would be a good thing for a seller since the underlying stock would have the tendency to move less. An example is selling puts close to the bottom of the pandemic crash when IV was maxed out. You have no idea that will be the max IV at the time, but the backtest has grouped them all nicely for you.\n\nYou'd just reverse that logic when selling options at the lowest IV of a timeframe. IV can only be the same or higher during the options lifetime, which is generally bad for sellers.\n\nBut I'm just not sure if this is enough to make me think I should look to sell options with really high IVs relative to their norms. Thoughts?\n\nHere's an extreme example with HOOD where selling low IV put options lost tons of $$ and high IV actually made a little during an extremely bad time to be selling puts on HOOD...\n\n[https://backtester.pythonanywhere.com/images/HOODPutsP\\_LbyIV.png](https://backtester.pythonanywhere.com/images/HOODPutsP_LbyIV.png)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}

At some point they will hit their credit limit or the monthly minimums will eat into their ability to actually spend more. \n\nThat last part ties in to the interest rate.

{"title": "Amazon Is Said to Plan to Lay Off Thousands of Employees this week", "selftext": "The job cuts of approximately 10,000, which would start as soon as this week, would focus on the company’s devices organization, retail division and human resources.\n\nAmazon plans to lay off approximately 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs starting as soon as this week, people with knowledge of the matter said, in what would be the largest job cuts in the company’s history.\n\nThe cuts will focus on Amazon’s devices organization, including the voice-assistant Alexa, as well as at its retail division and in human resources, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe total number of layoffs remains fluid. But if it stays around 10,000, that would represent roughly 3 percent of Amazon’s corporate employees and less than 1 percent of its global work force of more than 1.5 million, which is primarily composed of hourly workers.\n\nAmazon’s planned retrenchment during the critical holiday shopping season — when the company typically has valued stability — shows how quickly the souring global economy has put pressure on it to trim businesses that have been overstaffed or underdelivering for years.\n\nAmazon would also become the latest technology company to lay off workers, which only recently it had been fighting to retain. Earlier this year, the e-commerce giant more than doubled the cap on cash compensation for its tech workers, citing “a particularly competitive labor market.”\n\nChanging business models and the precarious economy have set off layoffs across the tech industry. Elon Musk halved Twitter’s head count this month after buying the company, and last week, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced it was laying off 11,000 employees, about 13 percent of its work force. Lyft, Stripe, Snap and other tech firms have also laid off workers in recent months.\n\nBrad Glasser, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nThe pandemic produced Amazon’s most profitable era on record, as consumers flocked to online shopping and companies to its cloud computing services. Amazon doubled its work force in two years, and funneled its winnings into expansion and experimentation to find the next big things.\n\nBut earlier this year, Amazon’s growth slowed to the lowest rate in two decades, as the bullwhip of the pandemic snapped. The company faced high costs from decisions to overinvest and rapidly expand, while changes in shopping habits and high inflation dented sales.\n\nAmazon experienced a slight rebound in its latest quarter. But it has cautioned investors that growth could weaken again, possibly falling to its lowest pace since 2001.\n\nEditors’ Picks\n\nWhat We Learned From Week 10 in the N.F.L.\n\nThe Anatomy of a Panic Attack\n\nGiorgia Meloni and the Politics of Power Dressing\nThe company has told Wall Street that it has tightened its belt in the past and can do so again. Last week, Amazon executives met with institutional investors, according to three people, just as its stock sank to its lowest level since the early days of the pandemic, erasing $1 trillion in value since Andy Jassy took over as chief executive last year.\n\nMr. Jassy, who previously ran Amazon’s lucrative cloud computing business, has been closely scrutinizing businesses to trim costs quickly. He initially pulled back on a warehouse expansion that was supercharged during the pandemic, then moved to other parts of the company.\n\nIn recent months, Amazon has also closed or pared back a smattering of initiatives, including Amazon Care, its service providing primary and urgent health care that failed to find enough customers; Scout, the cooler-size home delivery robot, that employed 400 people, according to Bloomberg; and Fabric.com, a subsidiary that sold sewing supplies for three decades.\n\nFrom April through September, it reduced head count by almost 80,000 people, primarily shrinking its hourly staff through high attrition.\n\nAmazon froze hiring in several smaller teams in September. In October, it stopped filling more than 10,000 open roles in its core retail business. Two weeks ago, it froze corporate hiring across the company, including its cloud computing division, for the next few months.\n\nThat news came so suddenly that recruiters did not receive talking points for job candidates until almost a week later, according to a copy of the talking points seen by The New York Times.\n\nDevices and Alexa have long been seen internally as at risk for cuts. Alexa and related devices rocketed to a top company priority as Amazon raced to create the leading voice assistant, which leaders thought could succeed mobile phones as the next essential consumer interface. From 2017 to 2018, Amazon doubled staff on Alexa and Echo devices to 10,000 engineers. At one point, any engineer getting a job offer for other Amazon roles was supposed to also get an offer from Alexa.\n\nThe company has sold hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices. But Amazon has said the products are often low margin and other potential revenue sources such as voice shopping have not caught on.\n\nIn 2018, Echo and Alexa lost about $5 billion, said a person with knowledge of the finances. When Amazon introduced new devices this fall in an annual event, it was notably more restrained than past years when it had featured zany products like a sticky note printer and $1,000 home robot.\n\nAmazon’s retail business, which covers its physical and online retail business and its logistics operations, has been under strain after the surge of demand and breakneck expansion during the pandemic. The company has said it has pulled back expansion plans, and has told investors it sees uncertainty with consumers.\n\n“We’re realistic that there’s various factors weighing on people’s wallets,” Brian Olsavsky, the finance chief, told investors last month. He said the company was unsure where spending was heading, but “we’re ready for a variety of outcomes.”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/technology/amazon-layoffs.html", "id": "yv3n9a", "created_utc": 1668441635.0, "score": 1113, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 271, "comments": [{"body": "10000 is 3% of corporate workforce? 3%?", "score": 351, "replies": [{"body": "The headcount may be small as a %, but most of these roles look like higher paid \"corporate\" heads so the savings will be much larger.", "score": 230, "replies": [{"body": "Because the minimum wage jobs are plenty and they can bring those in almost in a week or two.", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "People already quit the low paying jobs quickly enough, they would just need to not re-post openings.", "score": 29, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Calm down.

{"title": "$ASTS just went from speculative play to semi-nuclear squeeze as shorts double down (detailed DD inside)", "selftext": "Hey peoples,\n\nBy now most have heard of ASTS. I won't go into extreme DD around the company but here is the summary that matters:\n\n1. ASTS is a player in the Satellite Communications (much like Starlink)\n2. Unlike Starlink they do not require special equipment to receive the signal and their tech can be utilized with any regular phone\n3. They will accomplish this by launching MASSIVE satellites with +600 SQFT area. Bluewalker 3 (the catalyst behind all this craziness) has been launched in September and is now confirmed to be \"unfurled\" (i.e. unraveled) and ready to be tested in earnest. Check out the size of this bad boy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9m6ytpf4zz91.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bcbd63527a157aa801a847be06e6ffb0679b9fe\n\n4) This is a HUGE catalyst to the company as it shifts the investment proposition from a binary opportunity of the \"tech works?\" to a scalability and ramp up problem. It is no exaggeration to say the next coming days and weeks will be the most important in the company's history\n\n5) Major industry players just as Vodafone, AT&T, Rakuten and others are already invested in ASTS and many have even released videos with their CEOs/CTOs/COOs demonstrating their confidence into ASTS tech and the overall company. You can find them on the company's Youtube channel.\n\nAt this first glance, we might be tempted to discard this as another run-of-the-mill YOLO but with some DD of your own you can quickly arrive to a different conclusion. You might realize there is currently a huge tug of war between retail investors and a large short fund, which has \"double-downed\" today as an attempt to stem the insane pre-market rally of +20%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7r22nf9azz91.png?width=563&format=png&auto=webp&s=9341624196f103c042dc78ac078342c03c055bd4\n\nTheir efforts were successful as the stock pulled back to -5% at this time of this writing.\n\nHowever, it came at a cost.\n\nBelow is the funding rate for ASTS short positions. Notice how the funding fee (now at 20%) has been inching up (while available shares persistently below 50k) since Nov 9th when the speculation that Bluewalker 3 had unfurled successfully started to be confirmed by the astronomer community. There are currently ZERO shares available to borrow and some users are reporting their brokers reaching out to them to borrow their shares. Any re-borrowing will come at least 25-30% rate if not higher.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lf2prrzi1zz91.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0b2a6e8cdd8f521b26dcb2f72daff3667062277\n\nAt the same time today we saw a record number of submissions for institutional buys at pre-market including Goldman Sachs, Vanguard, JP Morgan and others as evidenced below. Notice today's filling date on the last 9 fillings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s0um2x6w3zz91.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=205ed3e7a60dd576bc2a2a0795ebcacb82ddcced\n\nWhy is today such a big deal?\n\nCause the earnings call with unfurl announcement is happening TODAY at 5pm. The short thesis best bet is to stifle the excitement through massive sell pressure (potentially even FUD questions during the call) and hope that sentiment carries over the next couple of weeks to give them time to cover.\n\nThe company has already announced via social this morning that the deployment was successful and 3 hours later a record short position was reinforced with the borrowed shares mentioned above.\n\nThe short sellers are panicking and with good reason. When companies migrate from binary thesis (\"is this even possible?\") to a scale/ramp-up problem, they are usually met with large amount of trench funding. This has happened with a multitude of companies such as SpaceX, AirBnB. Uber, Google, etc etc. We are exactly at that point with ASTS where the technology is weeks or even days of being completely validated. This will continue to act as a catalyst.\n\nNow combine that with the fact that nearly 40% (that's right FORTY percent) of the entire float is short. When you consider institutional ownership + insider holdings (which by the way have not sold a single share since public listed other than for tax purposes) you can see how this can become a powder keg as the funding rates spike.\n\nWith a functional Bluewalker3, ASTS will literally become the new leader of Satellite Communications, even surpassing Starlink in growth potential. ASTS will move away from \"will it work\" to \"will it scale\". Large positions from outside investors are soon to follow.\n\nFinally, social awareness is starting to rise. They already have +9k followers on Twitter but daily gains are accelerating and so is engagement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lxnuujhvkzz91.png?width=363&format=png&auto=webp&s=598833d4a238e30dd3d9df9c3169c00c861eb3f8\n\nNot bad considering that even established companies struggle to hit 50k followers.\n\nAs testing progresses and AST gets more exposure, this trend is bound to accelerate with Reddit not far behind\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m40kj746lzz91.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=101e4d7c25015d77d31a703965566c7689c77439\n\nI'm in 👍\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gqful0jc6zz91.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=955b0a22656efa13d170e98ff2587d4488c949cc\n\nMandatory position screenshot\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2so63ju6zz91.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=ded799e203ae7a57d415618b83cbc2ffe05ca412\n\nDisclaimer: None of this is financial advice.
