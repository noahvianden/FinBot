{"title": "Why aren’t more companies give retail shareholders perks?", "selftext": "I know 3M gives giftboxes, but wonder why wouldn’t Netflix gives subscription discount for say, someone who has 100 shares or more Netflix? Is this more of a tracking / verification issue or more of a SEC regulatory issue? It seems like a no brainer for companies to do this to make their share holder feel special.\n\nEdit: Okay, so I've read a few things about why the heck a company should consider this, so hear me out. \n\nFirst of all, employees are humans and they have emotions, companies give all sort of perks, t-shirts, special discounts to employees, and they also give shares to employees, to keep them motivated, feel part of a group and community and retained in the company, and hopefully they perform and deliver increase in your share prices. And if they don't, the employee doesn't directly get punished, they could be still earning a high salary, keeping the perks but the investor suffer. META is a clear example of this. \n\nRetail investors are human beings, they have feelings, and when they support a stock they want to feel special, feel part of a community as well, so gestures that make investor, especially those who has a bigger shares or have been holding shares for a long period feels special doesn't need to cost a lot of money, but can positively affect the investor relationship, images for the company, boosting sentiment, and that goes back to the employees who's taking RSUs, so it's a win win. \n\nMy thoughts is more of a regulatory concerns, but then I looked up an found GME is basically already doing this so it's not really a concern, more of just a investor relationship strategy, and dealing with retail simply won't scale, but for big big stake holders, inviting them to investor conference and pay for their drinks and meal is probably more common than not.", "id": "yjvye2", "created_utc": 1667365029.0, "score": 171, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "Ford used to offer employee pricing to shareholders with 100 shares but unfortunately ended it this year.", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "I'm wondering if Ford is having issues supplying dealerships.

The backlash and SEC charges against them would be impossible to escape.\n\nA pump-and-dump assumes that the shares were purchased for the purpose of inflating the price and then unloading them to profit off of the 'pump.' If you take a look at their quarterly filings, Meta hasn't issued any new shares. So how exactly did they pump-and-dump? It didn't.

They have too much cash and have no other reputable means of spending it.\n3. They reduce the amount of outstanding shares in the market.\n\nReducing the amount of outstanding shares in the market means your shares are more 'valuable', which increases the share price. Investors love when companies buy back their own shares because why would a company that is doing poorly buy back their own shares? It increases confidence that the company believes the shares are undervalued and thus, will increase in the future.\n\nDid it work out for Meta? No. And no one could possibly have predicted the extent that tech stocks have been hit or they would have all unloaded their tech holdings.\n\nTo make this personal for you, if you owned a company that you founded that continues to grow and you believe your shares are undervalued, why wouldn't you buy your own shares back?\n\nPump-and-dumps are heavily regulated more-so than ever since 2002 because of SOX.

As your question asks why did the market do so well when we've seen the worst economic growth? So that means short a stock right? No as even as far back as the \"big crash\" in 1929 not every stock moves down, there were a number of stocks that actually not only stayed high but continued to go higher during the great crash. \n\nThe media are another culprit we see a market decline 5 % and and the media are going on about oh the interest rate hike caused it. Really so you hear about interest rates going up and you suddenly want to sell your shares? \n\nThe other day I watched a video about Mr Buffets rules and one of them was about oh if a stock goes down then we should sell, or this is the mentality of the mob, yet in their video they were claiming no don't sell, well I both agree and disagree, the reason being is many stock holders will hold on to a stock after it declines by more than 15 % hoping it will go back up, which is never a good reason to hold a stock, an example of this was the company Rio Tinto a rather large diversified mining company, its stock peaked in 2007 at $151 it proceeded to fall and by March 2009 bottomed out at $52, those who hung on in the hope it would rebound would still be hoping, after 13 years the stock still has not reached its former peak. \n\nA good trader knows when to hold and when to sell, and when to buy, they do not allow the emotions of the market, the media, or the economy to rule their thinking, no rather they base their trades on well researched information to do with an individual share and then make a decision to either buy or sell. ( long & short) \n\nOne of the most famous traders was WD Gann a lot is still mentioned about this trader who made about $50 000 000 between 1900 - 1949 mainly trading the Dow Jones stocks and also the futures markets.  The key to Gann's method of trading was abiding by a set of rules, one was if you make a trade and it does not go in the direction you want it to for 3 days then exit the position, or he'd set a stop loss at about 3 points ( $3) below the low of the day, if the decision to buy was correct that stop loss will never be caught. Next rule was never lower the stop loss if your long you only raise the stop loss, to reduce losses, and increase profits,  so for example if we purchased CAT at $236 with a low of the day at $234 the stop would be set at $231 the following day the stock trades between a range of $235 - $238 so the low now being $235 we now raise stop loss to $232  the next day the price trades between $236 - $239 we now raise the stop to $233 so we never drop the stop loss we only raise it this prevents bigger losses and reduces our total loss and increases profits if we've bought in at the right time. \n\nIf we've got the right trend that stop should never be caught at least till it has reached a profitable level.  The next rule is if the stop does get caught then follow through on the rule and sell take a loss as this is one issue most traders have apart from emotions is ego, they don't want to admit that they've made a mistake, and refuse to sell. \n\nSome other tips to watch for is if a stock price has been in a decline is look for levels of resistance, Gann taught us to look for percentages,  the key one is 50 %, followed by 25 % then 12.5 % as a real live example watch AMZN shares their recent high was $146 they have been in decline for a number of weeks now, trading at around the $80 mark, the $73 mark would indicate a fall of 50% from the most recent high a good point to buy, other percentages to watch for are 66 % and 87 % levels , so if the stock broke below the $73 level then the next price for support would be around the $50 mark, followed by $19 at the 87.5 % mark. \n\nRemember these lines of support are no sure thing, and one always abides by the rules apply the stop loss if you did buy AMZN around that $73 mark set the stop loss at the low the stock reaches on that trading day of $3 or 5 - 8 % below the low of the day. Some in modern times prefer a lower stop due to the huge fluctuations due to computer trading which never existed in Gann's day. So if one sets an automated stop on a trading platform this can get taken out only to see the stock go back up again, if your going to be monitoring the price live then you could just have that price set to make sure you exit manually if it does hit the stop level rather than have an automated stop loss level. Just be wary of huge fluctuations on a day when the markets are taking a hammering, it might be best to stay away or take a wait and see attitude, if there has been bad news and the \"flock\" sell off ,don't make a trade in the first hour just wait, this is when the bargain hunters come in and cherry pick the over sold stocks.\n\nYes timing can be important if you watch carefully at how markets move, the first hour can be ciaos with buy / sell orders if the sell orders are higher the market will generally drop by a few hundred points on the Dow, or if buy orders are strong the market will sky rocket during the first hour of trade and then settle down, this again is due to all the emotion built up from the previous trading day or weekend, if its a panic sell though this will generally last for more than one hour and could last all day if this is the case then stay away, its better not to make a trade and be unhappy, then to make a trade and be even more unhappy with the decision. \n\nJust some tips I've learnt over the last 20 + years of trading.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The stock market is a strange beast, if will 99.9% of the time fool most traders, and then there are those that wish to take advantage of your money by offering so called trading systems that will make you 80 % profit, anyone offering this kind of trading system promising those kind of returns is a con artist pure and simple. If they said we guarantee around 50 - 55 % I'd be more inclined to say now their being honest, even at 50 % success that is a tall order, however every trade you make realistically has a 50 % chance of going up, although there is always a 50 % chance it will go down to. The truth be told it should be a 33.3 % chance it'll go up, a 33.3 % chance it will go down, and a 33.3 % chance it will move sideways.\n\nThe markets simply put panicked, anyone that understands the market psychology would of realized this sell off was due to panic not economic news, emotion controls the bulk of traders, and therefore once one starts selling the rest follow, it's the herd mentality, those experienced traders would of sat back waiting for a good opportunity to get back in and pick out some juicy bargains. Sure enough once the initial panic had settled down then what happened? The markets shot back up like a rocket and powered upwards, from Feb 2020 the Dow high was 29,551 it fell some 31 % losing 9362 points over 20 trading days with the largest fall being on 16 th March of 2997 points in one day following these huge crashes in the market in was only natural that we were going to see some huge surges up again.\n\nFrom the March low of 20 189 to the January 2022 high of 36 799 an increase of some 82 % in 22 months.  Following the huge cash injections by the US government, the fact that many new traders came onto the markets having to stay at home with nothing to do with Covid restrictions, many tried their hand at trading, injecting even more liquid into the Stock Market, however this honeymoon was only going to last so long. It was interesting to note that the March decline in 2020 was around 11 years from the 2009 bottom of the GFC.\n\nSome traders follow Fibonacci numbers, for example the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 are all sequences in the ratio, use them for trading years add 55 to the 1932 year low and we get 1987 another huge stock market crash, add 13 to 1987 and we get 2000 the high of the dot com boom, we then had the 11 September attacks with another stock sell off panic a great opportunity to buy as it was not based on economics, with a low in 2002 add 5 we get the top of the market in 2007 add 2 we get the low of 2009, add 21 to the years 2000, 2001, and 2002 and we get the years 2021, 2022, 2023, or the 2009 low add 13 we get 2022. Total coincidence maybe maybe not.\n\nIts amazing when markets do fall how close they come to the Fab numbers, the 2020 crash was around 31 % just 3 off 34, the 1929 stock market crash to the 1932 bottom was around 89 % loss in Dow points an exact Fab number, interesting enough from the top in September1929 to the low in July 1932 was 34 months another Fab number.  The fall from the January 2022 High to the low in September was 22 % just 1 % off the 21 Fab number. They won't always be exact, but it is rather amazing how close these falls do get, go back in history and check other falls, and see just how often the falls are very close to the Fab numbers.\n\nIf the markets do fall further in 2023 which is a good probability look to that 34 % mark for a bottom, around 24 248, the next level at or around that 50 % level just / 36 799 by 2. = 18 399, other points to keep in mind are February 2023 will be 13 months from the January 2022 high, October 2023 will be 21 months since the 2022 high.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
{"title": "Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead", "selftext": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.\n\nIn a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.\n\nThe move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.\n\nAlong with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a “step-down” in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.\n\nThat language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.\n\nThis week’s statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.“\n\nThe new language read: “The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.“\n\nThe statement reiterated that policy changes “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“\n\nMarkets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.\n\nAlong with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as “modest” and noted that “job gains have been robust in recent months” while inflation is “elevated.” The statement also reiterated language that the committee is “highly attentive to inflation risks.“\n\nThe rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.\n\nConcerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a “soft landing” in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.\n\nAt the same time, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago – 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.\n\nOn Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn’t as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.\n\nThere is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.\n\nCurrent market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.\n\nThe fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/fed-hikes-by-another-three-quarters-of-a-point-taking-rates-to-the-highest-level-since-january-2008.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/fed-hikes-by-another-three-quarters-of-a-point-taking-rates-to-the-highest-level-since-january-2008.html)", "id": "ykcawl", "created_utc": 1667412295.0, "score": 2578, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 457, "comments": [{"body": ">  the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation\n\nWhich is partially why the decision to wait so damn long before starting to raise rate was so stupid.", "score": 1193, "replies": [{"body": "good point.", "score": 151, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": -19, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Death by Snoo-Snoo", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "market is trying to find anything bullish in powell's words.\n\nit was completely hawkish.\n\nbig middle finger to the rally and fake pivot talks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhe was pretty clear about not pausing.

The issue is that the majority of consumers haven't needed to borrow much this year because of elevated savings built up during the pandemic, and on top of this over the last couple of years consumers in the US have been locking in cheap 30-year fixed-term mortgages so disposable income is also higher. Even after all these hikes consumer debt servicing ratios are still very low, [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CDSP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CDSP) and anyone with a mortgage is having a great time, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MDSP\n\nSo you have a consumer with high savings, cheap fixed mortgages and next to no debt sensitivity. So in terms of the US consumer there's no meaningful direct path for rate hikes to have an effect on demand. It's not just that it takes time, I'd argue the hikes are doing practically nothing right now. Powell could raise rates to 50% tomorrow but everyone has a fixed mortgage and no other debts who cares?\n\nWhat we probably need to happen is for businesses to start to feel the pitch of rate hikes and to begin laying people off, but with the US being a consumer economy that isn't likely to happen while consumer demand is so strong. So my guess right now is that maybe early next year once we're done with the holiday season consumers might have run down their savings enough that demand will begin to slow and perhaps then we might see more job loses.\n\nMy concern in regards to rates though is that this is all artificial. It's not like demand is high because Covid and lockdowns were great for the economy. It's high because of the temporary effects of stimulus.\n\nI guess the way I'm thinking about this is that in a normal rate hiking cycle the consumer is generally strong enough to endure the increases in interest rates. Or put another way, underlying economic strength is supporting the consumer enough that they can afford to borrow at higher rates. So in theory if these rate hikes are being supported by underlying economic strength then consumers should be fine to do things like remortgage at 7% because the economy is booming, right? But of course the idea that the economy could support that is almost laughable today. Yet in the past this is exactly what would have happened - rates would go up and people would borrow at those higher rates. But no ones borrowing at these new rates today because everyone has savings and fixed mortgages.\n\nSo I guess to answer your question, sure, eventually rate hikes will quell inflation. After all some people will eventually have to move house and borrow at higher rates. Savings will eventually drop and some people might have to borrow to fix their car or pay off some other unexpected expense. Businesses will slowly burn down cash levels and have to start borrowing at higher rates. The issue today is that literally one can afford it because underlying economy isn't that strong. So when rates do eventually matter, they're probably not going to act like a speed break for demand as they normally would, they're going to act like a brick wall. It's not that people can't afford to borrow as much, they can't afford to borrow at all - and that's your hard landing.\n\nSorry this comment is really long. I just think it's interesting that the Fed isn't talking about this and is now even hinting that they think the terminal rate might need to be higher still. I don't know if they believe the economy is strong enough to support 7% mortgage rates or if at this point just want to be overly restrictive to bring inflation down at any cost, but it seems to me the rate hikes are having so little impact they probably should consider a trade off here. At least if I were Powell I'd probably be less aggressive on hikes and allow core inflation to average 3-4% for a year or two because they literally have no tools to address the underlying problem.

Rates are high enough to bring down demand already imo, it's just going to take time.\n\nI think Powell needs to urge some kind of fiscal response now so he take the pressure off a bit. It would appear higher taxes would be far more effective at bringing down the current drivers of inflation, but I don't see that happening with mid-terms coming up -  especially if republicans do well.\n\nI'm also not convinced that a hard landing is any better than moderately high inflation, and increasingly this seems to be the only two options we have. I think this is even less debatable if you look beyond the US. People will quite literally die in developing countries if Powell continues to be this aggressive.\n\nPowell needs to comment on this and explain why the Fed believes further rate hikes will do anything meaningful to demand. Every meeting they do the same thing and expect a different outcome. There is seemingly no reflection process at the Fed for why this is, just a hope like \"transitionary inflation\" that eventually they will be right.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "The Fed seems take its time with almost everything.

Or do you believe that the overnight Fed funds rate needs to be in excess of the lagging inflation numbers like YoY CPI? And even if you do believe that are you using core or headline CPI?\n\nGiven that any backwards looking inflation reads are both too lagging and volatile to be useful I think what's probably most important is what the market thinks inflation will average and where the market is pricing yields of a similar duration.\n\nIf the market is pricing inflation to average 2.5% over the next 10 years and to borrow at that duration costs 4.1% the market is expecting a decently real return from that investment.

More in comments.", "selftext": "[Velocity of M2 Money Stock over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V)\n\nJust a quick edit: [M2 Money Stock over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)\n\nu/Infamous_Sympathy_91 's [post on credit card debt and personal savings from earlier today](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yjowp1/us_personal_savings_near_historic_lows/)\n\n\nIn 2020 money stopped moving. I wrote this in some of my previous posts and comments. In order to prop up economic activity, central banks increased money supply with almost 0 interest a.k.a Brrrrrr.\n\nSo ideally fresh minted money is distributed in the real economy and moves up and trickles down and so forth. As you can see in the chart above, money hasn't been moving as much in the economy since the peak in 2000; It's in constant decline with a hard fall in 2020.\n\nToday central banks are trying to battle inflation. As you can see in the chart above, money isn't moving as much, so it's not that there is too much money in the real economy. Whatever they printed in the last 2 years went up to the big black void of finance. All the derivatives market, swaps, trenches and all sorts of made up bullshit has sucked up money faster than your wife sucking her boyfriend's cock.\n\nInflation is a product of price gauging and artificial crises, such as cutting down oil production, slowing down logistics around the globe, lagging or harsh response to the pandemic by governments etc.\n\nWhat you're seeing with the interest rate increases will only hit small businesses and working people. Casino always wins. Banks will own everything. You will own nothing at the end of this.\n\nIn the next two years, you will lose your jobs, you will lose your homes if you have debt. You will start selling your assets until capitalism owns your ass. We had reached a point of multi-generational wealth with too many high net worth individuals. Those who are pulling the strings are actively sabotaging the economy and are robbing you.\n\nThe interest rates will once again go down, when most people lose everything and you can't borrow anymore. This isn't about bringing the inflation down by decreasing money spent in real economy. The chart in the link clearly shows you that there is no increased activity which would increase velocity of money.\n\nSo tomorrow or in the next year don't get your hopes up too much. Your average working class ape is in more debt than before and savings are at an all time low. The latest surge in house prices also guaranteed that banks and through them the central banks owns you.\n\nThis is the final stage of capitalism. Good luck to you all.\n\nYour uncle gay bear.", "id": "yjtunv", "created_utc": 1667358564.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|27|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|930|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yjtunv)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yjtunv)\n    \n>TL;DR: Banks are intentionally destroying the economy to rob you.

With the velocity of money slowing down, Central Banks increased money supply to create an illusion of stability in economic growth. \"If money doesn't change hands enough times, we're just going to have more money in the system to have the same volume of transactions in a given time\" was their solution.\n\n> In a healthy economy you need diversity. As a consumer, making 50 small transactions of $20 in the real economy, usually has a greater impact than having one single $1000 transaction to pay for a car loan directly to the bank. The idea behind it is that there will be more transactions made in the real economy before that same dollar reaches the blackhole at the top of finance, where it just becomes a number to use for some made-up derivative bullshit asset. This is where I start to think we've past the point of no-return in our financial timeline.\n\n> As a banker, your top goal is to lend out as much money as possible with a reasonable amount of risk. The bigger the loan, the bigger the paycheck for everyone involved in that transactions - that's everyone from the loan officer to the manager of the branch and higher up execs and shareholders.\n\n> The bank must not compete with the Main Street for your dollar. At the end of the day, banks need more volume of daily transactions to sustain as a business apart from low interest long term loans. But this is exactly what happened in 2008 and it is what happened in the last year. Going back to my previous point, money is not moving. And it will not help how much money federal reserve prints. We have been in a recession - for all intense and purposes - for more than 2 years, which is only shortened by increased money supply.\n\n> As of October 14, 2022, CPI is over 8% for 7 months now. That's the fake under-reported number government pushes you to justify federal reserve's low interest rates. As demand for many products and services decreased, supply has been artificially limited to increase the prices of commodities and goods in order to increase profit margin on a single unit. Corporations with lower revenues are able to post higher profits due to decrease in cost of production and about one trillion dollars in loans from the government.\n\n> We are screwed by every single entity we do business with. As workers, we have to compete with banks to purchase a home! We have to pay more in taxes to pay for our jobs?! due to all the loans that were given out and forgiven so far and in the future! We have to pay more for products we don't need as much. A simple supply and demand curve would explain to you how price lowers as demand decreases. Price gauging is 100% kosher in 2022.\n\n> TL:DR - government must not buy banks' debt anymore on tax-payers' behalf. That's our money going to the financial system that's there to facilitate economic activity and not make an unreasonable amount of profit from the very people that actually make this world turn. Without a worker you have nothing. We are not at a level of automation, where corporations and governments can disregard the needs of the working people! let the banks and federal reserve fail.
