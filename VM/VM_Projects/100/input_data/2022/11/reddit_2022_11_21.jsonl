And the call is only a little ITM, not even a whole dollar, though it would be good to know what the delta is: that could be anything from 51 to 70, with higher numbers being decidedly ITM.\n\nExercising a call with a ton of time value flushes that value right down the toilet. So unless you are assuming all owners of those calls are morons, nobody is going to exercise early and lose money on purpose.\n\nSome other comments below.\n\n* It's generally a bad idea to write CCs with expirations greater than 60 days. The further out you go, the more time you give the underlying to gain value, which means you take larger and larger losses on the buy-back value of the call until all the premium is gone.\n\n* Since you are short a call, you want it to *lose* buy-back value as rapidly as possible, and that happens in the last 60 days before expiration (theta decay curve).\n\n* Additionally, you tie up your shares for the duration of the CC. Imagine trading in all your 800 shares for collateral on 8 CCs and the stock doubles a month later to $20. Wouldn't you like to take some profit off those shares? Too bad, you can't, since you locked them away until 2025. If you try to \"break the contract\" by buying back the appreciated calls, you'll realize a loss roughly equal to the gain you would have gotten from selling $20 shares.\n\nIf you need cash now, why not just sell some appreciated shares?

But don't give up on adjusting the straddle/strangle bias until you are sure the interval is too large a gap to optimize.\n\nOne last thing to try before resorting to ratios: You can just wait to open the trade until the underlying price moves into a zone where your break-evens are optimal.

A roll is just an exit paired with a new trade (open) on the same ticker.\n\nSo since you are exiting in either case, it's not really about exiting at all. It's about how to evaluate whether it is worth opening a new trade on the same ticker.\n\n> I bought a GM 40c 1/20/2023 for $2,250 on Dec 3, 2021. At the time, GM was trading for $61.\n\nHow much did you pay in per-share dollars? That is a critical piece of information that is often omitted.\n\n> This was a LEAP.\n\nThere is no such thing. LEAPS is an acronym that modifies put or call. The S is not the plural of LEAP, it stands for Securities. The singular is LEAPS call.

At least you have holding time milestones in your plan, which is a step up from most beginners. However, what were your profit and loss levels at the time you opened the trade?

The decision to open a new trade on the same ticker is exactly the same process as deciding to open the original trade.\n\nTL;DR - Is the cash money you have to spend to open the trade worth more to you than the new trade? If so, don't roll. If no, go ahead and roll.\n\nCome up with a forecast for the trade and decide if the [expected value](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result) of the trade is sufficiently positive to be worth the risk. For example, if you forecast a 70% probability that the GM call that costs $1.00 will gain at least 50% by date X, and there is no better use of your money for that same period of time, you would calculate your expected value as:\n\nEV = (.70 x 0.50) - (.30 x 1.00) = .35 - .30 = +0.05 (lower bound)\n\nYou have a positive expected value of *at least* $0.05 on the trade, and if you think that average gain is worth it, you would go ahead and make the trade.\n\n> Any general thoughts/feedback on the trade, or on exiting LEAPS\n\nMy philosophy is to use a LEAPS call if and only if you can't afford shares.

However, you can approximate what you want by looking at the volume leaders ranking. A stock that trades 100 million shares a day is going to have pretty rapid price discovery. It might not be $1 every tick, but it will probably be the smallest increment per tick you're going to find that day. Ideally you'd rather have *trade* volume rather than share volume, since a single 1 million share trade won't add to price discovery as much as 10,000 trades of 100 shares each, but again I don't know of any screen that provides that info.\n\nFor contracts, keep in mind that contract volume is several orders of magnitude lower than the underlying shares. QQQ may trade 50 million shares a day, but the ATM QQQ monthly call might only trade 1000 contracts on a good day. Even if you multiply by 100 to get the equivalent share volume, it's still a tiny fraction of the underlying share volume. Which means its going to be hard to find contracts that move $1 per tick. Basically only the front month SPY and SPX ATM contracts will come close to that, maybe a few others.\n\nAnd \"tick\" is a pretty useless unit of time for most contracts.

Whether you open the spread as one order, or two separate orders, the end result is the same, but what is important to realize is that as long as you have $500 in buying power, you can open a 380/375 put credit spread in one order. But unless you have $38,000 in buying power, you cannot first sell a 380 strike put in one order, then buy the 375 in a second order.

But if I get exercised early, which is possible right?, will I have to go kill my grandparents to get inheritance so that I cover the costs for buying 100 shares for 380, or will Interactive provide the funds for that and then sell the shares in the market to cover its costs and get the initial 500 dollars so that it didn’t lose money?

And if the price goes below both legs will they exercise the 375 option again to cover their costs. \n\nThis is one reason you are required to have a margin account to trade spreads. If you get assigned early, you will buy 100 shares at 380. If you did not have $38,000 cash, you will buy them on margin. You will thus have taken out  a margin loan. If you had enough margin buying power for this, you actually wouldn't need to close the position. You could leave it open for as long as you like, with the understanding that you would be charged interest on the margin loan.  If not, you would be in what is normally known as a margin call (though I understand interactive brokers handles this somewhat differently) and you would have to satisfy that obligation as soon as possible. Again, they will not exercise the long put. It is better to sell the shares on the open market and sell the long put, than to exercise the long put.\n\nFor example, let us say SPY is at 374 and you get assigned early. You buy 100 shares at 380.  Now, with SPY at 374, the long put is must be worth more than 1.00. Let's say it's worth 1.10.\n\n1. If you exercise the long put, you sell the 100 shares at 375.  You have lost $500.\n\n2. If you sell the 100 shares on the open market and sell the long put, you receive $37,400 for the shares, and $110 for the long put.  37500 - 38000 + 110 = -490, so you have lost $490.\n\nLosing $490 is better than losing $500.\n\n>And so is it possible to do 380/375 credit put spread with if all the money I have is no more than 2500$?\n\nYes, with the understanding that you have to open it in one order. You cannot leg into it by selling the 380 put first.\n\nEdit: BTW, currency symbols go before the number.  It's $2500, not 2500$.

Your strikes are 380 and 375 so if SPY is at 363 they are both ITM.\n\nThis is one reason you should always manage your positions yourself rather than letting your brokerage do it for you and close positions before expiration. We're talking about a vertical put credit spread, with both expirations being the same. You can't have the short expire and sell the long. Once the short has expired, the long has as well. If you allow the short to expire ITM while the long is OTM, you will be assigned on the short, and the long will expire worthless. If you got assigned on the 380, buying 100 shares at 380, and the long expired worthless, you could then just sell the shares on the open market. If SPY were at 378 you would have lost $200.\n\nIf you are going to sell the long before expiration, because the spread is fully or partially ITM, you should buy to close the short too.

You basically have to start from scratch. Not only from hardware but also software side. And next to all those challenges are the raw material constraints for the battery alone, but that's other companies dealing with.\n\nYes there are a lot EVs comming out from different companies. And some are actual decent, but like I said, you have to scale this new car architecture. We have seen that this is not that easy, because no traditional car company still hasn't sold as many cars as tesla and many haven't even sold half the amount. And we have heard the competition is comming argument for at least 5 years or longer.\n\nThe longer it takes the competiton to catch up, the more difficult it will be. Just a few days ago for example, there was an announcement from the VW group that the trinity project has been delayed for years. Next to all those challenges, you have to be also profitable. Imagine your business relies on the profits on the ICE cars to survive and now you have to disrupt your own business with unprofitable EVs.\n\nOver time they might have to sell as many cars as tesla, or maybe not idk. This leads to the competitve advantage:\n\n* Like Elon said, the long term goal of tesla is the manufacturing expertise. Even right now, while scaling two huge factories, tesla has leading industry margins, which itself could be an argument for lower margins.Last Quarter tesla did 8 times more profit per car than toyota.If I remember correctly Tesla right now, is 3x more profitable than GM.\n* Supercharging expertise. Tesla is and has been building superchargers all over the world. Ofc there are a lot of different brands too, but no OEM has even close to the amount, like tesla. With Solar and Battery storage next to those stations - after breaking even - this could maybe generate over time decent money. But this is still in the stars. Nonetheless this supercharging network can also be used by different car brands, acting already right now as a extra revenue stream.\n* Autonomous Driving. The overall trend of the disruption of the car industry, won't be just EVs. It will most likely be self driving cars and probably 'robotaxis'. Tesla has the advantage to access its whole fleet, for specific situations to train the neural networks for. Tesla can also opimize and leverage on the fact, that it's all in-house and not a third party. (which nearly all other OEMs do).Yes there are already crusing Cruise and Waymo around, but IMHO the 'best-possible' solution is just pure vision, without any sensors. But we will see which is the best way, maybe even both.\n* There are also some other ways Tesla could generate money over the future, but those things are probably too far away.

The company reported record deliveries earlier in the month, and the vehicle volume growth was present in the company’s financial results as it generated record revenue. Despite the continued ramp up of the two new factories (one in Austin, Texas in the U.S. and one in Berlin, Germany), companywide operating margin improved sequentially versus the second quarter. This is in line with our view that the factories will become more profitable each quarter as production increases, eventually leading to margin expansion.\n\nDespite the signs of improvement in line with our long-term outlook, shares were down 5% in after-hours trading. With our outlook intact, we view Tesla shares as slightly undervalued, with the stock trading a little more than 15% below our fair value estimate but in 3-star territory. As such, we recommend investors wait for a larger margin of safety before considering an entry point.\n\nWe think some of the after-hours selloff is due to revenue coming in slightly below consensus estimates. Given that the company already reported lower deliveries, we think consensus may have been expecting higher average price increases during the quarter. We calculate a 5% year-on-year price increase and we expect average selling prices to rise further in the coming quarters. Given that Tesla’s backlog was roughly 3-6 months of production, we think there will likely be a lag from when the company raises prices to when it shows up on the financials.\n\nOur long-term outlook is intact. We expect Tesla will eventually grow vehicle deliveries to over 5 million vehicles by 2031. We forecast the company will be able to reduce unit production costs, while also growing ancillary services including autonomous driving software and insurance subscriptions, driving margin improvement.\n\nI agree with Morningstar.

{"title": "Jeff Bezos of Amazon sees a recession coming, and has said: \"Don't buy TV, fridge, hold onto your money.\" Do you think the US is headed for a recession?", "selftext": "Amazon founder and billionaire entreprenuer Jeff Bezos has advised the American people to avoid large purchases such as new TVs, refrigerators or cars and “keep some dry powder on hand” during the coming holiday season as the US economy is likely to be in a recession soon, according to a report in the CNN.\n\nThe tycoon had last month tweeted to his followers “to batten down the hatches”. When asked about the tweet, he told the American network in an interview that the advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike.\n\nHe said consumers should postpone buying big basket items that they have been eyeing for some time and big businesses should also go slow on acquisitions and capital expenditures because the US economy is likely to be in a recession \"very soon\".\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos told CNN. “Keep some dry powder on hand... Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\n“The economy does not look great right now,\" he said, adding, \"Things are slowing down, you're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy\". \"The probabilities say if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon.\"\n\nThe fourth richest person in the world said many people may be “feeling the pinch now” because of the extended economic downturn, but he appeared confident of a reverse in the trend in the coming time, saying as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future”.\n\nSeveral other leading investors and analysts too have cautioned the American public about an impending recession. They have cited the Federal Reserve’s continuous efforts to curb inflation, which increased to a 40-year high of 9.1 per cent in June and remained at 7.7 percent until a month ago.\n\nIn the interview, Bezos also said that he will donate a majority of his $124 billion net worth to charities to fight climate change and growing social and political divisions.\n\nSource: [https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/keep-cash-on-hand-don-t-buy-tv-fridge-this-holiday-season-jeff-bezos-122112000376\\_1.html](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/keep-cash-on-hand-don-t-buy-tv-fridge-this-holiday-season-jeff-bezos-122112000376_1.html)", "id": "z123ie", "created_utc": 1669045410.0, "score": 462, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 201, "comments": [{"body": "Hold onto my money??

If the company pays cash, it needs to come up with cash. Options and RSUs come from the company’s treasuries, over which the company has control. For this reason it a much smarter and more efficient way way for company to create value for its employees when compared to spending cash that could instead be used to purchase other resources. Typically the total comp you get from base + RSUs/SOs is higher than if the company pays you purely in cash. \n\nA company could give you 25k of stock options per year at a price of $5 and over the course of the your 4 year vesting, the price climbs to $25, those shares are now worth 2.5 million. If the company had simply given you yearly bonuses of 0.10*25k*5, assuming the market grows around 10% per year, you would have received 12.5k per year, which would be $50k over 4 years, not $2 million in profit (25-5)x(25k shares per year)x(4yrs)\n\nAs to which is better, it really depends on the company.\nSo in this example, getting 25k worth of shares per year over 4 years at a company that 5x’s its value over your tenure is preferable to getting the average market return (10%) on the equivalent amount of equity. On the other hand, if the company stays flat, your equity won’t turn a profit. \n\nGenerally speaking If you work at a good company, then RSUs and stock options are better than “the OPTION” to buy stock on your own, because the company can give you more compensation in this manner than if they had to expend free cash flows.

{"title": "The US Treasury Yield Curve Recession Indicator is Flashing Red", "selftext": "From the article:\n\n\nEven as stock investors cheer signs of inflation peaking, the bond market’s best-known predictor of recessions is showing its clearest signal yet that there is trouble ahead for the US economy.\n\nIt’s known in Wall Street lingo as an inverted yield curve, and in recent days it has moved to its most extreme levels since the 1982 recession thanks to a big drop in long-term bond yields. When this dynamic has been in place over the last two decades, in each case a recession has followed. (For a look at the history of yield curves and recessions, see our earlier story here.)\n\nWhile an inverted US Treasury yield curve isn’t known as a predictor of how deep or how long a recession may last, or even when a recession will begin, market watchers say the current message is unmistakable.\n\n\"Historically, when you get a sustained inversion like this […] it’s a very reliable indicator of a recession coming,\" says Duane McAllister, a senior portfolio manager at US firm Baird Advisors.\n\nThat leaves many market observers saying the real question isn’t whether there will there be a recession, but what it will look like. Will it be shallow or deep? Short or drawn out?\n\nMoney managers and economists are wrestling with these questions. Many say the outlook is highly uncertain against a backdrop of recent economic data painting a somewhat conflicting picture. On the one hand, inflation has started to come down from 40-year highs, which should give the Federal Reserve the ability to slow the pace of interest-rate increases.\n\nHowever, inflation remains extremely hot despite its recent easing. At the same time, job growth and consumer spending remain robust. In fact, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast, a running estimate of economic growth, is clocking in an extremely strong 4.2% rate of growth for the fourth quarter. Those indicators suggest the Fed can’t afford to stop raising rates too early and risk embedding higher inflation into the economy, analysts say.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/229496/the-us-treasury-yield-curve-recession-indicator-is-flashing-red.aspx", "id": "z17j6u", "created_utc": 1669058399.0, "score": 856, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 200, "comments": [{"body": "This gets posted every week for months now", "score": 892, "replies": [{"body": "I work on a bond desk, been looking at this shit for over 6 months now.

{"title": "Jeff Bezos of Amazon sees a recession coming, and has said: \"Don't buy TV, fridge, hold onto your money.\"", "selftext": "Amazon founder and billionaire entreprenuer Jeff Bezos has advised the American people to avoid large purchases such as new TVs, refrigerators or cars and “keep some dry powder on hand” during the coming holiday season as the US economy is likely to be in a recession soon, according to a report in the CNN.\n\nThe tycoon had last month tweeted to his followers “to batten down the hatches”. When asked about the tweet, he told the American network in an interview that the advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike.\n\nHe said consumers should postpone buying big basket items that they have been eyeing for some time and big businesses should also go slow on acquisitions and capital expenditures because the US economy is likely to be in a recession \"very soon\".\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos told CNN. “Keep some dry powder on hand... Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\n“The economy does not look great right now,\" he said, adding, \"Things are slowing down, you're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy\". \"The probabilities say if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon.\"\n\nThe fourth richest person in the world said many people may be “feeling the pinch now” because of the extended economic downturn, but he appeared confident of a reverse in the trend in the coming time, saying as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future”.\n\nSeveral other leading investors and analysts too have cautioned the American public about an impending recession. They have cited the Federal Reserve’s continuous efforts to curb inflation, which increased to a 40-year high of 9.1 per cent in June and remained at 7.7 percent until a month ago.\n\nIn the interview, Bezos also said that he will donate a majority of his $124 billion net worth to charities to fight climate change and growing social and political divisions.\n\nSource: [https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/keep-cash-on-hand-don-t-buy-tv-fridge-this-holiday-season-jeff-bezos-122112000376\\_1.html](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/keep-cash-on-hand-don-t-buy-tv-fridge-this-holiday-season-jeff-bezos-122112000376_1.html)", "id": "z122gg", "created_utc": 1669045333.0, "score": 316, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|95|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z122gg)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z122gg)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \n>TL;DR: Jeff Bezos is advising the American people to avoid large purchases such as new TVs, refrigerators or cars and “keep some dry powder on hand” during the coming holiday season as the US economy is likely to be in a recession soon.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "fuck i had to buy alll of those because they all broke this year", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "When he says dry powder… I didn’t think he’d be so open about his habits of choice…", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Keep cash on hand to buy the things that take up less space in my trucks: Jeff Amazon", "score": 276, "replies": [{"body": "Hello.
