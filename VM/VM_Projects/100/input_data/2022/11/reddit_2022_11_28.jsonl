There's no simple and free recipe for selecting trades and exploiting opportunities -- that's basically the core skill set of a successful trader and may take thousands of trades to master.\n\nSo best we can do in a Reddit post is point you in the right direction, but you'll have hours and hours of additional study and practice ahead of you. No doubt every single item I list below will raise a couple dozen new questions in your mind, but I can't help you answer those. You'll have to find the answers yourself. That's what pointing in the right direction means.\n\nSince you have a bullish bias, you are already in a challenging situation, since the overall market is bearish. There simply may not be any good bull trades of any type whatsoever on a day to day basis. So even with the scheme I summarize below, you may come up empty.\n\nTo get you started, I will summarize what I do, but please understand, this is only one of about a million different ways to solve these problems. I don't claim it is the best or only way to do this.\n\n1. Start by building a watchlist of underlyings to track (I explain how below).\n\n1. Every trading day, sort the watchlist by IV Rank. Look for IV Rank above 50% (I explain why below). If there are no underlyings that meet that criteria, give up for that day.\n\n1. For every candidate underlying, find the next monthly expiration that is as close to 45 DTE as possible. If there are none close to 45 DTE, drop the candidate and try the next one.\n\n1. For each surviving candidate, examine the option chain for the selected expiration for contracts near 30 delta OTM. If there are none +/- 5 delta, drop the candidate. Or, if the bid/ask spread and volume for that strike is poor (bid/ask spread is more than 20% of the bid and/or volume is 0), drop the candidate.\n\n1. Assuming there are any candidates left, open credit trades on the selected strike and expiration.\n\nNOTE: Some of the criteria above can be waived for a high enough conviction trade. You may think that XYZ presents an opportunity that is too good to pass up, even though the fundamentals are shaky and IV Rank is below 50%. The one thing you should never compromise on, however, is the liquidity criteria. If the XYZ 30 delta put has 0 volume and $1.00/$3.00 bid/ask, avoid like the plague.\n\n**WATCHLIST**\n\nYou may find it useful to learn how to analyze stocks and funds for short term trading opportunities. It would take an entire book to explain all the ways to do this, so what I do is first make sure that the candidate company has liquid option trading. If it doesn't offer options at all, or the combined volume of all the options chains is less than 100, it's a non-starter.\n\nThen find a good analysis site, like gurufocus.com, and examine the fundamentals of the company. I generally want growth companies that aren't meme stocks and that have reasonable fundamentals, like not too much debt if it is an oil company or tech company, forward earnings are forecast to grow, a reasonable amount of volatility (so not an electric utility or a regional bank), etc., etc.\n\nThis screening should be guided by a macro-economic thesis, like oil will do well during the Ukraine war, or staple good will do better than luxury items during a recession, etc., and base your screening around that thesis. Learning how to do this will take a lot of time and study and reading of financial news daily.\n\nFinally, examine the IV history of a typical option contract (ATM monthly put or call), or the aggregate IV of the underlying if your broker lists that. If the 52-week IV range is narrow, like 10%-12%, there isn't enough volatility to trade, so drop it from the list. If it's decent, like 46%-86% (reading off the NVDA aggregate IV from my broker), it's a keeper.\n\nShoot for about 50 underlyings for your watchlist, give or take 20.\n\nYou can kick-start your pool of initial candidates by going to barchart.com and looking at [the daily option volume leaders](https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks) near the end of a market day, because high volume tends to correlate with good liquidity. Screen out any underlyings with share prices less than $10 or higher than you can afford, like BLK going for $700/share.\n\n**Alternatives**\n\n* Rather than build a watchlist from scratch, some people pay for a screening service, like MarketChameleon.com, to screen for opportunities on a daily basis. They are agnostic to macros and underlyings and just want the top opportunities of whatever the market is offering that day. One day they may trade ABC, the next day XYZ, because the screen turned those up, not that they know or care what ABC or XYZ do.\n\n* Other people use Technical Analysis to screen for candidates. That's another rabbit hole that could take hundreds of hours of studying to learn.\n\n**WHY IV RANK?**\n\nYour goal as a credit trader is to find opportunities to exploit buyers overpaying for volatility. If someone buys a put and pays for 100 units of volatility from you, but by expiration only 50 units of volatility actually happens, you pocket the overpayment. Sellers demand higher premiums for higher volatility, because volatility increases their risk of having to honor the contract when exercised.\n\nWhile IV Rank isn't a perfect predictor of overpaying for volatility, the higher the IV Rank, the more the deck is stacked in your favor. Of course, there is also higher risk that the volatility will actually be realized, or worse, you undersold the volatility (you sold 100 units, but 200 units were realized).\n\nMore about trading volatility here (although these are delta-neutral approaches, not a bullish bias like you asked for): \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ulvsck/theta_without_delta_intro_to_vol_trading/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/v67zay/a_guide_to_csps/\n\n**HOW TO CALCULATE EXPECTED VALUE**\n\nFirst, [here is the method](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result).\n\nYou typically know what your potential loss is, either by the structure of the trade (max loss on a vertical spread) or because you risk-manage to that loss. So the unknowns are your win rate and your potential profit. You just have to make your best guess at those.\n\nIn terms of win rate on a credit trade, you can estimate that by subtracting the delta of the short leg from 100%. So a 30 delta put spread may have a 70% win rate (if held to expiration). That's a good enough starting point for estimating EV.\n\nThen you have to adjust your estimate as the market changes. If your short leg is no longer 30 delta but is now 40 delta, your have to recalc your EV.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nI'll stop here, this is getting long. **I've barely scratched the surface of just one way to approach trade selection**. There are dozens of completely different ways to do this, but even this brief summary was super long.

But again, I dont know when to use when and under what conditions.\n5. For day trading, I am assuming that doing spreads and iron condors would be a kill. My overall strategy for day trading would be momentum directional. I actually wrote a algo (using the above algo framework) to buy single PUTS/CALLS -- 1 OTM with minimum 2 DTE (So on fridays it would literally buy next weeks options). Again, for the algo I picked few stocks and indices (SPY/QQQ), but it wasnt taking into account IV or any greeks.

If you don't hedge, you need to have confidence in the corresponding direction. For example, if you do a put credit spread, you need to be confident the underlying will go up or stay flat.\n\nIron Condors require the underlying to be range-bound for your holding time. The current market conditions are not friendly for ICs. You're forced to use very short holding times to minimize volatility, which limits your profitability.\n\nHere's a comprehensive guide for when to trade each type of structure:\n\nhttps://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/\n\n> 1 OTM with minimum 2 DTE (So on fridays it would literally buy next weeks options)\n\nWhat does \"1 OTM\" mean?

(The owner of the option contract could exercise the option to buy shares before the expiration date, or sell the option, or allow the option to expire.) You do not need to own shares to purchase a call. The call can be bought and sold for a per-share price quoted as the bid/ask in an \"option chain\".\n\n**A Put**  \nis a contract to potentially require a counter-party to take (to put into a counter-party's possession) 100 shares of XYZ at a per-share strike price. When exercised the contract puts (sells) to the counter-party 100 shares, and the option owner receives for the shares the strike price in dollars times 100. (The put owner could exercise, sell, or allow the put to expire.) You do not need to own shares to purchase a put. The put can be bought and sold for a per-share price quoted as the bid/ask in an \"option chain\".  \n\n\n---    \n**Back to your topic**\n\nFor a call, you are agreeing, you might exercise, and obtain shares at a particular strike price.  \n\nIf the shares are at $100, a strike price of 110, **out of the money** the call gives the right, at this moment, the right to **pay more** than market price. This does not have much value beccause if the trader exercised, it would be for a loss paying 110 for a 100 shares that the trader could buy directly for 100 dollars.  \n\nFor a call at 90, **in the money by $10**,   the right to buy at 90 means  that the trader pays $10 less for shares than market value.  That amounts to a gross value of $10 times 100 shares, or $1,000.  The seller of the option will not give away that value, and thus the market price will be more than $10.   \n\nYou can observe this in action in an option chain, listing bids and asks for calls, (and puts).  \n\nAn option chain.   \nApple options.   \nhttps://www.cboe.com/delayed_quotes/aapl/quote_table. \n\n---   \n\n\nPuts work in the opposite direction. The long put holder has the right to sell shares (put the shares into the possession of a counterparty).

And just like shorting stocks can increase the amount of shares floating around and even lead to more than 100% of available shares being shorted (as was the case with GME), the same is true for options.

Plus it looks like there's less liquidity.\n\nFor most options, yes. There are a handful that have very tight spreads, like front month SPY ATM calls, but there are thousands of contracts with terrible bid/ask spreads and less than 100 average daily volume across the entire chain.\n\nThat said, you can't expect something with an average daily volume of 1000 to have the same bid/ask as something with an average daily volume of 10 million, even if you multiply the contact volume by 100 to get a share volume equivalent. So using the bid/ask spread of some typical stock isn't really a fair benchmark for options.\n\n> Can anyone explain me how people make money with options?\n\nThe short answer is by making enough to compensate for the wider spreads. And that's not just hype, it's actually achievable. Granted, day trading and scalping gets hit the hardest by having to cross a wider bid/ask, but those styles are not the only ways to trade options (or shares, for that matter).\n\nOne important difference is that contracts can be much cheaper than shares. A $200/share stock might have contracts that are only $1/share.\n\nAlso, it helps to trade only the most liquid contracts, relatively. Personally, I only trade ATM contracts whose spread is no more than 10% of the bid. I'll go up to 20% further from the money. If the bid is $1.00, I'll trade $1.00/$1.08 just fine, but I'd avoid $1.00/$1.21.\n\nFinally, options are inherently leveraged. If your perspective on share trading is everything must be 1 for 1, that would explain why option profits are puzzling to you. It's really hard to make a 100% return in one day on any kind of share trade, but it's relatively easy with options.

It is not \"electric car market\" rather just car market.\n\nRivian has a market cap half that of GM or Ford, while GM and Ford out sell it in the market place several times over.     It too is way over valued.  Lucid is similar and I think the market for cars that cost more than the US median household income is saturated.\n\n\nThese stocks including TSLA got bid way up with folks thinking they were going to be disruptors, and be the next Ford.    This is not the case.   \n\nPeople have been making electric cars for  120 years.  Ford disrupted this market by selling cheap gas cars and marketing them to rural people outside the power grid.    Now, we have these new companies that are doing the opposite, marketing these electric cars, but only in the big cities.\n\nIn the electric car market, I like Toyota, as they have been developing and patenting solid state batteries, that might be the next thing for electric cars.  As far as their electric car chops, true they are late to the game, unless you count the Prius hybrid, who's synergy drive is licensed out to most the hybrid cars now.   \n\nDriving 3 hours to my closest  Tesla dealer, I'll pass 3 Toyota dealers.     I'm much more likely to buy a Toyota for that, than a Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, etc.   You might look at Tesla's profit margin, and say, wow, that looks good, but part of that profit margin is that Tesla doesn't have nearly the number of dealers or service centers as Toyota, Ford, GM, etc.    I've been seeing Rivians, so they might have a dealer in my state, but I've never seen a Lucid or any of the others so I'm betting their market is even more limited.\n\nTesla said when they started they were going to make a cheap people's car.  Their stock is priced to do that, but they haven't yet.  They got outsold within months in China when a company that GM has a piece of came out with an electric car for 1/10th the price of a Tesla.    The whole electric car market is missing the mark.\n\nEdit:  All that said, I like WOLF who is building chip plants in the US to build chips that control big current, like what is needed to throttle electric cars.  Might be early yet for those guys, they have put a lot of investment in these plants, and it remains to be seen if it will pay, but they are making EV chips, in the US as the US is incentivizing chip making and EV making in the US so I like that.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I had high hopes for lucid and so far it has burned me.

{"title": "I see dead markets everywhere. They don't know they're dead. They only see what they want to see.", "selftext": "This Santa rally is nothing more than the final stop for hedge funds and large financial investors to dump their holdings before shit really starts breaking and everyone realizes 2023 is where the real collapse occurs.  It's why there is no follow through over the 4000 SPX level and no conviction to keep it going higher once it gets there.\n\nYou know how you wish you could go back to November 2021 because the writing was clearly on the wall for a bear market in 2022?  Well, this is the time to jump on before the next big move down and I think you have at best until December 15th to get on.\n\nLets take a quick trip back in time and review how this current rally started.  It essentially bottomed on 10/13 because of the bad September CPI print but then immediately popped to the upside because it hit the 50% retracement level from the post COVID high.  There was absolutely nothing that happened that day to warrant such an aggressive move up, all purely technical based on algo buying.  Did you happen to catch the interviews on CNBC and Fox Business where they interviewed traders about the crazy day and asked them to explain what happened?  They all looked into the camera with glassy eyes  in total disbelief like they'd just watched their favorite grandma get run over by a dump truck.  They had no answers.  Which is why it immediately gave up most of those gains the next day.  But that algo buying is what prevented a move much farther down.\n\nThen comes 10/17 and 10/18 where it moves up again based on good financial earnings from the major banks and bond markets stabilizing in the UK.  After this the market starts giving up those gains but then we have the Wall Street Journal article on 10/21 with comments from Fed president Daly that sparked the market up until 11/1 based on the notion that \" We’re closer to the end than we are to the beginning, and the more bear market rallies we see, the fewer are left before we finally flush it all out\" -  SoFi's Head of Investment Strategy Liz Young.From 10/21:\n\n* In remarks at a meeting Friday, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said the U.S. central bank should avoid tipping the economy into an \"unforced downturn\" and that it was time to [consider easing the pace of hikes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-says-time-start-180309530.html).\n* Investors also assessed a [Wall Street Journal report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-set-to-raise-rates-by-0-75-point-and-debate-size-of-future-hikes-11666356757?mod=hp_lead_pos1) earlier in the day indicating Fed policymakers are poised to deliver another interest rate increase of 0.75% at their meeting Nov. 1-2 and but are expected to discuss the possibility of a smaller increase in December.\n\nThis narrative is quickly put to rest by Powell on 11/2 and the market continues down for a short time but does not break out of its uptrend even though Powell stated a smaller rate hike in December does not mean they are stepping back or pivoting from their continued battle with inflation.  He continues to reinforce the smaller -> higher -> longer narrative.\n\nThe market gives no fucks and after a short period of consolidation it blows it's load on 11/10 after a CPI print that comes in slightly better than expectations.  From this point it's been consolidating and moving between 395 and 403.\n\n**So what am I saying here?  I'm saying this current rally shouldn't be happening but the market refuses to accept the truth of where the Fed and this economy is going.  However, to quote a line from one of my favorite shows last year, \"Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth.  And sooner or later, that debt is paid.\"**\n\nSo now lets look at some of the truth this market is ignoring.\n\n***The consumer savings rate is approaching a historical low while their debt ratio is moving to an all time high.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/32sqni25cq2a1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fc4adb6747b7ad5f2d856d7d2b5ff3150a8cd93\n\n***The 10 Year - 3 Month treasury yield inversion has hit a level not seen since before the dot com bust.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q3oxa8r6cq2a1.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85353e3b05e2c9e8b34413ad580912ae97fbeb37\n\n***The 10 Year - 2 Year inversion has hit a level not seen since the 80s.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8ozmo48cq2a1.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d82153813cee52bd08e30241e08c38f9dafd49c\n\n***The VIX has hit the bottom of its current trendline as well as a major oversold flag.*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z1ukr9/vix\\_is\\_broken\\_what\\_comes\\_next/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z1ukr9/vix_is_broken_what_comes_next/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggpugepacq2a1.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9823b4748e01e3346cb38eda8fdf760497c14ccf\n\n***The SKEW Index that tracks the possibility of a greater than 2 standard deviation drop is moving straight up.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2uz7apcccq2a1.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55d959dd956d691fe5ad4631041ec02ffaaa8940\n\n***QT still happening and the draining of this liquidity from the market is only going to raise volatility.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1o2bikdcq2a1.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7b4026cf58fa8c057a3e1ec2df603e757c1d4a0\n\n***Big Banks have sold off more than $150 billion in mortgage backed securities since last October (at a loss) You can read my previous post about this here:***  [***https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z2eydj/mortgage\\_backed\\_securities/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z2eydj/mortgage_backed_securities/)\n\n***This is another great explainer of the upcoming problem with mortgage backed securities:***  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUoqncO1\\_pc&t=2153s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUoqncO1_pc&t=2153s)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v5hlrbdfcq2a1.jpg?width=1691&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b44caeacba06df19d160cac8a0d58a9d933bc14\n\n***And here is a great showing of how this rally has detached itself from reality.

But I guess the leaf captures enough of the market for them, while they work on whatever it is, they are working on for the future. I’m not sure if they will redesign current cars to come out as EV’s, or if they will design all new cars. But once they get their shit spinning, I assume they will maintain the same standard for reliability and good build quality. Might take longer than I think, might not happen, who knows.
