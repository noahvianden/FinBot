The celebrity executive disposed of 19.5 million shares Tuesday, which is worth about $3.95 billion, according to three filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMusk did not take to Twitter to explain why he sold shares, but it’s possible the money will go towards his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform, which went through last month.\n\nIn April, Musk also sold around 9.6 million shares of Tesla stock, which at the time was worth $8.5 billion. Those shares were sold at around $885.42. Since then, Tesla has issued a three-for-one stock split, bringing the cost of each share down.\n\nMusk sold shares Tuesday at an average price of $202.56 each.\n\nTesla is currently trading at $191.30 after hours.\n\n-----------\n\n$TSLA TESLA UPDATED INSIDER BUYING / SELLING OVER THE LAST YEAR  \n  \nBuy Transactions: 0  \nBuy amount: 0  \nSell Transactions: 1455  \nSell amount: $35,974,783,779\n  \nSource: https://twitter.com/gurgavin/status/1590159021499379712", "id": "yq5y61", "created_utc": 1667960590.0, "score": 2382, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 352, "comments": [{"body": "Going to need to spring for TurboTax premium this year.", "score": 499, "replies": [{"body": "FreeTaxUSA.com", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "This is huge.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Yuge!", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "+1 for this shit.

This all of course assumes the stock price stays level, what I really mean when I say $100k is you got $100k worth of stock at the time of the award. Continuing the 100k example, if the stock price was $1,000/share when you started and $500/share after 1 year when you get your second grant, you'd have 100 shares from year 1 and 200 shares from year two.

Also, publicly traded companies use RSU because essentially you are being paid with share dilution, i.e. the company doesn't have to pay anything for those RSU's as the market bears the cost in the company share price.  When a publicly traded company is doing ok, annual RSU grants resulting in more shares being issued usually won't affect the stock price much, if at all.

So they can work wherever they want (or start their own company) as long as the visa is valid. If they want to extend the visa beyond the original validity, the worker's current employer would go through the normal visa extension process. And then for green cards, I would remove employers from the process altogether. If you have an employment visa (like H-1B) and have been stably employed in the US for some number of years (say, 3) in a job area where there is a shortage of qualified workers, you can self petition for a green card.\n\nAs it currently stands, the job mobility for visa holders is quite bad because they are dependent on their employer for visa amendment sponsorship and for their green card application. This is exacerbated by the green card application process taking so long (years). If you want to switch jobs, you not only have to find another employer who is willing and capable of supporting the immigration process, but you also have to start the green card application from scratch. This leads to employees sort of being held captive to their current employer.\n\nWhy does this matter? Didn't these visa workers choose that situation? Well, perhaps they did, or maybe they simply didn't understand the full scope of it.

It’s tough, but it’s definitely not a U.S. thing or even an unjust way of doing things.

I'm saying once your past that entire process, the subsequent application for permanent residency shouldn't be tied to your employer.\n\nUnder the current law, those employees may not be able to stay in the country even if they get a comparable job offer from a different company, simply because their original visa status has expired (or will soon), but the green card application isn't approved yet (the application process can take years). You can normally extend your visa while your green card application is pending. But if you're laid off then the green card application is withdrawn because it depends on the employer. So then you're just shit out of luck. \n\nAs for the process in other countries: in many countries the original visa application is dependent on the employer (just like the US), but the subsequent transition to permanent residency is not.

All good, nothing super impressive there.\n\nThat said, since 2016, they've been working on what they call \"full self driving\", and that's basically a machine learning engineer's wet dream.\n\nThey're using a plethora of different ML model architectures to perceive the world using computer vision/cameras, to identify parts of that world that are relevant for driving (lanes, lane lines, lane interconnectiveness, stop lights, stop signs, other cars, bicyclist, dogs, people, signs, cones, etc), and to predict how the world is going evolve over time so the car can make smooth/safe/intelligent decisions on how to best drive.\n\nSome of the ML topics they've covered are 1. depth maps from static images (no parallax), 2. depth maps from videos, 3. 3D birds-eye-view scene reconstruction in 360 degrees from 8 different cameras, 4. lane interconnectedness using transformer language models, and so many other pieces that I could get carried away with.\n\nOne thing that I don't think many people realize is that every single Tesla that's been made since 2016 is basically a rolling data-collection device. When Tesla talks about \"the fleet\", what they're referring to is their ability to send out a request to all 2 million cars and ask the cars to upload any/all data related to some specific scenario they're trying to understand.\n\nThey can send out a campaign that says, \"if you (the car) see a scenario where there's a stop sign that appears to be attached to a bus, please upload all videos/telemetry from those situations\". They can then use all of that data (once it's labeled) as training data that can be used to, say, train a small neural network to identify school buses. They do this ALL THE TIME.\n\nIf you want me to go into more detail, I'll gladly do that. Or if you want, I can send some video resources that validate all of the stuff I've just said.

{"title": "All my money is stuck in FTX, and I am insolvent", "selftext": "Hi guys, allow me to share my story.\n\nI'm 37. Asian male. Single. Ex-SWE\n\nDuring the peak of the 2021, I became a millionaire. I went all in with my 300k on TSLA in beginning of 2020, and it ended up shoot up to 1.5mil at the peak. Overnight, I became a millionaire without doing much other than clicking a few things in my browser. That gave me confidence. That gave me thinking that I am the shit. I quit my job since I actually never liked SWE, and said I'm gonna do my on thing. I started dabbling in C and put majority of my winnings there.\n\nThen it dropped by 60% during the recent crashes. I still had around 400k in C, and I basically stopped trading at a point and put all of that into USDC. Only that it was all in FTX and now I can't draw them out.\n\nI don't know what's gonna happen, but right now I'm sitting at 10k liquid in my bank. I thought I was a confidence millionaire, and all the sudden things went upside down.\n\nThis is scary. All the sudden, things just went to 0. Everything I had worked for suddenly came crumbling down.\n\nSo I went from being a confident millionaire to a terrified crybaby. I don't know what's gonna happen, but this is where I am now.\n\nEverything -- gone, just like that.\n\nI wanna say im fine, but its slowly settling in on me.\n\nBut someone dawned on me. A realization. An epiphany.\n\nThe way I had been going with my life is entirely backwards. I viewed money as important, but in the end it isn't. When I became a millionaire, I thought it'd be world changing. It isn't. I wasn't any different, but having the lottery money gave me some confidence, and I ran with it. But now, gone with the crashes of 2022. I'm now jobless, savingless, and the prospects for finding a SWE job seems daunting amongst layoffs.\n\nIt just showed me how wrong I've been living life. Completely backwards. I never liked SWE and just did it for the money. With that money I invested into stocks and C, and did well. With that money, I upgrade my life, my tastes, etc. But deep down I wasn't happy nor fulfilled.\n\nThis all made me realize that I've been building my life on sand, and it's all been an illusion. Money, better life, upgrades, all these external things are just an illusion. Why was I chasing after all these? How did I end up in this mess?\n\nAnd, for the first time in a long time, I prayed. Surrendering myself, and prayed.\n\nAnd strangely enough, I don't feel so bad anymore.\n\nAll these external things -- chasing after money, luxury, materialism -- really don't mean much anymore. These are the wrong metrics to evaluate my life. And letting these go, freed me from the weight of thinking about them.\n\nFrom now, the metric I go by is how much I am helping others with my heart and skills. Doing this really makes me feel fulfilled.\n\nI have recently been dabbling with creators, and I completed a writing cohort and I've been helping out here and there. I feel very alive and fulfilled doing so.\n\nSo now I want to measure myself by how much I am helping others, building the **social credit or goodwill**, as the currency. I am going to give more than I take. I'm letting go of the obsession w/ money, and instead of focusing on helping ppl with my unique talents.\n\nI am not scared of my future, because I know this new path is a more fulfilling one to embark on.\n\n\\---\n\nIf you are impacted by these market meltdowns, i hope this message finds you and may be of help for you. These are true tests to see who you really are\n\n&#x200B;\n\n===\n\nUpdate 1 --a) I'm getting a lot of DMs from ppl who reached out and gave me a lot of supportive and positivity. I am truly grateful for you guys in times like this. My faith in humanity is truly restored. 1 redditor actually took me out in NYC and bought me dinner. Thank You.\n\nb) as much as how bad this event is, I'm actually am ok. I do have some savings left to keep me afloat for while, and I have family and friends who can support me in different ways. Also, I am actually working a side project that I am very passionate about -- have been working on it for a few months, and it definitely takes my mind off of all this craziness. This just showed me that working on what i'm passionate about and trying to build a biz out of it is more fulfilling, and all the degen speculations don't mean much to me.\n\nc) What's done is done, theres no point in ruminating about it so all we can do is to move on. Of course getting swept by these tsunami sucks, and it's really out of my control and I dont know how the future is going to play out. So I'm just gonna completely move on and focus on my project.\n\nd) in times like this, we all can be better and support each other. Some of you redditors gave me support + positivity that I couldn't get in real life, so thank you.\n\ne) SBF and these crooks destroyed our trust and faith in humanity, But lets not let that define us. Let's restore faith in humanity together and make a comeback together.\n\nf) I admit i suck at all these trading/investing/speculating things -- it's too complicated and I don't have the passion to study/master it like some the guys here in WSB. So admit I got lucky w/ TSLA and am retarded w/ how I am managing my portfolio. Better to work on things I care about and can get gud at.\n\n\\---\n\nUpdate 2: If anyone cares, I'm going to write about my exp w/ FTX and how I am dealing with it.

Binance announced they were liquidating all their FTXs tokens in next few months which led to other people liquidating FTX tokens and tanking the price of FTX tokens. Binance holds a lot of these FTTs because they used to be an investor in FTX.\n2. That led to investors asking FTX to show it still has the collateral they gave FTX in exchange for tokens.

Smaller investors, realizing this indicates FTX doesn't have much collateral, start to cash out their FTX accounts, scared FTX will run out of money to pay withdrawals.\n3.

The liquidation of FTX will go towards paying obligations and secured claims first (account holders are unsecured loans and would only have priority over investors). Users get transferred to Binance.Also FTX had a deal to buy Voyager (one of the crypto exchanges that failed this summer) for $51 million cash and taking on their users accounts at 70% value or so pending creditors vote and agreement by the bankruptcy judge in December.
