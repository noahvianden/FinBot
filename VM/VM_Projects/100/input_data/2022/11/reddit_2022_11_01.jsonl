You can have a guided learning environment that is low stakes and repeated to learn whatever hands on skill it may be.

It won‚Äôt replace learning in real life obviously, but if it were up to me I would want a doctor who is training to learn and practice first in an artificial environment. \n\nAnother application with surgery.. Did you know that surgeons can not touch anything once they are scrubbed in? What if the surgeon is operating in the sinuses and is using CT imaging findings to guide the surgery? They can‚Äôt go on the computer and search things up.. That would break sterility for the operation. They tell someone to look it up or it is already pre-loaded on a monitor in a room. Add AR, and now they can use gestures without touching anything to load up image findings, manipulate, and optimize for their surgery. \n\nThink about how many professions this involves.. A lot. That is a big fucking TAM just for one aspect of AR/VR that none of you parrots think about because nobody is actually critically thinking about this situation. This is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity. Will Meta take the whole market? No. But will they take a substantial portion of the market? UHHH YEAHHH.
