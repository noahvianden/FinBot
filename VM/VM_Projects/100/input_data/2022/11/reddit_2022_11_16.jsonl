It wasn't a retail investor bubble imo, but a bubble caused by the Fed and their extremely reckless monetary policy decisions.\n\nBefore retail investors even began pouring into the the markets in late 2020 I wrote a thread on Twitter in the summer explaining that the Fed would inevitably create a stock market bubble if they continued on the path they were on. The influx of retail investors was a simply natural reaction to what the Fed was doing during that time.\n\nBut for whatever reason today no one is blaming the Fed, but instead blaming the victims of the Fed's policy mistakes while even claiming that the bubble Powell created in 2020-2021 was necessary. And I'm sure these same idiots will still be celebrating Powell when we're in a recession in 2023 because, well, at least he fixed the inflation problem he created!\n\nWhat annoys me the most about the current narrative though is that everyone seems to have forgotten that only reason we have such a strict inflation target is because price stability is supportive of economic growth. Specifically the 2% inflation target is important because it gives people some certainty over their financial decisions. Eg, if you're going to borrow, lend or invest money then having some idea where inflation will be over that period is important when assessing your decision.\n\nBut perhaps the only thing more important than having some confidence that inflation isn't going to spike to 10% is knowing that the Fed isn't going to be pivoting between creating asset bubbles and rug pulling asset holders every few years.\n\nI'd argue we've already seen Powell scare an entire generation of investors away from the stock market and they're now likely about to put a decent amount of first time home buyers into negative equity. Or wait, is also the home buyers fault that they brought a home in bubble of Powell's creating? I guess they should have known better.\n\nIf there's anything that should be taken away from what we've seen over the last few years I think it's the importance of balancing the predictability of monetary policy with inflation targeting. Having to factor in the risk of excessive monetary policy pivots is probably not supportive for long-term growth.\n\nSo if future economists are looking at this period I hope they'll be looking into whether there was a long-term investment confidence consequence to any of Fed's action over the last few years and not simply pointing the finger at home buyers, bond holders and stock market investors. Because let's be honest, it was the Fed pivoting from the most accommodative monetary policy in history to the most aggressive monetary tightening in history that caused the mispricing in assets, the double digit inflation prints and the likely 2023 recession. Not retail traders.\n\nAnyway, I know from the perspective of my own risk management going forward I'll be much more conservative with my investments and debt because I have been significantly underestimating how reckless central bankers can be. I'll probably also be less concerned about fundamentals when investing because as we've all found out the only thing that really matters is accurately predicting what central bankers might do next. We all know whether our portfolio is going to go up or down month has next to nothing to do with what companies we're investing in and almost everything to do with what one man might say.\n\n\\[/rant\\]", "score": 203, "replies": [{"body": "Most people who know anything do blame the Fed for being way too late in reducing their easy money policy.\n\nI suspect they will be late in slowing down their tightening too.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "I also blame them for STARTING the inflation issue.\n\nThey pumped trillions into the economy in 2020 and seeing as everyone states it \"takes a year or more to show up\".\n\nWalla, we have the inflation spike of 2022 and the consecutive rate hikes.\n\nRates should've been 3-4% this whole time\n \nBut no, let's lower them to 0% and then pump trillions into the economy\n\nAnd then panic about it later", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Voila, not walla .  r/boneappletea", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Interestingly it's also common to hear wallah in France. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wallah#French", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Walla?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Boneappletea for voilá", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Voila I imagine", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Inflation wasn’t caused by monetary policy, it was caused by fiscal policy (PPP, stimulus, enhanced unemployment, etc, and similar policies worldwide).\n\nThe Fed and other central banks had loose monetary policy for the entirety of the 2010s with very low inflation.

The rules and regulations from the EU can really kill the economy and take away from sovereignty. A lot of regulations have made it extremely hard for small or medium businesses as they can't afford the bureaucracy and the financial burden of living up to all the requirements. Regulation is a killer. I live in Denmark and my experience is that it hurts on all levels, i only really have deep knowledge in the energy sector and from business administration related university classes. Let me give an example from it, you know the GDPR nonsense right? for energy this is a major issue because no smart network solutions that rely on sharing data could ever be attractive since any company would have so many data hoops that make it impossible. (my source: the ceo of Ewii who had a meeting with me and a handful of other college students, Ewii is a energy company in DK) \n\nIf a business were to collect data with consent from the user they still wouldn't be able to pass it on to the other involved companies that need it as well for the grid to function. A real killer for all smart systems that want to regulate for example when electric cars charge. Another example are energy labels. You can't produce items without a label in many categories. If you can't get it you can't produce, if you can't afford the regulation and certification you can't produce. Similarly all the DIN ISO etc standards that are imposed, they are sometimes helpful but often they serve to create a competitive advantage for one particular company. See if one particular company is ahead of others in some ESG areas, they can then push for their own standards to become regulation, instantly hurting all the competitors who quickly have to invest big to catch up. (source: risk management classes, classes on sustainability)\n\nAt my work GDPR and other rules also pose a problem. I administer subsidies and we in Denmark are forced to do illogical things and do unhelpful things because we can't legally change our own laws due to the EU. So EU regulations make administration more costly and less effective. And gdpr also hinder us because again we need inefficient processes to prevent data sharing with third parties that we need to cooperate with or even across our own departments.\n\nIf they could have kept open trade with the EU following the EUs demands for trade but getting rid of all the other EU top down approach interference, then it would probably have been a big win to Brexit.\nI have more examples of how the EU hurts its strongest countries massively but those aren't Brexit related.

On a regular mortgage, the bulk of the payments are capital repayments, so a doubling of interest rates does not mean a doubling of repayments, it means a doubling of repayments on the small portion of the monthly bill that is interest rather than capital.

Revenue was down 17% on a year-on-year basis.\n\nNvidia is closely watched by analysts and investors as a leading indicator for the health of the technology industry, because it sells chips and software to so many PC makers and cloud providers.\n\nIn the past few months, chip companies like Nvidia have been slashing order expectations and warning that their customers are overstocked with computer parts. In May, Nvidia said it would slow the pace of its hiring.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that the company was “adapting to the macro environment.”\n\nThe PC gaming market is slowing after the pandemic boom. Nvidia graphics cards, which had been hard to find in stock in 2020 and 2021, are now seeing retail discounts. Nvidia also recently announced a new generation of graphics cards which are priced higher than the previous models.\n\nNvidia’s gaming division reported $1.57 billion in sales, down 51% year-over-year. Nvidia said it was selling less to retailers because they have more inventory than current demand. It said that macroeconomic conditions, in addition to China’s zero-Covid policy, are hurting consumer demand.\n\nA brighter spot was Nvidia’s data center business, which reported $3.83 billion in sales, up 31% year-over-year. Nvidia attributed the growth to sales to U.S. cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.\n\nIn July, Nvidia cut its guidance for the October quarter. Nvidia also warned in August that it would be hit by U.S. export controls that prevent some fast artificial intelligence chips from being sold to Chinese companies. In November, it revealed a new chip that is designed to meet the U.S. export rules.\n\nNvidia said that the reduced sales from the GPUs barred in China would be largely offset by its alternative products.\n\nNvidia has a few smaller lines of business, including professional visualization and automotive chips. They are small. Professional visualization shrunk 65% on an annual basis to $200 million. Automotive grew 86% but is still very small, reporting $251 million in sales.\n\nThe company’s “other” category reported $73 million in revenue. It includes Nvidia’s cryptocurrency mining chips (CMP). The company said sales from the CMP chips were “nominal.”\n\nNvidia said it spent $3.75 billion on share repurchases and dividends during the quarter.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/16/nvidia-nvda-earnings-q3-2023-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/16/nvidia-nvda-earnings-q3-2023-.html)", "id": "yx76kp", "created_utc": 1668634983.0, "score": 683, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 204, "comments": [{"body": "Bearish on that earnings call mic quality.
