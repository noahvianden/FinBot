The first type is buying their first home, generating wealth, not having to pay rent. For them it is a lot less important when they buy in the cycle compared to how quickly they can just buy in general. The sooner someone buys a home the more likely they are to build wealth. Speculators and people who own multiple homes. That's a different story. There's more risk and the strength of the economy plays a gigantic part. Probably the most important part. Trying to time cycles, if you can do it it's helpful but really what you need is someone to pay the rent. It's very common to see higher end workers making over 150k a year own at least two homes these days normally they live in one and rent the other. I even have one friend who completely quit his job after acquiring his fourth rental. These two groups tend to look at the market much differently\n\nIt's also worth noting from a payment perspective, that first group, if they would have bought at the top of the market. Their payment would still be less than buying the same home 15% off today, even 20% off just because of the massive difference in interest rate.

As bad as things appear here since we are used to things costing the same price for years on end. It's worse practically everywhere else. It's costing Europeans far more to buy American goods than many have seen in their life. We also know that inflation is measured in things like the CPI year over year. That means if an item goes from $100 to $120 you have 20% inflation but if it stays at $120 the next year it's now zero. That part is lost on a lot of regular people. At some point this next year, probably somewhere between April and June you're going to see inflation numbers fall pretty hard even if nothing else changes. That's why.

This relationship has something to do with a principle called the interest rate parity. I won't explain the entirety in detail here (feel free to google, plenty of good explanations), but foreign exchange rates and government interest rates are theoretically bound to each other by no-arbitrage. Let me give a simple example to illustrate why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAssume no transaction costs or default of country debt in this example. Imagine a world where the exchange rate of USD/EUR is **always** 1 to 1, or parity. However, the 1 year UST bond is at 1%, and the 1 year EU bond is at 5%. A smart trader realizes a risk free trade that makes infinite money. He first shorts $1 billion worth of 1y UST bond (you receive USD when you short a bond). He then immediately converts this USD into 1 billion EUR, and longs 1 billion EUR worth of 1y EU bond.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFast forward to a year later, the EU bond has matured. You receive 1.05 billion EUR. You immediately convert the EUR back to USD (still at 1 to 1), and repay back 1.01 billion USD (principle plus 1% interest on the UST). You've just made 0.04 billion USD, or 40 million, for absolutely risk free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou cannot have free lunch. As you can see from this example, in order to prevent this infinite money glitch (arbitrage), the USD/EUR exchange rate 1 year forward had to have increased (meaning something closer to 1.05 USD per EUR). Otherwise, everybody in the world would make free money.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTLDR: if the dollar weakens versus a currency, the UST rate(s) must also decrease in order to prevent arbitrage.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Fascinating answer!\n\nSo do you think the US $ just weakened heavily due to other countries also raising 75 or 50 BP recently and matching the hawkishness of the fed?

Every market (especially forex) is very complicated, and you can never pinpoint exact reasons for things.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Remember that policy rates of central banks are unknown in the future. Just like stocks, global treasury markets are also based on **expectations** of future actions, and thus will price in future hawkishness/dovishness of central banks. As an example, a country could signal a policy that front loads jumbo hikes 2 times faster than the US, but the market might also price in a faster decrease rates later on. In this case, exchange rate reactions to this will likely not be certain.\n\n\n2. Forex operates in many pairs, and there's just no way to really generalize strength for a single currency. The dollar index that the media refers to and uses to measure our currency strength is comprised of only 6 currency pairs. 57.6% of the index is weighted to the EUR. A scenario that could happen is that the EUR weakens vs both CNH and USD, but USD also weakens vs CNH. In this case, the media might report this as a dollar strengthening because the dollar index is up, but in fact USD has weakened vs CNH.\n\n\n3. For certain countries, default risk premiums heavily skew upward as you raise interest rates. Let's take Argentina as an example. A 5% increase in policy rates in Argentina will produce a MUCH greater increase in government bond yields than would a 5% increase in policy rates in America.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n> Also, won't the jpy move even further past 150 to 160 given that the rest of the world only continues to distance itself from them on Treasury rates?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYes exactly, and that's generally the reasoning for base case forecast in the near term (weaker yen assuming they don't change policy).
