Companies need free cash.  Consumers need free cash.  When this cash is plentiful, the market is hot.  When it is scarce, the market tanks.  This most basic concept is unavoidable.\n\nInflation alone is only a minor element.  It is NOT the driving force behind a scarcity of cash.  It's BLAMED for it, but it's not the source.\n\nI'll give a few examples of first hand experience.  So I work for a company that makes industrial equipment.  We deal with regulations, supply chain, and inflation.  In the last decade, there have only been three things that have affected sell prices.  Inflation is one, and it's generally a pretty reliable one year after year.  Over the last couple years we've seen a 14% jump in the US, only an 8% jump over normal.  This is not a huge number, and it's a number most people don't even actually notice.  Why?  Because they didn't care about number two at all either.\n\nThe second was tariffs.  When Trump pushed through a bunch of tariffs, it affected several major material suppliers and forced up material costs.  This resulted in around an 8% to 10% bump in sell price to offset.  For example, we saw a 30% increase in steel price alone.  But it also affected wood and paper too.  So, even tariffs were a bigger deal to us than inflation, and the general public didn't bat an eye over it.\n\nThe third is the big one.  Covid.  When Covid hit and world governments reacted (poorly), the world mass production monstrosity was effectively turned off and back on again.  This produced MASSIVE inefficiencies in all sorts of ways.  Inventories dwindled.  Productions pipe lines shut off.  Personnel were lost.  Some companies completely failed and died off.  Many companies found it hard to restart.  There was difficulty in getting labor back into work.  Businesses ate through on-hand cash waiting out the storm.  If you were operating, you were operating lean and also likely eating through cash.  Then price increases hit.  Material prices skyrocketed.  Lead times skyrocketed.  All of a sudden you had to buy at 2x, 3x, or more the price for the same materials AND you had to buy more NOW in order to offset the growing lead times AND you had to somehow do this while cash strapped.  At best, you were lucky and either had enough excess cash or outside sources of cash to float you by.  Most screeched to nearly a halt and could barely get product through.  It didn't help that as the supply chain failed, AP and AR went wild.  You had a hell of a time paying your vendors NET 30, NET 45, NET 60, or greater.  And equally, you had a hell of a time getting customers to pay.  It became a chicken and the egg problem.  You need receivables to meet payables, but everyone is in the same boat.  And if you couldn't make it work, you couldn't produce.  How bad was/is this?  (yes, is, because this is STILL happening)  Remember that 30% bump in steel pricing from tariffs?  Well, Covid related supply chain issues skyrocketed that up to 300% to 400% or greater.  Almost overnight you're paying 3x to 4x for steel, and this goes into your product.  Then you are forced to burden your customers with this added cost or your profit dollars go to zero, or negative, and you die.  Collectively, this all creates a MASSIVE inefficiency problem, one that's lasted for about a year and a half so far, that all companies had to navigate and somehow survive (many did not).  So how bad exact was/is the Covid supply chain problem?  Well, on a national scale, it's estimated to be around a 60% to 70% increase in prices of goods/services overall, but each market segment varies.  This upcoming year, it will again be another 10% to 20% bump as the supply chain smooths out, cash flow stabilizes, and companies adapt.  Personally, we saw an 80% to 100% bump for this year and another 15% to 20% next year.  Inflation has NOTHING on these kinds of numbers.\n\nAs far as the stock market is concerned,\n\nIt's driven by cash, so until people have cash, the market will be in a recession.  When will people have cash?  Well, from a business standpoint, next year will be an ok year for businesses.  The market is smoothing out.  Businesses are making adjustments to sell prices that allow healthy profit markets and enough positive cash flow to survive.  2023 will be a relatively stable year for businesses, and you will likely see some record profits in some areas.  People will blame corporate greed, but that's not really correct.  This is just a game of survival.  2024 will be the first year where we will likely see a decrease in prices.  So next Sept/Oct companies will look at metrics and set pricing for 2024.  Come Jan 1 2024 there will likely be sweeping decreases in prices on goods and services, and this should continue for years after.  When pricing hits the market in 2024, consumers will find a lot of relief.  I'm hoping between now and then consumers also see continued wage increases because this too will do wonders for buying power and consumerism.  This cash excess wave will hit and just start flooding the market.  The light boom in 2023 for businesses will be nothing in comparison to 2024, 2025, etc. that will come.\n\nWhat this means as a buyer of stocks is 2023 should flatten out.  This will be a STRONG buying year if you have cash to invest.  The market has dipped considerably, and it will be a stellar time to invest.  You're going to see massive rewards from those investments come 2024 and beyond.\n\nThis is of course barring any other major world catastrophe happening.  That is and forever will always be an unknown.\n\nWait, wait, WAIT!!!  What about oil?\n\nWhat about it?\n\nOil is looney toons land.  It doesn't really care what the world is doing.  Oil is at the whim and mercy of very few people, people who are not playing by any rules that govern you or I.  All you get to do is ride the wave.  If you were smart and saw it, there were stellar times to jump in.  For example, when the market was tanking starting last December, the only thing on the market that was hot was oil.  And if you bought in it after the Covid hit, you could have seen a 10x or greater jump in your investment.  It was the only thing making money or was stable through the first half of the year.  It runs in cycles and has for a long time.  You can still buy into it and just stay in it and make money too.  It's not like oil is ever really going to tank.  It's a controlled and increasingly scarce commodity.  And even if demand drops due to electrification and green energy, it will still go up.  It's this magical thing.  For an investor, the choice is really about if you want to play in the waves or just sit on it.  And because oil plays in a cartoon world, you don't worry about things like inflation.\n\nAlso, for as much as people complain about gas prices, it's not really a major factor towards cost of goods.  It is a part of the whole, sure, but it's not a major factor.

The current drought is resulting in 30%+ drops in yields, and for some crops like tomatoes they're just tilling plants back into the ground or letting them rot because they can't get water.  For some crops,ike strawberries, it's a short term price hike.  Anything that grows on a tree in a drought area, like almonds, is at serious risk of a much longer spike.  It will take 10+ years to recover crops grown on trees.  Almond farms in California are a very real risk that no one is paying attention to.  In the Midwest it's worse, because drought is going to fuck with soil salinity.  Farmers dropped fertilizer on the ground that then didn't get proper absorption.  It's going to require several rounds of crop rotations to rebalance the soil chemistry and will impact their ability to use fertilizers on the next couple of rounds, reducing yields even more.\n\n2.  Animal husbandry is severely fucked.  Right now beef prices are on the drop.  Everyone thinks it's great, but the real reason is that there's excessive slaughter going on because ranchers know they can't afford to feed cattle through winter.  Cows are being slaughtered at record numbers too, which means we're 3-4 years out on getting steers back to slaughter to make up the demand.  Similar issues for pork, except that china is the real pork problem.  They're consuming so much pork that they're building 20+ story slaughterhouses and will continue to keep very high pressure on pork, particularly pork belly prices.\n\n3.  Bird flu what?  The last round of avian flu killed over 50 MILLION poultry animals.  It's the largest outbreak in history.  In the past the infection rates were only about 1/4 from interaction with wild foul.  Now they're estimating as much as 80% of the infection is coming from wild foul, which would seem to indicate a much more infectious and pervasive avian flu is making the rounds.  Compounded with the increased demand for eggs for vaccine production and the poultry pressure isn't going away anytime soon.  Another round of avian flu and poultry might make beef look affordable.  Wait for the Audubon society next round of wild bird survey to see how it's playing out in nature too.\n\nI could go on and on there's at least another half dozen major influences including diesel price, Ukraine, worker shortage etc that are also more minor influences.

The costs of the trucks *may* be cheap enough to offset the need for 2 truck doing one trucks job, and thus offset the charging downside.\n\n This isn't my only source be he includes almost all the details of why Tesla Truck would work out.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Uv44W7xa4IU\n\nFor some reference 500 miles isn't the *best* range as some trucks can touch 700 miles in the 11 hours of driving we are legally limited to do ( not gonna go in depth of Driving Hour requirements, but know that we can't go above 11 hours , so if a truck COULD do 65mph A ERAGE the whole trip, that's 715 miles. Obviously, that's not the case for a lot of trucks in traffic or not meant to hit 700+ miles in a day. My route is set, I run a round trip between Liberty, MO and Omaha, Nebraska that's 420 miles round trip. So, if I was handed a Tesla truck , it'd work out for my routes needs. In fact it'd work out for about 75% of our routes,  the others are longer than the range and wouldn't work. \n\nOne of the major factors is the charging time. And that's where it starts causing problems. As above, MY route works, but my truck is used by another driver during the night time when the truck SHOULD be charging for my run the next day. The battery packs ( as far as I know ) are not swappable so the truck would have to sit idle for X amount of hours to recharge. The company *could* buy a second truck , but thats an extra initial cost that won't \"pay for itself\" for a few years . The Charge time isn't very long , but now we start getting in the maintenance side of the chargers and the trucks. Any misstep there, and suddenly your down a truck. To be fair, a diesel truck CAN break at any time as well, but a diesel engine is rather simply designed and easy to repair. Hypothetically, the Tesla would be fairly easy to fix, but it's a LOT of wire chasing , and if you've ever had to chase a wiring problem...it's a nightmare. Not to mention impacts of weather ( EV cars range is shorter in cold weather ) and power outages can happen for days or even weeks at a time after storms (summer or winter).  There are some limits that a diesel would never incur, but diesel itself has some niche problems though none so glaring as an EV.\n\nAnyways, this isn't all inclusive, I'm probably missing a few details but overall , it could be done. \nCompanies will try anything ( that's not a compliment....) To save on costs and there is potential for some cost savings. Th", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This all sounds about right although I have a few questions / points (and we do have to take Tesla at their word for this sadly, but):\n\n- I thought truckers were limited to 8 hours, am I just wrong or is this state by state?\n- I believe i remember seeing Elon talk onstage about how the trucks can be charged while they are being loaded / offloaded at the specific points, (obviously you need a charger at those points) and that a normal tank can take 20+minutes of holding the gas pump there already (not sure if true, never filled a truck but sounds right with how massive the fuel tanks are)\n- theoretically the Tesla‚Äôs are meant to break down less the normal cars because of break pad wear, no engine wear, and a few other parts that electric don‚Äôt require\n- cold weather also significantly impacts fuel consumption, not just batteries. It may be worse for Tesla‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not sure\n- 500miles is solid but if it‚Äôs only 75% of the jobs then you‚Äôre obviously better off having a mixed fleet of trucks, in a few years I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the batteries are more efficient and can cover 97% at like 850miles\n- I feel like auto pilot would benefit truckers the most. They have insanely long drives often with very little traffic on straight forward roads (especially in places like Australia) it probably will need a shit load of work first though", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Appreciate the follow-up question ( seriously, thanks for asking )\n\n1. We are required to stop for 30 minutes minimum in the *first* 8 hours of driving. That counts as our lunch/rest break. So, after maybe 6 hours of driving , we'd stop for food or restroom break for 30 minutes , and then the other 5 hours of driving time will unlock for us ( you can never have more than 8 hours unlocked at once, so taking a 30 minute break 2 hours and your shift would force you to take another 30 minute break to unlock  more driving time )  We get in serious trouble for not taking 30 minute breaks and could loose our license if we do that enough times. The truck won't shut down or anything, we have to watch the computer hooked up to our truck that constantly monitors our times.  But we are allowed up to a total of 11 of of driving per shift and allowed to be \"on duty\" ( fancy way of saying doing work ) for a total of 14 hours in a 24 hour period. \n\n2. Pumping fuel does take quite a long amount of time, about the 10-20 minutes your thinking ( diesel pumps at truck stops are extremely fast compared to cars fuel pumps ), so to your point, if charging is infact that quick and reliable, it's the same impact either way and that becomes moot. I will add though, that some drugs can have fuel tanks as large as 300 gallons, which gives them about 1,800 of range before needing to refuel. So not only is fueling not a daily occurrence anymore, but there's no way with turn battery tech to even come close to that range.  I will say that truck stop fueling for diesel is very fluid with one filling up, another truck behind him waiting, and we can guess it'll take about 20 minutes for him to fuel and get out of the way. *Having never used one* , I'm skeptical  even quick charging systems would be as fluid unless there's I display timer of sorts. Trucks just can't ( and won't, because we don't get paid sitting around )  wait to recharge after the current one without knowing your long it may take. , Yeah, some places could install charging systems at a company location ,  but I really wouldn't see that happening without some kind of tax incentive or kick back. \n\n3. Correct, by their very nature electric motors are much more reliable than many other systems. If prefer electric motors myself, I wouldn't complain about an EV truck. That said, diesel engines have been refined to the point where half a million miles on an engine is common. And for a few thousand dollars ,a rebuild kit would bring that engine back to life like new.  Without knowing the cost of a new battery pack or replacement electric motor, it's too early to tell which would be more viable, but I'd bet on EV being better as tech advanced. \n\n4. Also a good counter point, The advantage still goes to diesel on this as I made above, only because a bigger fuel tank offsets than you reduced economy of cold weather. For now, adding more batteries isn't an option until the either design more dense or made smaller to increase range. That will happen in the long run so the diesel advantage will go away. If battery range can be extended to 800 miles ( your always want a buffer zone, and again that goes back to the maximum amount of miles of truck could run in a day being about 700 ) , there's not many advantages, if any, to diesel anymore. \n\n5. We both essentially answered. 800-850 is perfect.\n\n6. This is just my opinion, I personally I never want to be in a truck that's autopilot. There are some running currently, but they are very heavily monitored, and our only running on roads that are 100% in perfect condition with newly painted lines and no construction. We all know that's not how the modern road system is, it's not perfect, and the trucks are too heavy for me to be comfortable having a couple of cameras and line detectors managing the truck. You could argue it would be like modern railroads, with a person on board just in case emergency, but trucks are not on rails and away from general traffic. I'm in a truck with active radar, and every safety system you can think of. I've had this truck slammed the brakes on by itself then he saw something that wasn't there. It's occurred about six times over the last 4 years, which is rare sure, but it absolutely cannot be happening. With any kind of rain or snow cover on the road I don't think anybody would want to be around an autonomous truck where the lane monitoring can't work. This is not to say that humans are great drivers, some are as bad if not worse than robots . It's not me fearing robot taking my job, it's about feeling comfortable with traffic around me. I'm sure automation will come to trucking as well, it's almost inevitable.

Local shit is fine for these i guess, on a dedicated route, yard with chargers, etc.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Gifs that end too soon...", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "As an over the road (OTR) Owner Op (O/O) I can tell you I want one of these. Many of you may not understand, the laws that regulate us. Do first I expect Elon had a permit to be over weight, the max he can weigh is 80,000 gross and the weight has to be distributed according to varying state laws the most strict requires the hitch point (kingpin) to be no more than 41 feet from the center between to two trailer axels. With no more than 34,000 pounds on each the trailer and the drives. The steers can‚Äôt be over 12,000 pounds, there are always exceptions but I‚Äôll keep it simple. So this test if it was 81,000 was a weight violation. \n\nWe are also governed on how many hours a day we can drive, 70 hours in an 8 day week, no more than 11 hours a day. If we max our weekly befor the 8th day is over we have to stop, and do a reset, 34 hours off or wait for the end of our 8th day to get the hours we used on the 1st day of the cycle back. That‚Äôs called running on recaps. It‚Äôs the most balanced work/life cycle unless you have the ability to be home on weekends then you run 11 daily. For the 5/6 days. My point in explaining all this is, 500 miles is about 8.5 hours, at 70 mph. So the range is perfect for recaps. You can also gain 70% of the charge back on a quick 30 minute break which is required by law to be taken before the 8th hour once the break is logged, you get up to 3 hours additional time to drive not to excede 8 straight. So ideally the break is after the third hour but must be before the end of hour 8.\n\nSo again, the 500 mile range should not be a factor. What should matter more the lack of infrastructure, every state funded rest stop needs to have plenty of charging and all the truck stops need to have EV parking to allow overnight charging to allow for charging and use of shore power, these trucks are like small motor homes and heat/air conditioning plus cooking, TV‚Äôs and gaming/computers for business use, all run when parked, currently to cook I need to idle my truck because my power system can‚Äôt fire up a grill or microwave. Other things that should be of concern is how much of a drain the heat and air conditioning use, when driving through the northeast or Death Valley, that could limit your range greatly trying to account for the required AC to go from cali to Vegas. \n\nI hope this helps some of you understand why EV scare some. I see the cost reduction of no more $400 oil changes every 3 months, no more $800-$1000 fuel bills, considering I get better than most of 8-9 mpg 1600-1800 miles per tank running it to E, I try to fill where it‚Äôs cheaper, and not below 1/8th of a tank (25 gallons). The other problem with EV is that the power to charge them has to come from somewhere, the increase demand on the power grid would be costly in California, Texas already proved they can‚Äôt take an increase, with the freezing temps they got last year.

I transcribed J's stutters in his reply but not the stutters in my question, so that way it seems like I was super smooth and not nervous at all. I ask my question around 39:35 where the volume spikes. The guy after me asked about crypto so you might want to listen to that too.\n\nJ shook my hand when I first arrived because I arrived late and almost bumped into him entering the boardroom; my palms were sweating like crazy, but I think he could tell how scared I was so he was pretty nice with me in his demeanor.\n\nAs for my question: If you listen to the whole recording, at one point he had been talking about Milton Friedman earlier and also was emphasizing that the treasury is nonpartisan, so I tried to play off of that sentiment, based on the quote suggested in [one of the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ylinlf/comment/iuz5apd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on my original post.\n\n**Here is a brief transcript of my discussion with him:**\n\n>*Me:* Following up on the discussion with your relationship, your nonpartisan relationship with Congress, I wanted to quote Dr Milton Friedman, he said that ‚ÄúInflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output.‚Äù I was wondering your opinion:  \n>  \n>**Is the Federal Reserve better equipped to reduce inflation than the other powers in Washington, I guess they expect you to, but is it possible to do this without having for example a balanced budget, or what is the interplay there?**\n\n**And then he replied:**\n\n>*J*: **So we, it is our job to, to look at price stability. It's not to say that fiscal policy doesn't matter, but you know it's, it's in first and foremost, it's our job.**  \n>  \n>By the way, when Milton Friedman wrote that-- wrote that and when I was in college, I graduated from college in 1975, you know, it was the heyday of monetarism, so people were looking at monetary aggregates, and thinking that the quantity of money, you know there's it's, money it's, it's the amount of money and the amount of goods, and inflation is too much money chasing too much goods.  \n>  \n>So that kind of stopped working about 40 years ago, it stopped work-- and it never really worked great **\\[I nervously chuckle\\]**, but it worked okay, and to-- to the point where were a lot of monetarists, and, and um including here at the Fed, and it was, you know, we were looking at monetary aggregates.  \n>  \n>Paul Volcker thinks that targeting the monetary aggregates, during that period when he was, you know, choking inflation to death... um but for, for whatever reason, the relationship between monetary growth and economic activity just got, just got completely, it was like this, there was no, signific-- you know, significant relationship for a while.  \n>  \n>Now that's not to say that that can't change, that the struc--  structure of the economy is ever evolving, and there-- there may be a place for money creation, when people look back at this inflation, they may look back, **money creation is very very high, with fiscal policy really, um during the um, we-- we don't actually affect monetary sup-- money supply when we, we create reserves and we buy assets, so we're not actually changing the supply of money, just the reserves of money.**  \n>  \n>So, but, uh, anyways, so that's the story with-- with Milton Friedman, who of course was a fun guy to read, and still is.\n\n(I went through several rounds of edits to the formatting of the text so it wasn't just one blob of text.)", "id": "z65h5e", "created_utc": 1669566516.0, "score": 384, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|36|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z65h5e)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z65h5e)\n\n^^WSB ^^[Stats](https://www.twitch.tv/wsbzjz/) ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: I asked Jerome Powell about inflation and the Federal Reserve's role in reducing it.
