{"title": "Indicators that stocks have bottomed", "selftext": "$SPX might have hit the bottom, currently down 17% from its ATH in early January, after lowest close of the year in early October (down as much as 25%). \n\nTL;DR\n\n**Bottom indicators**: \n\n* Inflation looks to have peaked (look at CPI)\n* Short-term interest rates also may have peaked (look at two-year Treasury yield)\n* 10-year yield peaked (recently dropped to around 3.7%)\n\n**Risk for more volatility** as earnings have not hit bottom. But the stock market historically hits the bottom 3-6 months before earnings estimates bottom. Falling profit projections likely include falling 10-year yield would support‚Äîor even boost‚Äîearnings multiples.¬†\n\nSource: [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stocks-bottomed-sp-500-51669155476)\n\n>For starters, the S&P 500 is down 17% from its all-time high of 4796 hit in early January. It was down as much as 25% to its lowest close of the year of 3577, hit in early October. One key driver was that the Federal Reserve has been ratcheting interest rates higher in order to combat high inflation by reducing economic demand. That‚Äôs even after the inflation had already begun denting consumer demand. Plus, faster-growing technology companies have seen their valuations, or their stocks‚Äô multiples of expected earnings, take a hit partly because higher rates make future profits less valuable. Those companies are expecting a bulk of their profits to come many years in the future.  \n>  \n>The thesis that the market has already bottomed hinges on the idea that inflation looks to have already peaked. The Consumer Price Index for October gained 7.7% year over year, down from 9.1% in June. Some of that is because higher prices, themselves, have caused consumers to turn away from shopping; retail companies have too much inventory and have had to mark prices down because demand isn‚Äôt strong enough for the supply. Plus, interest rates have already risen, though higher rates have more work to do in reducing inflation to the Fed‚Äôs 2% target.  \n>  \n>That inflation has peaked could mean short-term interest rates have also peaked. The federal-funds futures market is reflecting that the pace of rate hikes will slow down, before the Fed ultimately cuts rates in 2023. The two-year Treasury yield, a barometer for expectations about the fed-funds rate, is around 4.5%, below its multiyear peak of just over 4.7%. The assumption is that inflation and demand will be somewhat curbed by that point, so there‚Äôs a visible end to the Fed‚Äôs demand destruction. That would ultimately provide relief for the stock market.¬†  \n>  \n>To that point, ‚Äúif the economy manages to avoid recession or experiences only a modest contraction, a new bull market may already be unfolding,‚Äù wrote Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group.¬†  \n>  \n>A peak in short-term rates could also mean the 10-year yield, a key component to stock-market forecasts, has also peaked. Higher short-term rates have played a role in pushing the 10-year yield higher this year, but recently, the 10-year yield has dropped to around 3.7% from a multiyear peak of just over 4.2%. That‚Äôs partially because higher short-term rates should ultimately reduce demand and long-term inflation, lowering the yield on the long-dated bond. That‚Äôs key for stocks because a lower yield on 10-year government debt increases the value of future profits, boosting equity valuations.  \n>  \n>All of these indicators, though, do point to weakening economic demand. Earnings forecasts might have to decline in the next few quarters. Wall Street hasn‚Äôt cut earnings estimates for 2023 as much as they have historically by the end of a calendar year. And this isn‚Äôt a normal year; earnings pressure could be worse, given the risk of a recession.¬†  \n>  \n>But the stock market would likely resume rising before actual earnings results hit bottom. The stock market historically tends to hit bottom three to six months before earnings estimates bottom, according to RBC data. To be sure, if profit forecast drop enough, stocks would find a new bottom. But if earnings expectations drop even by 11% from here, and the S&P 500 doesn‚Äôt fall as much, the index would remain above its low for the year.¬†  \n>  \n>Plus, an environment with profit projections falling likely includes falling bond yields. If company earnings‚Äîand stocks‚Äîare declining, then investors could rush into safe 10-year government bonds, the interest payments of which are guaranteed. That would bring the 10-year bond‚Äôs price up, and yield down. The yield is attractive anyway, as it‚Äôs well above average annual inflation expectations for the next decade of 2.31%. In this scenario, a falling 10-year yield would support‚Äîor even boost‚Äîearnings multiples even while earnings projections are dropping.¬†  \n>  \n>If it sounds like stock market volatility is in store overall, that‚Äôs because it is. The S&P 500 could even revisit its low for the year.¬†", "id": "z2uui4", "created_utc": 1669224002.0, "score": 139, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 264, "comments": [{"body": "Every post like this add 4 weeks to the recession", "score": 973, "replies": [{"body": "Honestly why does every fucking person think inflation has peaked?

{"title": "Fed officials see smaller rate hikes coming ‚Äòsoon,‚Äô minutes show", "selftext": "Federal Reserve officials earlier this month agreed that smaller interest rate increases should happen soon as they evaluate the impact policy is having on the economy, meeting minutes released Wednesday indicated.\n\nReflecting statements that multiple officials have made over the past several weeks, the meeting summary pointed to small rate hikes are coming. Markets widely expect the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to step down to a 0.5 percentage point increase in December, following four straight 0.75 percentage point hikes.\n\nThough hinting that smaller moves were ahead, officials said they still see little signs of inflation abating. However, some committee members expressed concern about risks to the financial system should the Fed continue to press forward at the same aggressive pace.\n\n‚ÄúA substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,‚Äù the minutes stated. ‚ÄúThe uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assessment was important.‚Äú\n\nThe minutes noted that the smaller hikes would give policymakers a chance to evaluate the impact of the succession of rate hikes.\n\nThe summary noted that a few members indicated that ‚Äúslowing the pace of increase could reduce the risk of instability in the financial system.‚Äù Others said they‚Äôd like to wait to ease up on the pace. Officials said they see the balance of risks on the economy now skewed to the downside.\n\nMarkets had been looking for clues about not only what the next rate hike might look like but also for how far policymakers think they‚Äôll have to go next year to make satisfactory progress against inflation.\n\nOfficials at the meeting said it was just as important for the public to focus more on how far the Fed will go with rates ‚Äúand the evolution of the policy stance thereafter, had become more important considerations for achieving the Committee‚Äôs goals than the pace of further increases in the target range.‚Äú\n\nIn recent days, officials have spoken largely in unison about the need to keep up the inflation fight, while also indicating they can pull back on the level of rate hikes. That means a strong likelihood of a 0.5 percentage point increase in December, but still an uncertain course after that.\n\nMarkets expect a few more rate hikes in 2023, taking the funds rate to around 5%, and then possibly some reductions before year end.\n\nThe post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee added a sentence that markets interpreted as a signal that the Fed will be doing smaller increases ahead. That sentence read, ‚ÄúIn determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.‚Äú\n\nInvestors saw it as a nod to a reduced intensity of hikes following four straight 0.75 percentage point increases that took the Fed‚Äôs benchmark borrowing overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75-4%, the highest in 14 years.\n\nSeveral Fed officials have said in recent days that they anticipate a likely half-point move in December.\n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôre getting to a point where they don‚Äôt have to move so quickly. That‚Äôs helpful since they don‚Äôt know exactly how much tightening they‚Äôre going to have to do,‚Äù said Bill English, a former Fed official now with the Yale School of Management. ‚ÄúThey emphasize policy works with lags, so it‚Äôs helpful to be able to go a little bit more slowly.‚Äú\n\nInflation data lately has been showing some encouraging signs while remaining well above the central bank‚Äôs 2% official target.\n\nThe consumer price index in October was up 7.7% from a year ago, the lowest reading since January. However, a measure the Fed follows more closely, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, showed a 5.1% annual rise in September, up 0.2 percentage points from August and the highest reading since March.\n\nThose reports came out after the November Fed meeting. Several officials said they viewed the reports positively but will need to see more before they consider easing up on policy tightening.\n\nThe Fed has been the target lately of some criticism that it could be tightening too much. The worry is that policymakers are too focused on backward-looking data and missing signs that inflation is ebbing and growth is slowing.\n\nHowever, English expects the Fed officials to keep their collective foot on the break until there are clearer signals that prices are falling. He added that the Fed is willing to risk a slowing economy as it pursues its goal.\n\n‚ÄúThey have risks in both directions if doing too little and doing too much. They‚Äôve been fairly clear that they view the risks of inflation getting out of the box and the need to do a really big tightening as the biggest risk,‚Äù he said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a hard time to be Jay Powell.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/23/fed-minutes-november-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/23/fed-minutes-november-2022.html)", "id": "z2xhh7", "created_utc": 1669230191.0, "score": 1106, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 231, "comments": [{"body": ".75 to .5 is like my wife dumping one of her three boyfriends.", "score": 196, "replies": [{"body": "Poetry", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's more like she already had 3 boyfriends and is now only adding another half boyfriend.\n\nPeople seem to be misinterpreting 'slowing down' as 'reducing rates'.

The minutes mention the risk of recession is almost equal to the base case. They are probably one or two meeting away from having to declare recession as the base case. The soft landing definition has been tweaked from no recession to now mild recession or \"softish landing\".\n\nI don't think the Fed's in control of inflation yet. We've seen good inflation report this year being negated by another component that starts picking up in future reports. In July it was energy/supply chain being negated by housing. Housing inflation is not gonna go away probably until second half of next year. By then, wage inflation is gonna start seeping into the CPI, which every Fed members is extremely concerned about at the moment. You can say the easy part of the fight has been won (supply chain, energy price). The hard part (wage inflation) has barely started, and that's the most painful part.\n\nIn the beginning, I'd say the market wasn't sure if the Fed was simply front loading hikes, or if the Fed thought they were so far away from the neutral rates that they had to go 0.75% every time. You go 0.75% every meeting and pretty soon you're gonna hit 6%+. Therefore, it was pretty hard to gauge the terminal rates since it kept getting revised up. Market also wasn't sure how much Powell would lean towards fighting inflation at the expense of the labor market. As we can see now, Powell's not actually that resolute about fighting inflation. He's basically \"cheating\" by extending the time horizon (The 2% time horizon used to be 2024. Now it's 2025. This risk inflation expectation becoming unanchored). We can also see the Fed isn't sure what the neutral rate would be. I believe in one of the FOMC minutes, it mentioned 3.5%, so 4% rate is the minimum to even be neutral. This neutral rate can change. So if 5% is the terminal rate and 4% if the minimum neutral rate, we can see that the Fed's plan is simply to get into a somewhat restrictive rate region, and just sit there and wait. So clearly, they are very concerned about overtightening. This plan would only work if inflation expectation stays anchored, which is why they're pretending to talk tough about being resolute. Their plan would quickly fall apart as soon as inflation expectation starts showing any glimpses of being unanchored. So I'd argue the UMich inflation expectation and 5 year breakeven are almost as important as CPI/job report. Also, I think they're very concerned about a liquidity crisis like BOE, forcing them to do QE again, which would undermine their efforts. I think that's the big reason behind why they decided to go down to 0.5% in the next meeting. CPI was clearly the last signal they needed for going down to 0.5%, but that's assuming the next CPI will also be good, and we've been fooled before.\n\nWith all that said, it's too early to know if the plan's working or not. Inflation also went down during 1973 recession. Volcker also caved too early when inflation started going down in 1980 recession. Both times inflation went back. I'm going to say Powell's showing early signs of being more like Arthur Burns than late Volcker. If we assume 2% is inflation target and 4% is unemployment target, and underlying inflation around 4-5% (using NY Fed data) and 5% unemployment by the time they're done, we can see the Fed's failing on their inflation target by almost 100%, and their employment target by only 20%.

Risks to the economy are skewed to the downside and risks to inflation are skewed to the upside.\n\n* The odds of something else breaking (like UK pensions) continues to rise and is beginning to be a concern. \n\n* While rates will likely begin slowing down to 50bps in December, it is not guaranteed. In addition, the terminal rate needed to properly address inflation will likely need move higher.\n\n* US economic activity projections have been moved lower from September's estimates. US output will likely move below potential in 2024 and 2025. The unemployment rate will likely be above its natural rate in 2024 and 2025.\n\n**All in all, the odds of a recession continue to rise (by some metrics it is pretty much guaranteed) and the slowing rate hikes are offset by the need for more rate hikes. Economic projections for 2024/2025 have been lowered and fears of something else breaking is now a notable concern.** \n\nThat sound positive to you?", "id": "z2zmp4", "created_utc": 1669235360.0, "score": 243, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 244, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|11|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll3wl2/miners_and_the_global_commodity_supercycle_ft/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yy6z01/from_inflation_to_recession_why_i_am_all_in_on/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xormrq/500m_ape_issuance_is_extremely_bullish_for_amc/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z29okn/from_inflation_to_recession_part_2_puts_on/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ws18zp/bed_bath_beyond_unfortunately_the_likely_outcome/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wuz3kc/amc_and_ape_is_actually_free_money_right_now/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z2zmp4)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z2zmp4)\n\n**Check out the new [wallstreetbets discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)**", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "All markets heard was rates pace will slow down, and the risk of breaking something could make them pause.

The market is only a part of the economy so it might not react immediately to the change in economic conditions, but with many of the major firms starting and planning layoffs in the not too distant future, a long roadway to abate inflation, and more QT, I think there's still plenty of slowdown ahead.

The raising of rates is going to take a toll on these people/companies that have been so used to easy access to money and hopefully purge them out of the system.
