Facebook is making this pivot in some sizable part because of a clear understanding that a pivot away from the current core business is an eventual necessity. Nothing is keeping Apple or anyone else from competing and coming up with their own VR metaverse if they think that it's worthwhile for them to do so and they don't have to have the same urgency that Meta/FB does. Or maybe the fact that Apple doesn't seem to be that interested says something - as many tech companies melt down, Apple still holding up well seemingly in part because rather than get into every big tech theme of the last decade, they've focused on the one core business that has effectively become a tech staple and did it really well.\n\nAnd really I'm certainly not against growth, nor \"the future\", but the last year has been a lesson/reminder of not to go too overboard/become too enamored with hype over it.  And as much as I've liked a lot of growth themes, there's others that I've never liked (Uber/ride sharing) and others that I see as certainly put to use but in more niche instances. VR is the latter - I don't disagree with you that it will be used, but I don't see a future where it's as ubiquitous as some seem to think. Everyone spending most of their day glued to their phone isn't heathy, I don't know that everyone behind VR goggles is much of an improvement. AR at least could have a lot of strong technical use cases in the workplace, but do I think everyone's going to be walking around with AR glasses? Will society have a different reaction to another variation of Google Glass than it did the last time around? I very well might be wrong but I don't see it.\n\nTLDR: long and rambling response.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely interface.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "To be fair, tons of people have this sentiment towards new technology.

Price controls: whether through forced price caps or through things like sales taxes and on specific items, which artificially set the price.

Too hard to prove?", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "We tried wage and price controls in the 1970's (with inflation over 10%) and it was largely believed to be ineffective and a massive overreach and intrusion of the federal government into the affairs of private individuals and companies.  They also tried to lower the domestic cost of energy with the National Energy Program in the 1980's - which, among other things created \"blended\" (lower) domestic oil price and subsidized imports of foreign oil.   This was incredibly unpopular in Alberta and Newfoundland (Hibernia).\n\nThe truth is that the federal government and central bank has fairly weak levers for controlling inflation.  The core drivers of inflation, energy, food and housing are what economists call \"inelastic\" - that is demand doesn't change much with respect to changes in price.   This makes sense - if food, fuel and housing are more expensive, people still need to live, so they cut back or delay spending on more discretionary things - clothing, entertainment, travel, etc.\n\nThe current inflationary cycle is caused by several factors that are quite outside of the control of governments:\n\n* High (global) energy costs - which affects both the inputs to many industries and transportation costs - this is being driven by the war in Ukraine and resulting sanctions, and OPEC constraining supply to help out Russia.\n* Increase in food production costs - 2021 saw major droughts and decreased crop yields. 2022 has been a bumper crop year, but the war in Russia has taken most of the Russian and Ukrainian grain out of the world market, driving up prices.  Energy costs also impact prices of fertilizer and transportation.   Higher feed costs impact meat production and there has also been several waves of avian influenza in the poultry industry.\n* Supply chain disruption - for the last 2 years, shipping, container availability, rail, port capacity, etc. have not been able to keep up with demand.  Bottlenecks and backlogs have developed at key choke points such as  the Suez canal, ports, container availability, warehousing, rail, and intermodal transfer facilities.  Look on the shelves of many stores and notice empty spaces where some products are not available or the variety of choices are severely restricted.    Some retailers have orders backlogged for weeks or months.\n* Permanent loss of many people from the workforce - due to Boomers retiring or dying from Covid, a backlog of immigration, and many people deciding they are not returning to jobs that pay poorly.   This has driven up labour costs - another huge input to most industries.\n\nThe only levers the government has to combat inflation are interest rates and it's own borrowing and spending.   Federal borrowing is already down - I think the government is working on its first surplus in over a decade.   I don't think the Liberal / NDP coalition has much of an appetite to take on public sector unions and cutting infrastructure spending short sighted.  So we are left with monetary policy.\n\nHigher interest rates obviously make borrowing more expensive.  Most people think of interest rates in relation to mortgage costs.  But there are other forms of borrowing that are more immediately impacted by interest rates - namely consumer credit and inventory spending. People who carry monthly balances on the credit cards are going to be hit first and hard.  If you have a $1000 balance on your credit card, now you are paying almost $200 per ~~month~~ year in interest.   That could buy a lot of food, rent and gas.\n\nMany companies - retailers, distributors and manufacturers also borrow to finance their inventory - hoping to turn it over within 30 - 60 days.   But with the global supply chain disruption, there is a backlog of orders that are delayed in transit.   This will result in inventories building over time.   When consumers feel the squeeze on core transportation fuel, housing and food (and credit card interest) - it should result in less spending on other things.  So inventories will build and the cost of carrying and holding inventory at high interest rate will escalate. At some point, companies will have to start discounting and selling off old inventory.

Our country has ~14 trillion USD in circulation. Then theres the Eurodollar which is USD held by other nations for trade, which is at about ~16 trillion USD. Other nations use our money because we are the world reserve currency. All those other countries hold that money in their respective central banks. While its being held there it is NOT in circulation,  so it doesn't have an effect on inflation. They also hold large amounts of their own currency there, again, not in circulation. \n\nOkay so lets say the fed raises rates on bonds, now suddenly the USD becomes a much better store-of-value currency than their native currencies. So people start trading out their currency for US Bonds (effectively USD). So now all these other nations currencies are flooding the market, increasing their inflation, while the USD is being gobbled up and taken out of circulation,  reducing our inflation. \n\nNow those other central banks face a crisis, an attack on their currency. If left uncontrolled,  it can cause runaway inflation, and collapse nations. But have no fear, because this is the reason they hold so much USD in their central banks. \n\nQuick recap of where we are so far. Other nations are trading their currency for ours. This floods the market with their money, increasing inflation and reducing the value of their currency due to increased supply. At the same time USD is being taken out of circulation to be used as a store-of-value. This reduces our inflation and increases the value of USD to reduction in supply.\n\nSo to combat this the foreign central banks will start buying up their currency using USD which is now more valuable.  This will reduce the supply of foreign currency in circulation,  reducing their inflation and increasing their value, while simultaneously increasing USD supply which raises inflation for us, lowering the value of USD.\n\nSo to combat THAT the fed will raise rates again.

With low interest rates, and record government spending a huge amount of money was put into the system, but there was no corresponding increase in production.

Mortgages are cheaper so more houses get built and construction companies employ more people. Same with car loans and the auto industry. This happens throughout the economy and leads to low unemployment. The problem is that an economy has a productive capacity and when everyone is flush with cash and trying to buy the same stuff, the economy may not be able to keep up with demand due to its capacity to produce. This is when prices start to rise because when demand is up and supply can't keep up, prices go up. The Fed raises rates to reduce the money supply and prevent this from happening.
