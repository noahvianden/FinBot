The stock is also near Covid lows.\n\nApple is the company I‚Äôm most on the fence about. $130 is a good price but I feel like $110 is a possibility. Also zooming out, their chart looks scary. If Apple starts dropping, they have a long way to fall. Butttt they have a fortress balance sheet over $100b strong so unlikely. And people will spend their last dollar on an Apple product. They have crazy China risk but they are the best suited for a China shit show. The elusive $200 per share is a possibility but idk when and am less bullish unless they announce new initiatives like buy now pay later, auto, vr/ar.\n\nUber and Lyft are wildcards. Uber is the better long term play especially after they finally seem to be taking profitability seriously. Lyft has the better numbers currently. Both are decent long term buys and covered call opportunities. Stock could hit $30-50 within the next 3 years.\n\nWeWork is pretty safe at $4-5. The stock seems to like $6-7 range though. This actually has a ton of short term swing opportunities if you are brave enough to trust your instincts/graph/analysis. They have real assets, consistent revenue, and predictable financials. As they expand their all access pass and become the defacto go to leasing party for large corporations and multinational, that‚Äôs where the real money is. Stock could get to $20-30 within the next 3-7 years.\n\nSco is the etf that shorts crude. If your like me and get anxious trading futures, especially volatile stuff like oil, this is a safer bet. Basically if you buy, you think oil prices will drop, shorting means you think oil will rise. It kinda tracks gush but not really, I learned this the hard way. Basically my thesis is, oil will drop at some point UNLESS there is further escalation with Russia/China, or the obvious unforeseen circumstances. Oil prices are usually cyclical also so summer they are high but cool down afterwards. Sco is trading around $20. It was at $18 early Monday before the fed meeting. You absolutely can swing this stock. You can also implement a long short strategy where you short the stock but buy long dated call options. So when oil rises and this stock drops, you close your short, and take profits, while leaving your long call in place. If you like taking risks, you can do a poor man‚Äôs covered call and sell monthly calls against your long options calls while shorting the stock. I think sco will hit $30 sometime by March, if not sooner but will be choppy until then.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a lot for the well written comment!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": -9, "replies": [{"body": "I‚Äôm not arguing your points but typically, confidence in a stock pitch really helps when you have an above 4th grade grammar", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "love that you ignore all of the facts related to $ and go straight for a low brow hit on typing on mobile", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Adults don‚Äôt turn off capitalization on mobile phones", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "again, cant fight the content so attack the medium.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "you are actively steering OP away from gains.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "L3Harris has a very consistent drop and rise pattern over the past few years and have progressively done great in the long term", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Boeing-BA\n\n1 buy 5-10K worth everything it drops to 120 and sell it when it gets north of 175-180.

{"title": "Used Truck Prices Plummeting--Inflation Will Fall Quickly, not Slowly", "selftext": "One by one, the insane price increases we saw in 2021 and into 2022 are reversing or at least cooling down. It makes me think that through supply chains  entering into overdrive and a looming recession, inflation will cool down quickly not slowly. Before I get to trucks, let me give a quick update on other trends. First, [inventories are piling up in retail](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/35192-us-retailers-plan-big-discounts-as-inflation-inventory-add-up), with for example \"a 32% jump in inventories during the first quarter\" in Walmart.\n\nSecond, measures of supply chain pressure [have clearly peaked (graph)](https://i.imgur.com/2oFu2Ae.png), the figure taken from [SupplyChainBrain](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/35156-us-supply-snarls-ease-as-truck-capacity-rebounds):\n\n> A gauge of supply chain pressure in the U.S. economy fell to the lowest level since December 2020, as activity such as trucking cools from elevated levels with few signs yet of a worrying collapse.\n> \n> The Logistics Managers Index dropped to 67.1 in May, the second straight decline from a record of 76.2 reached in March. Faster gains in warehouse and inventory costs offset slower moves in transport prices. \n\nThird, [diesel future dropped at the end of last week](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/big-diesel-futures-drop-to-end-the-week), partly on news of Russia's oil production recovering slightly.\n> \n> The most significant bearish news in the market came out of Russia, where news reports said Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told reporters that by finding alternate buyers to the Western countries and companies that have shunned Russian oil, the country‚Äôs output was close to the 10.2 million barrels per day level from February, prior to the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFourth, US ports seem to be peaking earlier than usual, indicating a slowdown may come earlier than later. [Article](https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/35187-top-us-port-enlists-white-house-help-to-clear-rail-cargo-logjam).\n\nFifth, the Drewry composite World Container Index is decreasing slowly: [Graph](https://i.imgur.com/WUf1Qod.png), sourced from [the company website](https://www.drewry.co.uk/supply-chain-advisors/supply-chain-expertise/world-container-index-assessed-by-drewry). From the same website, here is the cost of shipping from Shanghai: [Graph](https://i.imgur.com/2WCTxY3.png).\n\nNow to the main article on used truck prices. While reading this, recall that used car prices were one of the main contributors to inflation back in Spring 2021. Article [(Freight Waves)](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/used-truck-auction-prices-falling-fast):\n\n> Auction prices of used trucks are falling almost as quickly as they rose over the last year. That is leaving owner-operators stuck with overpriced equipment they thought they could pay for in a hot spot freight market that is cooling off. \n> \n> ‚ÄúThe market is primarily absorbing trucks from fleets no longer retaining all of their older iron as new trucks trickle in and, to an extent, from owner-operators leaving the industry or going to work for a fleet,‚Äù said Chris Visser, senior analyst and commercial vehicles product manager for J.D. Power Valuation Services.\n> \n> In its latest Guidelines report, **Power said auction prices in May for model year 2020 used trucks fell 11% from April. Prices for model year 2019 trucks fell 15.9% month over month and 2018 models dropped 9.9%.** \n> \n> ‚ÄúIn May, 3- to 5-year-old trucks averaged 12.0% less money than April, but 57.5% more money than May 2021,‚Äù Visser said. ‚ÄúYear over year, late-model trucks sold in the first five months of 2022 averaged 82.6% more money than the same period of 2021.‚Äù\n\n> **Getting stuck by high used truck auction prices**\n> \n> When spot rates were paying $4 a mile and more, no price was too high for a fleet to add capacity. The idea was to take advantage of record-high rates and not worry about the equipment price premium. Now owner-operators who overpaid for equipment stand to get burned.\n> \n> ‚ÄúTrucking economy data shows rising terminations of owner-operator authorities and a steady and notable decline in spot rates from February through May,‚Äù Visser said. ‚ÄúTaken alone, those two items could suggest the new owner-operators who entered the industry in 2020-2021 are now exiting the industry.‚Äù\n> \n> Overall truck transportation employment increased through the spring. May was the highest month in recorded history for the sector. That suggests new owner-operators could be going to work for fleets.\n\n>**Retail prices still elevated**\n> \n> Retail prices in dealerships are still near record highs. Pricing moves tend to trail auction auctions. As rates fall, so will truck demand and prices, according to Steve Tam, vice president of ACT Research.\n> \n> ‚ÄúUnfortunately, long-awaited reports of loosening inventories come at exactly the wrong time in the cycle,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is the beginning of the end of the cycle, which promises to be every bit as exciting on the way down as it was on the way up.‚Äù\n> \n> Just as auction and retail prices vary, the freight market consists of contracted and spot-rate pricing.\n> \n> ‚ÄúIf your customers are mainly small fleets and owner-operators who operate in the spot market, you‚Äôre hearing the sky is falling,‚Äù Visser said. ‚ÄúIf your customers are mainly larger fleets who operate in the contract market, you‚Äôre hearing conditions are still strong\n> \n>\n\n**Implication for Equities**\n\nIf supply chain improvements alone improve inflation, the Fed can ease on their tightening and stocks will do relatively well. If demand reduction is what is driving improvements, this implies a recession and a possible worse bear market (or not, who knows). Both together? This may suggest that there will be a stock market in 2023. There may even be a market. Higher bond yields on US government bonds (caused by the Fed) mean that you can earn a higher premium for taking no risk at all. This means if you want to hold a riskier asset like a stock, you would demand an even higher premium. This causes stock prices to fall until the premium of buying it at that price is sufficiently high relative to bond yields.\n\nEDITS:\n\n1. The article is about freight trucking, not your regular consumer pick-up trucks.\n2. It is impossible to draw obvious conclusions about the stock market from this. My low confidence response is that this is bullish for equities (if it slows down Fed hikes), maybe not the economy.\n3. This is not an original thesis.\n4. I am aware that inflation is more than just used truck prices. The intent of this post was to get a snapshot of some of the key industries in the US supply chain.

That supply issue is making their situation dire.\n\nArgentina has an awful lot of problems, but understand that at 52%, whatever debts they have to pay on, they have to pay significantly more to service now.

It is also the biggest problem in Argentina.

They are \"printing money\" hand over fist with a shrinking workforce and (by the monetarist opinion) writing checks their asses can't cash and yet, they are still not experiencing inflation.  If the increase in money were the root cause of inflation, the number of Japanese workers wouldn't be relevant at all.  In fact the declining number of them would serve to make the problem worse, not better.  At best, it's a wash.  Yes, there is lower demand, but there is lower production as well.  \n\nBut if every new Yen saps value from the existing pool of Yen, then, by all accounts, Japan should be experiencing wild inflation, especially in this environment, and they aren't.

{"title": "So what is it that's not priced into the market? How bad is it?", "selftext": "* **ARKK** is below its 2020 covid low\n* **Ford** is closing in on a P/E in the 3's\n* **Intel**, which should be one of the most important companies in the Western Hemisphere if China puts a naval blockade on Taiwan before the *People's Congress* has a P/E of 6\n* **Target** has fallen 50%\n* **Netflix** is well below its covid March low trading where it was in 2017\n* **Goldman Sachs** (one of the 30 Dow components) is trading well below book value\n* **Wells Fargo** is trading below book value\n* **XLE** the major energy ETF has fallen sharply recently and trading where it was back in 2018 which is baffling\n\nAnd the list goes on. When you adjust all this stuff for inflation, and we assume an investor is well-diversified, what the hell is the point of putting money into the stock market? Based on my research, it's not to make money anymore, it's simply to break even from the USD's decline. This isn't Buffet's America. The only real way to make money, is by leveraging large amounts of low interest money, which is the privilege of those with money, or collateral and excellent credit. And if your leverage goes bust, walk away from it with certain legal protections, be patient, and repeat. Even commodities don't work as investment vehicles because there's a prime/sub-prime pricing issue taking place on either side of sanctions. Why not just buy gold or real estate? Everything is a scam because nothing is free market.\n\n[Gold](https://preview.redd.it/nyqgi4qz8i691.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=220142958222dd0ae318ca9a9fa91b082b68a561)\n\nThe only free market asset I know of is digital gold, and that's getting absolutely rocked in price too, even though most people don't realize it's a network that hasn't scaled money to the velocity that the internet scaled information, and is still a year maybe two away. It'll be interesting to see its deflation and free-market hell play out there when it does become the internet of money.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vz6j2i87fi691.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf31c52c00368d53554afffd988e24ff21249dd7\n\nBut in the meantime, there's real anger in the market. Authentic enmity. I remember this a bit in 2008, but going into that low in March 2009 (S&P 666), gas was cheap, interest rates were moving rapidly downwards, inflation was negligible, there were no wars, and Harvey Weinstein still ran Hollywood. It was Wall Street and bank bailouts that really irked free market advocates, not Rose McGowan's travails.\n\nSo my contrarian-ness in these markets has been wrong on the inside, but right on the outside, like Salma Hayek's bust post-50. At $280 QQQ for example, I believed everything lined up for a wicked bear rally. Line in the sand that number. We sliced through it like butter. Luckily I played the option *straddle* there to positive effect.\n\nMy next big play is shorting the VXX. Ostensibly it's a bullish or neutral play on equities, but not necessarily. My theory there goes that besides VXX being a sham volatility indicator, the selling **velocity** of equities should directionally decline. We can keep going down, but the velocity of the selloff will slow towards a bottom. If it doesn't, then most companies outside the Dow 30 will be priced for bankruptcy with P/E's of 1-4 within the next 30 days. *Note: I'll buy calls way OTM as protection for if I'm wrong.*\n\nThe worry of course is that with all the bad news priced-in or known, such as expected interest rate hikes, energy problems, inflation at large, anticipated food shortage, etcetera, that the market saw through and past its eyes unimpeded into some ultimate secret place, dismissing it like conservatives do when I tell them Reagan started cancel culture with his evangelicals. But yeah, the market's behavior is at odds with the velocity of information we have today. So I hope for and assume we bounce, but I'm acutely aware there may be something this market sees that we don't. Something absolutely wicked.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qlhg38v3fi691.jpg?width=2366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=362f592f743a94975452e5a963ce0f6bdbc259eb", "id": "vfnsfp", "created_utc": 1655615204.0, "score": 386, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 444, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|31|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|195|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vfnsfp)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vfnsfp)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "We've have been living In a false valuation stock market for a while now with the low interest rates.

But to point 1, the government is going to step in on significant job loss going forward, if salaries continue to exist, I think sales slow but don‚Äôt crash, which will lead to a serious rebound. \n\nI mean, I‚Äôm saving up to buy an electric car. One the supply chain frees up, prices will drop. Same with wood for the back deck and steaks at dinner. We are seeing huge price increases not exactly related to ‚Äúmonetary deflation‚Äù. I think inflation is inflation. \n\n\nI‚Äôm bullish because the alternative at this point seems to basically be mass economic collapse, where we just watched the government step in to prevent mass economic collapse.\n\nI think the war in Ukraine and the supply chain issues are going to lead to big problems where papa socialist will step in, and when they do, the markets will react positively when all of the priced in job loss and stagflation disappear. And if they don‚Äôt, the markets will climb back out of bear market territory.\n\n\nThe reality is - the globe needs a win. We need russia to fuck off. We need China to stop being ridiculous and ease up and get eyes of Taiwan. We need iran to not get rekt by neighbors and we need some stability. That will lift sentiment a lot.\n\n\nI have a hard time thinking the USD is fucked when we float less fucked than anyone else.\n\n\nWe basically had a shortage of people 6-12 months ago. And a shortage of supply. We also have a shortage of land and property and an excess of free cash flow from remote work expense reduction.\n\nInflation isn‚Äôt entirely a result of the fed. We have inflation because the world is fundamentally adjusted and adjusting. I actually do think it‚Äôs transitionary. Also information speed is lightning right now - the bounce back is too much to miss out on if you‚Äôre under 50 years old. You can‚Äôt just stop buying and sit out and wait til markets recover to invest.\n\n\nLastly - I think market advice depends on your job and it‚Äôs ability to work through recessions.\n\nDo you work as an accountant in alcohol? Or do you work in recruiting for a tech company? As a CPA, it‚Äôs hard to imagine not buying. I think even in 2008 the salary for accountants just kinda turned into ‚Äúno raises this year‚Äù.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Just wait until the real crash comes", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "WWIII is being slowly added in.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "thanks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni am buying some ford stock tuesday!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If it wasn't before your post, it sure is priced in now.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Arkk is invested into a lot of things with speculative value.

The house of cards is coming down and unfortunately I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs over yet because credit markets have yet to really crack. They‚Äôve been pressured for sure but credit spreads are not at levels that signify a true problem‚Ä¶.yet. That will come when quantitative tightening starts (QT). QT is quite literally the process of destroying money and probably has a way larger effect than the fed raising interest rates because it drains liquidity from the system‚Ä¶..that same liquidity that created this asset bubble in the first place.

They're not losing money selling gasoline. I'm pretty sure the reason they can beat out other places is pretty simple:\n\n-Lower infrastructure cost due to large high volume locations (Compare the volume of a costco gas station to a regular grocery-store 4 pump one for example)\n\n-Large lots that already have high traffic, but typically lower land/lease costs - compared to your regular corner-store gas station\n\n-Some subsidization by membership, offset IMO by increased traffic to stores\n\nAlso, with the recent *spike* in gas prices, I would not be surprised if they net out a large gain simply due to the volume of inventory they have (purchased at lower prices). While it would be temporary, and likely noted as such in a financial report, it would make their next set of earnings really nice looking.\n\nGas is 9% of their net sales (2021). They're not doing this at a loss lol.\n\nEdit:\n\nWas curious, looked into it more:\n\nAccording to their annual report, they hedge energy & currency risks. While currency risks is common, WMT makes zero mention of any energy hedge (natural gas or gasoline.)\n\n>We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has\na lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. It also has lower SG&A expenses\nas a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales\nwill generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly\nimpact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which,\ngiven the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A\nexpenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. \n\n--\n>The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and\nother commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate\nthrough the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the\nU.S. and Canada.
