Putin isn‚Äôt dumb, evil yes, but I think he had some ulterior motive to be dragging this war out l. To what end, I‚Äôm not sure. \n\nAgain, I‚Äôm just asking questions. Both sides have propaganda to skew the current state of the war in their favor. The west is pro Ukraine and according to then smoking Russia. The Russia has their equivalent propaganda.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Winning a war is hard though. Russia‚Äôs military is large but underfunded especially compared to modern militaries like the US. Hell, the US struggled in Iraq the third time and ended up losing in Afghanistan. \n\nNow imagine taking a country that has a bigger economy that Iraq, with a military partially trained by NATO standards, with a lot of NATO equipment, with greater motivation to fight then in Iraq, that is a bigger country than Iraq, and bankrolled by America. Now the Russians are trying to invade this country with roughly the same size force America needed against Iraq the second time, with a less developed military doctrine and chain of command, and almost no airforce.\n\nAlso remember that while America has been effective at wiping out established militaries it has struggled and even lost against insurgencies and guerrilla warfare. Compare the results of the Vietnam War with the Gulf War, the Invasion of Afghanistan with the Invasion of Iraq. \n\nAt least these wara give America the ability to learn from its mistakes and gain experience against rather competent foes. Russia however, only has experience with forces ready to surrender or being bombed into submission already. Georgia, Syria, Ukraine in 2014, Chechnya. This may mean the Russians grew overconfident in their strategy. \n\nRussia wiped the floor with Ukraine in 2014. So since then theyve appealed to NATO to basically be a sort of proxy in exchange for weapons and training. NATO agreed. The new Ukrainian military is now NATO trained and equipped, with some more funding from the US on top. It is not the wet noodle that flopped over in Crimea.\n\nWith all this in mind, the question to me becomes, what was Putin thinking while deciding to invade?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Tbf, USA I think had much stricter rules of engagement whereas I imagine Russia doesn‚Äôt hold them to that same standard which may explain some of USAs difficulties", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "The lockdowns have caused the inflation.

{"title": "My 1-2 Year Prediction: Inflation is going to collapse dramatically, one way or the other. This is not bullish for stocks, however.", "selftext": "I made the mistake of drinking coffee at night, so I decided to make what I think is a contrarian prediction? I welcome discussion and criticism (be nice, though!)\n\n------\n\n**I.** The Fed is going to overreact. It's not going to observe inflation falling dramatically until it is too late. Economic data is always lagging, and the Fed going to stand by its brisk pace as political pressure from Congress and news media ramps up. The Fed has a credibility problem--a *political* credibility problem, not a credibility having to do with its hypothetical ability to fight inflation. The Fed is going to manufacture a mild recession that brings down gas prices by curtailing demand: eliminate all the trees to stop the forest fire.\n\n------------\n\n**II.**  Prices are a powerful signal to markets; when there are severe shortages in food, oil, natural gas, metals/minerals, transportation, this sends signals throughout the entire market that that are huge profits to be made. What happens every time there is a bull run in commodities? It ends in a spectacular collapse as firms all across the world compete to extract the eye-popping margins. Oil is a highly competitive asset, that yes, depends on a longer-term cycle of capital expenditures--but I think global governments have it in them to fast-track production cycles if crises really get that bad. \n\nWe already see this collapse happening in shipping prices, lumber, and trucking, for example. There are massive increases in capacity scheduled for 2023 in shipping. Refinery output will take a year or two to really increase, and crude oil is slowly starting to increase in production. The administration will likely start to make it easier for the oil majors to get oil to the market, to save its political skin. Consider the huge buildup of inventory last quarter for Target, Walmart, and likely Costco. Markets were told to make more stuff, and they did. Russia will run out of its own men to lose and tanks to get blown up by the end of 2023, easing pressure on agricultural markets at least. \n\n-----------\n\n**III.** Sometimes, when talking about markets, we don't think about how it can change rapidly in fundamental ways that impact how production cycles even function at all. Remember all those scientists/companies saying we wouldn't have a Covid vaccine for a decade? How many billions of vaccine doses have now been administered in 2 years? In a time of crisis, my bet is that humanity figures this shit out. What did we do when toilet paper ran out? We built more. What will humanity do when the cost of energy goes to the skies? It will adapt. Consumers will drive less, hold more work remotely. Car pooling will increase, as will public transportation use. \n\n\n-----\n\n**IV**: Long term declines in population growth, aging will also be deflationary in the long run. But that's a bit too long term.\n\n-----\n\n**The notion that we will have a long-term elevation in inflation is inconsistent with global markets and profit incentives. It requires an absence of human innovation and adaptability.** We will not have inflation forever, and more likely than not, it's going to fall in a mild (or worse) recession and a glut of inventories arriving as that demand eases. My prediction is that by year end or early 2023, we will start to see news articles worrying about the Fed going too far.\n\n**Connection to stocks:** For this reason, I think basing your portfolio off of the expectation of elevated inflation is a mistake unless it's very short term. Inflation can disappear as fast as it appeared. So being 80% in commodities, shorting bonds, etc. is a very very risky bet.\n\nI think a good TL;DR for my message is: **the medicine for high prices is high prices.**", "id": "vdbzgg", "created_utc": 1655348691.0, "score": 159, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 212, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

While there have been price increases, everyone is still trying to walk on eggshells and maintain the image of being good corporate citizens.\n\nWe are still in the late innings of the part of the story where the retailers still want to appear to be on the side of the customer. The Target, Walmart, Costco CEOs all made these PR statements in the ending months of 2021 and during the Q3 earnings (October-November 2021 timeframe) that they intend to eat the effects of inflation - but this was convenient when the narrative was that inflation was transitory.\n\nThey were expecting to deal with a bad quarter that, by the time it's reported, would be mitigated by them giving strong guidance about a return to the norm, with inflation already passed by the Q4 2021/Q1 2022 earnings season.\n\nAs it becomes increasingly clear that inflation will persist, they will quietly abandon that and accelerate price hikes across the spectrum.

Tesla depreciation is so low, that you should have a much better outlook under your assumptions.\n\nfor example, a 5 years M3LR will  depreciate 15k$ (for me this is very high considering current market conditions), the car has 50k miles ( 10k/year is about standard in the US). You did not spend any money for gas or public transportation , and  at 25 mls/gal you have a about 13 k$ saving, leaving you with a cost of service for 50k miles of only 2k$ or 0.04 $/mile or 400$/year for 10k miles.\n\nNot even public transportation can compete with this. But I think the point you were trying to make is that we have a capital of 60 k$ locked into a car/investment and not everybody has the initial capital to afford such investment.\n\nThis is a very legitimate point, and is the reasoning behind  many economists and companies are thinking that the future is transportation as a service (TAS) in which corporation invest the capital in the fleet and get the return from the difference between the cost per mile and the price per mile they charge users.\n\nAs you can see, the math is intriguing for the TAS model, with prices around 0.15 to 0.25 $/mile  the cost for using a TAS is about 2.5 k/year for 10k miles of service that is less or equal to average cost of financing current purchase or lease of new cars.\n\nOf course, this becomes really applicable only with Full Self Driving - aka robo-taxi. If Tesla pulls that  out of its hat, the revenue for TAS has the potential to be simply insane, hence a stock valuation with crazy multipliers.\n\njust to give an idea, a 1M miles robo taxi will produce revenues between 150k and 250 k  over 10 years of operation or 15-25-k per year.  With FSD, a tesla uses about 34 MWh for 100k miles  and considering an average 0.15 $/kWh the cost of operation is about 5.1 k$/year. Adding another 2.4 k$/year of maintenance/operation cost  (probably too much) we have 7.5 k$/year cost. Adding also pro-rate for the initial investment in the car of 5k/year (50 k robo taxi - again very high price)  we are at 12.5 k$/year or between 25%-50% gross margins per year!!!\n\nIt is very likely that, under better deployment conditions, the gross margins may be north of 100% of the investment per year!!!!!", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "Really?

My friend leading the hike is HARDCORE and zero patience. \n\nIt was 100¬∞ in the canyon.\n\nSo I had my 3 liter reservoir w/ 2 extra 1 liter bottles... the lead in my group gave me shit, \"you have a rep for excess water slowing you down so you just dump it\" (my other hiking buddies talked shit) so I threw 1 liter back in the car.\n\nThere is an aversion to hiking in the river, so we are taking very technical high elevation side trails at every opportunity. We found a neat spot and fucked around for maybe 10 minutes. The lead all of a sudden \"WE WON'T MAKE IT\" and takes off.\n\nThe pace for the terrain was too much for our newbie. The side trail systems are complex. I got yelled at by both my friends for offering to help everyone over very challenging terrain, slowing us down. Newbie almost in tears thanked me very quietly with the others out of ear shot. \n\nA bit further on and the newbie and my non-lead friend said they were going to head back, it was too exhausting to go on. Newbie out of water completely and demoralized.\n\nI say hang on let me scout ahead. I noticed the canyon walls were changing. Not 2 minutes and I was at the subway. Ran back told em we were there. My stress level of never finding them dropped to 0.\n\nSo as we get closer some crazy guy is running around naked lol.\n\nThe subway was so damn amazing. The water was freezing. Totally reset the morale.\n\nI calculated how much time we had, offered up a conservative time we should head back. We had an hour. I gave 30 minutes. In 10 minutes the lead was like we gotta go now!\n\nI paired with my non lead friend and we got a head start, I had a bad feeling. The lead and newbie set off behind us. My friend and I make it down this steep hill. A few minutes later there's a crashing sound. Someone is falling down the cliff part of the super steep hill. 20' almost straight down.\n\nI think thank God it's not someone in my group.\n\nI zoom in, enhance, zoom in more and enhance... FUCK. Newbie. God damn fucking shit. Newbie got scraped up and landed hard on their ass. I patched 'em up with my first aid kit. But the damage is done. Demoralized to terrified and wounded.\n\nLimping back at a snails pace, we made it a quarter mile and the lead is now losing it. Says we should be back and we're lost and my navigation is all wrong. Difficult for me to reassure everyone, I tried to defer a bit to my other friend but remained positive.\n\nWe advance. The sun is starting to set. A lot more impatience and a level of despair I've not witnessed before - we make it to the base of the trail out of the canyon.\n\nThat despair turned into something more, the newbie said no way they can make it up. So I offer ideas. The lead and other friend, \"so ya got this?\" to me - I was perplexed. They took off, leaving me with the newbie.\n\nNewbie said, \"they left us without water\" - only death made sense at that point. No will to resist. No will to overcome. Made sure every single idea I had failed. I basically dragged that fucking ragdoll up a sheer canyon. But that wasn't enough. I had to burn through all my reserve water by talking - nothing but encouragement and challenges for determination.\n\nHalf way up, my friends shouted they made it - further decimating the newbies morale. I was so dehydrated I was starting to cramp up, newbie was worse off.\n\nWe make it to the top, easy from there. Right around the corner from the cars was a fork I didn't remember so I sat on a rock looking at my map when the lead comes running back to us with water.\n\nI was pretty destroyed (literally) dragging the newbie up the hill. My legs were cramping in the car to dinner, like severely. Wasn't feeling too good eating either.\n\nFun trip. Would do again. The hike ended up being 20 miles round trip due to excessive side trails, while most of it is supposed to be in the river.\n\nThat extra liter of water would have made a huge difference.

In 1969, Chase gave what would become a famous speech to the PR Society of America. In it, he said companies needed, quote, managers of the mind, and that‚Äôs where PR came in. Instead of trying to sell the public on the idea that a corporation‚Äôs values were aligned with their own. Chase argued that PR professionals should be shifting those values to align with corporate interests and that they could do that by shaping culture and public policy. Two years after giving this speech, Chase created the ad that convinced America that packaging waste was the fault of individual consumers and not industry.\n\nI heard about the podcast from another podcast looking at the history and politics of Global Warming called Scene on Radio.

{"title": "The Next Short Squeeze: $HOOD", "selftext": "Alright, it's been a while since I posted here but I know how much some of you guys like short squeezes.\n\nThis isn't a P&L play, Robinhood's revenue growth has stopped as the retail trading bubble pops. I can't see it getting much better in the short term. Combine that with the PFOF (Payment For Order Flow) ban, and you might be asking why anyone would buy this stock.\n\nRobinhood doesn't have any debt. Check the [balance sheet](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/Robinhood-Exhibit-99.1_3.31.22_FINAL.pdf), it's pristine. They have a book value (total assets - total liabilities) around $8.22 per share according to [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&ty=c&ta=1&p=m), I checked it and got $8.40 but I might've gotten the number of shares incorrect. It's currently trading around $7.20 a share after hours, meaning that if the company gets liquidated, that's the value returned to shareholders. \n\nNot only that, but Robinhood has $6.19B in cash on hand as of their last earnings report, but is trading at a market cap of $6.15B. I bought some shares today, meaning I am straight up buying cash for less than it's worth. If someone told you that you could buy a $20 bill for $19.95, you'd take that deal as many times as you could get it.\n\nMarket fear over banning of PFOF, retail trading dying out, and a general market hatred for the boy from Bulgaria who runs it have created this insane opportunity for a short squeeze.\n\nAccording to [fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/hood), HOOD currently has a short interest of 11.28%. FTX [recently](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-ftx-ceo-reveals-stake-trading-app-robinhood-2022-05-12/) bought up 7.6% of their float. This means there are less shares being traded, a low float is key for a squeeze.\n\nMy thesis is that it will just take one piece of positive news regarding a potential buyout or hedge fund purchase, which is very likely at these levels, to cause a big short covering rally in the stock. I'd target the $12-15 range.

{"title": "How and why the crisis will happen. Start Here to learn the basics.", "selftext": "**You can skip to the conclusion at the very bottom.**\n\n**I wrote this a few months ago for my friends in tech, and the more time passes the more correct it turns out to be, so I wanted to share it with more people. Hope it is useful to yall.**\n\nThe current nonfarm unemployment rate stands today at 3.6% in the US as of April 2022\n\n[Source](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)\n\nThe current CPI Inflation rate today stands at 8.3% counting food and energy\n\n[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/business/economy/april-2022-cpi.html)\n\nYou can control inflation by raising interest rates. Raising interest rates makes it so people loan less money, loaning money is how money is made for the most part. It happens because of the money multiplier effect. Which works kinda like this. \n\nImagine I‚Äôm a bank, and you deposit 100 dollars with me. Well as a bank I am legally required to keep 10% of deposits in storage (This is called [Required Reserve Rates)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredreserves.asp), just in case you want to come and take money out. So from your $100 deposit, I loan out $90 to Person 1. Person 1 now takes that loan and spends it wherever he wants. But I have to keep $9 of those $90 in storage by law. So I can loan out $81 to Person 2 and so on.\n\n \n\n[Money Multiplier Effect](https://preview.redd.it/1899omdljx591.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe2a034e1129b036f70ec773a28ae58a113c16f8)\n\n \n\nIf we make accounts and sum out all the money that I ‚Äúhave‚Äù as a bank, it's 100+90+81+72.9+65.61 and so on. In total for just these accounts you see on the graph. I as a bank can lay claim to **$717.57 total.** \n\nThat's called the **Money Multiplier Effect**, there's more to it but that's the gist. \n\nNow how do you stop all this money creation? You make it very costly to loan money. Usually, the Fed raises interest rates. But they cannot simply raise interest rates across the board. What they do is raise the [Federal Funds Rate](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)**.** Which is the interest rate at which banks can lend each other money, which eventually trickles down to the interest rate by which we get loaned money. \n\n \n\n[Federal Funds Rate vs Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/5ro6njlqlx591.png?width=1243&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dc7a1a2fb86ceb3b0172bd1054567f806822207)\n\n \n\nWhen The Fed wants to rein in inflation, they raise interest rates very high above inflation. Now you have also noticed the big spike there in the middle left of the graph. This was a period of incredibly high inflation in the US during the 70s and 80s. It was solved by a man called Paul Volcker, who‚Äôs revered today among economists. The federal reserve at the time was unwilling to raise interest rates because it would cause a recession and kill jobs. But the persistant inflation problem was too much, so the Chairman of the Fed was fired and replaced with Paul Volcker. Paul went on to raise interest rates to such incredibly high levels that it caused a recession, and raised the unemployment rate to double digit numbers. People sent him threats and 2x4s where construction workers wrote ‚Äúyou are killing our jobs‚Äù but the man persisted. Once inflation came down, it remained down. In the US ever since we have enjoyed almost miraculous levels of stable 2% inflation since. In the EU they had 2-6% bouncing around, Turkey between 6-30%, and Mexico 2-30%.\n\nHowever the work of Paul Volcker only reaches so far, today inflation rate is soaring high again, why do we not just raise rates again quickly? Because high inflation in the short term produces lots of jobs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Phillips Curve](https://preview.redd.it/ku065ngxlx591.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=d177b988e5d5e041a43c324d0dd36621bc051fd8)\n\n \n\nNow despite the fact that this graph says ‚Äúwage inflation‚Äù because it is trying to explain a single phenomenon. It actually applies to ALL inflation, high inflation creates low unemployment. Here is why:\n\nImagine you want a widget that costs $90, it costs $90 next week and the week after, no problem at all.\n\nBut now imagine this widget instead cost $90 now, and $95 next week, and the week after $100. If you want this thing you better buy it **Now**. An increase in the speed at which people spend, because they have to buy everything right now, means businesses have more business because everyone is spending so much, so they hire more people.\n\nOk so whats the problem? Why does this have to end?\n\nEnter the Michel Burry graphs.\n\n[This is the only site I could find them. I'm not an internet coin guy](https://news.bitcoin.com/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-of-looming-consumer-recession-more-earnings-trouble/)\n\n[This graph is for debt for consumers, think credit cards for example](https://preview.redd.it/d53ysb0omx591.jpg?width=1410&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=526651360bbdbd500c393256731f95b375d37f49)\n\n[This is consumer savings](https://preview.redd.it/buy79e0omx591.jpg?width=1435&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22b9e2599ab118436484867b1372307e71757745)\n\nThe first graph is ‚ÄúConsumer Credit Outstanding‚Äù meaning the amount of debt consumers have, for example, credit card debt. The second graph is ‚ÄúPersonal Savings‚Äù which is just what is sounds like, the amount of savings people have in their account.\n\nMichael Burry said of this of twitter  \"US Personal Savings fell to 2013 levels, the savings rate to 2008 levels ‚Äî while revolving credit card debt grew at a record-setting pace back to the pre-COVID peak despite all those $trillions of cash dropped in their laps\" (Source is the article above the graphs)\n\nWhy are people doing this? Is this a failure of personal responsibility? Maybe but not likely, here is the mechanism of why inflation actually predicts this.\n\nLets go back to that $90 widget. Imagine that not only is the widget going from $90, to $95, to $100. But your total personal savings are $100. If you need this widget then you will buy it immediately and kill your savings. Usually, this is the stopping point for runaway inflation, even if companies keep raising prices, consumers simply wont buy them because they ran out their savings, so companies go easy on the pricing, and consumers slowly build back up their savings. \n\nYou have probably done this as well. I imagine at least one of you, when gas prices were first rising from $2 to $4 decided to fill up your gas tank at 3$, just in case next week prices were even higher, and you were right. \n\nWell why has this not stopped? Why are prices rising and why are people taking out loans? Here is why:\n\nImagine you take out a loan for $100 with a 5% interest next week, and inflation is say 2%. \n\nNext week you will owe adjusted for inflation $100 + $5 in interest - $2 in inflation = $103 total.\n\nNow imagine that inflation is at 4%. $100 + $5 interest - $4 inflation = $101 total.\n\nTaking out loans has gotten **a lot** cheaper in adjusted terms. \n\nWhat if interest is also very low? Well today interest stands at around 0.75% going up to 1% \n\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)\n\nSo now imagine low interest rate **and** high inflation\n\n$100 + $1 interest - $7 inflation = $94 total \n\nYou now owe **less** in real terms by taking out a loan, which you then use the **Money Multiplier Effect** and you can see why all these things combined have been so bad.\n\n**TLDR / In conclusion:**\n\nThe Federal Reserve will be forced to raise interest rates by a lot, which will increase unemployment, crash consumer spending, and make a temporary but hopefully controlled intentional recession.", "id": "vdg32g", "created_utc": 1655363617.0, "score": 1652, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 489, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vdg32g)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vdg32g)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "In the middle of 6 crisis\n\n*makes post about impending crisis*\n\nPeak WSB post.", "score": 979, "replies": [{"body": "I haven‚Äôt kept up with the other crisis lol, except the food one.

The typical way is to borrow from the FED (that's the whole point of the interbanking interest rate - which the FED is raising through the rate hikes) and lend to consumer and corporations.

Just look at a bank statement and see the profit forecasts based on the FED rate changes.\n\nWhen you get a mortgage and you hear that your mortgage rate is 'base rate + X%', well, that's saying 'fed rate + our profit', and your rate will move (if it's a variable mortgage rate for example) as the FED rate moves. Long term fixed rates are also trying to forecast future FED base rates and so on.\n\nConsumer deposits cost a lot to maintain (hence bank fees for having an account) and that cost is higher than the FED rate cost of money, so until recently it made no sense for banks to attract depositors because managing that whole retail process cost much more than the 0.1% the FED was charging them. Of course, now, as FED rates go up and become expensive, banks start offering higher savings rates because that dynamic flips (but hey, nobody got savings left anymore, ha!).\n\nAfter the 2008 crisis there was lots of regulation to increase capital reserves and stop the bleed, BASEL and Glass-Steele etc., which have been paired back over the years because investment banks wanted to make more money. Stress Test by Geithner is a good book to see how it all unfolded during the 2008 crisis and how the lack of capital reserves/reqs got them killed.\n\nIf you want to understand more start reading equity research reports on banks (wherever you can find them) and banks financial statements, and then watch some general real economy videos by people who know their shit, like El Erian or Gundlach and things will start making more sense.\n\nBanks are a very special animal in the world of equity research and they have their whole language and terminology.

Like a spiderweb, or a (sorry if this is a poor descriptor for someone reading) cancer that has spread away from its original source.\n\nIt was hard for consumers to borrow money post 2008 but it got relatively easier over the following years to obtain money to start businesses, etc.\n\nRules for plebs like me were instituted saying \"you can't buy a second house without paying more, because that was the cause of the financial crash! It had nothing to do with MBS and such...\" while simultaneously we were seeing companies sprout up out of no-where to take advantage of low interest rates and shoot their shot.\n\nThink of how many tech startups came and went. How many chains of restaurants opened 20 locations (Poke craze, current example: fried chicken sandwich craze, etc.) and then not only fizzled out but imploded. That money didn't magically re-appear.\n\nBut we kept trying to stimulate the economy by making money accessible. Not to your average american, but to your Investment banks, your VC people, etc.\n\nInstead of providing stability through directly giving money to consumers, we tried the time tested trickle down method.\n\nIt appears (again, anecdotally, I'm no economist) that a couple of things happened:\n\n1. Rich got richer, poor got poorer, middle class shrank into the poorer side of the equation.\n2. A boom of growth when otherwise we should have had an even more major cooling period post 2008.\n\nEnter 2020.\n\nPeople largely blame stimulus checks for our current situation; we \"printed\" money after all.\n\nBut in reality, the stimulus checks we all received were a tiny tiny portion of the amount of money that was being distributed. The lion's share was going to corporations, etc., and the next largest share to small businesses (leaving out the money distributed to state and local governments).\n\nOverall, great, mission accomplished.\n\nBut then shit got weird. The economy, instead of leveling out and slowly recovering, surged. The markets were the precursors to this. The tech sector boomed. Unemployment dropped down immensely. Everything happened relatively instantaneously, which should have been a warning.

Not us retail investors, but the big players?\n\nThink of every company that, even prior to the pandemic, you were like \"there's NO WAY this business is going to survive\" that today is JUST starting to report lower earnings and layoffs.\n\nWe built a Dam with low interest rates and propping up, instead of the American People, the American Business. That dam is going to break. The money will drain out, businesses that should have failed will fail now, all at once, etc.\n\nSo, did inflation start with the consumer and spending? Probably not. It started with people being hired at companies that shouldn't have been successful and paying high salaries, or SPACs raising billions in capital to bring all sorts of crazy shit to the market, etc.\n\nIt's going to be impossible to blame this on consumers; we don't have any money compared to the trillions or quadrillions or whatever the fuck it is being moved by corporations, businesses, etc.\n\nTo extricate ourselves from this shitstorm? Make it easy for the consumer to borrow. Make it hard for the business to borrow. Ensure that consumers can LIVE (and soend...UBI?), and that GOOD businesses can survive and thrive (higher interest rates), with a level playing field for the little guys and gals (massive grants comparatively for small business entrepreneurs, or lower interest rates for small startups vs. Large corporations).

A red flag example is someone who wants to defend themselves in court.\n\nPowell went to Georgetown Law and has no training as an economist. He believes so strongly in his silver tongue that he uses nonsense phrases like \n\n‚ÄúForward Guidance‚Äù\n‚ÄúData Dependent‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe have the tools‚Äù\n\nHe talks to the press, a lot. He loves the attention and is drunk on the power of controlling the entire US Economy with his silky wordplay \n\nThe only problem is that it doesn‚Äôt work that way. In December 2018, he caused a taper tantrum when Jay Powell announced that it would be reducing the pace of its purchases of Treasury bonds in order to reduce the amount of money fed into the economy.\n\nbond yields rose and stocks collapsed. Which was predictable and actually cathartic and necessary. \n\nJay Powell, the lawyer, chickened out and got tweeted at fiercely by Trump and quickly reversed course.\n\nThis sent a signal to Wall Street that ‚Äúthis guys a puss‚Äù and he will never take the punch bowl away.\n\nHe never has. The 75 bips is just a .75% increase in the federal funds rate that was telegraphed, leaked and jawboned so much that if effectively became meaningless.\n\nThis is against an 8.6% rate of inflation that a year ago he called ‚Äútransitory‚Äù\n\nThere is a forest fire and Jay Powell shows up with a squirt gun and his silver tongue.\n\nPaul Volcker was a giant, he was 6‚Äô 7‚Äù and was educated at the London School of Economics, Harvard and Princeton \n\nWhen inflation roared its ugly head in the 1980s , he did not go on TV, provide ‚Äúdata dependent forward guidance‚Äù or try to jawbone. He silently raised the Federal Funds rate to 20% and it took seven Secret Service men to carry his balls around.\n\nFor a visual representation imagine Paul Volcker as Gandalf and Jerome Powell as Pippin\n\nEdit: for context, the ‚Äú70s‚Äù was the period after the 60s and before the 80s.

The inflation STARTED on January 20, 2021, and everything the current senile old fuck in the WH has done has only made it worse.\n\nThe sad part is that it's by design. He told us he would destroy the oil/gas industry, that he would end them. Problem is he's doing just that but without any viable replacement energy. This is all the fault of the ignorant American voters. FJB fucking told us he would fuck shit up, and these idiots still voted for him.\n\nRegarding the supply chain issues, nothing has been done to curtail that issue. We were simply told to \"lower our expectations\"... remember that? Also, the US is STILL enforcing Covid rules that prohibit truckers from crossing the border with Canada, which is hindering meat packing plants, causing supply disruptions, raising prices. This could be easily fixed but FJB won't do it. As a side note, this \"follow the science\" bunch of hypocrites in DC are COMPLETELY IGNORING the Johns Hopkins study that says lockdowns were  useless. I guess the geniuses in the FJB administration know better?\n\nAs far as the war goes, if we hadn't turned against domestic energy production and then begged OPEC (which Russia is now part of) to produce more, and we had a coherent leader in the WH, that war would have never happened. Instead this idiot says he wouldn't react to a \"minor incursion\"... Idiot. Anyone coming into my house with a gun would not be considered a minor incursion.\n\nThe sanctions have failed, as experts said they would, and now Russia is stronger and the rubble is increased in value. Yay, Joe, you incompetent fuck.\n\nThat's enough of this rant. Your assumption of inflation being the supply chain and the war is ludicrous. Inflation was already 7.9% in February. Russia didn't invade Ukraine until the END of February. Now we're at 8.6%. Even if you could attribute all of the increase to the war, it's ONLY 0.7% (8.6-7.9) higher.
