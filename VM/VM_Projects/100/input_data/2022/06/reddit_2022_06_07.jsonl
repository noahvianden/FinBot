{"title": "Target shares fall as it expects squeezed profits from aggressive plan to get rid of unwanted inventory", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/07/target-markdowns-plan-to-cut-inventory.html\n\nTarget warned investors Tuesday that its profits will take a short-term hit, as it marks down unwanted items, cancels orders and takes aggressive steps to get rid of extra inventory. The retailer slashed its profit margin expectations for the fiscal second quarter to account for a wave of goods winding up deeply discounted or on the clearance rack. Shares fell more than 9% in premarket trading following the news. “We thought it was prudent for us to be decisive, act quickly, get out in front of this, address and optimize our inventory in the second quarter — take those actions necessary to remove the excess inventory and set ourselves up to continue to be guest relevant with our assortment,” CEO Brian Cornell said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nBy taking swift action, Cornell said Target can fend off further pain and make room for merchandise that customers do want, such as groceries, beauty items, household essentials and seasonal categories like back-to-school supplies. He said the company’s stores and website are seeing strong traffic and “a very resilient customer,” but one who no longer shops popular Covid pandemic categories. “We want to make sure that we continue to lean into those categories that are relevant today,” he said. Target anticipates its operating margin rate for the second quarter will be around 2%. That’s lower than the outlook it gave less than three weeks ago, when it anticipated its operating margin rate would be roughly around its first-quarter operating margin rate of 5.3%.\n\nIn the back half of the year, Target anticipates profit margins will be in a range around 6% — better than its average performance for the fall season in the years before the pandemic began. The company said it still expects revenue growth to be in the low to mid single digits for the full year and to maintain or gain market share in 2022. Retailers from Walmart to Gap face a glut of inventory as inflation-pinched shoppers skip over categories that were popular during the first two years of the pandemic. Gap, for instance, said customers want party dresses and office clothes instead of the many fleece hoodies and active clothes the company has. Walmart said some families are making fewer discretionary purchases as the prices of gas and groceries rise. Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters both reported a steep jump in inventory levels, up 46% and 45%, respectively, from a year ago from a mix of items not selling and supply chain delays easing. The extreme shift in consumers’ spending habits comes as retailers start to get back to healthy in-stock levels. That means some have an abundance of sweatpants, throw pillows and pajamas just as consumers search for swimsuits and suitcases. Plus, some shoppers are trimming back on spending due to inflation or putting more of their dollars toward experiences like dining out and traveling.\n\nCornell said Target decided to roll out its new inventory plan after hearing retail competitors had similar woes. He said the company also wanted to get ahead of key sales seasons, such as back-to-school and the holidays, when stale merchandise could clutter stores and drive away customers. Target said it had nearly $15.1 billion of inventory as of April 30, the end of the fiscal first quarter. That’s about 43% higher than in the year-ago period. Target shocked Wall Street on May 18 with a wide earnings miss for the fiscal first quarter, as it got hit by fuel and freight costs, higher levels of discounting, and a rotation away from items like TVs, small kitchen appliances and bicycles. Its shares fell nearly 25%, marking the company’s worst day on Wall Street in 35 years.\n\nWalmart missed earnings expectations, too. Its inventory levels were up about 33% compared with a year ago. Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said at an investor event on Friday that about 20% of that is merchandise the retailer wishes it did not have. Roughly a third is additional inventory to help the retailer restock key items. He said it will be “a couple of quarters to get back to where we want to be.” That company’s shares also fell after Target’s announcement on Tuesday. Walmart’s shares were down about 4% in premarket trading. Cornell said Target is sorting through its inventory, deciding in some cases to pack away merchandise to sell at full price in the future and in other cases to promote or come up with ways to sell through it now. For instance, he said, Target had a big sales event over Memorial Day weekend to clear bulky outdoor items like patio furniture out of its backrooms. It also got additional space near U.S. ports to hold merchandise, so it has a place to move goods — some of which are arriving too early or too late.", "id": "v6tqbl", "created_utc": 1654603610.0, "score": 1029, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 259, "comments": [{"body": ">but one who no longer shops popular Covid pandemic categories\n\nMy dollar store has Lysol, hand sanitizer and alcohol wipes in nearly every aisle stacked 6 feet high!

I'm just saying that limiting oil production is one way to reduce hydrocarbon consumption when people are failing to curtail their own energy consumption. But for that to really work, we need spiraling energy prices to stick so that demand destruction can kick in where people are forced to cut back. \n\nI remember how, last Summer, during the Texas rolling blackouts during their heat people (on a Texas subreddit) were criticizing me for suggesting that they turn their thermostats up to 80 degrees and acclimate themselves. Apparently, the masses of cheap houses that have been built there lately are not suitable for deep South climates and mirrors glued to bathroom walls fall off & the houses turn into heat boxes. But even apart from the shoddy construction, the idea that people should learn to live with higher temperatures if they move to Texas instead of blasting their ACs all Summer, was deemed to be a barbaric, pre-Civilization idea on my part. But you know, the hundreds of millions of energy hogs in America who equate civilization with never having to acclimate to colder temps in Winter and hotter temps in Summer, can cut back if energy costs enough, and high prices may be the ONLY way to force them to do that. \n\nHigh prices are the inevitable result of a climate mitigation policy of forcing a reduction of hydrocarbon production. So high prices serve a functional purpose. The proper solution to the dilemma of high prices is to create a culture of energy conservation by individuals in their own daily lives.

{"title": "Apple is turning your iPhone into fintech service taking on PayPal, Affirm and more", "selftext": "Apple plans to expand its fintech offerings when it launches the new iPhone software, iOS 16, this fall.\n\nThe company announced new features for the wallet app such as a buy now, pay later service at its annual developers conference Monday.\n\nThe new features are designed to attract more people to Apple Pay and keep customers locked into the iOS ecosystem.\n\nApple is turning into a fintech company.\n\nThe company announced several new features for the iPhone’s Wallet app at its developers conference Monday that directly compete with products from other fintech companies such as Affirm and PayPal. The big one: a buy now, pay later service called Apple Pay Later. That announcement sent Affirm shares down more than 5% Monday, and they were down an additional 4% as of Tuesday morning.\n\nApple will also launch a new payments system later this month that lets you pay someone by tapping your iPhone against theirs. It’s a direct competitor to Block’s Square. And Wallet in iOS 16 will let you track online orders you buy through Apple Pay.\n\nAll of this points to one of the most interesting corners of the Apple ecosystem — a growing suite of financial products within the Wallet app. Many of these features aren’t designed to make money for Apple directly, but they do make Apple Pay more attractive for people who haven’t tried it yet. (Apple takes a tiny percentage of every Apple Pay transaction, so the more people using it, the better it is for Apple.) Like most major new iOS features, it’s also another mechanism to keep customers locked into Apple’s ecosystem and upgrading to a new iPhone when they’re ready.\n\nBut Apple’s new Wallet features are also coming at a time of great economic uncertainty. Inflation is still going wild. Gas prices continue to hit record highs. And there are plenty of very real fears about an upcoming recession. It could be a tough time for Apple to launch a new product designed to get people to buy more stuff if those trends persist throughout the year.\n\nApple’s new rivals in the buy now, pay later space have struggled in recent months as consumer spending shifts from goods to services. Other fintech and crypto companies such as Robinhood, PayPal and Coinbase have struggled this year as well.\n\nApple has a longer-term vision for Wallet. As the company revealed the latest features Monday, executives said the ultimate goal is for the digital Wallet app to replace everything in your physical wallet\n\nBut things are moving slowly in some areas, such as last year’s feature that lets you add your driver’s license, which is available in just a couple of states in the U.S., and with a few more expected soon. Even then, you can use the ID only at TSA checkpoints at one airport in Phoenix. Carmakers have also been slow to adopt the iOS feature that lets you store a digital version of your car key on your phone.\n\nStill, Apple told me yesterday there’s little concern over that slow adoption. The hope is consumer demand pushes third parties to adopt the technology.\n\nOn the fintech side, however, Apple is building a foundation to provide a boost to its payments business by layering more functions into Apply Pay and Wallet beyond just using your iPhone, instead of your credit card, to pay for things. And because of Apple’s scale with more than a billion devices in use, a lot more people are about to be exposed to these products.\n\nApple expands fintech ambitions in iOS 16\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/07/apple-expands-fintech-ambitions-in-ios-16.html?__source=androidappshare", "id": "v746bm", "created_utc": 1654627445.0, "score": 399, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 184, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 208, "replies": [{"body": "Debt with a fresh coat of paint", "score": 84, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "I low-key thought it actually was a new form of payday loan so I bet heavily on Affirm prior to it mooning when they scored the amazon deal.

{"title": "World Bank warns global economy may suffer 1970s-style stagflation, Risks of further deterioration are mounting", "selftext": "BY DAVID J. LYNCH\n\nThe global economy may be headed for years of weak growth and rising prices, a toxic combination that will test the stability of dozens of countries still struggling to rebound from the pandemic, the World Bank warned Tuesday.\nNot since the 1970s — when twin oil shocks sapped growth and lifted prices, giving rise to the malady known as “stagflation” — has the global economy faced such a challenge.\nThe bank slashed its annual global growth forecast to 2.9 percent from January’s 4.1 percent and said that “subdued growth will likely persist throughout the decade because of weak investment in most of the world.”\nFallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has aggravated the global slowdown by driving up prices for a range of commodities, fueling inflation. Global growth this year will be roughly half of last year’s annualized rate and is expected to show little improvement in 2023 and 2024.\nThis will be the sharpest slump after an initial post-recession rebound that the global economy has suffered in more than 80 years, the bank said. And the situation could get even worse if the Ukraine war fractures global trade and financial networks or soaring food prices spark social unrest in importing countries.\n“The risk from stagflation is considerable with potentially destabilizing consequences for low- and middle-income economies,” said David Malpass, president of the multilateral development institution in Washington. “ … There’s a severe risk of malnutrition and of deepening hunger and even of famine in some areas.”\nIf the worst outcomes materialize, global growth over the next two years could fall “close to zero,” he added.\n\nWith few exceptions, the economic outlook is troubled.\nIn the third year of pandemic, the global economy this year has been hit by what the World Bank labels “overlapping crises” — fallout from the war in Ukraine, recurring coronavirus lockdowns affecting Chinese factories and the highest inflation rates in decades.\nFor now, the greatest areas of concern lie beyond U.S. borders. A recession in Europe is a real possibility, as the continent struggles to accommodate nearly 7 million Ukrainian refugees and deal with upheavals in energy markets. Elsewhere, the interruption of grain exports via the Black Sea is hurting countries such as Lebanon, Egypt and Somalia. China is suffering from its rigid zero-covid policies and battling costly property market weakness.\nThough the U.S. economy shrank in the first three months of the year during the omicron variant surge, growth is expected to rebound in the current quarter, according to economists’ estimates. Financial market gauges of future inflation rates have declined since late April, easing — though not eliminating — fears of a prolonged price spiral.\nNathan Sheets, global chief economist for Citigroup, called the chance of a significant stagflation outbreak in the U.S. “remote,” in a recent client note.\n\nPolicymakers must act quickly to mitigate the Ukraine war’s consequences, help countries pay for food and fuel, and accelerate promised debt relief, while avoiding “distortionary policies” such as price controls and export bans, the bank said.\nThe World Bank’s Malpass said the global economy is being hampered by inadequate production capacity for key goods. “It’s very important to increase supply massively to really try to get at inflation directly by more production. Unfortunately, there aren’t signs of that very much yet,” he said.\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted global energy markets, threatening Europe with recession and straining the budgets of countries that import large quantities of oil, natural gas, coal and fertilizer, the bank said.\nAs Europe weans itself from Russian energy products, its purchases from alternative suppliers competes with orders from existing customers, limiting available supplies.\n\nInvestors also could take a beating from a repeat of ‘70s-style stagflation. The S&P 500 stock index, already down more than 13 percent this year, could lose an additional 20 percent or more, according to a recent client note from Bank of America.\nLed by the United States, the world roared out of the pandemic downturn with its fastest growth since 1973, a 5.7 percent gain. The global economy was expected to struggle this year as it adjusted to the loss of pandemic-era government spending and ultralow interest rates. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — and continued coronavirus flare-ups — have made the situation tougher.\n\nThe price of a barrel of Brent crude oil has jumped to nearly $120, up almost 50 percent this year. And wheat has staged a similar rally, leading the bank to call for urgent action to ease “worldwide food shortages.”\nThe World Bank’s downbeat forecast adds to concerns about global weakness. Most major stock markets, including those in the United States, are in the red so far this year. And the bank’s sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, lowered its global forecast in April.\nWith the U.S., and most other major economies suffering the highest inflation in 40 years, many economists in recent months have cited the danger of a 1970s rerun.", "id": "v7acpd", "created_utc": 1654642670.0, "score": 1184, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 346, "comments": [{"body": "The 80s were the best decade up to that decade in the history of the stock market, so the 2030s should be lit.", "score": 321, "replies": [{"body": "“You will own nothing and eat ze bugs”", "score": 219, "replies": [{"body": "*vill", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Vill Veaton?

The second part about a $23 billion take-home bonus has been making the rounds, it's just as bad. The dollar figure is flat out wrong, the use of *take-home* is misleading at best, and the use of *bonus* is technically incorrect.\n\n* The $23 billion figure is actually $16.4 billion as of today's closing price. \n* Reich says $23 billion take-home, but Elon will pay about 40-50% in taxes so his take-home is more like $8-9 billion. \n* It's not really a bonus. Musk receives no salary, bonus, or time-based equity. Instead, it is the compensation for successfully guiding Tesla during uncertain times and miraculously multiplying market cap by 11x, adjusted EBITDA by 21x, and revenue by 6x. \n\n___\n\nHere's the data and additional thoughts.\n\n\n**23 billion**\n\nFirst, the $23 billion figure. He cites a Guardian article from 45 days ago. Tesla's 10-Q from March 31st of this year lists 3 operational milestones as Achieved, pending certification.\n\nEach milestone grants Musk the option to purchase 8,443,351 shares at $70.01 each. Thus, Musk can acquire 25,330,053 shares worth $18,153,035,782.98 for a cost of $1,773,357,010.53 resulting in paper gains of $16,379,678,772.45.\n\n**take home**\n\nElon will face federal income tax at an effective rate of 37%. Social Security tax is not levied on earning in excess of $147,000. The Medicare rate is 1.45% for the first $200,000 earned and an additional 0.9% thereafter, effectively 2.35%. Elon moved to Texas around December 2020, but California will fight for their 12.3% share commensurate to Musk's time spent in the state. \n\nUltimately, Elon will pay somewhere between $6,445,403,596.96 and $8,460,104,085.97 in taxes based on today's closing price. His take home would be in the range of $8-10 billion, a far cry from the $23 billion Reich says. This doesn't even include the taxes he will potentially pay when he sells to come up with the 1.77b needed to acquire the shares in the first place.\n\n**bonus**\n\nThere's not much to say on this. We know that Elon helped lead Tesla through production hell and defied the critics and naysayers, resulting in absolutely astonishing returns for investors and employees. Simply calling it a bonus ignores Tesla's monstrous growth over the past 4 years. The compensation package is described as: 100% pay-for-performance structure with 10-year term; [No salary, no bonus or time based equity](https://i.imgur.com/RIg5oIy.png)  \n\nNone of this really matters I guess. But damn, I like having accurate figures. Leaving stuff like this unchecked might not materially affect sales now, but part of me does worry that it could affect Tesla at some point in the future.

{"title": "What will happen with our economy?", "selftext": "Enough of \"oh I don't have a crystal ball\", blah blah bullshit.\n\nLet's sum up what the fuck is going on.  It's bad.  It's getting worse.  It's getting worse quickly.\n\nLet's look at the problematic topics in the economy right now....\n\n\n1) Inflation\n\n\n2) Interest rates\n\n\n3) Consumer Spending\n\n\n\nFirstly, inflation... obviously high.  Going much beyond real wage growth.  But what's causing this?  Demand? No.  It is primarily driven by supply.  This all stems from the brilliant idea of shutting down the economies in 2020. It created major issues in supply chain.  Think of water flowing through a pipe.  Break that pipe, pump water into it to keep water flowing, then try restarting at full throttle.  Good luck.  Demand is no higher than pre-pandemic but the flow of supply has been fucked up.\n\nThis caused the SHORTAGES.  \n\nThe economy is a complex web of chains.  Break one, it affects the others.  All chains broken, try restarting full throttle.  Never could you do this.  It leads to inefficiency.  It leads to more widespread shortages.  \n\nSince demand went back to pre-pandemic levels, the shortage of supply causes inflation.  It's not absurdly strong demand.  It's a shortage of supply, with normal demand.  Prices go up.\n\nNow high inflation causes higher velocity of money. Why?  Better to buy that thing today than tomorrow.  What does higher velocity of money do?  Add more inflation.  Similarly, the job market is seeing a much higher velocity of movement of workers, leading to a perceived shortage, higher turnover and higher wages.  Add more inflation.\n\n\nSo let's get to the Fed solution...increase interest rates.  What does that do?  Decrease demand.  This has 0 impact on fixing any supply issues.  It can only hamper supply issues further.  How?  Companies experiencing out of control costs getting hammered with higher debt service costs, causes more difficulty.  The Fed needs to decrease demand so significantly to match the issues from the broken web of the supply chain.  \n\n\nCase in point...the automotive inventory levels are so low that dealers barely have cars on their lots.  Even if the Fed suppresses demand so significantly to reduce sales by 30%, the automakers will still be operating as much as they can for over a year to recoup those inventories.  This is the same in a lot of industries right now.  There will be no letting off the gas because of the supply issues.\n\n[Auto Inventory](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AUINSA)\n\n\nSo the Fed will NOT be able to solve this and will continue steep increases in interest rates since it WILL NOT tame inflation.  If they are looking to tame inflation, the ONLY result will be a severe recession since inflation will not settle unless demand collapses for some time (see auto example/reason).\n\n\nThe consumer only has so much money.  The biggest costs most consumers have are mortgage/rent, food, and energy.  With the steep interest rate rises, mortgage costs will go up substantially.  Rents have already gone up and will continue.  Energy costs have nearly doubled.  Food costs are up 25% (compare your grocery bills from before to now).  With all these costs going up on necessities, less money available for discretionary spending.  \n\n\nSo consumer spending starts to reduce, rather significantly.  This leads subdued earnings (especially at companies that are not considered necessary).  This results in hiring freezes and layoffs.  \n\nInvestment starts to decrease as assets are revalued at higher interest rates.\n\nThe government starts pulling back on spending due to the enormous debt and higher cost of debt.\n\n\nNow we have 3 out of the 4 components of GDP decreasing. \n\nThen it is a chain reaction.\n\nWe need a quick, deep recession to rebalance all the supply and demand issues and stop more pain.  The longer it drags out, the longer and worse it will be.\n\nHow long will this last?  This is the question that cannot be answered because it is dynamic with variables that can be changed.  Does inflation get worse, does Fed go harder, do assets deflate....\n\n\nPS. Our component prices will be up 50% in vehicles by July 2022.  A new car in 2023 will cost a pretty penny.  \n\n\nTLDR;\nThe Fed cannot fix the supply-side driven inflation.  The velocity of money is causing more inflation.  This will all cause consumer spending to decrease, layoffs, and a deep recession likely for some time.  We need the economy rebalanced as quickly as possible.", "id": "v6hr7e", "created_utc": 1654561159.0, "score": 368, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 522, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|119|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|479|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kvegwp/will_twtr_go_bankrupt_this_year/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqt667/brkb_a_serious_market_underperformer/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ua4php/google_the_oversold_cash_cow_that_will_blow_past/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v6hr7e)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v6hr7e)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You're not spending because you spent all your money in a fucking casino.\n\nThere are still plenty of warehouse workers getting $22 an hour buying everything you can't afford.\n\nMaybe take a second job at Wendy's so you can afford to buy your wife that cock ring she has been wanting for her boyfriend.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "one thing that never changes, pimps gonna pimp, and hoes gonna hoe", "score": 227, "replies": [{"body": "Nobody fucks with gator!", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Gator don’t play no shit", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Gator never been about playing no shit.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "lolllllll", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Gators bitches better be usin jimmies!", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Pimps don’t cryyyyyy….. pimps don’t cry.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Shorting hoes, long on pimps $$$", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "always ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Pimps up, hoes down", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Call the hoes - put out the pimps", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "War.

All 56 economists who provide quarterly forecasts not only see steady growth over seven consecutive quarters but also the absence of a contraction. The US unemployment rate, which has recently improved the most in its history by falling to 3.6% — almost the lowest level in five decades — from a 2020 high of 14.7% is poised to reach 3.5% in the third quarter and remain low for several years. That would make the US the second-lowest in joblessness among the G-7 nations after Japan, according 50 economist forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.**\n> \n> Additionally, the economists put the probability of a recession at 30%, up from 15% at the end of January but not historically remarkable.\n> \n> To be sure, no one knows how and when two of the biggest contributors to inflation — supply chain disruptions and commodities shortages aggravated by China’s economy-pinching Covid Zero strategy and Russia’s war in Ukraine — will end.\n> \n> Other assumptions obscure why economists are sticking with their forecasts. When the difference in yield between 10-year and 2-year Treasury securities turned negative in March, commentators immediately predicted recession because all six downturns since 1980 came after a negative or inverted yield curve. The same commentators were largely silent when the yield curve turned positive earlier this month by more than 0.2 percentage point.\n> \n> At the same time, inflation-mongering took a respite when the Consumer Price Index dropped to 8.3% last month from 8.5% in March while the Fed’s preferred PCE inflation gauge fell to 5.18% from 5.31%. The median forecast of 69 economists puts the CPI at an average of 7% this year before it declines to 3% in 2023 and 2.4% in 2024.\n> \n> The risk of recession is surely real, but so is the absence of several historical red flags. The US deficit-to-GDP ratio had declined to 4.9% in April from 18.6% in March 2021, only 0.1 percentage point wider than the pre-pandemic level and 1.6 percentage points wider than the average over five decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the performance of 10 major currencies versus the U.S. dollar, appreciated to a level that is 14% higher than the average since 2015 when the index began.\n> \n> For all the anxiety about financial markets, US borrowing costs — including federal, state and local governments as well as American companies — are the lowest since 1975, when such data became available, according to the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index. Even after yields climbed 2 percentage points from the low, debt financing still is 2.8 percentage points lower than the 47-year average of 6.3%.\n> \n> Bloomberg Chief Economist Tom Orlik and his colleague Anna Wong, Bloomberg's US economist, share their peers’ equanimity about inflation and growth. They attribute the optimism-pessimism gap to a lack of experience with anything comparable in recent memory.\n> \n> “You really have to go back to the Spanish Flu in 1918 or Bubonic Plague in the Middle Ages,” for a perspective that informs the current situation, Wong said.\n> \n> Orlik put it this way: “There's no kind of historical relationship of anything in the historical data which tells you how Russia invading Ukraine is going to impact. You can't really look to history for lessons on how China's lockdowns in response to omicron are going to impact.”\n> \n> As a result, he said, “It's always more interesting to talk about the risk scenario, especially when the risk scenario is kind of sexy like a recession, rather than a base case of everything being OK.”", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Calls on us economy got it", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Oh my gosh it’s all going to crash and we will lose all of our money!!!

We currently have two groups of people moving into peak earning periods of their lives. Millennials and Gen Z. Millennials put off buying homes for a very long time, and starting families. Those people have been in peak earning years for a bit now, but are just now starting to settle down. Gen Z coming up behind them will compound that. Millennials “failure to launch” has caused a sort of “super demographic” in terms of spending which will play out over the next decade or more. \n\nStarter homes: There has been a criminal under supply of starter homes being built over the past 30 years. This has caused existing home to jump, you are correct, but the rising interest rates will only slow the growth of existing home sales. Eventually manufacturers will see the $$$ in the demand for starter homes and that trend will pick up again. Building newer but smaller square footage properties. However this doesn’t happen overnight. Also with inflation driving raw materials higher, this may take some time for the money to be right. \n\nInflation: Inflation and higher borrowing costs will also drive some retired people back into the workforce. It is already happening.\n\nInterest rates: true there is generally an inverse relationship between increase in housing prices and interest rates. If people can’t afford the monthly payments on the average home, sellers will lower prices to make the sale. However this isn’t absolute. Someone who sells their home also has to either buy a other or rent from someone. Rental rates are also skyrocketing, which makes that choice more difficult. If I refinanced my house at 3% to take out my equity, and I have to lower the price just a bit to sell it, and then I either have to get a new loan for 5.5% or pay rent much higher than I was paying on my low rate mortgage, I’ll probably just sit there and not sell. \n\n\nI think what we are seeing is just the tail end of people trying to cash out high. Eventually either rates will come back down, or houses will come off the market. People will decide to stay where they are until they are sure they can 1) sell for enough to cover their costs of moving and buying a new place or 2) can sell for enough and are sure they can get a rental that makes sense.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "I like the way you're trying to explain the madness that has occurred over the last 2-3 years logically.

(To be fair, a lot of *his* followers [are bots](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9lbG9uLW11c2tzLWJvdC1wcm9ibGVtLW9uLXR3aXR0ZXItaXMtZXh0cmFvcmRpbmFyeS0xMTY1NDQyNjgwMD9tb2Q9aHBfbGlzdGFfcG9zNA/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB69c9827b).) He floated the idea that he could walk away from the deal because Twitter was lying about the spam bots.\n\nTo a non-lawyer I suppose this looked like a good pretext, but it was not. It was not for at least three reasons:\n\n1. Musk had not a shred — not even the tiniest bit — of evidence that Twitter’s estimates are wrong, and it [seems very likely](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5jb20vMjAyMi9tdXNrLXR3aXR0ZXItYW5kLWJvdHMtYm90LWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtYm90LXNjaWVuY2Uv/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB18835419) that they are right.\\[1\\]\n2. Even if Twitter’s estimates are wrong, Musk could not get out of the merger agreement unless the error was likely to have a “material adverse effect” on Twitter’s business, and it absolutely would not.\n3. Musk has been talking about Twitter’s bot problem forever, and in fact he originally said that he wanted to buy Twitter *in order to* fix the bot problem, so no one could possibly believe him when he said that he wanted to walk away from the deal because he just discovered that Twitter has a bot problem.\n\n...\n\nWell. I guess he set his lawyers — led by Mike Ringler of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP — to work finding a pretext that they could stomach. And they found one, and today they filed it with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, in the form of [a letter to Twitter threatening to call off the deal](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE0MTgwOTEvMDAwMTEwNDY1OTIyMDY4MzQ3L3RtMjIxNzc2MWQxX2V4OTktby5odG0/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB40cca94c).\n\nTheir pretext is sort of the lawyer version of Musk’s pretext. The problem, say the lawyers, is not that Twitter has too many spam bots. The problem is that, when Musk asks for *information* about the spam bots, Twitter doesn’t give him the information he wants. From their letter:\n\n>Twitter has, in fact, refused to provide the information that Mr. Musk has repeatedly requested since May 9, 2022 to facilitate his evaluation of spam and fake accounts on the company’s platform. Twitter’s latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company’s own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr. Musk’s data requests. Twitter’s effort to characterize it otherwise is merely an attempt to obfuscate and confuse the issue. Mr. Musk has made it clear that he does not believe the company’s lax testing methodologies are adequate so he must conduct his own analysis. The data he has requested is necessary to do so.\n\n...\n\nAgain, I don’t know exactly what he’s asking for, but in general I can understand why Twitter would be nervous about sharing user data with Musk. For one thing, there are all sorts of regulatory and risk reasons to be nervous about sharing user data with someone who, for now at least, does not work at Twitter. For another thing, Musk has been publicly trolling Twitter about the bot problem, and about everything else, for weeks now, and there’s no reason to think he would be particularly responsible with *this* information. His lawyers write:\n\n>Mr. Musk will of course comply with the restrictions provided under Section 6.4, including by ensuring that anyone reviewing the data is bound by a non-disclosure agreement, and Mr. Musk will not retain or otherwise use any competitively sensitive information if the transaction is not consummated.\n\nBut this is not much comfort, because Musk has constantly ignored the restrictions of the merger agreement, including by [tweeting disparaging things](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMjcvYmlsbC1od2FuZy1hcnJlc3QtaW5zaWRlLXRoZS12aWNpb3VzLWN5Y2xlLW9mLWFyY2hlZ29zLWNvbGxhcHNlP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA2MDYyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDYwNiZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bCb47860cf) about Twitter. He himself has [boasted publicly](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9lbG9ubXVzay9zdGF0dXMvMTUyNTYxNTg0OTE2NzU4OTM4MA/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB85ee1a5d) that he violated a non-disclosure agreement with Twitter by tweeting about Twitter’s bot methodology!\\[7\\] If you give him sensitive user data he is just absolutely going to tweet about it, and trusting his promises not to would be dumb. And if he does break his promises, what can Twitter do? Sue him to call off the deal? Twitter doesn’t want to call off the deal. Musk does!\n\n...\n\nI mean, to be clear, it isn’t a *good* pretext. It is, for instance, very hard to imagine that Musk’s banks are clamoring for detailed information about spam accounts to line up their financing; Twitter has raised debt financing in the past with its existing bot disclosure. Nor is it clear what Musk’s “reasonable business purpose related to the consummation of the transactions” is. And because it is so clearly part of Musk’s broader trolling operation, it is hard to imagine him *winning* if this ends up in court: If he refuses to close because Twitter won’t humor his bot-fishing expedition, it seems unlikely that a Delaware court will side with him. But it does raise the *risk* for Twitter, which gives him a bit more leverage to try to renegotiate the price. It is all going to get so much dumber.\n\nIn other Twitter M&A news, on Friday the deal [cleared US antitrust review](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE0MTgwOTEvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTIyMTY3MzExL2QzNDY1MjJkZGVmYTE0YS5odG0/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB0793fdac)with no problems. One possibility is that Musk will keep sending nasty letters and tweets about bots, and the people — including the ones working for him — whose job it is to get the deal done will keep working to get the deal done, and one day Musk will be mid-sentence typing a nasty tweet about Twitter and find out that he owns it.\"", "id": "v76t3j", "created_utc": 1654633935.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|159|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v76t3j)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v76t3j)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "These reports are really, really cool.

Add on top of that the hedge funds and banks rehypothicating and buying shares on margin to the point that more than half the “money” in the market is borrowed and a lot of it has no collateral. Small business and the middle class have been ruined by corporatism in the government as both taxes and the inflation cpi rise simultaneously with no end in sight. Work force participation is still lower than before covid lockdowns hit, and jerome powell isnt man enough to do a rug pull and jack the fed rate. I’d assume part of that has to do with the fact that if we crash, we cant lower the rate of the fed again to save us. Now add the fact that pulling russia out of swyft meant the rest of the world couldnt buy all russias commodities with us treasuries and we stand a serious chance of losing the world’s reserve currency (meaning our t bills and money isnt always exchangeable elsewhere in the world). Even opec wont drill more oil for us because we’ve sent them so many pallets of cash they dont even want more of our money at the same time the rest of the world is reducing their stockpile of t bills. Thats pretty important because a huge part of our gdp is in our banking services, specifically the part where we profit from the rest of the world using our banks. If that happens, our gdp will basically consist of missile sales and big pharma which are pretty much entirely reliant on taxpayer money and corporatist handouts anyway. If the reserve currency is lost, printing money wont be much of an option anymore either since the freshly printed money cant buy actual things other places in the world. The economy as it stands is a house of cards supported by the government giving away tax money to businesses to give the perception that they arent failing to turn a profit and the fed lending out printed money at pretty much 0% with no risk just so our companies can keep the lights on and keep people employed. Now add supply chain issues because russia is like 90% of the world’s neon supply to make microchips (needed as a shielding gas for welding them with lasers) and 42% or so of the worlds catalytic metals like platinum and palladium which are needed in huge quantities in aerospace, military industrial, and for satellites. All of those things just got a lot more expensive and our government buys a loooot of that crap.
