Critically, and contrary to popular conception, an index fund does not automatically buy more of a security simply because it has gone up in price, given that it already holds that security. But if the fund takes in new money, then that will go into securities according to their shifting size, and that can in theory disproportionately benefit stocks that are already on the up.\n\n>For instance, over the past four decades, on average 14 cents of every new dollar put into the Vanguard 500 fund or State Street’s SPDR would have gone into the five biggest companies. A decade ago it was closer to 10 cents. Today, it is over 20 cents—the highest on record. Although those bigger companies are, well, bigger, those extra cents can have a disproportional market impact, according to a 2020 study. In other words, size can beget size, a dynamic that could contribute to the tendency of financial markets toward bubbles, according to critics.\n\nthe 2020 study is “Tracking Biased Weights: Asset Pricing Implications of Value-Weighted Indexing,” by Hao Jiang, Dimitri Vayanos, and Lu Zheng. https://www.nber.org/papers/w28253\n\nthe study's summary states:\n\n>We show theoretically and empirically that flows into index funds raise the prices of large stocks in the index disproportionately more than the prices of small stocks.\n\nyou can potentially avoid this problem by investing in things that are not cap weighted for at least part of your portfolio. for example, SPYD takes 80 higher dividend stocks from the S&P 500 and weights them equally at 1.5% of the portfolio, then adjusts 2x a year IIRC. a stock might go up to 1.8% or down to 1.1%, but no one company will dominate SPYD with 5-6% like Apple or Microsoft. and SPYD is doing better this year than the S&P 500 because it organizes the stocks differently and isn't subject to the major run-up of the last few years.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for this", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is the phenomenon where when a company gets added to sp500, sp400 or sp600 they go up.

But in practice, a seller has to expend capital for price changes, for reasons such as, updating their menus with new prices. Some of those additional practical costs are passed on to consumers in increased pricing.  So in practice, either inflation or deflation, add additional costs to everyone, just to do business. \n\nTo minimize those additional costs, the total amount of money should change, so it stays relatively similar to any changes in total value of transactions occurring in the economy.

If the economy is growing, i.e. more goods and services are being exchanged than previously were, then you could print money at a positive rate that is less than the positive rate of growth of the economy, and end up adding to the money supply while simultaneously creating deflation.\n\nInflation/deflation effectively measure the difference between rate of change in economy size, against rate of change of money supply. Assumedly the economy will continue to increase over time as population grows, because more population means more transactions. So to take a macroeconomic view of things, to keep the value of the money the same over time, we would need to keep printing money over time. However on the micro scale, we    have to first measure what is happening in the economy, before we can change our monetary policy to reflect, so changes to the rate of printing money always lag behind the changes to the economy itself.

This is why very few people in Denmark want to pursue engineering careers. When we want to hire experienced engineers, we usually have to find someone from abroad.

If your money is worth less tomorrow it encourages you to spend today and not save for tomorrow. More spending means profits for business means growth means higher wages the whole uptick cycle.\n\nWhy not strive for 0 inflation? Because the human psychology generally strives for progress be it in wages standard of living and goods. If you want more, you’ll try to work harder or be more efficient.

The only reason we do... anything... is because we get more out of it than we put in.\n\nSo even with a stable population, the economy should keep growing. This means that even with a completely static money supply and a birth rate of precisely one birth for every death, the value of things will change. Of course with a growing economy, this perfectly stable population will end up making and buying more stuff. The supply of some things might go down, leading its price to go up. (See e.g. lumber; oil.) Or we might figure out how to make more of something, more easily and cheaply, and its price might go down. (See e.g. computers, televisions; oil.) Even with a perfectly static money supply things will constantly change. And of course there can be supply shocks (a forest fire burns down half the lumber supply, or a bacterial infection could shut down a manufacturer of baby formula) and demand shocks (everyone who's cool has to follow the trend of filling their houses with tulips... for one summer).\n\nThis means that with a static money supply, you can get inflation, *and* you can get deflation. Deflation is devious, and really damages economies. I understand we used to have deflationary recessions and depressions fairly regularly, in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A number of factors combined to get us out of that cycle, including the massive fiscal stimulus effect of WW2, massive population growth, the rise of the use of household debt to fuel economic activity, the rise of antibiotics and modern medicine which improved productivity, the rise of computers which *massively* improved productivity and importantly, moving away from a static money supply to fiat currency. This basically meant that we could still be subject to inflation, but would not be stricken by deflation. (And yes that's a wildly huge oversimplification but, for purposes of inflation talk, true.)\n\nDeflation is bad, but a little inflation is okay! It can even be healthy, especially in a country with lots of growth and the steady increase of debt. But, you have to manage it. There are still freak things that occur and the growth of population, technology, productivity, etc. cannot be perfectly predicted. Economic shocks can lead to stagflation, where prices inexplicably keep rising even when people's ability to pay those prices does not. (The 1970s, yeah, but also real estate in the 2010s?) You can somehow also end up with de facto deflation, which is a bit weird and scary when you think about it.\n\nEconomists are not perfect but they try to learn from these things and we try to keep this big unwieldy ship on an even keel. Because, at the end of the day, you gotta look at the big picture of why we're even talking about this stuff. What's the point? I think it's something like, create economic and political circumstances in which people can grow up and live their lives and determine who they want to be and what they want to do. Not just for a select few, but for as many people as possible. And for that you need 1) basic rule of law, and 2) a basic functioning economy. \"If it all burns so be it\" is fine and dandy for someone who has grown up with all manner of options and a bunch of nice stuff. But it's not so great for the next generation to hear maybe they shouldn't get to have what you had.

{"title": "High Oil Price Causes Inflation? Use the regression to forecast CPI", "selftext": "  As title, the view that hiking oil prices causes high inflation is frequently heard, so I did research on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0t8m2bwohd491.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5504bb865f997fa65ea1db920c099d5fbfb25afc\n\nFirst, energy indeed was the highest YoY item, especially fuel oil was higher than 80%. However, if we look at relative importance, shares of energy service + energy commodities were lower than 10%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2evzv7rhd491.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f7f81d860c1e33c7bfd2793b13f3aa2db4a84a2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0r0ycdeuhd491.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e7315cef0bc81115bc5dfb5fd891f615e93fff9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f1mlajcshd491.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69a5206669beaa4076063fe8ab13b6a3b3ca8116\n\nHere's another common view: oil price not only influences these items but also costs many products/services. Plus, I often hear that oil price is highly correlated with CPI. That's why I'd like to run a regression.\n\nData: WTI spot price and CPI index. First, I used the data since 1947. The correlation is high: 84%. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xp6bi4p2id491.jpg?width=627&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8c01076e033e2094ae328c1f318092f786f0787\n\nHowever, the problems are:\n\n1. Regime Change: percent of oil to disposable income or interest rates were different in different periods. \n\n2. CPI YoY forecast of this time interval is as high as 17.9%, apparently deviating from the reality.\n\nInstead, I used data since 2020/04. Although the sample is much fewer, the regime is closer to now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a772uwi4id491.jpg?width=664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd366a8844451ba8cadf10dcf995def7e75cb65e\n\nThe mean forecast of 7.85% is closer to the mainstream forecast of 8.3%. When analyzing statistics, we make confidence intervals as well. Based on most common 95%, same as mainstream.\n\nConclusion: From statistical results, tomorrow's CPI is less likely to be higher than the common forecast of 8.3%. (of course, regression has its limits).\n\nLike today’s post? Click upvote!

It’s repeatedly mentioned in the Quran. I’m not sure if you are taking a tone of surprise, or if you think I’m randomly making stuff this up.\n\nLet’s see what the Quran says about interest...\n\n“Those who benefit from interest shall be raised like those who have been driven to madness by the touch of the Devil. They have claimed: ‘Charging interest is just another form of trading,’ but God has permitted trade, and forbidden interest. Hence, those who have been warned by their Lord and stop charging interest may keep their previous gains, their case being entrusted to God. But those who revert shall live among the flames, and shall remain there for eternity.” — Surah al-Baqarah, verse 275\n\n“And for those who charge interest even though this has been forbidden, they have wrongfully taken other people’s property. For these people who have rejected faith, we have prepared a terrible punishment.” Surah al-Nisa’, verse 161\n\n“O’ you believers, do not eat up the amounts acquired through Riba (interest), doubled and multiplied. Fear God, so that you may be successful, and fear the fire that has been prepared for the disbelievers. Obey God and the Messenger (Prophet Muhammed), so that you may be blessed.” — Surah Al’Imran verses 130-132\n\nFurthermore, the Islamic prophet Muhammed spoke out against Riba numerous times in the Hadith. The Hadith is not part of the Quran, it is a collection of sayings by Muhammed during his lifetime. It is regarded as very important to Muslims.\n\n“There are seventy grades of severity of riba (charging interest.) The **least** serious of these offenses is as serious as a man committing adultery **with his own mother**.” (Ibn Majah)\n\n“God would be justified in not allowing four types of people to enter heaven or experience its blessings: habitual alcohol drinkers, those who take riba (charge interest), those who take an orphan’s property unjustly, and those who are undutiful to their parents.” (Mustadrak al-Hakim, Kitab al-Buyu’)\n\nFrom Jabir: “Cursed be the receiver and payer of interest, the man who records the debt, and the two witnesses to the agreement. They are all equally guilty of riba.” (Muslim, Kitab al-Musaqat)\n\n“One dirham (unit of money, think of it like one dollar) of riba which a man receives knowingly, is worse than committing adultery thirty-six times.” — Jiabir ibn ‘Abdallah, reporting on Muhammed’s Farewell Pilgramage\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are just a few small snippets.
