We're going see slowing global growth and higher inflationary pressures for a couple of years which will be painful for both individuals and businesses, but given we have low unemployment levels and relatively healthy balance sheets the chances of a GFC-sized systemic failure in the economy appears low for the time being.\n\nThat said, I think there is a much greater potential for the market to be hit far worse than the economy this time. For years financial assets have seen returns far in excess of the rate of underlying economic growth. This was largely due to supportive monetary policy and a historically low inflationary environment. We still have some ways to go just to revert back to historical valuation averages and interest rates. When you couple this with the potential for a mean reversion in asset valuations coupled with slower economic growth, declining corporate profits and little to no monetary policy support it's easy to see how markets could go much lower from here. And I think what makes this time unique is that this could happen without a significant rise in unemployment.\n\nSo right now, no it's not worse than the GFC and it probably won't be as bad for the average person, but for those who own large amounts of financial assets it could get much worse.

I don't totally understand how the transparency of this works, because I've followed the JPM, wells Fargo earnings last quarter. I guess they would just shut the fuck up and not say anything to investors/analysts about any suspect Long-Term Capital Management/Archegos type counterparty deals they've made.\n\nAll the core, mature S&P 500 companies look like they're in good shape going by their financials/balance sheets. So the giants are still growing, and even if their growth stops or goes negative, they have the cash to weather potentially multiple bad years (the giants like Microsoft, Apple) will be completely fine.\n\nHOWEVER, they will still probably shed tons of workers. If Microsoft has like 60B cash, they're not going to spend it all and then start firing, that's not how it works.\n\nThe Microsoft layoffs has a lot of implications for different parts of tech. The remote connectivity/conferencing/workplace productivity can probably be extrapolated to lots of layoffs in these zero moat newer high-growth companies like Atlassian, Asana, Monday, Docusign etc.\n\nA lot of tech in luxury/discretionary enterprise software, or entertainment tech like streaming/Netflix/Roku, funcoin, and travel/airlines are also waiting for layoffs to be forced on them. And all manner of the discretionary Peloton type companies.\n\nThat causes the domino affect with further layoffs in finance/banking. People get poorer, lose their jobs - a lot of mortgage/loan departments in the big institutions are getting axed literally right now, headcounts have to drop as loans go bad.\n\nI think auto is vulnerable too - when I see the chip supply shortage, this is kind of a prelude to them possibly overcorrecting. That can drop the price in the used car market which I would think very likely is going to see a surge in buying vs. the new car market. Either way it's a zero-sum game between car manufacturers, used car auction Carmax/Carvana/Vroom/Kar, and ride-share, so there will be loss of either manufacturing jobs or tech/gig workers.\n\nSo if you think of this panopoly of tech -> > airlines -> across-the-board discretionary -> advertising and adtech -> finance/banking -> obvious layoffs waiting to happen, maybe auto and multiple other industries too, would total unemployment claims hit say 1.5M, vs the 200k now? That could be extremely softballing it. Could it be 2M or 3M? We're at stone bottom nadir in unemployment - this is cyclical in recessions, who knows what the peak will be before we can start experiencing recovery.\n\nBut unemployment will rise and help temper inflation and break the wage-price spiral, with the rate hikes, but who knows how long the recession will last. The 2008 GFC ended because of a decade-long easing cycle. In 2020 the unemployment dropped from \\~14%-15% strictly because of easing/PPP loans/direct stimulus checks propping up demand/spending. This one will not allow for it because inflation will flare up as soon as they bring down rates. So we're going to be forced to see how bad unemployment can get without monetary policy interfering.\n\nSo the 'average length of recession being 15 months' fact being bandied about is really impacted by the Fed's interference in 2008 and 2020. It's not a real reference point, if the Fed can't initiate another big easing cycle a year or so down the line without agitating inflation. I think without it it can be a lot worse than what we're thinking.
