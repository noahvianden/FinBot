{"title": "A history-based advice to new (or over-confident) investors", "selftext": "I know still quite some people (particularly new investors) are itching to get into the market to buy the dip/bottom. We also see advice from people with enticing lines [like this](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/u-s-stock-crash-is-huge-opportunity-to-cash-in-top-investor/ar-AAYAx9J): \"U.S. stock crash could present Americans with a \"monstrous\" opportunity when looking at the economy from a long-term perspective\".\n\nNow my advice is: Don't listen to them. Instead, what you should do is two things: 1. Be patient. 2. Wait for clarity in economy and fiscal policies. Then you put your money into the market. Yes, you might miss the bottom, but you would avoid a lot of pain.\n\nIf you don't believe me, at least believe the history. In the last 22 years, Nasdaq pulled back 35% three times before this year:\n\n1. 2000. Nasdaq peaked at 5132 in early March 2000, dived 40%+ the next 2.5 months. If you had bought in then like you're considering now, even if you bought exactly at the local bottom, you'd be looking at another nearly 2.5 years of pain with a further 63% loss from your purchase before Nasdaq finally bottomed. But if you had just waited for clarity, even if you missed the bottom by 3 months, you would still be up 678% from your purchase point to now! Had you bought when Nasdaq was 40% down, your gain over the same period was 255% (edit: it's not the same period, it's actually almost 2.5 years longer with less return). Yes, a big difference.\n2. 2008. Nasdaq peaked at 2862 in Oct 2007, dived 25% the next 5 months. If you had bought in then at the local bottom, you'd be looking at another 1 year of pain with a further 41% loss from your purchase before Nasdaq finally bottomed. But if you waited for clarity and missed the bottom by 3 months, you would still be up 484% from your purchase point to now! Had you bought when Nasdaq dropped to local bottom after 5 months and 25%, your gain over the same period was 401% (edit: it's not the same period, it's actually 1 year longer but with less return), still not as good as when you had waited.\n3. 2020. Nasdaq bottomed after just a month and 35% drop. If you bought exactly at the bottom vs 3 months later, then you'd gain 62% vs 9%. This time buying the bottom won because: 1. We assumed you actually bought at the bottom. 2. We assumed that the alternative is that you missed bottom by 3 months long. 3. Most importantly, 2020 was so different than the other 3 times, namely 2000, 2008 and 2022, because in 2020 the global governments all went super easy on fiscal policies, flooding the market with liquidity, which caused the problem now. 2020 was an aberration that has less historical parallel or usefulness as a lesson.\n\nSo clearly I'm arguing again for my rules based on both reasoning and historical support:\n\n1. Be patient.\n2. Wait for clarity in economy and fiscal/monetary policies. If you watch news and sentiments, you probably can see it less than 3 months post bottom and catch most of the gains.\n3. Then you put your money into the market.\n\nThat's it. You'll make good/better money without having to endure the stress and pain for months or years first. Follow my rules and you'll thank me later. :)\n\nYes you can argue for DCA, but that's not the active investing we're talking about here. And DCA would still have been in for a long period of pain in 2000 and 2008 with quite likely a worse return.\n\nEdit: How to watch out for clarity? If you're not experienced, just watch the Feds and the market. When they pivot on their stance to clearly more dovish, it will help the economy and the stock market. They won't pivot unless there's clear signs that the worst inflation is over. Yes - economy could've been hurt then, and quite likely so. But stock market is forward looking and will react. The local bottom before the dovish fiscal policy will quite possibly be the actual bottom. Of course there's no fail safe method to absolutely catch the bottom - but it's surely better than buying too much earlier than the bottom!\n\nFurther edit: Since so many mentioned \"you don't time the market\" or \"what if you missed gains\" as they didn't notice my replies in comments, I'll explain here:\n\n1. Every pro times the market and they should. You don't believe that, you've been played. For example, Buffett says he doesn't time the market. He lied. He doesn't like cash yet he's accumulating cash before recessions - investing afterward. He called it value investing but his adjustments to cash% were timing the market based on valuation. Pelosi and the Feds were even timing the market LOL. Plenty of retail investors adjust their portfolio to dodge the market turbulence too. It's all timing. I'm just advocating timing based on improvements in economy and fiscal policies.\n2. It's fine to miss gains when you try to avoid loss. What's worse? Losing principal or missing gains? If you don't know the answer to this, you shouldn't be actively investing. In the examples in my OP, I also used missing the bottom by 3 months as the example, which means in 2000 and 2008 you would've missed 17% and 41% of gains already but you'd still come out ahead. For those people who just trust DCA more, I already stated - it's not the best active investing strategy. It's NOT even active investing. And DCA in 2000 and 2008 would've been in for long periods of pain with likely worse return anyhow unless your DCA timed the bottom relatively well. Otherwise your DCA could run out of money much earlier than the bottom - which is 2000 and 2008's cases were at least a year away - and generate a worse return. If you design your DCA based on when market might possibly bottom - Aha! You're timing the market, your DCA is now an oxymoron! LOL\n\nLast Edit: To the DCA fans that can still think: Listen, let's first make it clear (if any of you couldn't figure it out from my post above already), my advice is clearly talking about the cash you saved and is ready for invest right now. I advocate for holding for clarity as I think that would beat the market - as I said above, in the previous instances, the strategy did beat the market. But of course DCA fans say DCA now, it's the only way to earn money in some people's eyes. So a few simple points for your consideration:\n\n1. DCA works not as good as just invest everything you have in a bull market. I hope I don't need to explain the simple math here. My advice beats DCA since it attempts to dodge the bear market and just let money ride the bulls market or up-n-down market fluctuations.\n2. In a fluctuating market, depending on the fluctuation and your DCA frequency, DCA could be a bit ahead or behind market. So my advice is as good as DCA in this case.\n3. Finally let's consider bear market. First, you couldn't have been timing the market to do your DCA, otherwise you defiled your own principal and sabotaged your argument. So assuming at or near the peak of the market, you had $10K, based on your principal of not timing the market, you must have started DCA already and DCA-ed your way down. So how did you do your DCA? Don't tell me you've DCAed in your 401K, that's irrelevant as, again, my advice is about the cash ready to be invested NOW - In comment below for 401K I advocated people continuously put money in there. So let's say you DCA the $10K in 4 batches every month. Then starting from near the peak in Nov. 2021, you already ran out of the $10K and are now down 20% for Nasdaq or 12% for S&P. I pulled out of the market late Sept and the cash is earning 0%, easily beating DCA. So let's say you DCA the $10K in 10 batches, my question is: how do you know that would beat my advice when my cash is around 12-20% ahead of you already? If market bounces back slowly, it'd take a while for you to even break even. Even if I miss the bottom, I beat your DCA easily. To beat my advice, you need to time your DCA to the downturn length well to be able to beat people trying to time the market - and using the methods I said above, this simple timing has a better winning chance than blindly DCA because most of the DCA plans are already down and might continue to lag further behind cash.\n\nOK enough about DCA. For the CFA that trashed my post: I'm sorry but please don't make CFA sound like a special qualification. I've used 3 CFAs over the last 10 years, they all were significantly behind my own management of my brokerage account, one lagged far behind the bull market, another was still behind my own managing, and the last one lost significant amount of money during 2017-2018, mostly during the near-bear market in 2018. CFAs lose money too and a lot of them give bad advice. The CFA title alone does not give your any special power in any debate about investing, if not making it worse. HF managers are stronger than CFAs in investing and they lag the market.\n\nFinally - no one's forcing you to take the advice, and I have yet to see anyone providing a concrete argument against my advice. Saying DCA without details means nothing - because as I detailed above, how and when you DCA make a huge difference, so you essentially still have to time the market - again, an oxymoron of a method.\n\nI won't waste more time preaching to deaf ears. People could have earned 44% in the last month listening to my advice that I posted for the first time on r/stocks (I only posted on that stock's own subreddit before because I know how biased people are and didn't want to post here unless I was quite sure of the short term actions, and I was totally right) instead of losing 7% with Nasdaq or S&P over the past month. But well, people chose not to listen. I guess there're just too many people too arrogant for their own good on this subreddit. I'll stop posting here. This post won't make me any money and my time spent here is purely for people's own good, but was met with some ridiculous detraction.

It's an extremely stupid argument you're raising. I only started using Reddit since a year ago, so based on your logic, I was probably only born a few year ago LOL. I posted only about Luckin Coffee because I already stated in many threads and comments - it's the one I spent the most time studying and the most comfortable with recommending. I simply don't recommend stocks that I don't know pretty much inside and out to friends or internet. It is a big problem on the internet that idiots pretend to know shit about many stocks when they don't. Even FAANG stocks drop 20% post a quarterly report because it blindsides you. Yet Luckin Coffee I was able to predict its first profitable quarter ever (using the same method Muddy Waters discovered its fraud 2 years ago - checking multiple Luckin shops' sales in multiple cities through volunteer network) AND I [wrote on Reddit 4 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uw0mqz/luckin_coffee_analysis_business_comparisons_big/) to get people to take advantage of the event.

You clearly don't know investing by even raising this point. Hedge funds are paid for actively managing your money. They're paid whether they lose your money or not! You put your hard earned $ into them, they'll put them into the market whether they have a bigger chance of losing money or not. They would've put the money all in had you given them the money in Dec. and lose 40% for you. Tiger Global and others already did! Even ETFs like ARKK did. Their strategy do not involve \"do not lose principal. If it means waiting for months, let's wait\". The advice I had given also is very specifically for a severe downturn, or Nasdaq 35% was used as example. HFs do not plan their trading on such extreme events that only happened every 5-10 years! Your argument is both ignorant and extremely stupid because you're basically saying: If an advice for retail investors cannot be adopted by HFs, then it must be wrong. How stupid is that?

This downturn could last another 0.5 - 1 year at least. So I'd say if you have a pile saved up, you put it in several batches, and do it every 2-3 months so it lasts over a year (or put in a bit less in the batch at the beginning and more afterward - hence the weight). When clarity shows after a (local) bottom - which quite likely could be the actual bottom, put the rest in quickly - don't DCA then. \n4.

It's being sensible about valuation and not pouring your money into a company just because you like it. You either wait for your entry point in order to have a shot at getting the rate of return you're looking for or you don't buy at all. You don't try to time bottoms.\n\nWhen people talk about trying to time the market, they precisely talk about that, though. They talk about trying to time a bottom or getting in and out of positions because you think they will continue to fall in the short-term in hopes of getting a better entry. Those people don't have an entry point they deemed good. They act based on feeling or hopes that the price could go lower, which may well see them miss out despite the price being good enough. That's not happening if you have an entry point and you stick to it.\n\nAs for ETFs, I think it's a bit different. Of course you can still say you wait, but it's considerably more difficult to value entire ETFs and come up with an entry point. And if that's your first/only position, you're also running at the risk of missing out considerably. If you looked at the index on May 2020, when it was recovering from the crash, chances are you would have said that it's trading historically rich despite the situation, and you wouldn't have got in. You would have missed out on a run up by more than 50% and a gain of 20% even after the recent decline.\n\nThis is why in this situation I believe that DCA is generally a good idea, and that's historically backed.

So far, there are also few signs that they're actually starting to improve cost of revenue. They were still posting a negative GROSS PROFIT for the full year 2021.\n\nDid you even look at their financial statements? You claim that risk for stock dilution is low, but they've literally diluted by more than 800% in 2020, by almost 180% in 2021. Share-based compensation was $32 million in 2021, it's  $43 million in the ttm. Dilution is happening as we speak. It's also a common misconception that a company isn't gonna dilute further just because they aren't at imminent risk of going bancrupt tomorrow.

I will actually have them turn break even at 2024. Analyst estimates beyond that are a bit wonky but I will have them turn a profit afterwards. I'll also use consensus estimates for this one. After breaking even, I will have them net a 2.5% profit margin in the first year, then a 4%. Assuming a P/E of 30 (which, granted, if they manage to actually grow at that level 30 is probably quite a bit too low) and our discount rate we get a $2.20 stock now. If we assume 60 here, then sure, it's about a buy at price.\n\nIn the end, a lot rides on assumptions that are difficult to make at this point, but for a conservative investor looking for sustantial upside in a high-risk gamble like this, you absolutely can make a case for an entry price around $2.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your input!

Within the next 5 years, I think they'll get to $50 billion (at least) at which point they'll earn 4% net profit margins, resulting in a $2 billion annual net profit. The current market cap is $3 billion.\n\n\\--\n\nEdit: The other thing people commonly misunderstand is how it's physically possible to decide to pay below-market, since buying a house is competitive, right? The answer is because they're not buying already-listed homes competing against other buyers. They buy homes by people going to [www.opendoor.com](https://www.opendoor.com), typically before the house is sale-ready, putting in their address, and within 5 minutes they have an automated initial offer (try it out!). Turning it into a real cash offer takes a 20-minute Zoom call. The seller then compares this concrete offer from Opendoor which takes no extra work (appointing an agent, cleaning the house, making repairs, showing the house, etc) with the uncertain prospect of listing where both time to sell and final sale price are uncertain. There's value in that certainty, speed, and convenience, which is why Opendoor has a real and unique value proposition.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I am absolutely getting recked by this company.

I am sharing mine below.\n\n(W1 = 1 Week candlestick timeframe)\n\nMy strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks - W1 SMA(200) (blue on the picture) and min/max price from last 200 weeks - W1 MIN(200), W1 MAX(200) (both yellow on the picture). All these indicators are used for is to determine ultra conservatively what is the \"cheap\" price.\nYou can see them in the picture: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/ynHSQyQ8/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ynHSQyQ8/)\nAdd up new investment money every 6 months - as much as comfortable.\n\nHow to use?\n\n1. Split ur total investment money into 4 equal piles.\n\n2. Invest one pile per crossing critical weekly structure (3 descibed below) - weekly structures are meaningful in moves many years across\n\n3. No matter how much you invested, sell 1/2 of the investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line - after this you can again buy from the initial place - W1 SMA200. You can also choose to sell the half when you are at 80% or more profit (early).\nNotice that you should pick stocks on which you have at least an 80-200% target if the price goes back to the MAX(200).\n\n4. Invest 1 pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line\n\n5. Invest the 1  pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line\n\n6. Invest 2 piles when the price goes under the W1 MIN(200) as far as it is to the MAX(200) from the W1 MIN(200) - orange rectangles used for measurement on the image.\n\n7. Hold 1/2 of the position in profit until you are happy with the profit (up to you, I recommend at least 3 years more after crossing W1 MAX(200) upwards).\n\n\nThis strategy is for investments lasting 3-10 years. Never sell a losing investment!\nIf you stopped liking the stock you invested in fundamentally after you invested, just go with it and try to take profit when the price bounces from one of your buy orders and overall you did profit from the stock.\n\nThis is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:\na) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a few years\nb) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have the balls to ignore them\nc) with this strategy you will rarely get fully out of cash - this may be hard to stand.\n\nThis should be used on assets that are growing forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).\nI really advise buying something that is traded publicly for at least 5 years.\n\nProfits can be reinvested.\n\nIf you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media.

Should have asked Trump to freeze oil prices when Covid hit so they would not drop that  hard. The oil cos shut their drilling operation and refining capacity when demand tanked in 2020-2021. This demand rebound is a perfect opportunity for them to rake in money, before the eventual recession and drop in demand. This problem is going to fix itself. People reduce driving as inflation hits their pockets. Demand of other things drop and shipping costs drop with them, this is temporary pain, not discounting the pain it brings, but throwing money at it or crucifying any administration for it is both counter productive and asinine. You can’t befriend Iran, Venezuela and Russia just because now you need their oil. You need oil above $80 a barrel for US production to be profitable. US oil does not have enough margin to compete with Russia or Saudi Arabia. Fracking isn’t cheap. So there is reason why US capacity to pump oil dropped during Covid and now the oil companies in US are sure this demand will not persist so they are in no rush to increase production capacity. It is not a knob they can dial around. Takes planning and investment that has to make business sense. Covid caused drop in demand, supply was late to catch up, companies lost money. People resume life after Covid, demand increases fast, supply can’t catch up as fast, oil prices increase. Then Russia invades Ukraine and oil supply chains are reworked. This also adds uncertainty and prices shoot up more. Like everything else in this world. Democrats are so doomed and Republican controlled Congress is inevitable, even then why do Oil companies still resisting on investing in capacity to screw over Biden? Because even a republican led congress won’t dictate the demand after this high passes. US oil needs oil to stay high to break even. Not $120, but not $60 either.

Looking for advice on how to manage some trades that turned against me.", "selftext": "I’m always trying to learn, and I’m simply hoping that some of you more experienced traders can help with some ideas and insights on what my options are and what might be the best way to manage these trades I’m trapped in.\n\nMany of you will say that I shouldn’t have sold naked puts on margin. I get it. As they say, \"it works until it doesn’t.” I've learned a valuable and expensive lesson.\n\nTo summarize, I sold some puts on margin, got caught when the market started tanking, rolled out the expiration dates a few times trying to avoid assignment and hoping for a turnaround in the markets… and now I’m stuck with some seriously ITM puts and I’m getting margin maintenance calls each time the stocks fall further south.\n\nHere are the options positions I’m in:\n\n* AAPL: Dec 16, $165 Put (X4)\n* BITO: June 30, $35 put (X1)\n* TNA: Oct 21, $69 Put (X1)\n\nThis portfolio also includes:\n\n* AAPL: 330 shares\n* SPY: 50 shares\n* …and a few others of less significant value.\n\nWhat are some of the options I have to manage this and minimize the pain and losses?\n\n1. I could wait it out, sell calls on the AAPL shares I own, and keep feeding the account with cash and hope things turn around. But that’s unlikely in the timeframe I have on these contracts. Eventually these puts are all most likely going to expire ITM leaving me with a large margin debt balance and I’ll be underwater on all of the shares. I can then try selling calls on the newly acquired shares, using the call premium to pay the margin interest… but that could be a long uphill, losing battle.\n2. I could 'buy to close' the puts now, taking on that expense as margin debt. This would result in less margin debt than the first option of taking assignment of the shares. But I also have to consider that buying to close the contracts leaves me with nothing. I won’t have the underlying shares, so I can’t sell calls or generate any cash from that scenario.\n\nWhat other ideas/options should I consider? How have you managed trades that have gone against you?\n\nLet me know if you have any questions that would help you evaluate the situation.\n\nThanks in advance for any wisdom and advice you can share.\n\n\\----\n\nEDIT to focus on main topic.", "id": "vfgcbq", "created_utc": 1655589361.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "Bro, you have a margin call. You're **already** up shit creek. I can't tell you what to do, but I can tell you what I would do in your position.\n\nIf I were you, I'd get right out of these positions and start over.  Optionally cover 3 of your AAPL puts with your shares.  But that's me.  I would absolutely not take assignment of shares, especially if you have to buy them on margin.\n\nSecond, you seem to have a misunderstanding of theta - you're not and can never \"lose\" theta if you're short an option.  Value will always flow from a buyer to a seller of an option. Read up on intrinsic and extrinsic value of options.  For example AAPL is $131 a share today, but a December $165 put is $35 when. Why 35 when it only provides $34 in value? That is the extrinsic value that will flow to you as the option seller, and you still receive it whether your option is in the money or not.\n\nThird, as is often said around here - you already took this loss every time you rolled forward.  Rolling is closing the current position at a loss, and opening a new position already in the money.

The easiest way to do this is to buy puts at or near the money to match your current short contracts and days to expiration. This will cost you a significant amount, but would limit any further downside. **This will be expensive and could end up losing even more money than you have, but will create a maximum loss.** There are many other hedging options, and I'd encourage you to look at all the options.\n\nIf it were me, I'd just close these out and take your loss, then re-evaluate.

In this season we trace the creation of disinformation from its origins in the American oil industry to the well-oiled machine it is today.\n\nThey have transcripts available for every episode if you prefer reading them, but each episode is really good. The history of dirty tricks and politics and absolutely abhorrent behavior by the petrol companies is even worse than I'd imagined. It's profit ahead of everything, ahead of politics, ahead of health, ahead of the any kind of decency or morals. They are willing to do *anything* to protect their industry.\n\nHere's a bit from [episode 6, where they talk about petrol company's PR taking down people like Ralph Nader](https://www.desmog.com/s3ep6-manipulating-masses-and-predicting-future-edward-bernays-and-w-howard-chase/)\n\n> What companies had to do to fight back against these forces, according to Chase, was to predict which issues might face them in the future and then control social, cultural and policy conditions to ensure that these issues would not become a problem. In 1969, Chase gave what would become a famous speech to the PR Society of America. In it, he said companies needed, quote, managers of the mind, and that’s where PR came in. Instead of trying to sell the public on the idea that a corporation’s values were aligned with their own. Chase argued that PR professionals should be shifting those values to align with corporate interests and that they could do that by shaping culture and public policy. Two years after giving this speech, Chase created the ad that convinced America that packaging waste was the fault of individual consumers and not industry.\n\nI heard about the podcast from another podcast looking at the history and politics of Global Warming called Scene on Radio.

They became the economic powerhouse and military powerhouse for a long time. Their currency was the western world's reserve currency. They had exchanges and everything else we have today without computing or electricity.\n\nInflation, competition, et al. occurred. Their wealth disappeared as did their power. Next was the English. Same shit. World's greatest navy, strongest economy, pound sterling as the reserve currency. Then gone after WW2: Electric Boogaloo.\n\nNow is America's turn. Greatest economic power the world has seen, strongest military, best tech, most pronounced exchange, USD is the world's reserve currency. I know people don't want to hear it or believe it... some may even not believe it's possible. \n\nIt is. The Dutch thought it couldn't happen to them, as did the Brits. It did. Nobody stays in control forever.\n\nNow, let's backpedal to 2008 - the systemic housing crisis. How did they \"fix\" it?\n\nInflation. \n\nWe had around a 5% interest rate as opposed to a 3.84% inflation rate in 2008. For every year past 2008, the annual average inflation rate has increased about 2% whereas the interest rate has decreased with minimal \"hikes\" which have not been even a single percent. What this did was provide an economic environment where there was more money to lend (so average joe can secure a loan for a house or whatever) and incentivized the banks to lend *more* because they *had* to lend more in order to make the same amount of money to years prior. A house of cards built upon debt. Not to mention the government bailouts for these \"too big to fail\" institutions.\n\nTo make things worse, recently the pandemic happened. The global economy nearly ground to a halt. This is very bad for a nation when their currency is the global reserve currency because now people will start calling in \"bets\" on your currency - and if your economy is in the shitter - things go from bad to worse.\n\nThat is what the current economic environment of America is currently - a house of cards built upon debt that was caused by over lending/over borrowing and was triaged by inflation. We had the chance to default - which would've hurt our credit rating and fucked our shit up for a little while - but we wouldn't be where we are now: Sprinting towards a sheer cliffside with no more road in front of us to run on.\n\nThat is what I mean by \"kick the can down the road\" and \"put band aids\". Delaying the inevitable via inflation.\n\nConsequently, that's what both the Dutch and the English did before they lost control of the global economic reigns.\n\nSatisfied?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "ohh yes thanks ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "In my opinion, we will drop more at the end of Q3, and all Q4 , inflation will rise, and prices will soar.
