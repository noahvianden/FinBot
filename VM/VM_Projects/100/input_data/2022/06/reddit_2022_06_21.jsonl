{"title": "Here’s why Larry Summers wants 10 million people to lose their jobs", "selftext": " Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers says there needs to be a surge in unemployment to curb inflation, which Federal Reserve policy makers say doesn’t need to happen for price growth to cool off. According to Bloomberg News, Summers said in a speech on Monday from London that there needs to be a lasting period of higher unemployment to contain inflation — a one-year spike to 10%, two years of 7.5% unemployment or five years of 6% unemployment. Put a different way, Summers is calling for the unemployed rolls to swell to roughly 16 million from just under 6 million in May.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he spoke with Summers on Monday, with Biden — echoing his Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, the former Fed chief — maintaining that a U.S. recession can be avoided. The way Summers framed the numbers suggests he’s talking about what’s known as the Sacrifice Ratio, which is the link between unemployment and inflation.\n\nAccording to Jason Furman, the former chair of President Obama’s Council of Economics Advisers, the Sacrifice Ratio in the 25 years before the pandemic has been six percentage points — meaning one year of a six-percentage-point jump in unemployment or two years of a three-percentage-point increase in the jobless rate would be required to knock down inflation by a full percentage point. \n\nIn May, the unemployment rate was 3.6%. What Summers is basically saying is he wants the unemployment rate to rise to a level that would knock a full percentage point off inflation. The Fed-favored core PCE price index cooled to 4.9% on a year-over-year basis in April. \n\nCurrent Federal Reserve officials don’t accept that there needs to be such a stark trade-off. The Fed’s forecasts call for the unemployment rate to rise to 4.1% next year in a way that would cool core inflation to 2.3%. Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, said the trade-off was less between inflation and unemployment than between inflation and job openings. \n\nJerome Powell, the Fed chair, also said such a stark trade-off wasn’t needed. “Take for example in the labor market, so you have two job vacancies essentially for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating. You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level and you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that’s consistent with 2% inflation,” Powell said at the last post-Fed-meeting press conference.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-larry-summers-wants-10-million-people-to-lose-their-job-11655800397?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-larry-summers-wants-10-million-people-to-lose-their-job-11655800397?mod=home-page)", "id": "vhf9sb", "created_utc": 1655823492.0, "score": 281, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 289, "comments": [{"body": "Well, Baby Boomers are still retiring at a rate of 10K PER DAY, but if Mr. Summers thinks that unemployment needs to go up, who exactly is going to DO THE WORK?", "score": 220, "replies": [{"body": "Too much money in economy, better take jobs away from the people that control 20% of America's wealth\n\nWhat better way to bring down prices than to swing a bat to the knees of the already crippled poor and middle class.\n\nHow to decrease rent, food, and car prices?

I.e. Amazon has been using profits to grow their logistics and distribution to a massive scale.  This is beneficial for the government because a 1 time tax break pays dividends as the business grows and generates more revenue in the long term.

The US Department of Health and Human Services has a discretionary budget of $151 billion per year, as of the current fiscal year. **The government doesn't want to offer Health Care as a government service.** They want to prop up new and exciting insurance schemes that increase the kickbacks for their paymasters. M4A failed in Congress not because it was a bad idea *per se* (even though it was), but because there wasn't enough graft to find broad donor support, and Medicare reimbursements decrease every single year without Congressional overrides.\n\nBuild some hospitals and clinics in every state in the nation and every metro area; hire doctors and nurses; open the doors to free government health care for all. Let private providers and money-skimming insurance middlemen try to compete with FREE care. All it would take would be the stroke of the executive pen: Congress has already authorized the expenditures.\n\n[Rationing of care is a stated public policy goal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1173526/) of most nationalised health care systems.

Scale product deployment.  Same fundamental questions that Tesla faced prior to 2020. \n\nI don't know whether Palantir succeeds in making the jump.  The company claims that its Foundry software is general-purpose enough that it no longer needs a lot of customization for each organization that buys it.\n\nI like what I see from Palantir in terms of product and ambition to get that product used all over the Western world.  I only made a small bet, but modest bets are all that's needed IMO.  I invested just 8% of my total portfolio in TSLA in 2011-2012, but that modest amount grew so much that it became 75-80% of my overall wealth a decade later.

Which is why there were so many regulations enacted after the crash on lending standards moving forward.  Foreclosures happened as a larger symptom of the poor lending practices at the start post-crash.

They panicked and THAT caused a liquidity crisis in the interim. A literal game of hot potato. Part of the reason these CDOs were junk was because they were mainly on adjustable rates - which were in the process of reaching their terms. And as those rates spiked, people went into foreclosure because they were given too much to begin with. Same goes for cash out and HELOCs. \n\nSo yes. My point still stands. This time, on the residential side, it’s a lot different. Loans are generally a lot stronger and most people who got mortgages have low fixed rates.

The ARM loans are going to be the first sellers on market- especially when they have bought at egregious prices thinking RE was going to be a hedge against inflation. News flash- inflation is terrible and real estate is actually going down. ARM borrowers in my opinion will be selling their houses out of desperation. They will be stuck watching their liquidity go down on multiple properties and will also be getting reamed by their monthlies shooting up with each new prime rate adjustment.

It means more USD/wealth leaves the USA for better ROI abroad.\n\nThink of a strong dollar as a 'heavy' and expensive money. Comparatively weak yen as light and cheap. To barbarically over simplify, the upside of having a strong currency is: so long as the standard by which all of these values are derived is stable, you're currency cant be 'too strong' to the point of failure - economic growth would just slow; plus, the usd acts/acted as the monetary value benchmark by being the \"world reserve currency\", so as long as that standard is maintained the Fed could hypothetically get through any type of monetary warfare by just printing more USD. Its like being on the gold standard and having the magical ability to mint gold out of nothing like Rumpelstiltskin; the only thing holding you back is getting *too* greedy, spinning so much gold that gold's value becomes trivial, and the world economy no longer accepts gold as the bench mark for monetary value.\n\nThe downside of having a weak currency and devaluing it against the standard value benchmark, is that if you fuck it up you can weaken a currency to the point of failure - where the value of it and everything attached to it collapses. The nice thing about doing this calculated weakening on a gold standard is that central banks had a steady benchmark that they could accurately predict to base calculations on, to avoid getting any where close to failure/hyper-inflation, though they could gamble on ignoring the math short term and still fail. The better thing about doing it on a USD world reserve currency standard is: while not being able to predict what the Fed will do with the dollar, so long as the Fed is willing to  add to the money supply by printing USD - you can aggressively devalue your foreign currency in relation to this, and you know that those dollars will never go away, allowing you to engage in a sort of monetary guerilla warfare against the central bank producing the world-reserve-currency \\[the Fed\\], encouraging them to a race to the bottom at their own peril. Thus allowing the fed to print more money at will, but in order to guarantee it is accepted in circulation - it has to accept a world where USD is constantly fleeing the USA for better ROI abroad.\n\nImagine the monetary race to the least sustainable value, but if the people running the Fed didn't care about retaining the USD as world reserve currency long term, and are working with say central bankers of EU and ccp/China to make some new digital world reserve currency after milking the American economy dry. Americans would wake up one morning with hyper-inflation without world reserve or petro dollar status, and the service economy is suddenly not sustainable.

The lesson isn't that every 10-15 years the market gets built up by irrational exuberance and then crashes back down so you can buy in. The lesson is: **nobody fucking knows what is going to happen** and the economy is not a predictable wealth-machine.\n\n2008 was really, really weird. It has never happened before, and it will never happen again. The circumstances took decades to come together. It's like you had a gas leak in your basement from 20 years ago than you never fixed and the gas built up in this little crack in the wall until one day you turned on the toaster and your house blew up.\n\nThe exact same thing will not happen again.

Since we're nowhere near the point that we can quickly shift into clean energy and transportation, we're relying on fuel supply increasing and it's just not happening.\n\nSo I don't think it's 2008, but this has been a long time coming of a different situation.  We've been needing to shift out of reliance for foreign fuel sources for a long time now, we just haven't done it, our economy was built around those cheaper fuel sources, and now the rug is swept out from under us in a quick and violent motion.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I'd argue we're in a worse place than 2008. \n\nWe've seen the meme of the stripper from \"The Big Short\" about having 8 homes and then an image of some guy saying he has 2400 (or whatever amount) airbnbs.\n\nIt's amazing the amount of people I know with 2-20 airbnbs. If we go into deep recession, those airbnbs alone will likely get sold or foreclosed on. I mean most of the people I know have continued to keep buying so not all or many of their properties are paid off. \n\nThe auto industry is about to see a massive decline in sales. Surprisingly Cathie Wood made a comment about this. Granted anyone with a brain could've figured this out without much thought but everyone (still doesn't) and didn't want to believe it to be possible. Car world is much like the real estate world. Inventory will surge. So like 2008 we're gonna see a situation where dealers will have too much inventory and cannot sell it. Maybe not this year but going into next. \n\nThe consumer is racking up credit like never before. I see it with all my clients and when I'm out to eat, everything is getting paid with credit. Not cash. Not debit. I pay attention to that all the time as a simple indicator of the market. When I see people at grocery stores using credit, way more than anything else, that tells me, the consumer is strapped. And the data doesn't disagree with me on it. \n\nWith the cost of fuel and fertilizer, farms are already in a tight spot. Most have said to me directly, we cannot farm next year if prices double. If things continue, the price they paid this year for fuel will likely double, if they haven't already depending on when they contracted their fuel. If the Russia/Ukraine thing continues, I see no reason why fertilizer and def go up in price. Double in price? Unsure. Either way the price you're paying for food now is, to some degree only factors in last years costs to raise/grow whatever you're buying. So come fall, the new pricing comes in affect. With transportation costs alone, if a box of crackers is $5 now, it's gonna be minimum $8, maybe $10 by December. Then next year comes, if farms are already maxed out and cannot afford to spend more, and we see even a 30% increase in costs, that's a shit storm in of itself. \n\nI could go on and on.

The biggest mistake in the entire world is making the assumption that high interest rate = crash in prices. Wrong.  The only thing that matters at the end of the day are supply and demand. Sure, demand may get hit if interest rates rise, but what you geniuses doing advanced calculus fail to also consider is that supply may also contract in response, which means you'll get no relief in prices at all.  The only way your assumptions hold about a real estate crash is if there is a flood of inventory that hits the market and inventories build up by a lot. \n\nYou know what will also happen as rates rise? Sellers who would have sold will no longer sell because they can't afford a new place to live. Why would I sell my house locked in with a 2.8% interest rate for a new house with 6+%? \nNope. Sellers often need new places to live too. Also, if prices do actually dip, sellers will just sit on their properties for years and not sell because they simply won't take a loss.  In the end supply barely improves even if demand contracts and prices never crash.   So much wishful thinking.  Real estate liquidity may just drop like a rock resulting in very little price relief.  Of course that doesn't fit the fantasy reddit whacks it's pps over though while they wait for an epic 2008 like crash.

If you talk to an Austrian school they are basically like \"we're fucked\". As rates rise people will not sell and constrict spending. The US economy is driven by consumer spending. The long and short of it, debt is borrowing from future earnings. The money doesn't really exist until someone works to create it or you just debase the currency. If people begin to default on things like credit card debt trillions of dollars that exist in the economy disappears because the person who was going to work to create that value isn't going to work to pay it back. \n\nVery simple example. Im the bank you come to me for a 100 dollar loan, I just add 100 to your account. The money doesn't exist for real I just added 100 to your account (fractional reserves). So then next week you say well I bought a widget with it but I can't pay you back and default. So now that 100 dollars that the bank added to your account doesn't exist. No one is going to work to create the value of the 100 dollars. So technically the bank can try and get compensated by taking the widget from the borrower but then the value of the widget is less than the borrowed money. They also have to waste time and resources to get compensation from the borrower which is another drain on the loan. So while from the perspective of consumer spending it looks like people are buying, it is all on debt and once people default on the debt because it becomes unserviceable, the banks take the hit and become less likely to lend or worse go under. \n\nWe have been playing a game of buying on debt, shuffling the debt around and because the fed rate was low the cost to borrow was low. As rates rise we will see people default and lenders take the hit. While lenders do plan for losses having a mass of people default again will cause another downward spiral where lenders don't want to refinance debt and more people default.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Except this is a bear market, a crash implies we didn't know this would happen two years ago.

Miss out if you want to, COWARD(S)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "To take any one sentence summary and say you disagree with it is understandable. For most people, it's very difficult to understand even part of how economics works. and....part of playing in the market is a belief system. Either the belief it's going to go up, or going to go down. And maybe some things need clarification. For example, there IS a NEW housing crisis just about upon us, at least by the \"normal\" standards. New housing usually is about a 3-6 month supply ahead of purchases. Meaning, if ALL new house building stopped, we would be out of houses in the US to sell from builders. Does that mean there are no houses to sell? No, but because it's a growing population, that would be insufficient to handle the growth. Which is effectively what is happening. Because now we are down to maybe a month lag on new houses, and new house builds are taking 50% to 100% longer to get done, so the supply/demand is skewed, which is why housing is going up. HOWEVER, this is not at all like the bubble of 08, this is not about millions of people taking dangerous loans from shitty banks trying to convince the population they can afford what they cannot. This is about a steady buildup up demand and supply is simply not keeping up right now. So, short term, there is a housing price rise occurring. But....as the supply begins to catch up, those houses will fall back down (but only a bit and for other reasons like inflation) and new houses will becoming increasingly available. But, the other thing to recognize here, which is why the recession is and will happen but will not be long lasting (if things stay how they seem) is because the Fed realized the inflation (which was not unexpected, dumping trillions of dollars will eventually cause any economy to inflate) they are now putting on the brakes, now doing the opposite of dropping the rates to effectively zero to keep the economy alive by raising them vigorously, which certainly slows down the housing purchases, because either people now are not able to qualify, or they sit back and hope the rates will come down, in either case cooling the housing market back down (this might take 6 months to a year to finish having it's affect). Meanwhile, this nervousness of the inflation, economy, job market, Russia, etc, also gets the stock market nervous, because the market simply reacts to what people are doing. So, in typical fashion, normal human psychology, is to panic and sell, so that's what millions of people, and the big financial houses (somewhat) are doing. However, if you watch closely, you will see there is \"dry powder\" or cash sitting on the sidelines that have now engaged and are buying all these stocks at the bottom. Since many of us don't have reserves like this, we can only sit in wait as the tide will eventually rise again. If you have reserves, and can safely invest, then it's the time to buy in because it will rise and you will make money. \n\nYou also mention the other currencies. It's a good point to look and see how others are fairing. Economies that didn't or wouldn't try to keep their economies afloat are now at the bottom of the bottom, because their economy is trashed worse than ours, and their currency is unwanted and not valued. The dollar is stronger in many respects, because although we are in the shitter, they are even further in the shitter. You are not retarded, at least you are thinking independently, and that is good. It's good to be examining and thinking about whether people making statements about how everything will be fine or everything will be on fire are coming from and how THEY came to that conclusion.
