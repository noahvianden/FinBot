When you do on rare occasion have those you're chilling in your office working through it, maybe meeting or calling a coworker you get along with to do it with you so you can brainstorm what the best way is.  The interview is totally different from the reality.\n\nHere is the challenge though: The only alternative I have ever seen is to ask an actual real world problem of someone.  The problem? first it's almost impossible to set these up for every language.  Algorithms are nice and contained so you can say \"use whatever language you're comfortable with\" if you don't need expertise in the language for the position.  Second, real world problems require setup which means you either need to make a whole bunch of challenges in a bunch of languages or require the interviewee to know the language and deal with getting a lot of frameworks to cooperate.  Finally, real world problems are frequently tough to explain/describe and that eats up a lot of your time available.  This makes things a tradeoff.  I personally had a company I REALLY want to work for.  They say they don't care if I know their tech stack, and their interview process doesn't rely on algorithms...but all of their interview problems/challenges are done in the specific tech stack because they don't have time to set up the same challenge in all tech stacks.  This made it very hard for me to pass the interview because I had learn 2 new languages and 2 additional tech stacks in order to even approach solving the problem.\n\nFor our team, we're largely hiring less experienced people and we don't care what tech stack they use.  In order to accomplish this we chose to go with very simple algorithmic questions, as well as some basic db and design questions.  Our algorithmic question was literally \"remove duplicate values from an array\"...it's as simple as iterating the array and constructing a new one.  If the value is already in the new one you don't add it.  The sql questions were very simple select statements.  In both cases we don't look at whether they finish it but instead look at how they approach the problem.  We've had multiple candidates surprised when they got the problem done and that's all we were asking.  Also, we don't ask that they compile and run it (unless they want to).  We just ask them to walk a sample input - we're watching to see if they spot mistakes and fix them and if they can read their own code.  We don't care if all the syntax is perfect, we care that the logic works.\n\nIs our approach ideal?  no.  It also wont' work if we're trying to hire someone more experienced.  it's the best we've found so far.  But...as someone who has interviewed who is more experienced I've found the entire thing very challenging.  I hate algorithmic problems and I don't frequently have to solve them.  I've found that they're a flip of a coin.  Does the solution pop out at me right away? if so I'm good.

Amazon and Tesla are similar in that they didn’t pay high salaries because they made up for it with larger equity offerings on the goal that it would perform well.  And it did.

One of my best friend work for them and he always sell his shares to diversify, a better pay would be better for him. He was telling me how one of his employee started in 2005 and even if he has a terrible salary had more than a thousand shares haha. \n\nBut yeaj Tesla want to be world leader in AI technology to justify their valuation but somehow want to give shitty conditions by forcing everyone back to the office, doing layoffs and offering substantially worse conditions than others in this field.

Similar to why people choose to work for startups, even though that is true monopoly money.\n\n\"Apple employee could have bought the shares and made the same profits\". Operative words being \"bought\" and \"profits\".  Not everyone has $30k+ per year to throw down on one stock to match what an employee would have received as part of compensation. Further, \"same profits\" ? An employee didn't need to purchase the shares so there is no \"profit\"; unless Tesla goes to $0 the employee would have made money. There is only up or down, with the added insight of being an insider.\n\nYou keep using the term \"pay\", and after all this I have to presume you're meaning \"salary\".  We work to pay the bills and make a living, no?   Given your example, the early Amazon employee has a \"bad salary\" but has equity worth over $2m.  Sure, more money is always going to be better but the salary, at that point, is insignificant. A faster path to wealth is through equity, and that employee achieved it.   Now, regarding your friend, why don't they leave Amazon?   If he's selling his shares to diversify (a safe strategy), then he probably doesn't believe the shares will appreciate, and if their total compensation (base + equity + bonus) is below market value without incoming increases then again, why don't they leave?\n\nYou talk about Tesla forcing people back into the office but at the same time cite Apple and Google, two companies that are wanting to bring people back into the office, too.\n\nYou can cherry-pick a downtrend on any stock chart at any point in history. If someone joined Tesla in 2021 intends on staying long-term then the stock will likely recover and continue to appreciate.

Much of Europe’s goods inflation is imported, while the US experience was all about roaring demand.\n\n> The biggest difference is in employment and wages. Tight US labour markets (alongside oodles of excess cash savings) are supporting high demand. Not so in Europe, where household consumption in the key eurozone economies has not recovered from the pandemic, as Tomas Hirst pointed out on Twitter yesterday. Hours worked are below pre-pandemic levels too, suggesting labour market slack.

{"title": "Goldman Sachs says the meme stock revolution is over. U.S. retail investors have sold most of what they bought over the last two years", "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-revolution-over-goldman-165449356.html\n\nRetail investors flooded into so-called meme stocks like AMC and GameStop during the pandemic hoping to net quick profits in a market that just seemed to keep on soaring. In 2022, with interest rates climbing and the stock market struggling, it’s a different story. Goldman Sachs analysts, led by David J. Kostin, revealed in a Tuesday research note that retail investors have sold most of their U.S. stock purchases from the last two years. And over the last seven weeks alone, $26 billion has flowed out of U.S. equity ETFs and mutual funds, which are often traded by retail investors. Rising stock prices, stimulus checks, and near-zero interest rates led investors to rush into the stock market like never before during the pandemic. In fact, U.S. investors sank more than $1 trillion into stocks in 2021 alone, the Financial Times reported in December. That’s more than the prior 20 years combined, and three times more than the previous annual record. On top of that, the “democratization” of investing due to the expansion of low-cost trading applications like Robinhood, and the birth of large online communities of traders on forums like Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets, spawned a meme stock revolution in 2021.\n\nMeme stocks are equities that gain a cultlike following on social media platforms. Typically, these stocks are targeted by retail traders due to their high short interest, which means that a large number of short-sellers—traders who bet a stock’s price will fall by borrowing shares and then selling them at market price hoping to buy the shares back at a later date for less—have shorted the stock, making it susceptible to something called a short-squeeze. A short-squeeze happens when short-sellers are forced to buy shares (i.e., cover their shorts) in order to exit their positions as a stock rises, pushing the stock even higher. The meme stock era propelled the share prices of formerly unloved, and mostly unprofitable, names like GameStop to new heights in the first few months of 2021. The video game retailer eventually saw its shares jump over 2000% to a short-lived record high of $483 by Jan. 28. Leading up to that record, the number of unique accounts trading GameStop on a given day increased from fewer than 10,000 at the beginning of the year to nearly 900,000 by the end of January, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission report.\n\nNow, though, with a slew of macroeconomic headwinds from the war in Ukraine to sky-high inflation hurting stock market returns, the retail crowd has all but abandoned its meme stock heroes. Shares of GameStop are down over 50% in the past year to around $120, and AMC has fared even worse, with shares plummeting nearly 60% to $13 over the same period. Goldman Sachs says the rise of retail investors and the meme stock movement was largely a result of a narrative they call TINA, or “there is no alternative.” The idea is that because interest rates were so low, savings accounts, government bonds, and other interest-rate-sensitive investing alternatives just didn’t pay enough to be worthy of investment by the retail crowd. As a result, there was record investment into risk assets like tech stocks, meme stocks, and cryptocurrencies as investors hunted for stronger returns. “Since 2020, fiscal stimulus, near-zero interest rates, and record-high equity allocations supported TINA … But investors are now facing rising interest rates and recession concerns,” the analysts wrote, adding that there has been a sharp reversal of the TINA trend over the past few months. It’s now the age of TARA, or “there are reasonable alternatives,” Goldman says, and that’s reversing households’ aggressive stock purchases, which have significantly contributed to the recent stock market selloff.", "id": "v42x8z", "created_utc": 1654272986.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "Can’t get retail to sell, so just lie and say they all already sold XD", "score": 123, "replies": [{"body": "I didn’t sell", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Is trading volume zero?

Then Ryan Cohen entrred the picture, became one of the largest investors in the company, became chairman of the board and threw out the old execs and hired new ones. Now suddenly gamestop begins transformation into a modern e-commerce business with modern social media marketing and a not so grim future outlook. \n\nThis is REALLY REALLY and I cannot stress this enough REALLY bad for the aforementioned financial organisations who have spent years profiting off of (and consistently growing) their short positions against gamestop. Essentially their short positions against these cellar boxxed tickers are usually multiple times larger than the total number of shares that actually exist, by use of loopholes in market law, short positions against ETFs containing the symbol and a very toothless and complicit SEC. \n\nThis means the price per share going up has a huge negative impact on their portfolio, which is how a company like Melvin Capital (a small fry hedge fund in the grand scheme of things) had to close down after reporting losses in excess of four billion dollars, reported by them as being a result of their short position on Gamestop, a company with a market cap less than half that four billion number AFTER the January 2021 craze. Melvin lost more money than gamestop is worth. \n\nNow gamestop has used this investment boom around their stock as an opportunity: they've paid off all debt and are launching new services and building vast amounts of infrastructure to aid in their strengths as an e-commerce business. This means that the aforementioned financial organisations (the ones still alive) are REALLY hurting, and despite entering into these 'sure bet' short strategies with fairly low interest rates... There's STILL interest, and the cost of administration with maintaining and continuing to grow these positions in a opaque and technically legal way. As there is no conceivable way for them to actually close the short position and stay afloat (see:Melvin capital) the only real choice is to short the ticker more, hopefully creating enough sell pressure to bring the price back down to the sub-$10 it was in 2020. \n\nBut that's not happening. The price fluctuates for sure but it's not going down that far. Closing a short position, even now would solidify tens of thousands of percentage loss, also creating a huge amount of buying pressure which would raise the price higher, creating a positive feedback loop (which we saw just a taste of  first hand in 2021) and that is enough to destroy even the most affluent and hearty of financial organisations.\n\nSo to answer your question: holding and refusing to sell shares in certain companies can indeed put a significant hurt on 'the man' and when 'the man' holds 99% of the world's wealth, yes: you get to watch the world burn", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Nice fanfiction", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Which part is fiction?

Most of the hiring will come later: \n\nFor Giga Texas, after they have an expanded supply of 4680 battery cells, and after they have more lines installed and running (at the Cyber Rodeo, they had just enough equipment installed to produce a small number of vehicles, and from the drone videos it is clear that there is still a huge amount of equipment still to be installed). There are many more contractors at Giga Texas installing equipment on a typical workday than there are Tesla employees making vehicles. The temporary switchyard may not be able to handle enough electric power to power a fully ramped factory, and they just started constructing the full scale switchyard. Remember that Elon said it takes about a year to ramp up a new factory, and the hiring pause will likely be over before Giga Texas needs a large number of new employees.\n\nFor Giga Berlin, they are using smaller battery cells in packs supplied by Giga Shanghai, which is coming off a lockdown, and the supply of battery packs for Giga Berlin may not yet be up to normal. Later this year, Giga Berlin plans to switch over to 4680 cells/packs, and they may not want to ramp up too much before the switchover.\n\nSo both new factories likely do not need a large number of new employees at this instant. Also note that the hiring pause can be as long or as short as the company wants it to be, and doesn't have to be the same duration everywhere - hiring will resume first in places where workers are most urgently needed.\n\nIn addition to other comments that a reduction in workforce is often used to remove the least productive workers (which of course may include people who are good workers in general but just not a good fit for their position or the organization), Elon has previously commented that in times of rapid hectic growth, Tesla will sometimes inadvertently hire more people than they need with particular job descriptions, and eventually they need to reassess how many workers they need of each type and trim the positions where they have too many workers, as they prepare to hire more of the workers they need more urgently.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "given the \"no more working from home\" email he sent out this was obviously coming.", "score": 68, "replies": [{"body": "Makes firing easier.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Doesn’t matter either way.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "He may be able  to achieved 10%  reduction just through attrition, at least part of it.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "https://twitter.com/WholeMarsBlog/status/1532728341865943040\n\n> Note that this will not apply to anyone actually building cars, battery packs, or installing solar.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Right?

In more simpler terms, he doesn't care about today, he wants to ensure that the tomorrow is protected. That may seem offensive to some, but it can be reframed as such:\n\n1. Climate change problems occurred because vested interests kept protecting the past and present, rather than protect the future.\n2. US lost access to space for nearly a decade or more after the Space Shuttle shut down, including leading us to pay Russia who we consider our geopolitical enemy to the tune of nearly $100M YoY, for a decade, to get access to the station we *mostly built* on *our* tax payer dollar.\n3. Russia's invasion of Ukraine could have been avoided had actions been taken in 2014, but past and present was protected rather than make the hard decisions to safeguard the future.\n4. COVID 19 could have arguably be avoided almost entirely, because since Bush Sr all the way to Obama, so: Bush Sr, Clinton, Bush Jr, and Obama, all laid out plans and dedicated funding to building a logistics Network and Framework to deal with a pandemic situation, but the past presidency was interested in safeguarding the past and present rather than protect the future. (china does have some blame in this in how they handled it, but in a crisis the world often looks at the US to lead and in 2016-2020 we dropped the ball: **hard.**) Where all the guidelines and frameworks and measures were trashed because fuck the black man in office.\n5. Much of the supply chain crisis ongoing today is directly attributable to failures of point 4.\n\nIn essence, in the last 30-40 years, there's four crisis events of incredible severities that have pushed the world far closer to an authoritarian path with problems that could be avoided but were not addressed because it was convenient to ignore them at a *personal* level.\n\nAnd so when you look at what Elon does, then, it all comes together. It's like when a mom makes cookies with her son or daughter, and the kid always wants to eat the dough before it's ready and the mom keeps chiding the child to have patience, to not take the easy road to quick satisfaction, to wait for the future where it will be good. Sometimes, the mom will allow the child to have a little bit of the sweet dough, but otherwise will insist on the child waiting till the end.\n\nIt's that, but we as a society are outsiders looking in, and are seeing essentially a period between when the dough was being made and when the mom let the kid have a small piece of it to tide him/her over until the cookie is being made and all the outsiders see is a mom constantly chiding the child and saying \"no, not now.\" And then reacting \"wow, what a piece of shit parent. Keeps denying the child his/her desires.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, society has been conditioned to operate on a 1-5 year timescale. Profits, revenues, strategies are measured in those limited windows. Companies live and die within those windows. Elon's basically proving at extreme scale that that sort of thinking is wrong and proving why it's wrong. It's also showing the world what was possible and has always been possible and how far we as a society could be if we just waited a bit more and thought more long term than the next 1-5 years tops.\n\n**AND ITS PISSING PEOPLE OFF. THAT EXISTENT LEADERSHIP HAS IN MANY WAYS DENIED THEM THEIR FUTURE.** \n\nBut change is incredibly hard, especially self-reflecting change. It's easier to blame and shit on the outsider than to recognize that we as a *whole* need to become *like that* if we want to have a sustainable future. That we've put off the hard problems for too long, and to solve them now, it's going to suck, it's going to hurt, and it's going to cost us a lot.\n\nHe *isn't* a saint.

The strike, the expiration, and the premium.\n\nThe strike is the price at which you are entitled to sell 100 shares at. In this case, a 750p means you can sell 100 shares at $750 each, regardless of what the stock is priced at. If TSLA goes to $100 then that's $650 x 100, and what you'd call DEEEEEP (like Jim Cramer's bussy deep) in the money. In this case, it's more like $730 vs $750 strike therefore $20 x 100.\n\nExpiry is the deadline by which the price movement needs to happen. 0DTE means it expires today. Almost all options are traded on a Friday expiration (or Thurs if Fri is a holiday and casino closed). SPY and others you can get to expire on any day the casino is open, 0DTE's galore. Since these puts expire today, you can sell them while they're green or wait for expiration to exercise them. Exercising is a whole different topic, but essentially it means you're actually following through with the contract vs selling it for the premium.\n\nSpeaking of premium, we reach our last major concept of options - the premium. This is the price you pay to buy said contract. Factors that determine how big the premium will be are: how far ITM or OTM or ATM, amount of time until expiration, and Implied Volatility or IV. ITM (in the money) for TSLA would be any PUT above current stock price, so $735+ and ATM would obviously be about $730, and OTM would be $725 and under. A $100p on TSLA would be so ridiculously far OTM that it would cost dollars per contract. On the flip side, a $900p would be so far ITM that it would cost thousands per contract. If it's 0DTE, expires today, there's so little chance for price action to go in your favor that the contract is super cheap. If it's a LEAP (Long Expiration Ass Punch or something), it's argued that's anywhere from 6mo to 18mo away from expiration, but since this is WSB, it's more like anything dated 3wks away or longer. A $730p (AT the money, ATM) dated for 2023 expiration would be extremely expensive because you have so much time for it to continue dipping into the 600's or 500's and go way in the money. The seller of these puts is not too sure about that bet so they'll charge you thousands per contract to make that amount of risk worthwhile. Last is IV, basically when things are calm and tranquil, IV is very low. When there's upcoming events, like an expected crazy earnings release, or other big news, IV will spike like crazy and multiply the options premiums. When we say things are \"priced in\" with regards to options, it's IV we're talking. If you think \"oh this is guaranteed to tank in the next 2wks\" and it truly is, chances are IV has already taken that into account and you won't gain a dime. The real winners are when you buy when nobody expects that movement and then it just BAM happens, you go +420% but if you don't sell, IV crush happens, the huge movement is already accounted for and unlikely to make any further movement, your premium gets killed.\n\nTL;DR: strike, expiration, premium mixed with a little IV\n\nAdvanced course starts discussing theta decay, but you're entirely too smooth for that\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, your options don't have to go ITM to make bank, if his $730 TSLA puts were dated 6 months out, and bought a little while ago when TSLA traded at $760, that movement from $760 to $733 got very close to ITM but because it's still a long ways out, there's a very high chance it will continue crashing way past $730 and thus the premium would go through the roof.

(Edit: if price continues to rise to $250 over the next several weeks, if you sold the calls thinking you can pick up shares later, you're nowhere near able to pick up 1,000 shares anymore).\n\nObviously buying those 1,000 shares now is a better deal if you want those shares, but ya can't predict the future.\n\nIf the price goes to $250 instead of $160, you might want to just sell the calls for their premium if you think $250 was an overshoot and that it'll come back down to $150 again in the next couple of weeks.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "So the difference is that your goal was gme to hit 250 after expiry date and you wanted to gain bigger than just premium profit right now.

It is telling us that brokers are concerned about underwriting the risk of retail investors shorting GME, getting margin called, and then the broker having to take the risk of rush buying shares in the event of margin called clients. In effect, these borrow rates are broker risk management and not an artifact of simple supply and demand.\n\nYour over-simplistic view is also just based on supply/demand curve and not considering whether the supply side is dry or the demand is high. Actually, demand isn’t particularly high (after all, the bears are always telling us that GME isn’t even a highly shorted stock so a squeeze can’t happen. You can’t have it both ways). In actual fact; the supply cupboard is bare. Retail ape are stubbornly holding, and making it hard for brokers/MMs to locate shares to lend via turning off margin in their accounts, and direct registering, plus institutional ownership spiked up in Q1, locking up yet more shares, plus insider buys locking up even more.\n\nPop over for tea some time and I’ll explain how markets work.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Let me guess - it means MOASS, endgame, hedgies are fukt?
