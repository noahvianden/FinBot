What a joke.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "What reforms, in the face of a sharp drop in demand for refined oil, would have kept refineries from closing? It seems like falling rig counts and refinery closures were already in the works before he ever stepped foot in office.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "It‚Äôs complex so going to simplify, please bare with the length. \n\nThis problem will not go away even with more extraction the same way lumber and meat was expensive despite dirt cheap lumber and cattle prices. It‚Äôs all about the middle of the supply chain and the capacity shortage and inability to expand it there. Demand destruction with a recession would certainly help, but it‚Äôs a trend that will continue until it becomes a constant even with low demand for gas. \n\nIn the Northeast there are many independent refiners meaning they‚Äôre not major oil companies with full integration. In other words they only refine, they don‚Äôt extract upstream or blend and market downstream. Strictly in the business of refining. The equivalent would be a company that only owns a sawmill and doesn‚Äôt farm timber or transport and market it after the sawmill.\n\nBecause of that, they‚Äôre subject to ethanol blending requirements even though they do not blend gasoline. To fulfill the requirements of the program, they instead need to purchase credits called RINs to comply, which were a couple cents when the program started and are now at $1.50-$2.00. The total cost to independent refiners is hundreds of millions of dollars per year, causing losses some years and preventing that money spent on credits from being spent on capital projects and turnarounds. This amounts to an expense every year higher than the cost of purchasing a refinery in many cases. \n\nBiden had a choice to reduce the RVO under this program, which would have reduced the cost of these credits by lowering the blending requirements for ethanol. Instead, he raised them which spiked the cost of credits and the pain will only continue. \n\nThis hurts independent refiners who largely supply the Northeast (PADD 1) and are already at a disadvantage. Since they physically can‚Äôt blend ethanol because they don‚Äôt market and sell gasoline to consumers which is where blending occurs, they are being pummeled from both sides. \n\nA couple already closed or decreased capacity, which is significant for the region. By lowering the RVO (blending levels in the total gasoline pool) or even just not increasing it, he could have stopped the cause of what has already closed some refineries and caused this capacity shortage. \n\nAnd for those saying I‚Äôm claiming this is only Biden‚Äôs fault- not the case. Trump sided with ethanol and refused to help as well. But it‚Äôs no secret that the left has opposed pipelines running to the East which would help make the economics better for refineries supplying the densest part of the US. Beyond obstructing permits, simply being vocal about being anti fossil fuels is enough to prevent investment. That‚Äôs why this problem won‚Äôt go away without demand destruction in the short term and a comprehensive energy policy, reforms (like permitting), and investment in the long term. There is no stomach for long term investment in refining because of the political conditions which means capacity will only continue to decrease. \n\nWe did this to ourselves by pushing for a transition without a comprehensive plan. Biden attacks refiners for having a good quarter because there is less fuel than people who want it, yet they have been lagging and losing money the last 15 years.\n\nEdit: WSJ Editorial Board put out a piece yesterday, one of a few they have done, about this issue.

If we are comparing just the conferencing aspect, I think Zoom will win every time with it's ease of use and fantastically simple ui. I also like the Zoom chat but it's still nothing of note. It's just what a simple cloud chat app should be. Easy to use, easy to search, good balance of back end settings (enough Office integration to make people happy as well). But Zoom is definitely not a front end for 365 and if collaboration and SharePoint type stuff are the most important to your business, Teams is of course going to be the best option. We use a different document management system that has all of our collaboration and 365 integration built into it so we don't really utilize all of the Microsoft tools (usually because they are more frustrating!) In the end, aside from some of the bugginess that we would experience in Teams meetings (mute not always working, video and sound sync issues that weren't ever present in Zoom or WebEx, etc.), the biggest issues always seemed to be with external parties being able to join a meeting and have a good experience. That is where the bulk of complaints came from and it was usually a result of an external user trying and failing to join a Teams via the web whether they were on pc or iPad, then trying to download the Teams app which also wouldn't work for them because their office either didn't have Teams licensing or didn't have it setup properly, or they did and the user's device wasn't managed or something like that (so they could never use Teams associated with their office email address). Ultimately, they would not be able to get connected and everyone would blame it on Teams being garbage. And in a way they weren't wrong but I can also see how this isn't exactly the fault of Teams.

When the Fed raises rates, this increases the cost of taking out a mortgage. This causes less people being able to afford them, which means there becomes more seller's than buyers. Sellers then no longer have pricing power and have to lower prices to attract buyers. During the time of sellers having the control, lots of people saw opportunity and started building to meet the demand. These are starting to come on line now so you have both fewer buyers and increased supply thus price has to drop to meet the buyers. In housing, this could take 12-18 months to work out.

Governments and businesses that make good decisions are more likely to survive and even thrive vs. their competitors. \n\nExamples: \n\n* A company may not have a good handle on where production bottlenecks are occurring, or where they might occur.  Palantir Foundry software can help decisionmakers find a problem, or anticipate a future problem in a complicated supply chain. \n* A large government organization is trying to manage a complicated budget.  They have numerous inputs (taxes, revenue from transit services, funding from state or federal government, etc.) and outputs (salaries, contracts with vendors, benefits paid to assist citizens, etc.) and much of this input/output is across different departments using different systems.  Palantir Foundry can form a layer over all these different systems and give decisionmakers an overview of how cash is flowing at any given time.  They an spot inefficiencies, potential problems, and even unusual patterns that might indicate fraud\n\nThe main mission of Palantir is to make software that enables both governments and private enterprise throughout the Western World, to make better decisions.  \n\n* They do have another software platform, \"Apollo\", which is slightly different.  Apollo is a system for secure deployment and monitoring of software.  Malware and contaminated software supply (think back to the [SolarWinds security breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolarWinds#2019%E2%80%932020_supply_chain_attacks)) are ongoing threats.

About 12% of all Walmart workers are homeless. 70% of all workers on SNAP, TANF and medicaid work full time(GAO).  Since Walmart is the largest employer with about 515,000 employees working fulltime you can get an idea of how many are on govt subsidies.\n\nWhy is this even relevant? because a very large portion of the population is on a fixed income and they are working fulltime.  This dynamic we see in Walmart holds true for other major firms that are able to influence the cost of their inputs, especially labor.\n\nSo it is very possible that we can have stagflation with full employment because the working homeless/working poor population has exploded.\n\nTo be sure, the Fed is in between a rock and a hard place but they have no choice, they have to raise rates and no matter what they do, the ship is going to hit an iceberg.\n\nThe question is, what measures can be taken after the ship sinks to save as many people as possible that are barely floating in the water?", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "I read somewhere years ago that in the 1960's (?) that GM was the largest employer in the US and families could thrive with one wage earner.
