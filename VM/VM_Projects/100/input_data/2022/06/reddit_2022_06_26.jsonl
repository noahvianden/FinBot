Still bought UVXY calls near end of day and grabbing SPY puts tomorrow at mid day.\n\n[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ud0jjz/how_a_rogue_vix_spike_last_week_predicted_the/):  *^((4/21 -VIX 19- SPY 450)**\\*\\*)*\n\n>**Pt. 3 - Volatility, Suppression and Patterns**  \n>  \n>Here's my assessment of the situation, how I picked up on the strange pattern and what I have concluded might be happening and why this would occur-- First let's get you caught up to what VIX even is:  \n>  \n>**The Volatility Index (VIX), measures investors confidence of market health and signals the level of fear or stress in the stock market—using the indexes as a proxy for the broader market—and hence is known as the “Fear Index.” --The higher the VIX, the greater the level of fear and uncertainty in the market, because of this a major increase to VIX will cause markets to systematically sell off in computerized responsive trading.**  \n>  \n>You can start to gather from this relationship as to why VIX climbing unchecked at every COVID news update could be problematic to an already tense market in recovery.  The Federal Reserve recognized this importance as well and set in motion a plan to prevent it from continuing to repeat itself.   By June of 2020 it was apparent that the monthly volatility cycles were upending investors and was going to spiral into a larger full blown crash.   As part of the Fed's recovery outline, a market recovery team was to be created, affectionately known to us as the plunge protection team.   Their algos began to routinely show themselves during trading to prop up the major indexes and provided price support to entire sectors worth of companies stock so our then feeble markets didn't appear outwardly sick in what became known to many as fed pump mornings (fed pumps, money printer go brr etc.).    This set in motion a dangerous policy of the Reserve algorithmically suppressing VIX to clamp it down and in the process engineer false market confidence to prevent skittish investors from fleeing the markets at the first sign of trouble.  \n>  \n>All of these efforts were unprecedented, it gave them a level of access and control to our financial markets that had never been seen and the unbridled ability to dictate much of the narrative driving the perception of our recovering economy. From that point on an all out market protection war to save us from ourselves was put underway.  And it worked, a little too well.  It led to one of the strongest continuous bull markets in modern history and set the stage for that V-Shaped recovery that we were so promised.. but at what cost?   The cost of lying to the markets, falsely propping it up with strings and cheating volatility as a means to suppress the truth of how bad the situation really was to everyone.  And in the process enticing confident investors to pile into positions with margin debt at levels never before seen.  \n>  \n>***\"The suppression of volatility creates a debt to the market that must be paid.\"***  \n>  \n>It was in these efforts of market control and suppression that myself, and others, began to notice cracks leaking out that could not be explained.   The exaggerated mid-day price movements into end of day collapses, pump like market behavior, inexplicable micro-crashes that dotted the recovery at every few month intervals, and of course the questionable manipulation of VIX that seemingly defied all market health indicators.  \n>  \n>To truly understand why these rogue  \"spike\" movements jumped out at me you must understand that VIX has very unique price pattern tendencies and normally travels very naturally under live trading and has reactionary impulses that correspond to the current market health ie. climbs during red markets, movement that will typically begin gradually while following a back and forth tug and pulling both directions before the next linear climb or drop interval starts.  \n>  \n>The rogue price jump was always such that it went against the ongoing sentiment and movement of the live market and currently trending VIX direction, (large percentage jumps occurring in the midst of a green market) which defied implicit behavior tendencies.  In addition there was always an immediate and successful attempt to crash the spike back down to regain market stability for the day to calm peoples nerves before giving the market the full VIX dose over the trading days immediately afterwards.  \n>  \n>**Why it matters?**  \n>  \n>In the past when we have observed this behavior under healthy green markets, it has signaled the point at which the markets are about to incur the volatility debt that the Fed has been sparing us from through their market control measures.  \n>  \n>It will be slowed down and even dialed back for periodic intervals to maintain stability and produce green markets, but its' climb will likely persist as the pressure it creates is released in a controlled manner.  Which I do not believe has fully happened, in spite of the pain this past week has wrought.  \n>  \n>The Fed is in a tightening cycle for inflation control whilst slowing the onset of a recession. They are going to continue reducing their trillion dollar asset debt that they accumulated in the wake of pumping through the corona recovery markets. The result will be the very indexes they propped up for so long continuing to bleed back resulting in a VIX that will continue to reject downward control.  \n>  \n>Position: UVXY calls will be rewarded but should be treated with respect(--take profits),  and entered at appropriate times.  Puts will print as this process unfolds and the markets reconcile with the true state of affairs.  \n>  \n>**TLDR:  The tape and glue that the fed has employed as a means to prop up a sickly market will spring a leak occasionally showing us how bad of shape the boat is really in-- the day before it takes on water.   An unintentional side effect of the Feds efforts in suppressing VIX and propping up our markets has berthed a type of early warning alarm that seems to go off in the days before giving you a chance to get a head of it with your trades.**", "id": "vky4ab", "created_utc": 1656224047.0, "score": 441, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 182, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|123|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vky4ab/the_vix_spike_that_leaked_out_on_friday_has/) \n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vky4ab)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vky4ab)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Entered a mass SQQQ position Friday at close for this very reason.

{"title": "Oil crash incoming. TADAWUL vs OIL.", "selftext": "Have all of you paid attention to the Saudi TADAWUL index, which correlates (that is, rises and falls) depending on what happens to oil prices? If you haven’t paid attention, then I’ll probably reveal some of the chips in this matter to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, now almost all American invest. banks are taking out significant upsides on oil (they say that the potential for oil growth can be up to $ 150 - 170 per barrel), but moreover, this annoys me from the side that this message is addressed to the broad market. Since the \"crowd is not worthy of profit\", and it is always fooled by the market. I refer to the fact that before the future fin. crisis, oil is unlikely to cost $170 per barrel. Maybe $130 - 140 will show on the pull up, but higher growth potential seems unlikely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, there will soon be a significant bias in favor of supply in the oil market (that is, many market participants will sell more oil than is required), thereby the price will be dumped down. China and India are the main movers in the oil market in the next 6-8 months. But then everything will settle down and return to normal, thus oil will continue to grow after the crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThirdly, if the TADAWUL index falls and the price of oil rises, this is at least a signal that huge market participants are dumping positions to ordinary investors who fall for the trick of investing. banks and buy shares of oil and gas companies and other commodities at mid-term highs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill there be a collapse in oil prices? Yes, it will be within the framework of the future financial crisis! Will there be a decrease in inflation in the world? Yes, it will be, indirectly the market is already betting on this event by selling shares of oil and gas companies. But will the decline in inflation be long-term? No, this is a local crisis phenomenon marked by the economy entering a deflationary (crisis) spiral, that is, commodity prices will fall as part of a recession, and thus inflation will decrease in the short term. It should also be borne in mind that the Fed is sleeping and sees how to launch economic stimulus programs as soon as possible as part of a loose monetary policy so that US stock indices again begin to desperately grow in the financial. doping, so the growth of inflation in the future on the factor of an inherent increase in commodity prices is doomed!\n\nAlso, pay attention to the new cover of The Economist, they noted in it that in the near future the whole world will experience all the negativity of the energy crisis. IMO this is a clear sign of the top.\n\nWhat all this will lead to?

Ten years later, the price had dropped to $7 per ton. Afterward Coal's price increased into the 1900's. During the 1900s, both oil and coal prices increased steadily, but oil prices have increased five times as fast as coal prices over the past 100 years because of increased demand for oil relative to coal. Now if that is your idea of comparing these two as a prediction of Oils actual price cost relative to demand. Then okay.

The mass firing now being carried out at the behest of Elon Musk suggests this strong run of execution has come to an end, and could complicate efforts to get back on track.\n\nWe’ll find out roughly a week from now how many electric vehicles Tesla built and handed over to customers this quarter. There was little the company could do, of course, about Shanghai shutting down the city for weeks and costing the carmaker output from its most productive plant. Musk’s words and actions lately don’t inspire much confidence in how the company has coped.\n\nFirst, the chief executive officer gave an interview to the Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley on May 31 (though the fan club only just aired the footage this week). Musk described the new factories opened recently near Berlin and in Austin, Texas, as “gigantic money furnaces” losing billions of dollars.\n\nDays later, Reuters reported Musk had sent an email to Tesla executives saying he wanted to dismiss 10% of employees. He then wrote in an all-staff email that cut would only apply to salaried workers. Then he tweeted Tesla’s overall headcount will increase over the next year.\n\nFinally, Musk told Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait this week that the salaried job cuts would take place over roughly three months. He also downplayed the significance of  a lawsuit by former employees who claim Tesla violated federal law by failing to provide advance notice of the job cuts, calling it “ trivial.”", "id": "vl3xkw", "created_utc": 1656247435.0, "score": 1270, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 593, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|61|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|802|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vl3xkw)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vl3xkw)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So it begins.\n\nEasier to let someone new go than someone who's been around for 3+ years.\n\nTypically no severance, not vested, and still under a probation period.", "score": 341, "replies": [{"body": "True.

{"title": "The recent Friday rally explained", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/rjpw7y5wpz791.png?width=386&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3881287f2d482261cb00413daf777bec51b47cb\n\nOn Friday we saw a massive rally more specifically at 10 am. The data that came out at 10am was \"bullish\". It was actually expected to be interpreted as bullish based on the futures rising that day and seeing a rally all morning into that period and beyond.\n\nI only point this out because any data that is showing inflation \"topping\" out is being grasped onto for all possible hope. Since there are a ton of shorts in the market, we are witnessing bear market short squeezes rather than rally if you want to understand them better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hruwidzbqz791.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=8facb266718b0eb179ed7c072b35f3bce69aeaed\n\nThe data at 10am showed that consumer sentiment was 0.2 lower (pessimism flattening out) and new home sales rose higher than the expected forecast. So wall street is interpreting this as bullish af. I was pessimistic generally speaking after Thursday but I have noticed everyone has become very pessimistic so the money to be made is by being optimistic even if irrationally.\n\nI personally trade during the day or 1-2 day trades. This said the week overall coming up imo is a do or die for the current squeeze going on. ANY data that comes out not horrendous will continue the pump all week and these are the data that are coming out:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkzbi7yqrz791.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=a02b4e9b893492a2065d618c5a405a91b1c92d42\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qn89750urz791.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c04e348680b129bb91c40c9c0dcea2fadd84f86\n\nMonday imo will just be a continuation of the current rally. With more housing data showing up, considering the housing data that reinforced SPY at 10am on Friday was positive, I would expect a good move higher in anticipation and after having that data. This will set the bullish feel in the air so to speak. Consumer confidence and more housing comes out on Tuesday and these were already interpreted as bullish thus Tuesday continues the rally.\n\nGDP estimates come out Wednesday. As these are just estimates I think the theme will still be bullish here. I just don't see any bombshell data that discourages the FOMO surrounding your typical squeeze for the week.\n\nThursday is where it might get dicey. There is alot of data to digest and its all about the consumer. Is inflation showing a leveling or rising? Does the consumer have extra cash and are they spending it? Is unemployment rising in May? Is manufacturing showing more weaknesses? OPEC is missing from the calendar but they are also meeting on Thursday!\n\nI personally believe Thursday is going to be the turning point day IF there even is one. Historically it pays to bet on the week leading into or during July 4th with the week just ending higher since 2018 (I only went back that far). With it being a major holiday, I don't see the market doing any bad stuff but if it will, they can de risk on Thursday and go about their early vacation to wherever all the rich people go for 4th of July. Friday will just be a continuation of whatever Thursday brings. You have PMI data but you already got that insight from Thursday.\n\nWhats important is you need to keep in mind your timeframe. If your planning on laying down some puts that are 3 weeks out, maybe wait for the crescendo of bullishness to take place on Wednesday and do it 30 mins before the day is over. If you think wall street is out for the bears lunch money, play this week assuming its green all week and get out on any extreme bullishness.\n\nOn SPY there is still a gap to fill at 400. Theres alot of bullish calls out interestingly since Friday as though someone wants the market to rally. One suggested even 7% with the rebalancing. Rebalancing is not going to take a full 5 days to complete. It could be done as soon as the end of Monday and they will rely on retail to jump in and complete the move all week.\n\nTLDR; all data will be interpreted as positive and keep the market rally in tact until at least Thursday where for me its a coin flip. Wednesday near EOD presents the best shorting day and Monday at open or just general weakness through the day  is the entry to ride the bull week. Expect heavy volumes and so up and down moves will mean what they are trying to say. Professionals always control the end of the day and the end of a week. Remember when you see those rug pulls, they just so happen at the end of the day or into the end of a week!", "id": "vl8wam", "created_utc": 1656262022.0, "score": 197, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|33|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1279|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vl8wam)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vl8wam)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Holy shit.

More confirmation of a major reversal coming, even if it's the 1 minute chart.\n\nWhen the prices were closing on Friday, the price action of all the stocks freaked me out. There were several anomalies that made me [exit all my AAPL call positions:](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vjxutl/a_modest_3k_gain_in_3_days_from_11k_to_14k_this/)\n\n1. All stocks across the board exhibited consolidation, which is normally quite bullish, but not all stocks had the same pattern.\n2. The volume was too consistently high for a lot of them.\n3. There was actually too little volatility that day for my liking.\n\nPut those points together, and there is actually a good chance that players were getting out of the game and exiting, instead of accumulating.\n\nSo out of impulse, in addition to closing my my positions, I took a small risk and bought some 0DTE SPY puts 388 strike.\n\n[Also picked up some GME shares 'cause the price action was really weird.

I am expecting a drop some time between now and 8am EST. There could still be a random pump from here to the high last hour, but I am still bearish.

But if you want to know a secret, I am seeing hints of bearish divergence, both regular and hidden \\(if you know what that means\\). First confirmation of my previous hypothesis that buyers are losing steam, and sellers are hiding \\(not other way around\\). Still expecting drop within maybe, 3-5 hours is reasonable, or sooner.](https://preview.redd.it/mztbpcqrb3891.png?width=2650&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a6e4dda9a92cff56585bab479ea35b70f4b04b1)\n\n**Edit 12 (Update 1:25am):**\n\n[Zooming out to 5 min chart, because it's dragging on. We can see that it's starting to get volatile, in the downward direction. If it were volatile going up for that last candle, I would've said bullish short term. But because we went down, sellers starting to jump out from bushes. This could be the start of the drop.](https://preview.redd.it/cte2u8c6n3891.png?width=2650&format=png&auto=webp&s=87e48d9b9f7cf4db221b21eba761483736ecda04)\n\n**Edit 13 (Update 1:30am):**\n\n[Immediately the next candle after previous update, it dropped. This is it, there's no coming back. Based on previous price action, 1\\) high volatility after major pumps, 2\\) on low volume, 3\\) a more massive manipulated pump, 4\\) immediate downward volatility consolidating at low fib lines, 5\\) waterfall drop, the chance of us returning to make highs from here is extremely unlikely. We've seen these patterns all the time in crypt0e. Let's see what happens. It should consolidate, sideways, and down from here.](https://preview.redd.it/geuzj7hko3891.png?width=2650&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc51153b19b0f8d75df4897ccd06b8d71e9672ea)\n\n**Edit 14 (Update 2:40am):**\n\n[What did I tell ya, consolidation and down, sideways and down, ezpz.

This is usually a pretty bullish signal. However, the price action isn't volatile enough in the downward direction for me to believe it.
