Lifting of lockdown not only restored demand, but caused more demand in some areas as people bought work (and exercise, and cook etc.) from home equipment. This combined with a generalised suppressed demand effect and the human supply chain impacts, which led to a huge imbalance that later played out as port congestion in much of the world. This caused retailers to then order even more, which ironically exacerbated their own problems, in an effort to insure themselves against further disruptions. These two separate events are just about played out and will be gone next year.\nEvidence of this can be found in the vastly improved situation with chip shortages and other similarly impacted commodities. \n\nIf there was an inflation map, we are here.\n\nThen we got war which caused a different set of commodities to spike and new supply chain disruption and then finally we got hit with Shanghai lockdowns and their associated impacts on yet more parts of the supply chain, including many which were impacted the first time around.\n\nThese last two are yet to play out while we‚Äôre feeling the tail of the first couple, but we‚Äôve seen the Russian tanks vs. Ukranian mud movie in the spring and that didn‚Äôt go well, so let‚Äôs assume by winter some immediate impacts there begin to ease. On the commodities impacts even if the war doesn‚Äôt ease, next year more wheat will be planted by farmers elsewhere for example looking to take advantage of the higher prices from the imbalance, which will drive down prices as the market adjusts itself.\n\nSo unless we‚Äôve *really* pissed off the gods, China has a rough winter of Covid, or some other indeterminate inflationary pressure arrives, things will naturally enter a deflationary cycle. There is also a lot of risk in the market, retailers are already finding themselves with too much inventory which is beginning to play itself out as discounting on their part, some issuing profit warnings. Those discounts equal lower prices and you know what cheaper prices do? They drive down inflation. There are also a bunch of companies who decided the solution was de-globalisation so decided to in-source manufacturing, some even bought or built factories and in many cases are now walking those plans back as shipping costs ease again making their new ventures uncompetitive. \n\nThen add in everything else Cathie always talks about driving prices downwards, I haven‚Äôt watched this particular clip but I‚Äôm sure s-curves and wrights law are in there somewhere, which is all relevant to the discussion, just hidden by all the above shenanigans, which crucially are all temporary.", "score": 93, "replies": [{"body": "Oil price shock is playing a bigger part than you make it sound.

You did not address the fact that no mature commodity business has high profit margins (not counting things like drilling oil where the resource is fundamentally limited).\n\nThe reason business with high capital costs & low operating costs are worse than vice versa is because once the all competitors in the space have made the large capital investment, they then have a race to the bottom which ends up covering the operating costs but not the capital costs - from a single company‚Äôs point of view, it‚Äôs worth it to knock prices down a few cents if they get loads more business, even if they end up making terrible returns on capital, because if they don‚Äôt knock the prices down someone else will, they will get all the business and maybe be able to turn a profit on capital investment too, while you will see far larger losses if you don‚Äôt get any business at all - hence, revenues will cover operating expenses but not cost of capital. \n\nWhat tends to end up happening in these situations (in a mature industry) is it makes businesses very unwilling to invest capital at such a low rate of return, and you see an extended period of little investment, until there is a supply crunch and prices and profits jump, then suddenly managers are very willing to invest. This results in supply exceeding demand and price slumping again, and the cycle repeats. \n\nI learnt about this cycle as it pertains to deregulated electricity generation, but the characteristics of that seem very similar to me to cloud computing - the only difference being that right now demand is rising faster than supply. \n\nI can link the paper on deregulated electricity generation economics if you‚Äôre interested in reading further?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">What about the rest of my comment?\n\nI don't specifically disagree with it. Sorry, I wasn't ignoring it, I'm just still considering some of it.\n\nI'm open to your idea that cloud will become a typical commodity. It's certainly possible. It might even be likely on balance. I'm not sure.\n\nAnother possibility is that you've given insufficient weight to the fact that the main buyers of servers and so high end chips will be only three very large customers. They could squeeze their supply line significantly before reducing margins.\n\nAnother area overlooked is that cloud isn't only a commodity service but also adding value through innovation. Aws used to be about 10 services. Now it's hundreds. Increasing their value add should increase margins.\n\nNext comes migration cost. Moving from Aws when you're funny leveraging it to Azure will be very expensive and time consuming. It's the sort of migration you won't make for small cost savings. I do this for a living so fully understand what is involved. Customers will be sticky to their current provider which will reduce price competition more than typical commodities.\n\nI'm not completely convinced by the idea that cloud will play out like a typical commodity. Again, it might, but I'm still thinking it won't. My retirement sure will suck if it does.\n\nThere's also an issue of timing. I might be right for another couple of decades before you're right if it commodifies along typical lines.

That's not how the industry works. Its years and millions in investment before you see first oil. Speaking for unconventionals in the US, It takes years from applying for the permit, to production. It takes 10-12 months to receive that permit after application.(on Fed lands, Im speaking from experience in NM in the Delaware Basin.) Depending on how many wells are on the pad, it can take anywhere from 1-2 months to drill, another 2 months to frac. Then you need to get oil, gas, and water off the location. So either you truck it out (most expensive way especially with the price of diesel currently) or you build out the infrastructure in the area. AT THE ABSOLUTE EARLIEST, it's 6 months from spud to first oil. And that's for a well run company, like the one I work for. For those mom and pops, it's easily over a year. These wells decline in production over time. So for a company to keep up their oil production over time, or even grow production, they need to have these permits in the back pocket and learn to be more efficient at every part of the process.

Economists at Barclays BARC, -3.69% and Jefferies backed up the shifting expectations, by indicating they expect policy makers to deliver a hike of that magnitude at their June 14-15 meeting.\n\nBeneath the issue of where the Fed goes from here is a much more fundamental and serious problem: Some observers fear the U.S. central bank has already effectively lost control of inflation. May‚Äôs price gains were broad-based ‚Äî hitting everything from shelter to gasoline and food, as well as the narrower gauge, the so-called core reading, that excludes food and energy. The data were ‚Äúcatastrophically bad‚Äù for both the Fed and Americans, said Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer of Nashville-based Laffer Tengler Investments, which oversees $1.1 billion.\n\n‚ÄúWhat we saw in this report which was disappointing and a little alarming is that the core reading, excluding food and energy, came in hotter than expected and that‚Äôs after we dropped off from a very high number for April 2021,‚Äù she said via phone. ‚ÄúThis is a much more persistent and stickier kind of inflation that takes years to work through the system.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe Fed has been wrong at every single turn and we should be seeing a 75 basis point hike at the June meeting,‚Äù Tengler said. ‚ÄúThe question is whether they can surprise and I don‚Äôt think we are going to see that. Every time they delay, that allows inflation to run rampant and this raises the odds of recession.‚Äù Equity markets will be ‚Äúugly and choppy through summer because inflation numbers are not going to improve.‚Äù\n\nIndeed, traders of derivatives-like instruments known as fixings have expected a string of annual headline CPI readings that rises to as high as 8.8% in August and September, before settling to 8% for October. Meanwhile, U.S. consumer sentiment plunged to a record low this month.\n\nSeptember outlook\n\n‚ÄúAll in all, the report should be of great concern for the Fed given that price gains in both the headline and the core measures show no signs of abating, and we expect prices to continue to register firm gains in the near term,‚Äù TD Securities strategists Oscar Munoz, Priya Misra and others wrote in a note. ‚ÄúWe expect the Fed to maintain its aggressive tightening bias in the months ahead, look for the Committee to hike rates by 50bp both next week and in the July FOMC meeting, and believe a 50bp hike in September may not be out of the question.‚Äù\n\nA team at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -5.65%, led by Jan Hatzius, agreed with TD‚Äôs September assessment, by saying ‚Äúwe now expect the Fed to hike the funds rate by 50 bps in September (vs. +25bp previously), in addition to +50bp moves in June and in July.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúToday‚Äôs report should extinguish any pretense that a ‚Äòpause‚Äô in rate hikes will likely be appropriate by the end of summer, as the Fed is clearly still behind the eight ball on bringing inflation under control,‚Äù said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede.\n\n‚ÄúInvestors should expect the Federal Reserve to continue on its 50-bp rate hike path next week and beyond until inflation shows meaningful signs of decelerating toward the Fed‚Äôs 2-3% target range,‚Äù Pride said.\n\n‚ÄúToday‚Äôs CPI report was a doozy,‚Äù said Tom Graff, head of investments at Facet Wealth.\n\n‚ÄúWhile we knew the headline number would probably come in high due to food and energy prices, consensus was that the month-over-month Core CPI would slow sequentially,‚Äù he wrote in an email. ‚ÄúUnfortunately that didn‚Äôt happen. Headline CPI came in a full 1% for the month and a 40-year high 8.6% for the year, and core stayed steady at +0.6% for the month and 6.0% for the year.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúThe most concerning part of this report was its breadth. The monthly number wasn‚Äôt driven by a few items. Most of the major categories actually accelerated price increases month-over-month. Most observers agree that broader inflation is more likely to persist.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFriday‚Äôs inflation data suggests the ‚Äòpeak inflation‚Äô debate may be premature,‚Äù said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management. ‚ÄúThe idea of peak inflation assumes that our supply chain disruptions are over and won‚Äôt recur anytime soon and I‚Äôm not so sure we can be confident of that.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúInvestors remain too confident that the Federal Reserve will be able to control inflation,‚Äù Davis said by email. ‚ÄúWe should not take the Fed‚Äôs ability to control inflation as a given.‚Äù", "id": "vaqrmh", "created_utc": 1655054702.0, "score": 416, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "This is why I think we'll see downward action in the first half of this week.

Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending (an adverse demand shock). This may be triggered by various events, such as a financial crisis, an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock, the bursting of an economic bubble, or a large-scale anthropogenic or natural disaster (e.g. a pandemic). In the United States, it is defined as \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the market, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales\". In the United Kingdom, it is defined as a negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters.\n\n\n\nWant more info?

Going to these are just pure gambling and throwing away money for a hit of gamblers high. \n\nIn the stock market you have immensely better odds. There are literally just two option directions. One is up or increasing number. The other is down or decreasing number. That sure sounds like a 50/50 shot to me. I would play those odds anytime. It would seem a lot easier to get lucky eventually anyway. Even if you are Terrible at guessing or predicting the direction, you are bound to get lucky eventually. \n\nI know the automatic rebuttal will be a third direction, flat. Of course this accompanied by Theta says hello. How long does flat truly last? A stock or ETF will undoubtedly go one of two ways or both. Up or down. \n\nI ask myself all the time if I'm truly just throwing away money and gambling. I ask if I have a gambling problem. I say no.

The point being that millions of Americans either are quite a bit more wealthy or feel more wealthy because of equity appreciation or tax free capital gains in RE.

People selling in very high markets like CA and NY are buying in cheaper markets.\n\nAnother option would be home equity loans.  I personally know quite a few people who have opened a home equity line to build pools, buy toys or gamble with options.\n\nPeople look at the value of their home and they feel like the equity is like money in a bank account.

It may be viewed as the opposite of failure. The criteria for success depend on context, and may be relative to a particular observer or belief system. One person might consider a success what another person considers a failure, particularly in cases of direct competition or a zero-sum game. Similarly, the degree of success or failure in a situation may be differently viewed by distinct observers or participants, such that a situation that one considers to be a success, another might consider to be a failure, a qualified success or a neutral situation. For example, a film that is a commercial failure or even a box-office bomb can go on to receive a cult following, with the initial lack of commercial success even lending a cachet of subcultural coolness.\r\n\r\nIt may also be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether a situation meets criteria for success or failure due to ambiguous or ill-defined definition of those criteria. Finding useful and effective criteria, or heuristics, to judge the failure or success of a situation may itself be a significant task.\n\n\n\nWant more info?

{"title": "Jesse Livermore. The most legendary trader you never heard of.", "selftext": "At the age of 14, his father pulled him out of school to help with the farm; however, with his mother's blessing, Livermore ran away from home. In 1891, at the age of 14, he secured employment, as a board boy, posting stock quotes at a Boston, Massachusetts branch of Paine Webber stockbrokerage, at the rate of $5 per week. \n\nIn 1892, at the age of 15, he bet $5 on Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad at a bucket shop, a type of establishment that took leveraged bets on stock prices but did not buy or sell the stock. He earned $3.12 on the $5 bet.\n\nAt the age of 16, he quit his job and began trading full-time. He brought $1,000 home to his mother, who disapproved of his \"gambling\"; he countered that he was not gambling, but \"speculating\".\n\nFrom 1895‚Äì1897, age 18‚Äì20, he accumulated $10,000 trading profits, a 1,000 per cent net return in three years of trading.\n\nOn September 14, 1900, age 23, he moved to New York, arriving in time for a strong bull market in stocks. He traded successfully, on the long side, at Harris, Hutton & Company stockbrokers, turning $10,000 into $50,000 in five days. In May 1901, he anticipated a correction and went short, using 400% margin. He lost his entire stake.\n\nHis first big win came in 1901 at the age of 24 when he bought stock in Northern Pacific Railway. He turned $10,000 into $500,000.\n\nIn the Panic of 1907, Livermore's huge short positions made him $1 million in a single day. However, his mentor, J. P. Morgan, who had bailed out the entire New York Stock Exchange during the crash, requested him to refrain from further short selling. Livermore agreed and instead, profited from the rebound, boosting his net worth to $3 million.\n\nIn 1908, he listened to Teddy Price, who told him to buy cotton, while Price secretly sold. He went bankrupt but was able to recover all of his losses. \n\nIn 1915, he filed bankruptcy again.\n\nIn 1924‚Äì1925, he engaged in market manipulation, making $10 million trading wheat and corn in a battle with Arthur W. Cutten and engineering a short squeeze on the stock of Piggly Wiggly.\n\nIn early 1929, he amassed huge short positions, using more than 100 stockbrokers to hide what he was doing. By the spring, he was down over $6 million on paper. However, upon the Wall Street Crash of 1929, he netted approximately $100 million. Following a series of newspaper articles declaring him the \"Great Bear of Wall Street\", he was blamed for the crash by the public and received death threats, leading him to hire an armed bodyguard.\n\nEventually he lost his fortune and filed bankruptcy for the third time in 1934, listing assets of $84,000 and debts of $2.5 million.\n\nOn November 28, 1940, just after 5:30 pm, Livermore fatally shot himself with an Automatic Colt Pistol in the cloakroom of The Sherry-Netherland hotel in Manhattan.\n\nInfo from https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Livermore", "id": "vaojua", "created_utc": 1655048321.0, "score": 428, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|20|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|339|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vaojua)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vaojua)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wow.

As interest rates go up, that will put further downward pressure on consumer spending.  \n\nThe market isn‚Äôt down because earnings are coming in at horrible recession-like numbers, the market is down because people are selling their holdings based on the idea of future earnings being really poor.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a good investor, just keep buying really great value as it pops up.

Investors will brag about the pricing power their investments have. A companies‚Äô ability to raise prices is a good\nthing.  Unfortunately there are a number of problems at play right now:\n\nSince inflation is hitting almost everything, operating costs for companies are going up and forcing price increases as a reaction.   When stimulus was ramped up, many companies also cut back inventories because they feared the worse from covid‚Ä¶ this caused increased demand, reduced supply, and an overheated economy.  Now many companies can‚Äôt seem to get their supply line back up to snuff, while costs are ramping up.  The consumer does still seem to be handling all this(so far),  but interest rate hikes and price hikes will absolutely slow the consumer down.  \n\nJust note, price hikes don‚Äôt slow down how many dollar the consumers spends, it just refocuses, and concentrates, where the spending goes.   Demand destruction via inflation does not result in the consumer spending less $$, only interest hikes do that. Reducing the M2 money supply and forcing the economy into a recession(in my opinion) is the only way to slow down inflation.\n\n\nMy own personal opinion about where stocks are headed is simple, I have no fucking clue.  Typically stocks outperform the dollar during times of inflation because cash is trash.  The dollar is losing value, companies are raising prices, why the fuck would you want to hold it?
