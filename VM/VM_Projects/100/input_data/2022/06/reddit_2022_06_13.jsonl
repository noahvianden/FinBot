However, if you are really buying a put debit spread as described above, your short would be ITM.  Technically you could be assigned anytime, but assignment would be extremely rare before expiration, unless it's deep ITM and there's no extrinsic value.

For example: I’ve noticed in previous trades when the sold calls doubles or nearly tripled in value, I would buy to close the short calls on a wed or thurs and by end of day sell the long underlying. Realizing later in the week or next that I left money on the table as prices on the underlying continued upwards. \n\nHow should I be calculating when is enough for me to close the short positions and then how much longer to hold onto long positions to maximize profit potential?

Best of luck to everyone this week and thanks again", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> My question is do you all have a protocol or any guidance on when during the week to buy to close the sold calls so that you can sell your underlying.\n\nFirst, terminology. Don't use the Robinhood \"sold calls\" term. Use what the industry has been using for decades, \"short calls\". That will save you from sounding like an RH noob.\n\nSecond, why do you have an underlying at all? You said you had 2 LLY long calls, but made no mention of shares. Where did the shares come from and why are they relevant?\n\nUnless you are misusing the term \"underlying\" to mean your long calls? I'm going to assume that is what you are doing, but correct me if I'm wrong. Underlying refers to the shares or units or notes that the option is derived from. It doesn't refer to long calls. A PMCC is not a covered call where you own shares of the underlying. A PMCC is a calendar diagonal spread, assuming the strikes are different. The proper term you should use, in the context of calendar or diagonal spreads, is the \"back leg\". The short calls you are rolling are the front legs.\n\nSo if your question is when do you sell your back leg in a diagonal spread, the answer is when you hit your profit target for the back leg. Your back leg should have an independent [exit strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourplan) that you set up when you opened the trade.\n\n\n> How should I be calculating when is enough for me to close the short positions and then how much longer to hold onto long positions to maximize profit potential? Currently I am pretty cautious so if I see a 35-50% ROI on the position being closed I take it. But on many occasions I’ve noticed I left another 25-50% on the table.\n\nDon't concern yourself with woulda/shoulda/coulda. Money \"left on the table\" could just as easily have been money lost if you had held longer. [The results of a single trade are next to meaningless](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qfq82a/poker_wisdom_for_option_traders_the_evils_of/), you should instead focus on your long term profitability.\n\nThe backtested exit for short front legs is 50% of max credit. So if you sold the front leg for $.60, exit when it costs you $.30 to close.\n\nFor long back legs, I like to use 10% profit, but you can use whatever you want, with the understanding that the longer you hold to get more gains, the more you risk losing.\n\n> I’m new to LLY and noticed on most days IV goes up or down 2% and the Greeks don’t change much, but with small price action and minimal volume the option value will fluctuate quite a bit compared to all my other contracts. Is that just demand going up and down? Never seen it before so wanted to clarify.\n\nFor one thing, you can't compare the price movement of share A with share B, so you super can't compare the price movement of the options on share A with options on share B. Your observation doesn't really mean anything.\n\nFurthermore, how do you know the option value is fluctuating? What are you basing that on? The gain/loss reported by your broker? If that's based on the midpoint of the bid/ask, all that fluctuation means is that the bid/ask is wide (poor liquidity) and the gain/loss reported by your broker is a really bad guess. All of the fluctuation could be down to bad guesses.\n\nFor example, suppose the bid/ask starts out at $1.00/$3.00 on 0 volume. The midpoint is $2. If the next day the bid/ask is $1.00/$4.00 on 0 volume, your broker will report that the call went up $.50 in value, because now the midpoint is $2.50. **But price is discovered by trading and no contracts were traded!!** So all that happened is that a \"phantom\" $.50 was added to the broker's bad guess making it a worse guess. **The actual value of the contract didn't change**, as evidenced by the bid not changing.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The poker post might merit a Monday School perspective on risk.\n\n/r/options/comments/qfq82a/poker_wisdom_for_option_traders_the_evils_of/", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I dunno.

The delta may be much smaller to avoid having the call be challenged by rapid moves upward of the stock price, and also to have a significant gain if the stock is called away via asssignent.  Or he may be doing something else.   \n\n20 to 30 delta is chosen because it is in the vicinity of one standard deviation (68%) of probabillity for the call to expire out of the money, as the market has priced the option at that moment.  Everything can change in the next moment.  \n\nGenerally longer periods are chosen by some traders because the short option becomes more vulnerable to adverse price moves of the stock as expiration approaches; hence many traders exit before the last week (or two) of option life is encountered.  The term for the concern is called \"gamma risk\"; gamma coalesces around at the money as expiration approaches, and the value of the option changes more rapidly if the stock moves adversely, in the final week of option life. \n\nCollars are long stock, short calls (paying for puts), and long puts.  \n\nYour manager may be conducting a more fluid version of this typically static position.     \nSelling calls, and exiting, and separately buying puts, and exiting when the stock is up.    \n\nInsufficient information from you to speculate properly.  \n\nPower Options has a concept on collars different from the typical, in which they propose long term puts, to keep theta decay down, at a strike price slightly above the money, and long stock, with a net capital at risk of somewhere about 10% of total capital in the trade, plus or minus a few percent.

Your third one especially. Hopefully I understood what you wrote accurately.\n\nBut I will try to answer your first one with some thoughts at least; I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong: (1) For me, given the limited # of covered calls I've sold, finding a good deal (right strike, period, premium, delta, etc.) is not trivial. Maybe it's easier if you just buy for the sake of selling covered calls but the assets I hold, mostly index ETFs and leveraged index ETFs, are ones I seek to hold. That said, I have found some promising deals with leveraged ETFs and they're also priced so it's doable to do one to ten contracts (unlike say QQQ - 100 shares of QQQ is \\~27K now). So first point is that it's not \"a stock\" but \"100 shares\" (of course you know this, I'm just saying because it's 100 shares, you need 10K of capital to do one contract in your example which is a limitation for many people).  (2) The period also - once you sell the CC, you're stuck with those shares and can't do anything until expire or you roll it or close it. Overall this I feel is a lack of flexibility but could just be my perception. You could have a weekly expiry where mid-week it goes up above $110 in your example and then comes back down to $90 and because it wasn't end of week, it doesn't get called away. Whereas if you didn't do the CC you'd have the control and you could set the limit order to make happen at any time (*this is likely the most direct answer your first question*).  I see this as an additional risk (i.e., it has to be above $110 AT EXPIRY, not just any time prior, even though your shares could be called away any time, they almost certainly won't until expiry as I understand it). (3) Finally, if the premium for the 10% profit in your example is 1%, then it makes a lot of sense to do the CC (for me), so your profit potentially could be 11%. But if it is pennies, may not be worth it.\n\nI think these perceived criticisms of mine about CCs segue into your last two questions. There is probably some situation/scenario where if the asset goes up above $110 prior to expiry, you could close and then sell the asset? Or close the option for a credit or perhaps a debit that makes sense. Right? If the asset goes to $115, you could close the CC for $1 debit, and still come out ahead by $4 by selling the shares yourself. Is this the way to think about it? I don't know.  Though this isn't exactly what you're asking which I think has to do with the time value of options (i.e., by closing early you're cutting into the time value of the options as I understand it). But I do think the answer is that you  may not need to take a loss and at least in my case I'm not exploring/assessing all the possible ways one can come out ahead.\n\nI am interested in hearing answers your third question also. But one scenario where you can keep 100% of your premium and not deal with the stock's price movements temporarily is to roll it over. This is punting the issue but you collect more premium that gives you more time at least (and possibly more premium). The second one is to close it for a net gain/loss of zero. In other words, let it rise to $111, then pay $1 to close it and then sell your shares for $111 (this seems like the most direct answer). Or if you've been rolling it over five times,  and been collecting $1 in premium each time, you can let it expire at $105 and then sell the stock and achieve your goals. What I am learning is that there are many ways to think about options and as newbie I'm not thinking about all of them (i.e., limited in my choices, I suppose like mastery of anything, it's a learning process).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Right?

I too am interested in the answer to that question.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "> But wouldn't everyone who has a take-profit order sitting at a particular level be doing this -- why don't they?\n\nBecause a covered call is not a limit order. A CC usually only gets assigned at or near expiration.\n\n>  I'm having trouble grasping this conceptually: why holding until a certain date protects the initial money I pocketed from the call, but getting out sooner forces me to incur a loss.\n\nLet's use actual numbers to demonstrate.\n\nYou bought XYZ for $100/share. You write a call for $110 and 30 days to expiration for $1 in credit. Your goal is to keep the entire $1 credit and make *at least* $10/share profit when the shares are sold above $110.\n\nHowever, the day after you write the call (29 days to expiration), XYZ rises to $120.69. \n\nThe question you should ask yourself is, what is the value of the call now? \n\nYou know for sure that it must have intrinsic value, since it is ITM. In the case of a call, the intrinsic value is the stock price - strike price, which would be $10.69. So the call is worth *at least* $10.69. However, since there is still plenty of time before expiration, the call also has additional time value, raising it. So the total value of the call is now $11.69.\n\nYou have a call that you sold for $1 that is now worth $11.69. To buy it back, you have pay $11.69. So your net gain/loss on buying is back is $1.00 - $11.69 = -$10.69. There's your loss.\n\nOf course, that's only considering the call. If you also sell the shares when they are worth $120.69, you gross a gain of $20.69/share on just the share sale. Netting everything together is a net profit of $20.69 - $10.69 = $10/share. However, compared to not writing the CC at all and just selling the shares next day (without a $110 limit order, which would have triggered earlier) you'd have $20.69/share net profit. One way or the other, you lost money buying the contract back.\n\nSo that's what happens if you buy to close before expiration. If you hold through expiration and let it get assigned, the contract has been fulfilled. You keep the contract premium you were paid and you deliver the shares that your contracted to sell. You don't have to buy the call back, the owner of the contract keeps it and receives the shares you must deliver. The owner then pays you the contracted amount, which is the strike price.\n\nIt's exactly the same as what you hear about in the news about some celebrity or professional athlete wanting to \"buy themselves out of their contract.\" They may have to pay more than the contract is currently worth in order to get out of it. But if they just let the contract expire without renegotiating it, they are now a free agent with no extra money out of pocket.\n\n> Last question: is there a way to \"replicate\" this flattening, such that I can keep the initial premium from the call, but be totally done with the stock -- i.e., no longer affected by the stock's price movement -- before the expiration?\n\nProbably best to stop calling it \"flattening\", since there is already a commonly used term for getting out of a CC. It's \"buy to close\".\n\nShort answer: No (it's actually maybe, see last item below). It's a contract. You're asking if there is a loophole in the contract that lets you get all the benefit but none of the drawback. Why would the buyer of the contract agree to let you have all the benefit? What's in it for them to let you do that?\n\nYou either abide by the terms of the contract or you buy yourself out of the contract. Those are the only two alternatives.\n\nThere are things you can do on the side in addition, like buy 100 more shares at $100/share price. So if the price rises to $110 before expiration, you can dump at least 100 shares right away, while the other 100 are still tied up in the contract.\n\nYou can also roll out the call to a later expiration. That doesn't really solve the problem, it just kicks the can down the road, since your shares are still locked up in a contract.\n\nYou can buy a call and turn the CC into a covered spread, but buying the call costs money and will probably use up all the premium you collected and probably more, violating the requirement of keeping all the premium. And your shares are still locked up in the contract, though some brokers may allow you to sell the shares and turn the spread until an uncovered spread.\n\nYou could sell a put at the same strike and turn it into a covered straddle (or a different strike and a covered strangle) and *maybe* if you have the highest approval level for option trading your broker will let you sell the shares and turn the covered into an uncovered spread. That would satisfy all your requirements. But again, this isn't cost-free.

And that’s a very good question I keep asking myself. Would the world tank it’s economy to win a war?\n\nWe’ve got to look at who is “the world” to answer that question. The world is really two camps: \n\n—politicians and their followers in one camp (would not want the pain of tanked economies) \n\n—are led subtly by news (quoting think tanks) who are funded by money interests in the other camp (make money during tanking economies and war times). \n\nNone of us in US want to see democracy defeated by invading tyrants. Democracies across the globe are United in this sentiment  \n\nHow long will the war continue?\nAs long as the sentiment among voters and politicians is in agreement with the news feeds that get their data from the think tanks who are funded by Defense Contractors. \nIt’s in Defense contractor’s best profit interests to prolong the war. Interestingly, the think tanks they fund are the best data sources on the war, the sources news reporters quote. So our news is Fed to us by Defense Contractor-funded data. Folks with profit interested in prolonging the war. Folks whose children and families do not live in Europe. Folks who can afford nice vacations and who do not feel the pain of higher food or gas prices. \n\nThen, consider the issue of who are really going to feel the most pain as the war continues into winter 2022-2023: European voters. Will they cave to Putin? Putin is betting that Europe will cave in. Russian media characterizes Europeans as lazy snd spoiled and soft, not willing to endure hardships. Will Europe cave in? Europeans say they have enough reserves to last the winter. Europeans do not want Putin’s war machine pushing westward into democratic nations. Maybe Europeans will have the Will to ration food and fuel if they need to do it to get through the tail end of winter 2023. \n\nConsider US voters: US is self sufficient in energy and food. We are right now the worlds largest exporter of energy. We are a top exporter of wheat and corn. So why are our food and energy prices so high? Because we are exporting a LOT of what we produce. When voters realize this fact, US voters might start clamoring to reduce US exports in order to reduce US domestic food and energy prices. \n\nAs Blackrock’s Larry Fink, and JPMC’s Jamie Dimon both say, the world is moving toward increasing isolationism. \n\nIndia capped wheat exports. Malaysians capped palm oil exports, though both were weak caps. Yet that’s the trend. Other nations, even Ukraine, have said, “in scarcity, we’ll feed our own people first before we export.”\n\nConsider populace of developing nations (excluding China and India) who do not produce enough food and rely on wheat and corn imports: they are going to have hunger riots. Egypt will likely raise fees for ships passing through Suez Canal to raise money to escalating prices, to buy food imports. What will African nations do? Africa has always been a site of struggle between democracy vs Russian influences, depending on which country donates the most to them. US will donate food we grew ourselves. Russia will donate food it stole from Ukrainian grain silos and confiscated from Ukrainian ships in the Black Sea. \n\nLloyd’s of London plans to stop insuring freighters carrying Russian oil, beginning in September. How is that going to affect Putin’s war efforts? How will Putin retaliate?\n\nWhile it is true that Russia is exporting less oil due to sanctions and more expensive shipping work-arounds, but on the other hand it is also true that Russia is making a lot more money on oil they are selling to India and China, even though selling at 30% discount to what Europe and nations who sanction Russian oil are paying to US and OPEC. \n\nI am asking the same questions you’re asking and am thinking about  positive reinforcing loops, versus negative reinforcing loops in this global economic model. \n\nWhich influential reinforcing loops are strongest? \n\nI am thinking one of the most influential weightings is the US consumer. Of the entire global consumption, if you look for a single most impactful consumer, US consumers consume the most, so I assign US Consumers with the strongest weight in this model.  China’s workforce of producers are also a strong weight. And the producer/consumer dynamics are really interesting. If US pursues isolationism, we can produce and consume what we need. Our laborers are more expensive, so US Consumer prices will be higher in such a scenario, but we have natural resources to do it. China cannot keep growing its economy unless we buy the stuff it produces. China needs oil it gets from Russia but Chine needs to sell its production to US and Europe, mostly China sells to US Consumers. \n\nWhat do US consumers want most right now? Not so much the goods that China produces. US consumers want Services and Experiences. Experiences. Driving, flying. That’s mostly the middle to top income brackets in US. \n\nBut we can’t limp all US Consumers into the “spend-spend-spend- for-fun” category. Because the majority of the US population is not able to go in vacations, those living in multi-person households with household incomes under $50k/yr. \n\nUS Consumers who are starting to use their credit cards more snd more to make ends meet do feel the pinch of higher food and energy prices. It’s the multi-person households making less than $50k/year who feel it most. Heads of households who are working two shifts, two jobs. People who will be first to get laid off in the upcoming slowdowns. \n\nWill the people who are hit the hardest around the world clamor for their governments to DO something to ease the pain? Will that population influence be stronger than the influence of the Defense Contractors?\n\nWhich world will tip the decision scales?\n\nWe want the war over unless we are invested in food and oil and Defense Contractors. And those are the sectors where stock prices are rising. \n\nWhether Powell is weakening Putin by QT is another discussion: look at the global money flow. US banks are loaning money (they don’t have to loan on the Fed banking margin rates —they’re loaning at rates that are whatever the market will bear. \n\nGoldman Sachs just issued a line of credit to Peabody (BTU) at 10%) —lending to fund commodity & commodity domestic & seafaring transportation. The funds flow from US banks to pay for delivery to energy importing countries where the payments are not always in USD, even though loans are repaid yet now the profits  do not come back directly to the US. Fewer buyers of US treasuries. Also, Blackrock (China puts money in Blackrock) is “light on Treasuries” right now. Blackrock (China is big investor) is lending to commodities brokers. \nQT is reducing US bank liquidity. \nFed is rolling back it’s Treasury investments, banks and foreign investors (Russians, OPEC, China)  are not showing up as much any more for Treasury auctions. Nobody wants their US assets seized. So Treasury yields go up to entice investors to Treasury auctions because investment in US Treasuries is down. \nHow is this hurting Putin?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Demand destruction.\n\nIf ppl lose their jobs and income they don't have places to drive to and can't afford gas.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This is the way, sadly.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Future expected layoffs will not be affecting  summer vacation plans that people have already made. \n\nPeople are sticking with their vacation plans\nThe layoffs have only started, \nAnd who will be laid off in the future is still uncertain\nBut people feel like now is the time to grab that vacation after two years of being cooped up", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Oil will only come down if legislation is passed at this point.

It didn't recover until the pandemic-fueled boom.\n\nThis is because when crypto crashes, miners will flood the market with used GPUs, giving bargain prices to gamers. MSRP prices for gaming GPUs doubled during the boom. What happens when GPU prices drop to half of MSRP?\n\nIn the last 3 months, ETH mining profitability has dropped by 50%. 70% in the last 6 months.

They lump both categories into their gaming sales category. Therefore, no one can reliably model the impact.

In 2018, Nvidia only faced the crypto crash. In 2022, Nvidia faces a triple whammy: **recession-risk** (GPUs are a non-essential good and expensive), **people going outside more** (less gaming), and **crypto crash** (mining). While some companies are facing one or two of these issues, very few are impacted by all three.\n\nLike most tech companies during the pandemic-boom, Nvidia also hired a ton of workers and started projects that don't either don't make any money or loses money. Nvidia's employee count went from \\~13,000 to \\~22,000 from 2020 to 2022.\n\nThe question is, is Wallstreet ready for negative Nvidia revenue growth?

{"title": "The next 24 months could change your life.", "selftext": "Hey guys. This post contains advice. Please be careful when taking advice from anyone. Why? Because the people giving the advice never have to deal with the fallout when something bad happens to you. Like all those teachers who told you to take out loans to go to college and now you have huge debts. Anyway.\n\n**The next two years:**\n\nI want to talk about the next 2 years in this post. If this is shaping up to be anything like 2008 then it is possibly going to take around 2 or so years for the market to collapse, bounce around looking for a bottom, and then slowly recover upwards.\n\nWhat this means for you is that you have 2 years to readjust where you are in life to take advantage of the up coming bull run. I can't tell you what to do with your life--maybe if you've ever been interested in programming you can check out something like Leon Noel's full stack free bootcamp, or freecodecamp, or odin or w/e. Maybe you want to advance in your field, in which case you should probably reach out to people on LinkedIn and just start talking with people because internal advancement within a company is typically hard/impossible and not as rewarding as job swapping.\n\nWhatever you end up doing, just make sure you're taking steps to place yourself in a better financial position later on. I mean, you should always be doing this, right? But a lot of people don't. And I'm here to tell you that you should. \n\n**Today:**\n\nNow, what you don't want to do--and I can't stress this enough--is you do not want to be betting against the market right now. I know, the market is going down and it seems like free money. And you might be thinking \"oh if I buy puts against the market, then I'll have more money to buy calls when it bounces.\" Yeah, sure. Because you're so good at timing the market you're going to do it twice? Lol, ok. \n\nWhat will end up happening is you won't have any idea what you're doing and you'll buy puts into a short-term bull rally and lose everything. Small bull rallies do happen in larger bear markets, and they destroy people who think they're going to be cute and buy puts.\n\nNo--a better move is to be buying. We are now under the 200 day moving average on basically everything and the gap will always fill for good companies and for the broader ETFs like SPY. Now is when you want to be buying shares. Not everything at once--but slowly over time.\n\n**Final note:**\n\nRemember what I said at the start of this: the people who give advice do not have to deal with the bad outcomes that follow. That means if you listen to this, and the bear market ends up being worse, or Joe Biden deletes the stock market, then hey--that's life in the big city. I hope you all make money. \n\nKeep it high and tight. \n\n🚀👖", "id": "vbleuu", "created_utc": 1655151667.0, "score": 362, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 188, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|75|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1926|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkujx7/amd_strong_upside_for_this_week/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6qjk/what_nobody_is_telling_you_about_investing_life/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vbleuu)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vbleuu)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I had to double check if I was on the right subreddit when I saw this post.
