{"title": "Gasoline prices top $5 a gallon nationally for the first time and are likely headed higher", "selftext": "The average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline rose above $5 nationally for the first time due to increased demand from the economy reopening from the pandemic and depleted oil supplies stemming in part from the war in Ukraine.\n\nPrices look set to continue rising into the summer months, analysts said.\n\nthe average national price reached $5.004 on Saturday. That’s up from about $3.07 a year ago and a record price not adjusted for inflation. At the end of the week, prices had already averaged $5 or more in about 20 states, with the highest prices on the West Coast.\n\n“By my calculations, the typical household is spending about $160 more on gas a month than a year ago,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “That’s a big bite.”\n\nGasoline prices normally peak in mid-May, but this year they have continued to rise and the average price is about 65 cents higher than a month ago. Due to short supplies this year, analysts are forecasting that prices may not top out until mid-July, when summer driving season traditionally peaks.\n\n“I don’t think we’re far away” from the highest prices, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “I don’t think it would eclipse $5.50. I would say $5.25 is the top, but again, the market is unhinged.”\n\nHowever, if there are any serious refinery outages this summer, or disruptions from hurricanes, gasoline prices could spike, he added.\n\nGasoline is in shorter supply than normal because the U.S. has lost about 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity, since before the pandemic. At the same time, sanctions on Russian energy has sent oil prices sharply higher and created tight supplies of both oil and fuel globally.\n\nAnalysts say while consumers are feeling pain at the pump, the price of fueling a car with gasoline is not as big a part of a household’s spending as it had been in the past. That is in part due to more efficient vehicles.\n\nAccording to a CNBC analysis, drivers were spending an estimated average 20 cents per mile on gasoline as of June this year, even with the steep price increases.

Investors got burned from 2014-2020 because of shale oil. Many small time oil companies were bankrupt from this time period. They don't want a repeat of that. The Saudi's intentionally flooded the market with cheap oil from this same period because they wanted to weed out the other oil producers who couldn't survive with the smaller margins. Only the big players could survive. If you check the stock performance of oil companies from 2014, you were basically losing money while the rest of the stock market climbed significantly.\n2. Refining capacitiy is down because the ROI isn't there to justify building a new one when renewables are becoming a higher point of focus.\n3. The U.S. government is disincentivizing the drilling of new oil fields. Regulations are incredibly high. At the end of the day, oil companies operate the same as a regular mom-and-pop business: \"Does it make financial sense?\" The answer right now is no. You might remember the Keystone Pipeline XL being shut down. Well, it was initially approved so work was started. After spending a projected total of $15 billion, TC Energy then had their permit revoked by Biden. Ask yourself: Why would anyone want to take that risk? Yes, it might be allowed now. But just as easily, it can be shut down. That uncertainty is at a level where it becomes unappealing.\n4. The war decreases the amount of available oil supply because of sanctions imposed. This means you have more countries bidding on the same supply of oil driving the prices up higher.\n5. OPEC has ZERO incentive to increase the supply and lower the prices. Saudi Arabia, for instance, knows that oil is finite and that their cash cow won't be around in say, 20 years. They have been divesting away from oil quickly in preparation of this. That is why you are seeing Saudi Arabia spend billions of $ in other areas to ramp up their economy.\n\nIs it Biden's fault? The serious answer is no but the long answer is his initiatives are making is increasingly difficult for oil companies to want to increase production and refining capacity. When you want to go green, there is a transition that will happen. This is that transition period where you are going to see high oil prices for the foreseeable future in the hopes that it will pay off in the long run when renewables are the dominant player and EV's become the norm.

Btw, the $2t includes both stimulus and unemployment\n\nThe reason I’d say that the factors you mention aren’t the main cause of the inflation we’re experiencing today is that most of the costs have been driven from the costs of raw materials increasing. Logistics costs increasing. Companies competing for limited supply and having to spend more to secure the inventory they need to build their product. Those raw materials aren’t generally supplied by US-based workers. We lost that years ago. Some dude holding out for $15/hour before he returns to Kroger won’t reduce the price and availability of distributors for a Ford F-150, or the cost of the PCA’s and chips that go in … everything. Those things are constrained by government actions in China, Taiwan and Malaysia\n\nLooking forward, higher prices will lead to demands for more salaries, or increases in unemployment claims, etc. inflation begets inflation.

Only to countries friendly to UK and Western interests such as Taiwan. This is where TSMC comes into play, since they (currently) have a stake in ASML which they bought primarily to fund the development of the new 5nm manufacturing process. This also gets them a certain amount of preferential treatment and TSMC gets the latest and greatest stuff first. And while TSMC isn't state-owned, it like most companies of strategic importance has a cosy and mutually beneficial relationship with the government.\n\nIf we briefly look at a map of Taiwan, we can see that the Western side is nearer to China. It's also where damn near everything is. Everything [including TSMC's semiconductor fabs.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/z9JRSRH1TWD9Eh8X8) So if China was to hypothetically launch a strike from the likes of [somewhere on the perimeter of Haitan Bay,](\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/7Gx4EFyanmYjdhG67) which is about 140km away from the fabs, they could *easily* destroy a lot of TSMC's equipment. Likewise, when we consider that China apparently has missile systems which can reach [as far as 300km away](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2127346/king-explosives-who-extended-firing-range-chinas) this is nowhere near outside the realm of possibility. Also, the Chinese manufacturing apparatus is *very* good, and I'd hazard a guess that they use home-grown chips in their missiles as well. They may  not be cutting edge, but they don't exactly need to be. They just need to get from A to B and explode at the end of it all.\n\nSo let's say that China launches a special military operation against Taiwan and starts a massive missile bombardment against the country, hoping to break the place like Russia tried with Ukraine. And let's say they succeed. Once again this is also not outside the realm of possibility since the KMT's (the main opposition party) operating principles were basically along the lines of, [\"let's work with China and see if we can make them see things our way.\"](https://international.thenewslens.com/article/116615) until very recently, if they don't still think the same way. Then China gets Taiwan and everything that comes with it, including TSMC. And let's say TSMC's factories are caught in the crossfire. That's fine, the Taiwanese (now Chinese) government will simply provide the money to rebuild them. And ASML would probably have to say yes to TSMC asking to be rebuilt because they're a stakeholder. Carl-Zeiss out in Germany, who makes the lenses for ASML's EUV equipment on the other hand, wouldn't necessarily have to say yes to ASML's request for a new lens for TSMC because TSMC's equipment was blown to pieces however, particularly if the German government steps in-which they could reasonably be expected to do since they're one of the Netherlands' major trading partners (Thank EU!). The same to a lesser extent for Panasonic. So China still doesn't get in.\n\nThat's a major reason why China hasn't launched any strikes or other operations against Taiwan. While China is effectively the world's factory, they [can't catch up with TSMC](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3154121/chinas-chip-champion-can-smic-lead-beijings-quest-semiconductor-self) because they can't create their own EUV machines, and companies such as Motorola (owned by Lenovo) rely on chips built by TSMC to keep up with the competition.

I mean all country hold various kinds of currencies in reserve, not just USD. Why? Because they think they can get something back from us. So as long as we are producing things other countries want, we can exchange those things for the things we want from them.\n\nYou can take China as an example. When China was a developing country, they exported a lot of the things that they produced to the US in exchange for dollars. They then use those dollars to purchase the advanced technology and whatever else they needed to improve their economy.\n\nDecades later, China has advanced significantly. Now they are at the point where they can develop their own technology; they don't need to rely on the US as much anymore. They can stop sending all the things they produce overseas, and instead, consume those things themselves. The more they do so, the fewer dollars they will hold.\n\nThis is not really something that we can stop. If China doesn't find it worthwhile to hold our dollars anymore, there's not a lot we can do about that. And I would argue that we shouldn't worry about that anyway. If China doesn't want to make our cheap goods, then we can reinvest in American manufacturing and make them ourselves (or, more realistically, switch to some other developing country which IS happy to export to us in exchange for dollars).\n\nThe so-called reserve currency status of the USD was simply an outcome of the economic period of WWII. Back then, when countries still linked their currencies to gold, countries with an export surplus wound up with plenty of gold. And in the post war period, When Europe was deeply in debt and economically in shambles, who had all the gold? The United States. And we used that exorbitant privilege to our full advantage by lending money to everybody. Part of the deal was that countries wouldn't redeem their dollars even though the technically should be able to.\n\nOf course, pretty soon we sent abroad way more dollars then we had gold in reserve. So we inevitably left the gold standard. At the point, whatever \"exorbitant privilege\" we had before was gone. Our currency wasn't qualitatively special; it was just popular. As countries rebuilt or developed, it was inevitable that we would lose that special place. Now we are in an era where the last illusion of us being the \"world's reserve currency\" is disappearing. Yes, our currency is widely held and used. But that is based only on the power of our economy to produce things that other countries want. Beyond that, many countries wish to get away from hiding and using dollars for other more political reasons.

Our founding fathers were very set on NOT being a democracy.  They were far more intelligent than we are today.  3) Trump tried to shut down travel to China in January and was called a racist, meanwhile Pelosi, Schumer and many others were begging people to go out to parades and events all the way into March.  Get your facts straight.  5) 2 sentences didn’t incite anything.  And if you listened to everything he said, he didn’t want people to do anything dangerous, he wanted to have their feelings known.  However, the FBI agents that were undercover who were riling people up to attack sure played a part.  They are on many videos if you take a minute to look.  Also, plenty of video showing staged scenes at White House that day by people there.  6) Trumps wall would have cost $6B and provided a lot of security for the southern boarder.  As evidence by the areas a wall was built.  However, the same democrats that are on pace to donate $100B to Ukraine (and I’m sure 10% to the big guy) said it cost too much.   7) There still is zero evidence of Stormy Daniel’s, and in fact she is suing the sleezbag lawyer who represented her.  8) Trump was impeached by a patrician banana republic with no proof or evidence.

I seem to recall Nokia had one a while back as well, but I can’t seem to find proof at this point. Those cameras are becoming more frequent, so at some point the usual big companies will follow suit if it takes off.\n\nNext, you should consider how it’s viewed. The video you linked uses the phone to scan around, but true VR will almost certainly use a headset like the Oculus. VR Web Browsers such as Janus & Firefox Reality have largely been closing down lately, but there are still browsers like Wolvic around.\n\nFinally, it may be worth keeping an eye on sites like PornHub to see what companies start to develop it more & more. Yes, this is a financial excuse to look at porn. If you start to see more trends & more views on a particular company’s style, it’s possible that could be a good company to follow financially.

The reason they have such a big bubble is the same as Japan in the 80's - they are printing money to lower their currency values in order to lower their exchange rate in order to get more foreign trade sales.  This is starting to stop working because labor is starting to become too expensive and outsourcing is now moving to lower cost countries.  The reason China has been into Africa recently isn't because they want to conquer africa or some shit (nobody even wants to conquer africa even if they could do so) - it's so they can offload their low cost production economy onto them while taking over all the middle mercantile layer of trade to funnel all sales of the stuff that will be made in Africa through chinese companies.  The problem is, there's really no way to do this fast enough and the problem is here now.  Look at Japan.  Their economy went from world striding colossus to deflated soy boy in only a few years.\n\nThe other problem they have is Xi is making himself into an emporor for life and when people become kings, their brains check out.

{"title": "$SPY - Predictions for the week of 6/13", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/c2jzxqicu0591.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=a99e14cc79d7a8029044dc59b2709c40284e204f)\n\nSimple TA I will be watching\n\nResistance Area \\~432 \\~412\n\nStrong Support Area \\~388\n\nRSI < 10 is very oversold (currently a weak indicator though)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzjz4qkkw0591.png?width=1423&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff5c6ffe32014f2be393db93cb1b22d3e153cd1d\n\nAfter $SPY was rangebound for over a week there was finally a breakout led by negative news.  Some people are not realizing how bad the 8.6% CPI report was... the highest analyst estimate was 8.5%.  Our government is not being honest about the current economic situation (not that I would expect them to be).  The federal reserve has been consistently wrong about inflation over the past 2 years.  There is one thing that they are being honest about, inflation needs to be brought down fast.  Jerome Powell already knows he needs to save reserve currency status and bring down inflation as fast as possible.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/l99m90dxx0591.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ac8bd7ba32d355e0f2708a9f72cac2a26df7b74)\n\nThe bond market has always been a very good indicator of what the federal reserve will follow for the effective rate.  The 6-month and 2-year yields are what I like to check.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/9f10iba901591.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ada35e9b96a8b4f2a8975ab47a2d2a61bde5d98)\n\nThe goal is for the effective rate to reach the 6-month yields, a spread of more than 50bp in the 6-month yields and effective rate will most likely signal a rise in rates.  There are 2 possibilities for next week when Jerome Powell decides how much to raise rates (Purple Line - 75bp rise, Blue Line - 50bp rise).  At the current 6-month yield a 50bp rate hike would equal a 46bp spread from the 6-month yield.  I think the federal reserve will be watching what the equity markets are anticipating... shown above if the 6-month price continues to drop and the yield increase to around 2.23% then I will say there is a 99% chance of a 75bp rate hike.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9tgyaf931591.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7de398e8afd784af07e63ebfbd7d1bb8210fd65\n\nThe 30Y - 5Y bond yields were also inverted this week,  the bond market always shows the economy's health... and right now it is warning of a recession.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pht8ks04a1591.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ca461acebd5b28e07faafee5ef19ef14c0773ef\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vuqefvpv41591.png?width=1268&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3c37c9a7bb6d75c89c0c0da0e6871a296c2d1b2\n\nAnother problem is that our government thinks the economy is strong, this is because consumers keep spending and spending.  This spending is not lasting though and has started to slow down from inflationary pressures.  People are now borrowing money and using their savings just to keep up with inflation.  This cannot last much longer.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Federal Reserve Calander](https://preview.redd.it/wjuyr99lf1591.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef02627fc8e7e7291768fc110d2675623a4d522b)\n\nAlso, 8:30 AM on Tuesday is PPI\n\n**Recap**\n\n$SPY should be rangebound again this week, there shouldn't be any closing price under 388 or above 400.  If 6-month yields rise to about 2.23% expect a 75bp rate hike, otherwise 50bp.\n\n[5-day outlook is kind of a joke don't take this serious](https://preview.redd.it/c5kbndtvh1591.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f609c770c7d8cbaf806cd193ecdd9204b40901f)\n\nI will respond to every comment!", "id": "va460m", "created_utc": 1654974091.0, "score": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|31|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|851|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ukkumd/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_59/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skwpds/spy_current_week_analysis_next_week_predictions/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcoh2o/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_314/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/swfwtz/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_221/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7jifc/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_37/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sqwd9c/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_214/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t23ypl/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_228/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/va460m/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_613/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/upmtnf/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_516/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tp494n/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_328/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uaa3k6/the_real_reason_behind_the_invasion_spy/) \n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=va460m)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=va460m)\n    \nHey /u/5k4_5k4, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "My dogs birthday is on Wednesday.

Think that macro is terrible, awful. FOMC needs to provide a solid package of sanitation measures, IMO they can't or at least shouldn't keep BP hike at 50, people needs the increase to feel the gov it's really trying to solve it, even tho it prob will be negative to the market as well. These two scenarios will probably end with SPY crossing 380 again, at least to kiss once 370's. Mate, I think that luckily tomorrow Monday will reach +1.5% approx at some point, maybe that should be your moment to close these positions, Tuesday as OP said prob will end flat or more likely negative.
