Apple languished in obscurity in the 90s and was near bankruptcy before expanding into personal gadgets like iPod and iPhone. All of these companies had strong cash flows in the past and were a mainstay of consumer products. And I’m telling u the success stories. Cisco never recovered from their dotcom bubble heights. Neither did yahoo. Whatever happened to MySpace. The same question is being posed right now to FB. They’re losing the social media game, Facebook.com is mostly irrelevant and constantly being challenged by regulations, Instagram probably being the only relevant and “cool” social media, even then, younger kids are using tiktok, WhatsApp is a mainstay outside of the US but no clear path towards monetization. And so they plan to expand into the “meta verse” - I have no fucking idea what it means. I think most people don’t understand exactly what it’s supposed to mean - so far it just sounds cool. I don’t think we will live like in ready player one. I don’t think VR will have nearly the Revolutionary potential of the personal gadgets - although I concede I might be wrong and possibly biased because VR headsets make me dizzy and nauseous and I don’t even play video games. I believe this is what the market is assessing. Sure they’re making money now, but for how long, and they are burning through tens of billions per year into an idea that could possibly never become reality.\n\nThat’s not to say that FB is done, but pricing FB as a growth company when there’s no clear path towards growth is not gonna happen and that will bring down its P/E valuations which is what we’re seeing.

I'm not confident or educated enough in any one company to do that, but doing that across, as I said, 5-10 companies which you TRULY believe in is a wise strategy IMO.\n\nNames that I'm looking at very closely right now (none that I currently have a position in): APPS, META, SOFI, COIN, PLTR, AMD, PUBM, WELL, SHOP. Some of those are IMO very undervalued, most are profitable, and most are growing at a crazy clip.\n\nI also really like BITF, PINS, NVEI. Those I do hold positions in.\n\nThe point is that these are names which have taken unbelievable beatings. You have to find companies in that area which you believe have been unfairly sold off to unreasonable levels. Look for profitability, high growth, low debt, gaining market share, growing margins.\n\nAt the moment, I feel it's never been easier to find companies that are so attractive by so many metrics. But they're basically all in growth, biopharma, fintech. Sectors that people HATE right now. People will love them again in time. It's the same story with oil. People HATED oil last year. I was mocked for buying oil and gas companies in 2020 and 2021. Same will happen with the things people hate currently.\n\nJust be selective. There is plenty to choose from but not all is worth touching. There are all sorts of growth companies which have terrible financials or just struggle like hell toward profitability. Some are no longer growth, it has stalled. You have to look around for yourself and see what you like.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Some good REIT buys now as well.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Don’t use margin and don’t enter the same stocks you were in.

The S&P 500 is down 11% from the last year. Basically to be that bad you have to have really tried to invest in speculation only, non recognizable stocks, meme stocks, etc. \n\nYou have to recognize when something is a lost cause and cut the losses before it's too late. The red flags usually show waaaay in advance but here's some general advice.\n\nFirst of all, do you actually understand what the company you invested in does? Like TRULY understand what the company does, not just \"oh well they do this\" and you can't describe what the thing they make is or how it's useful? It really has felt like a ton of people who don't understand tech started overrating stocks without even understanding what the company actually does. \n\nA great example is the recent Snowflake IPO. This company was HEAVILY overvalued and I knew it when it went public. That's because it had a ton of buzzwords around what kind of company it was, what it did, people didn't understand though. They saw \"cloud data company\" and assume \"oh this must be a good company\". But what even is a \"cloud data company\"? First of all Snowflake likely doesn't even have their own cloud, they probably use Amazon's or Microsoft or someone else's. Second of all, as someone that actually worked with Snowflake in a professional setting, like actually met with one of their engineers and worked with a customer that was looking to integrate Snowflake with my company's product at the time. Snowflake is literally a database. Now in what world is a company that solely makes a database worth the insane evaluation that it was given when it IPO'd? Then you have to look at what happened since, well it went up with everyone else and now it's down to half the value that it IPO'd for.\n\nSo once again take a chance to really understand what the company you invested in actually makes, understand what their true value added to society is. Take a second to think about, who is their primary target consumer, are they B2B, are they retail, what is their primary subsection of the market they target? Don't invest too much into a single sector of the market, don't over invest in tech or retail or food services, find a way to spread to multiple sectors. \n\nAlso look at the historical data of the company, see how it has grown over the last few years and truly understand if the growth makes sense.\n\nI will say though, of the stocks you picked I would've held onto DIS  and not pulled out so quickly. If you look at DIS historical evaluations they have essentially topped what their current stock value is in more normal market settings. I never liked PYPL, their product just seems too easy to replicate and has too many competitors. They're essentially competing with banks. They're just the middle man to me, not worth investing in. PENN, never invest in gambling stocks, these guys literally want to profit off other people's addiction and stupidity, you probably would've been better off taking the money you put into the stock and putting into bets on their platform. ROKU, this company has been around for years and I've seen their product and always thought it was a piece of trash, always felt like Amazon and Google had released better products to compete in their area. They always felt like an \"RC Cola\" type of company.

At the moment, those look to me like China stocks (already starting to rebound, were the first to drop), tech growth stocks (careful here, but it may be close to bottom), and bio (looks like it may be starting to rebound). \n\nIf you don't want to pick individual stocks you could track indexes that follow sectors and trade the 3X leveraged ETFs. This is definitely the approach I would take with bio because the individual stocks are incredibly volatile for reasons that are hard to predict. You don't want to be holding these 3X leveraged ETFs for a long time (more than a few months) but they are much more risk on way to trade sectors. I wouldn't take that approach with the tech stocks, I would look for stocks that have taken 90%ish drops and trade mean reversions/reversals. \n\nFor bio and china sectors, the 3X leverages etfs are:\n\nChina: YINN (going up) / YANG (going down)\n\nTech Growth: LABU (going up) / LABD (going down)\n\nIf we start truly entering a reversal in bio, you could see LABU 3x to 6x in the course of a few months. \n\nI personally don't trade these too often, but an example of one I'm in now is NRGD (3X leveraged trade that top 10 big us oil companies are going down). I've got a 90% gain on that in the last 2 weeks. But again, you need to TRADE these, you can't invest in them. You need to have other ways to manage your risk. I set hard stops (say 3% from entry), move my stops up to slightly above break even once I'm green on a trade like this, and never allocate more than 20% to any one trade.  \n\nIt also might be worth doing some reading and research on how to trade on the long side on individual stocks when we do eventually enter an uptrending market (wait until the nasdaq composite is in an uptrend, at least until the 10 and 20 day simple moving averages are uptrending).

{"title": "Retail traders haven’t given up on the stock market — and that could mean it has further to fall", "selftext": "As investors search for potential signs of investor exhaustion to gauge whether the bear market in U.S. stocks might have more room to run, a team of analysts warned that retail traders likely still have scope to get more negative on stocks. This in turn may suggest that a full-on market “capitulation” might still lie ahead, even as U.S. stocks extended a rebound on Wednesday from last week’s slump.\n\nAnalysts at Vanda Research led by Marco Iachini said in a weekly research note that while retail interest in U.S. stocks reached its lowest level of the year so far on Tuesday, they still haven’t reached levels of “capitulation” on par with what was witnessed before stocks turned around in December 2018 and March 2020.\n\nWhat might retail capitulation look like? The Vanda team said that during the last two major selloffs in 2020 and late 2018, total “capitulation” didn’t arrive until retail traders had become net sellers of stocks. Using a pair of charts, the Vanda team showed that retail investors became net sellers of stocks for at least a few sessions just before the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.13% began to rebound in both 2018 and 2020.\n\nTo be sure, retail investors are a much bigger force in markets today than they were four years ago, as average daily trading activity by small-time traders has increased substantially, according to flows data collected by Vanda from several of the most popular discount brokerages used by retail traders, including Charles Schwab SCHW, +0.10%, TD Ameritrade and others.\n\nAnd retail interest isn’t the only measure of market “capitulation”, a term that represents signs of exhaustion that typically emerge before stocks bottom out. For example, when it comes to popular market-based measures of capitulation, it’s worth noting that the CBOE Volatility Index, the Wall Street “fear gauge” that reflects expectations for market volatility over the coming 30 days based on activity in options markets, has yet to flash its most closely watched exhaustion signal.\n\nAs MarketWatch pointed out in a story from May, investors typically associate a reading above “40” on the VIX with capitulation. The gauge topped out above 80 in November 2008 and again in March 2020. But it has yet to cross this threshold so far this year. Then again, every selloff is different. During the selloff in March 2020, the S&P 500 fell 34% in just 23 trading days. This year’s selloff has been drawn out over a much longer period with the S&P 500 falling more than 20% over a span of almost six months. Still, U.S. stocks appear headed for the worst first-half performance since 1932, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\n**To read the full story and to view charts-** [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-u-s-stocks-rebound-analysts-warn-signs-of-genuine-capitulation-remain-elusive-11655922860?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-u-s-stocks-rebound-analysts-warn-signs-of-genuine-capitulation-remain-elusive-11655922860?mod=home-page)", "id": "vir3lt", "created_utc": 1655968995.0, "score": 143, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "Retail has been constantly bombarded for years now about time in the market, investing, don't sell in downturns etc. We've all seen 2 or 3 crashes in the last 20 years and rich people scooping up cheap shares and become wealthier and wealthier.

{"title": "AMD stock now at a ‘reasonable valuation’ after near-50% pullback, Morgan Stanley says", "selftext": "If the semiconductor surge comes to an end, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. could be best positioned to sustain the pullback, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote Wednesday.\n\nAMD AMD, -0.05% shares performed slightly better Wednesday compared with those of other chip makers, which saw shares decline overall, after Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of the stock now that Xilinx, which was acquired in February, is firmly a part of AMD. Morgan Stanley was identified as the lead financial adviser for Xilinx, when the deal was announced in October 2020.\n\nAnalyst Joseph Moore established an overweight rating and $103 price target, writing that the company “offers potential for solid numbers at a reasonable valuation,” given its near-50% selloff from late-November highs. “Overall, we are optimistic that the company’s prospects in data center (CPU, GPU, and FPGA) will provide enough growth to drive further positive estimate revisions over the next several quarters,” Moore said in a note.\n\nAMD shored up its data-center offerings when it closed on its purchase of Xilinx, which specializes in field-programmable gate array, or FPGA, chips that can be configured by a customer or a designer after they are made. Those chips, in turn, are used as accelerators in data centers to boost computing power and improve power efficiency in existing physical spaces. \n\n“Apprehensions we see in the consumer linked end-markets should leave AMD less exposed comparatively than key competitors, allowing us to underwrite conservative numbers that shouldn’t surprise much to the downside,” Moore said.\n\nAnalysts are concerned that the explosion in semiconductor sales amid a pandemic-influenced supply crunch could lead to a severe downturn in the months ahead, as inventories build and customers halt purchases. That has been a major factor in a strong downturn for chip stocks in the first half of the year. “While a digestion phase in PCs and consoles appears likely, and we are budgeting for some caution next year, we believe strength in server (with further market share gains) should allow the company to keep posting solid growth at a now reasonable valuation,” Moore said.\n\nSeparately, AMD announced late Wednesday it appointed Mathew Hein to the position of chief strategy officer, effective Monday. Hein comes from investment banking firm DBO Partners, where he was lead adviser to AMD “on a number of opportunities.” Up until 2013, Hein worked at Morgan Stanley for 17 years, where Hein held positions such as Technology Investment Banking Group managing director, and global head of Semiconductor Banking. Reporting directly to AMD Chief Executive and Chair Lisa Su, “Hein will be responsible for advancing the company’s strategy across an expanded market for high-performance and adaptive computing solutions and will work closely with the AMD executive team to accelerate the company’s next phase of growth.”\n\nEarlier in the month, AMD doubled-down on its commitment to expand its data center offerings, and forecast average annual revenue growth of about 20% over the next three to four years, while sticking to its second-quarter and annual forecast provided in early May. \n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet expect revenue of $6.43 billion for the second quarter, compared with AMD’s estimated $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion, and $26.2 billion for the year, based on AMD’s estimate of about $26.3 billion.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-stock-now-at-a-reasonable-valuation-after-near-50-pullback-morgan-stanley-says-11655920462?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-stock-now-at-a-reasonable-valuation-after-near-50-pullback-morgan-stanley-says-11655920462?mod=home-page)", "id": "viyn5d", "created_utc": 1655995679.0, "score": 587, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 212, "comments": [{"body": "Genuinely to many stocks like AMD I want to be pouring money into.

I do not see how it can be more attractive than just regular video chats where you see the actual person.  What am I missing?\n\nI've used VR headsets many many times and have owned one of my own...one of my biggest issues is that you get fatigued with that headset on your face pretty fast.  It puts weight on your face, it makes you too warm, and my eyes get fatigued staring at that screen for an extended period of time.\n\nFurthermore, with a video chat, you see the actual person, not just some animated cartoony looking version of them.  With a video chat, you see a person's subtle facial expressions, whereas the metaverse characters only pick up body movements and I don't see how they'd ever get to the point where they can pick up on every little facial expression that an actual video can pick up.\n\nI do think the metaverse can produce some really fun gaming opportunities, although I still feel they're a bit gimmicky.  I have noticed that Mark Zuckerberg seems to focus primarily on the business application of the metaverse.  I just don't understand how the metaverse can convince any significant number of businesses to buy metaverse equipment and get into the whole metaverse, when we already have video chat capabilities.\n\nI believe Zuckerberg is a smart guy, but I don't understand how going ALL IN on the metaverse can possibly be a good idea.  Obviously there are other players in the metaverse space (not just Meta/Facebook), but Meta seems to the the furthest along and they're pouring billings of dollars into this.  The thing is, I think the traditional Facebook businesses are a solid investment.  Their \"Reels\" are growing very rapidly. 50% of the time people spend on facebook is on videos...a lot of that is Reels.  20% of time on Instagram is on Reels.  They're fighting back well against Tiktok.  But the fact that they've changed their name to Meta and they're going all in on the Metaverse makes it impossible for me to invest.\n\nThoughts? Am I missing something?\n\nEDIT: Okay a bunch of you keep bringing up how the Internet was initially viewed as a fad, implying the metaverse is destined to explode like the Internet.

The metaverse buzz word that everyone is talking about is, in very laymen's terms, the next iteration of the internet (i.e. internet 3.0) where most of the world wide web is decentralized but secured and run off of independent blockchain technology. So with that in mind, understand that VR and metaverse are not the same thing. You might use VR or AR peripherals to navigate this new iteration of the internet. But VR wouldn't necessarily be the only way to do that.\n\nThere is some confusion with this mainly because the term \"metaverse\" is associated with Facebook's rebranding and also they've been trying to develop their own cryptocurrency but also metaverse is associated with places like Decentraland and the Sandbox which are virtual worlds run on blockchain. Note you don't necessarily need a headset to visit these places (i don't believe the Sandbox even supports it yet) but I hardly would consider those places \"the internet\" and i seriously doubt they have the potential to become internet 3.0. \n\nWith that cleared up, there really isn't much you could do to invest in \"the metaverse\" right now outside of investing in Facebook or buying stock in HTC or other VR companies. You could buy virtual land in places like the Sandbox but beyond that there really isn't much else.\n\nTalking about headsets. I don't think the headset / VR fatigue you mention is a big deal. I own an HTC Vive (pretty old by today standards). Yes fatigue was initially a problem, but in my case I eventually overcame it, and I've heard others experience the same. Also the software/games level of polish makes a big difference in how fatigued you get after a set amount of time and developers have been getting better at improving this. I can report that, at least in my case, I no longer get fatigued after 3-4 hours of playing something like VTOL VR which would of normally drain me within an hour or so. I think this is largerly due to me just getting used to it. I often go 5-6 hours now but I've got a full time job and a family so its kind of hard to invest more time into it. I have no doubt that someone (younger) with more time can easily sink in 8-10 hrs or more in a day in VR or even as long as the battery charge lasts.\n\nThe technology is also always getting better. Be it resolution, screen door effect, weight of the headset, wireless-ness (my vive has a fat cord connected to the pc), the software etc. I imagine that initial fatigue is only going to improve and its going to be easier and easier for people to pick up and use a VR headset for the first time. I imagine its similar to when you use any other peripheral for the first time. Think back when things like a monitor, the mouse or keyboard (typewriters) came out for the first time. Everyone didn't immediately become comfortable with them. There's an initial fatigue/learning threshold that you can only get over if you keep using it and get used to the device. But then the technology improves and eventually it just clicks. Do people still get fatigued using an LCD screen anymore? Haven't heard of that in a long time.\n\nGoing back to the virtual land. I just don't see places like the Sandbox being this big next thing. I say that because they remind me so much of when Second Life or yet older Active Worlds had just come out. And everyone was raving about how those were going to be the future.\n\nI think with the newer places like the Sandbox the decentralization aspect is both its main appeal and its main flaw. Its nice that there is this raw freedom and frontier feel associated with virtual land sort of giving everyone the creative freedom to do what they want. But have you actually been there to look at how chaotic and nonsensical everything turns out to be? The Sandbox is like wandering through the acid trip of a stranger.

Here’s my take which is not grounded in any sort of reality, but might give a similar glimpse of the future they’re planning:\n\nHumans experience life via electrical impulses in the brain. Those come from sensory organs, but the output of those organs is still electrical impulses. \n\nEventually, we will reach the point where those impulses can be controlled and sent directly to the brain. Like in the matrix. But likely wirelessly, with very little wetware. Elon is working on a brain stimulating device. Eventually it will jump to the consumer market. \n\nWhen that happens, you’ll need an environment for people to go that is familiar. The most popular environments will likely be similar to what we are used to, at least until customers get their “Meta-legs” like sailors get “sea-legs”. \n\nThis is basically opening up an entire parallel market to sell goods (clothes and products), meta-estate (it’s not real), services (someone to level up for you, or design you an evil lair for your 20 gigabytes worth of server space), experiences (forget raves, you could experience whatever crazy shit a programmer could imagine). \n\nIt also would provide an enormous amount of user data for sale to advertisers. Not just what you might be interested in, but what you emotionally respond to. \n\nThere’s practical applications as well: telework, virtually traveling places, entertainment, etc. \n\nAI will have its place there, as you’ll need people to talk to when everyone else is logged off.\n\nAll of this hinges on the brain stimulation technology, which is likely being quietly developed by a ton of private companies including Facebook. But it sounds like they are focusing less on the hardware and more on the software: the ecosystem itself. A literal walled garden for you to live in. \n\nAnd it’s a proven value generator. Look at MMORPGs and the marketplaces they provide. Or super boring, popular games like the Sims and Animal Crossing, and how much time and money people put into that. \n\nImmortality could be achieved by creating a custom AI based on your “self”. You could live in paradise for as long as the servers are running, which is long after your body has died. If the sensory inputs are the same, what’s the difference? (And meta would be charging you a fee for as long as you want to live). Maybe you pay for it by working as everything is digital nowadays. Or maybe your grandkids would pay so they’ll never have to suffer the loss of their grandparents. \n\nBasically, this is the future, there’s too much potential profit in it for it not to happen, and Meta is trying to get there first to set the rules that everyone else will eventually have to abide by. Is it a sure thing? I think so, but likely not in our lifetimes. Is Meta is sure thing?

Their revenue is record high.  Their earnings are near record.  They have over twice the growth rate of any other streaming service on the market, short Prime which is basically even with pace but sells a wider array under the Prime umbrella, and short Disney because, well...Disney.  Even so, only Prime matches the numbers, and even Disney and every other streaming service has half or less of the viewership.  So nearly everything is half or less of Netflix with less growth rate than Netflix, even through Q1 and Q2 this year.\n\nNetflix IS losing 1 million subscribers due to Russia sanctions.  And it's true Q1 was flat.  But even Q1 was above growth trend and more so a reaction to overly high Q4 growth last year.  Yeah, you hear about Q1 being \"bad,\" but nobody's talking about the well above normal growth Q4 last year, not a peep about that.\n\nReally, this whole mess seems like a marketing smear campaign and little else, and a number of the news articles came from Paramount, who is pushing their Paramount Plus platform.\n\nThe odd thing about this is that no streaming service is actually competing with any other.  Consumers aren't picking one or the other.  There has been NO downturn of subscribers when new streaming services entered the market, even when many entered at the same time.  People don't pick one or the other.  They pick both.  Right now at least, streaming businesses are NOT in competition.  They are only working to entice people to subscribe in the first place.  After that, done.  People don't step away after that and do not step away when yet another service pops into the market space.  Consumers just aren't being selective at all.  The subscriber numbers across all the major streaming companies repeat this fact.  Their growth trends are all almost dead linear, and not one, not one at all, has ever dropped when a newer service enters the market.\n\nAs for the password sharing.  That's not new.  Netflix has been around for a long time, and this is normal talk for them.\n\nI don't think their move to ads is meant for consumers.  I think it's merely a revenue stream.  I think they're getting a LOT of push by advertisers to buy into the platform.  Again, Netflix has the most subscribers, by far, and advertisers want to be in front of that.  I think this is a tool to make that happen.  This is ONLY a plan for revenue growth for them.  Consumers will decide on how they want to pay, but realistically, Netflix wins both ways and will just make more money.  When they implement, they will make record earnings, period.  And you still won't see people leaving the platform either.  Why?  Because people don't.  Funny thing, policy changes like this or rate changes like this have NEVER resulted in subscriber loss.  Remember me saying growth rate is linear?  Yeah, it is.  It always has been despite over half a dozen price increases.  Customers don't care, not existing ones, not new ones.  Growth is steady.  So this lower tier, ads, whatever, it won't matter.  Subscribers will grow, and Netflix will be making fat cash.\n\nAs for the stock?  Well, it's on sale right now.  You decide if you want to buy in.  I bought some after the big drops.  So far, it's actually been one of my best stocks with the best stability and return, out pacing the index.

Most other streaming services are also very linear in growth.\n\nNetflix had the highest subscriber numbers, basically double or more versus literally everything else on the market.  The only match was Prime which is also books, shipping, etc., a combined system of services, not just streaming.\n\nNetflix had a steeper growth rate than every other streaming service, still, short Disney+, and Prime is about even with Netflix for growth (but again a mix of services under that subscription umbrella).  Netflix is very much the king in this market segment by 2x or more versus EVERYTHING.\n\nRemember that linear growth?  Well, you can plot a trend line and check subscribers relative to that linear trend.  Well, funny thing.  Q4 2021 was unusually high.  Q1 2022 was light and in this case slightly negative.  This sounds bad because it's a first event, but there were numerous other quarters that were near zero, too, so this isn't even uncommon.  It's just that Q1 was slightly negative (-0.1%), and this was a first.  But...you compare Q1 against the linear growth trend and well...it's still above trend.\n\nAnd you can look at revenue and earnings per quarter too and graph this out.  You're looking at record revenue numbers through Q2 and near record earnings numbers Q2.

I think it was something anticipated by Netflix themselves???  And I know at least half of that was expected from the sanctions on Russia.

I have taken profit on all my energy stocks (bought in 2020 to early 2021) a few weeks ago. I think oil and gas have a very long term bullish path before them which Buffet also sees, but he is known to not care about timing.\n\nBear case for oil and energy stocks in the short term is currently: \n\nRate hikes and inflation pushing the economy into a recession. This destroys demand and the supply demand balance for oil is very very sensitive as both sides are fairly inelastic.\n\nRussia is still exporting an enormous amount of its sanctioned oil to mainly India and China, so its hard to even estimate how much the war is impacting supply. The total supply could barely be impacted if India and China now just have to buy less from the global market. \n\nPending Iran nuclear deal. Recently talks have been picking up again to lift the oil embargo set upon Iran which could add to global supply (then again, their sanctioned oil might have been hitting black markets all along just like russias is now, so this could be a non issue)\n\nMassive amounts of speculation into the sector. Very few people were positioned for higher oil prices and markets tend to overprice. Its hard to know how much of the current prices are held up by momentum traders and speculators vs long term investors. Adding to this, long term holders that were well positioned in the energy sector have started taking profits. Rebalancing factor portfolios also adds sell pressure as energy is the only thing that has done well this year. **Be very wary when everyone is bullish at the same time.** At any time, an end of the Russia Ukraine war could trigger a cascade of selling in energy stocks and completely reverse momentum.\n\nTo add to the last one: there have been record amounts of insiders selling in the energy space. They probably see the same as all the factors above, *or* they see a first opportunity in years to capitalise.\n\nOil and gas companies remain non ESG and thus attract a lot less capital currently that ESG compliant companies. Regardless of my or your disagreement with this, this means a lower earnings multiple will remain the case for these companies. Additionally, they remain highly cyclical stocks that many people consider on their last stretch.\n\nWindfall tax profits being discussed globally.

I think they went from 9% to 9.5% discount or something, which would resemble a 4.7% reduction of the 2030+ terminal value (1.095/1.09)\\^10 which still doesn't get $1300 all the way to $1200, but I suppose he wants to round down $1241, or he's also further discounting the profits leading up to 2030.\n\nIn maybe 2 years from now the 10y will be different, and the terminal value of TSLA will be 2 years closer which means you're going to make a different valuation based on the discount at that point. That means if you're willing to skip a few years ahead, the current 10y really isn't that meaningful. I guess he's trying to do it mathematically correct and all, but considering he's also quoting Q2 (which is completely irrelevant as it's like $1-$2 EPS difference which translates 1:1 with the stock price) it's clear he's looking at a much shorter timeline than some of the longs would.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Ok thanks, I have a better picture now. I started replying to this and it got longer and longer…sorry for the essay below.\n\nMy original reply was essentially saying when yields go up valuation goes down. I mentioned the 10-year yield changes as an example, but admittedly I was being lazy as I agree with you. Just looking at single point in time is worthless, you have to look at the whole yield curve when valuing and I was using the 10-year movement as a proxy for the whole yield curve movement. \n\nRegarding the two year shift, I think this is an awkward situation from Tesla being crazy growth. Yeah you can extend the time horizon by two years and discount by an extra two years, but the further out we project the more uncertain we are and really we should try and allow for that by trying to project over a time horizon we have reasonable certainty for. Otherwise you can just keep adding additional years and get an ever increasing price target if we think Tesla will keep growing at a rate faster than the discount rates applying on those extra years.\n\nIf the 2-year shifting example creates a scenario in your mind that makes you think interest rate changes are worthless and nothing more than noise, then I like to extend it to the long-term hypothetical to think about the impact of interest rates. In the hypothetical where we say, know Tesla’s next 200 years of earnings with absolute certainty, then adding the 201st years earnings makes little difference to the valuation; 1/((1.03)^201)= 0.25%. Only 0.25% of the value of earnings in the 201st year will actually influence the price target (present value of discounted cash flows). We can add as many extra years as we like but it’s really immaterial to present value figure. Theoretically this is the most accurate DCF we can create as we have all known earnings and cover all of time (or good enough). Now in this scenario if the yield curve moved up by 1% at all points, this will reduce the present value of discounted cash flows and shows that interest rates directly impact the valuation model.\n\nI suspect I am very much teaching my grandmother to suck eggs here, but just trying to explain my perspective clearly.\n\nTLDR: Overall I agree the whole yield curve needs to be considered, but the shifting two years scenario is more of a ‘quirk’ of Tesla’s high growth rate in my eyes. When we try and create the most accurate valuation by considering all time horizons then the quirk disappears and we can see that interest rate changes impact the valuation. You might say it’s stupid to consider two hundred years into the future and there’s no way we could know about, and that’s a fair retort.

If he's got bad news he just says it, and if he's got good news he just says it (without trying to make it more than it is).\n\nAnd this extends to his companies, they don't do PR, they don't send out a press release on Friday afternoon with bad news, they don't put out polished and practiced announcements. For a lot of presentations Musk just stands on stage and apparently says whatever comes to mind without ever having seen the slides beforehand? \n\nThis is completely unlike basically every other company, and most other people. We all tend to care *a lot* about how we come off, if what we're saying is being taken in the best possible light, etc. That's why we don't brag, we 'humble-brag' and why we avoid giving bad news and if we have to give bad news we sugar coat it. Musk basically never seems to care about putting a spin on things or sugar coating bad news. And if he's going to brag, he just brags, he doesn't try to pretend he isn't to look better.\n\nAnd it seems like this affects how his companies are run. People are judged more on results on whether they can impress their manager by looking good, or buttering up the right people, or being a bunch of 'yes-men', etc. Think about how much time and energy was spent at your job trying to look good, as opposed to just doing the work and assuming that good work would be rewarded?\n\nI know for me, that at my last company, it was all about appearances and making your department look good compared to everyone else. And even just for individuals, we were never busy 100% of the day (maybe 50% of the day on a good day) and so we spent a lot of time looking busy, or trying to pad our goals and performance reviews with extra bullshit to look good.\n\nMaybe Tesla (and SpaceX) are just really productive because people are rewarded for doing work and don't have the same incentives to spend all their time trying to *look* good and impress managers and VPs and directors?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla basically an autistic savant company", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "these people are full blown idiots\n\n\\-Tesla is groot geworden door een heleboel subsidies, goodwill \n\n\\-en niet te vergeten valse beloften (oa zelfstandig rijdende taxis) waarmee investeerders werden aangetrokken. \n\n\\-Ondertussen hebben ze serieuze concurrentie\n\n \\-dus het product Tesla is gewoon niet zo populair meer.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "-\"Elon verkoopt aandelen en nadat hij de prijs laat crashen koopt ie gewoon weer terug!\"\n\nLol i wish", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Ja, even if that was true. \n\nFUCK YEAH", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "If Elon fucked up twitter and bought 6 billion worth of Tesla I’d cork the Champaign", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[Yes we talked about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/vinkkd/tsla_daily_thread_june_23_2022/idevou9/)\n\nIt's fascinating. \nI sent the link to my father who is a recent TSLA hodler as an example of why we (informed people) have an edge vs the market.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry Corrie", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Eerst lezen dan pas posten kut! \n\n(grapje)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|bYk7T8YGe6Mo0)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "[https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/vinkkd/comment/idevou9/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/vinkkd/comment/idevou9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalready some discussion about it. fucking [nu.nl](https://nu.nl)", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can we report the false quote about bankruptcy to nu.nl?", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Buys a few shares with margin.

Instead, prices are going to level off and remain close to stagnant for 2 years. 2 years of stagnant house prices, with 9-10% inflation means home values will decrease about 20%. The housing market will \"crash\" in that sense, but prices won't go down and you still won't be able to afford a house.\n\nEdit: This is my own analysis based on market conditions and historical data of the housing market.
