The doom and gloom over interest rate increases might have been overblown.

Couple that with those terrible lending schemes being seen as a great investment the world over, and we have a problem. That's not really happening from what I have seen at a systemic level, as mortgages were in 2008.  We have certain asset classes taking a hit, but it's not as though the entire financial system, or even large quarters of it, are vested too deeply into any singular thing.\n\nIt will probably cool the economy a bit, and certain industries likely see less growth because of this, however less growth is not equivalent to losses. Bad businesses will no longer have the easy money tap to keep going, good businesses will have invested wisely and have a plan in place to get from under it.  Granted, the .75% interest rate increase is something that by all rights should have happened over the course of the last 1.5 years as it became apparent the economy wasn't in shambles post-COVID, but frankly it's just catching up to where I feel we *should* already be.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Granted we are in a housing bubble now in many areas at least, and monthly payments of absolutely balloons across the board.

When that last part didn't happen, things went south in a hurry.\n\nOn top of this, the MBS market was rife with absolute fraud to an astonishing degree at every level. People lying on their mortgage applications, lenders lying to borrowers, financial firms lying about what their assets actually were, rating agencies lying about the ratings, and the government lying about keeping all of this in check. The sheer systemic level of fraud behind 2008 is beautiful in a way as to how complete it was.\n\nProbably the most apt comparison right now is the crypto market. *Fortunately* the economy and world financial system isn't tied to the crypto market in the way it was to MBS. The real problem with 2008, and why it was so bad, is that practically everyone in the entire world believed the bullshit, in no small part due to decades of confirmation bias. Crypto hasn't gained that level of entrenchment. Frankly, I don't think any asset class has from what I have seen.\n\nGranted, people are going to be in for a world of hurt with their houses they bought last year.  Buying a 100-year old shit box with a failing foundation, walls coming apart, and a neighborhood best described as \"Detroit suburb\" for 10% over asking, which is 50% above where the property was two years ago, is a great way to lose money.

Everyone was invested almost entirely in MBS's, including banks. And those that weren't completely leveraged into MBS's were leveraged into MBS-based derivatives to the scale of a 20 to 1 ratio overall. You had banks that were funding their default swaps with mortgages backed Securities. That is just asinine, as the entire premise of investing in MBS was that mortgages wouldn't fall, and the entire purpose of default swaps is that you pay a premium *if* mortgage backed securities fail.  So when mortgage backed securities fail, you owe someone money, but your main investment and revenue source was those mortgage backed securities in the first place, *and no ody thought this was a problem*.\n\nOr put another way, the derivatives market was 20 times larger than the entirety of the mortgage market in 2008.

There is a push-pull going on between expected higher inflation and the extent of a recession that is most showing-up in that rate on a day-to-day basis. It is like a see-saw, which is why \"bad\" news can be \"good\" news. Greater possibility of a recession means less oil and other input demand, which means less pricing pressure. On balance I think the market is more concerned with higher inflation (as that has more of an impact over the long-term for stocks) so that is why you are seeing some of this action. With that said, the balance of the market could shift and surprisingly bad economic data (bigger recession happening earlier than expected) could make the market more concerned with a deeper recession over inflation.\n\nThis push-pull is also both driving and indicative of a lot of uncertainty which I think is leading to a lot of money being left on the sidelines. These last few days have largely been stable to down, implying that the market has priced in Fed / interest rate expectations for now and is waiting for the next datapoint. Investors now have a bit more certainty about the environment they are investing into (i.e. not a runaway 10-year rate to 4% right away) and that is why you are seeing some capital return.\n\nOverall, I think the stock market is reacting more quickly compared to prior high-inflation times (largely because of how clearly the Fed is communicating) so this reads as an oversold market finding the right price level for a couple weeks until the next economic data point.

To put things in perspective, a 30-second Super Bowl commercial cost $6.5 million to reach 112 million people. That's less than 6 cents per person. \n\nYoutube CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions) run from $4 to $10. That means 4/10th of a penny to 1 penny per ad view. \n\nNetflix's standard plan is $15.49 a month. If you figure they can get 2 cents per 30 second ad, then you'd have to watch about 775 30-second ads per month for them to break-even. Or about 6.5 hours. Assuming 15 minutes of commercials per hour, that's about 26 hours of Netflix a month. Which is super reasonable when you consider subscribers watch an average of 96 hours per month.\n\nExcept that 96 hours per month is likely inflated because an estimated 100 million leechers aren't counted in Netflix's official 222 million number. So that 96 hours could go down as Netflix tightens up their sharing rules. And when ppl naturally start watching less tv because of commercials.\n\nFrankly, I view the move as desperate.

Of course, in reality peak growth will take place in the preceding years and have already decreased below 50% by then.\n\nStill, since we need to be in mass-production in Q1 '27 at the latest in this super-optimistic scenario, that means low-volume production by summer 2026, meaning we need to start building in early 2025.

{"title": "Could these be the reasons for today's rally in the Stock Market?", "selftext": "Respected Traders and Investors,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry guys. I know my long posts are \"Awol\" right now but i promise you they are coming and they are going to be really big. So brace yourselves whenever they hit this week or next.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[June 15\\/16 bottom dilemma ?](https://preview.redd.it/py228ur0sl791.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab90ec9db4ac3319a23c764cc6431d86514c591a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for my previous long post you all know my stance. Post June 15 Fed meeting we rallied and we didn't predicted it this month. We predicted it since April when that March rally was kinda fading. But the following day we went down further on June 16 which shouldn't have happened because my levels are so high above that i just cannot be wrong. So i wrote that day the reason was the Swiss Bank surprise rate hike of 50 bps. Many new people who read the post thought hey this guy sounds condescending and thinks so highly of himself. Some just thought he is full of shit and needs approval of us. To be honest guys i am not that kind of person. I'm just a person who just lives in his mom basement because he thinks the world is coming to an end starting this q4 but before that a more stronger bear market rally than march is coming which will fuck those bears who thinks their puts are gonna print millions of dollars when market goes down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let's discuss what could be the reasons of market pump today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo things have happened today \n\n\\- We got Michigan data came out which in my opinion wasn't that bad. Here look it yourselves guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Michigan Data](https://preview.redd.it/t5qn90fbtl791.jpg?width=1075&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fff63476c216386e2182dee1ff626c227fbd5a98)\n\nThe key takeaways were the 5 year inflation expectations. It's coming down and also the 5 year break even on the technical charts are. Now these numbers could easily be cooked. Also the inflation expectations for June are low meaning when we see the June readings in July CPI it could go down significantly considering we will be measuring inflation with last yr June in July high CPI read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Now this what i'm about to tell you is very contradictory. Many people won't like the guy who told me this but hey he was right about Swiss Franc. It's called Geo-Political chart.  \n\n\n[Poland 10 year bonds vs Poland Stock Market](https://preview.redd.it/1qv526u8ul791.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a7b137eabdd8008ea67b1d3866afffa08cb1a08)\n\nSo i heard it on news that just maybe the Russia-Ukraine conflict is over. Look at the 10 year bonds. ( Bonds rarely lie in comparison to stocks ) The green candle is kinda anomaly since the war rumor started ( Green line ) and you could also look at the point when the war really started. ( red line ) You can also observe the breakout in the relative strength index on weekly time frame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll these in my opinion is working out quite nicely for us heading into next month data we will be focusing on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- July 13 CPI : Which should come lower as discussed above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- July 28 GDP : Positive we go up , Negative ahh i'm not really sure. Could be we have priced it in or could be we should fall because things are not looking good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- July 26-27 Fed meeting : Right now i don't wanna comment about this because i'm ashamed of what happened last time. I couldn't write the post about the changes JP Morgan did at last moment and had to tweet about it. Many people didn't read it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo guys like i always say keep enjoying and have a good time. The US economy doesn't look so good. Even the people in \"All in Podcast\"  ( Do watch the episode guys. It's GOAT finance podcast ) kinda agrees with me because of this data below. This situation if you do remember is kinda like the time of S&P and Moody refusing to lower the credit ratings on mortgage bonds. ( Blind lady from Big short )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Once this goes down. Boooooom](https://preview.redd.it/aj36i7hdwl791.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=5720b40e91a17dd4857a2ae49adead1ae3a0aefd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso if you do remember guys i have been bullish on Chinese stocks like NIO ( up 40% since my $100 portfolio. Reason : George Soros ) and BABA ( up 20% ) since the start of my Wall Street letter series. If you want more proof here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$3.86 on May 27 went to $86.55. That's 22x this year. Kinda like GME 2022 for institutions.

They are up 30% right now. So please don't sell them. SEC can track you down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all i have to say for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a fabulous evening after work guys.

So we get upswings generating from short squeezes and which  eventually fades fast enough because unless there is a underlying changes in some data these kind of rally hence eventually fades away.\n\nIf you read my previous wall street newsletter you will come to know that this is the 2nd bear market rally that i have been predicting since april 2022 when remember that march +20% rally started fading.

I know the charts say one thing but stagflation may be much different this time around with so many reasonably comfortable and able to absorb the shock.  \n\nEquity destruction will not mean jingle mail this time on the scale we saw before.  The MBS and risk assessment of those pools may cause a synthetic default like when the mark to market rule change caused so many margin calls in 08.\n\nThe wealth gap has increased to such a level that housing may crumble but the pieces will be picked up much sooner creating a floor.

I think their models would include balancing this pain for that.

You see powell dec fed minutes were your first sign of rugpull. He kinda spoke about QT and tapering etc. It was the worst report since 2008 minutes. I remember then we got a hawkish powell on fomc after renomination who was comitted to fighting inflation because it was being politcized. That was a sign right there we are going for a bear market. Meaning your stocks wont do anything for 1yr. Coz its the average for bear mkt and the situation isnt like 2020 where you could have V recovery becoz of QE. So hence we didnt get santa claus rally. (Your 2nd warning sign) Also puts piled up so much before March 16 Fomc after wage price inflation in January (3rd warning) that it was kinda expected it was gonna be sell the rumor 50bps but buy 25bps. So hence we went up for bear market rally and stopped around the highest band of ema ( 89,144,233) and MA( 100,200) . So fundamentals down also technicals highest bullish pt you could have gone for bear mkt rally in NDX SPX.\n\nNow coming to your second pt. How is July CPI read calculated? Well you see they take your first week , second week , third week , fourth week june reading of cpi components and average it down. So suppose oil was 90,100,110,120 in 4 weeks. You oil will be 420/4 = $105. Thats a Fed scam right there but thats how cpi is calculated. Now there is a owners equivalent rent scam which i wont dive in here but it will continue to go up as yr end arrives. Now what do we know in June. Well when Fed hiked in june 2nd week commodities fell as calculated by me technically in WS : 7. So youre starting to see why this cpi read could be lower. The only one thing that can happen out of anomaly is owners equ rent as it constitutes most part of cpi. Oil energy food are also coming down so dont worry there. And the next most imp pot we will be comparing read to June in July highest 5.4% inflation. So in respect to that June in July read should be low. May report in June was anomaly hence Fed raised 75bps. No one was expecting it. Also now Michigan have confirmed inflation exp are coming down for June. Thats your bonus right there. As for your concern about summer demand. No dude. Your concern should be winter when Oil goes $140-150. Not this $100-120 oil. Also china reopening is kinda good for supply chain issues problems but bad for oil as demand for oil will increase. So im not including that.\n\nNow that swiss thing and my sources for that. Sorry to break it to you but i dont have any proof because the proof is on 13F which we cant see rn. Its just a theory think about it. You want your currency to be stronger even more than dollar. What will you do ? Fed is doing rate hikes + cmon you know the answer say it reducing their balance sheet. Now what will swiss franc do to go stronger than dollar. Surprise surprise 50bps hike + say it reduce balance sheet. Meaning sell your positions in tesla,microsoft,google,apple etc. Hence we saw these big tech selling that day. All credit goes to the good guy sitting on right side of cramer.\n\nYoure not an idiot dude. Asking questions in class is ik kinda a geeky thing and you lose pts getting hot chicks but irl if you dont ask questions you will be left behind.

Your point as I understand it is although the books are cooked as everyone knows will get the print you estimated in your calculations.\n\nThat brings up an interesting point.  I read in the scmp about the inflation print in China and the differences in how they calculate personal expenditures and CPI with very different weighting.  I think with your ability to do the maths you could find something really good there in short order in terms of sectors.\n\nWhen the 13F is available then it will be interesting to see what happens.\n\nI think we're headed for $130 oil in the near term.  That may be a guess but when leadership is faulting them for output during a summer blend change at the same time as stopping the cap on ethanol which is a formulation change that takes 4 weeks  to come through best case.  At least that's what is taught in school for refining plant operations.  The summer season and the strategic reserve having roughly 500 million barrels left we're going to see a lot of upward pressure. There was a Reuters article on May 16 saying 538 and the June 17 inventories at 504ish.  It was about 640 not long ago.  We are shipping a lot to Europe\n\n[http://www.spr.doe.gov/dir/dir.html](http://www.spr.doe.gov/dir/dir.html)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-strategic-petroleum-reserve-drops-lowest-level-since-1987-2022-05-16/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-strategic-petroleum-reserve-drops-lowest-level-since-1987-2022-05-16/)\n\nSure you probably saw these.\n\nThanks for your help.

Il its boring and i suck at english and grammar. So bear with me.\n\nI'm not confirming my credibility i just pt things because sometimes people dont know where i pointed that out. Its important to know why i highlighted it there. And not before. And how i actually reached to a certain conclusion. Remember all charts have a story to tell. If you can understand the story the bonds, stocks, repo mkt, fx swap mkt are trying to communicate not on 4hr or daily chart technicals but on weekly and monthly lvls then predicting directions are so easy.\n\nAs for your first questions yes inflation print will be front loaded we have established idk some WS newletter that the crashes have a story to tell. there are two crashes.crashes in rate hike cycle and crashes in rate cut cycle. Since 80s bond yields have been on lower low hence most of the crashes are in rate cut cycle. And before 80s when bond yields used to make HH with HL crashes used to be in rate hike cycle. So if bonds are really gonna go for HH and HL for next 40yr as it should because 40yr bond cycle has ended then crash should be in rate hike and mot liftoff. Now there are few exceptions to this but wht i think is gonna happen if we are gonna get paul volcekered. There is just no way out if you want inflation under 2%.But if you wanna go like Japanese style sure go yield control supress bonds to -ve rates and just hyperinflate the dollar like yen. And expect CBDCs to absorb like your petro dollar do to Oil.\n\nAs to your second pt. It will be houaing crash that crash equity. Yes but MBS are diff these time around. They arent fillled with catshit wrapped in dog shit this time around. But whats gonna happen is when we get paul volckered or these slow gradual pain then due to philips curve unemployment will go up. Meaning people wont be able to pay mortgages monthly payments. And have to sell house. So bonds is losing value and now Fed also have to sell MBS to reduce balance sheet so they sell more and put more pressure on MBS to default. So this 2022 is worse than 2008 because this bubble is combination of dotcom bubble + housing bubble + voldemort bubble.\n\nNow as to your question that housing will be picked up by wealthy aa wealth gap has increased. Well you see celebrity are going to get broke and influencers of yt instagram fb are about to come on streets. Its all because of advertizing downhill disaster. So maybe hey you will see them working at mcdonals pizza hut etc to increase the participation rate in jobs report. Also you need to understand most of europe and usa is a debt model and based on refinancing. Suppose your athelete what you do is spend your money first then sign contract. But wht if you spend more and then your contract get cut in half. You have debt burden pilimg up.So those celebritity who are careless  and have a sh9t finance guru. The real gurus must be 40+ because if less than that you havent seen the real bear market and noone financial expert has even existed for 1939 fed engineered depression let alone 1921 forgotten and 1929 great depression.\n\nAs for my ABC correction i didnt used rsi.I used stoch rsi + pvto. maybe bruh i could be wrong.I'm not a god or have a time machine in my backyard.\n\nAs for derivatives concern like 2008 you might wanna look at something called CMBS loans. Some guy posted its the modern day CDOs of 2008. i'm not gonna read thousand of pages of mortgages again lie 2008. So sorry. i will simply buy Cds or short or buy leveraged bear realestate etf.\n\nNow as for you trying to replace stagflation and go for De-inflation. You might wanna patent that. Coz i think we are entering a world where commodities will be highly priced for Usa people coz i believe dollar will weaken and due to strong Reminem by Zoltan :) BW3. And then we could have a hyperinflationary world in usa. Just like japan but the wages will also be up to meet those high prices. Basically dollar devaluation is coming and debasement hedges will go up. So ____ has a place in this world. But its not deflation or inflation its hyperinflation.\n\nAs for GDP multiplier moving in direction of rates. Idk man. Dont wanna comment there. But i think dollar is done. Just do the changing world order now and lets all go to China or Hong kong together.🤣 \n\nThats all i have to say. Had a good discussion. I think om drunk. Gn. Have a nice day.
