The Tesla CEO also said this is contradictory to Gates' desire to fight climate change and that he should be supporting Tesla's electric vehicle development.\n\nIn an interview with a French YouTube channel \"Hugo Decrypte\" that was aired on Thursday, Gates was asked if Musk is right in taking such a stance.\n\nGates responded by saying. Tesla isn't short of capital, and the company has done a \"fantastic job.\" He also said the company's cars are great.\n\nThe Microsoft Corporation founder noted that he gives a lot more money to efforts addressing climate change than Musk or anyone else for that matter.\n\nGates pointed out that cars account for only 16% of emissions, and the other 84% also needs to be solved. Although he acknowledged that Musk has \"done a great job.\" \n\n\"Somebody shorting his stock doesn't slow him down or hurt him in any way,\" Gates added.\n\nAs recently as late last month, Musk in a Twitter chat with his followers said Gates' Tesla short bet may have ballooned, and the latter would need about $1.5 billion to $2 billion to cover the short position.'\n\nSource: benzinga.com/news/22/06/27556119/bill-gates-explains-why-his-tesla-short-position-shouldnt-hurt-elon-musk", "id": "v547ko", "created_utc": 1654397245.0, "score": 455, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 339, "comments": [{"body": "‚ÄúNothing personal.

Which would you choose to obtain? Obviously, you‚Äôd choose the chair. That‚Äôs because there are many types of chair, produced by scores of different companies and widely distributed. You could buy a $15 folding chair or a $1,000 antique without the slightest difficulty. By contrast, to obtain an X-ray you‚Äôd have to work with your insurance company, wait for an appointment, and then haggle over price. Why? Because the medical market is far more regulated ‚Äî thanks to the widespread perception that health care is a ‚Äúright‚Äù ‚Äî than the chair market. Does that sound soulless? True soullessness is depriving people of the choices they require because you‚Äôre more interested in patting yourself on the back by inventing rights than by incentivizing the creation of goods and services. In health care, we could use a lot less virtue signaling and a lot less government. Or we could just read Senator Sanders‚Äôs tweets while we wait in line for a government-sponsored surgery ‚Äî dying, presumably, in a decrepit chair.\n\n\n*****\n\n^(I'm a bot.

With the stock market fluctuating or even having a downturn and with inflation and even cryptocurrencies having taken a dive, I Bonds are a wonderful opportunity. \n\nThe Treasury Department says the following about I Bonds.\n\n\"I Bonds can be purchased through October 2022 at the current rate.  That rate is applied to the 6 months after the purchase is made.  For example, if you buy an I bond on July 1, 2022, the 9.62% would be applied through December 31, 2022.  Interest is compounded semi-annually.\n\nA Series I savings bond is a security that earns interest based on both a fixed rate and a rate that is set twice a year based on inflation. The bond earns interest until it reaches 30 years or you cash it, whichever comes first.\n\nFor the first six months you own it, the Series I bond we sell from May 2022 through October 2022 earns interest at an annual rate of 9.62 percent. A new rate will be set every six months based on this bond's fixed rate (0.00 percent) and on inflation.\n\nIn a calendar year, you can acquire:\n\nup to $10,000 in electronic I bonds in TreasuryDirect\n\nup to $5,000 in paper I bonds using your federal income tax refund\n\nThe limits apply separately, meaning you could acquire up to $15,000 in I bonds in a calendar year\"\n\nRead about them at: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res\\_ibonds\\_ibuy.htm](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ibuy.htm)\n\nThis is my new best advice for investors under the current circumstances.", "id": "v5e3p7", "created_utc": 1654438125.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 168, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 77, "replies": [{"body": "If the government gets to the point that it can't  pay the dividends on our bonds, we have much more important things to worry about than the risk of our bonds.", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "So you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a chance!\n\n-Lloyd Christmas", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Actually, much more than a chance.

Thanks to u/Ok-Researcher-120 u/throwawayyeetyyeet for the comments. Although it didn't feel like I was at WSB with that quality advice...\n\nI also listened to u/arpatel530 and sold some OTM covered calls during earnings when the premium spiked. Thanks to IV crush, I made a very nice return selling those calls and just bought more shares. But now the premium isn't worth getting called away at the moment. Especially with the 3-4% volatility we can see in one day. I can easily see a scenario where INTC goes up 15% in a week. The premium on options that OTM isn't worth the effort. So I don't think the risk of covered calls (missing out on higher upside above my strike) are currently worth it as I don't want to be stepping over dollars by chasing pennies.\n\nMy thesis on my INTC investment has not changed in the past 8 weeks (as I said in my last post):  \"I am long due to the good fundamentals of INTC (very cheap PE, low debt, high revenue, large market share, great moat, decent profit margins). I am optimistic of their new leadership and the overall market. I believe that the negative sentiment against the company and semiconductor market is too much and is creating a good entry point for a long term play in this very profitable company. I think they can pay for their extensive and expensive upcoming CAPEX (building new fabs) out of free cash flow and spin offs with minimum new debt. I also get a decent 3+% dividend while I wait. The company, in my opinion, has a very limited downside (I don't think it can break below $40-44) and a 3-4x upside ($140-185) by 2025.  If INTC multiple expands to anywhere near TSMC, it wil be a nice increase in share price for INTC. TSMC's PE is 2.5x INTC. Many fab-less players (AMD, NVDA) will diversify their manufacturing for competitive pricing and lower their geopolitical risks (great for INTC). These fabless chip designers (NVDA, AMD, Apple, Google, AMZN, etc) only have TSMC, INTC, and Samsung to choose from. ASML is the king maker in this market and INTC will get ASML latest litho machines for their sub 20A chips in the upcoming years (1H 2024). This will allow INTC to be the most advanced chip designer once again.\"\n\nI got down voted a lot by AMD investors, but don't know why they can't understand this isn't exactly a zero sum game. The entire industry is expanding and most chip companies can also grow. Just like you can have multiple car companies (Tesla, Ford, GM, VW, TM), you can have multiple chip companies. Although I think AMD is priced for perfection and INTC is currently priced for worst case scenario. Furthermore, INTC also manufactures chips and I can see a future where AMD contracts work to INTC. AMD doesn't own fabs, so they can have a mutually beneficial relationship. But all the hate against INTC is good for those of us that want to pick up on a company that has bad sentiment but decent books and long-term projections. Ultimately, I feel this is a safe place to park money for 3-5 years (INTC only has a beta of 0.60), and in my opinion, limited down side (-20%) and great upside (400%).\n\nI also get to collect more than $16.2k/year (3.2% at $1.46 share) in dividends from this investment while I wait to see what Pat can do. I already got my first dividend payment of almost $4k this week and bought more shares.\n\nI was down $15k 8 weeks ago. Since then, I was down over $100k around the end of May when INTC hit its all time low of $40.31. I was down massively due to some ill-timed LEAP options that I bought trying to time the bottom. I was at least degen enough to buy some even more FD options and caught the mean reversion and gained on the upside. I didn't hold the FD options long to be greedy and sold as soon as I was able to get a little higher share count than I previously held. I am now down $36k, but that is only 7% and in this market, I am happy with that.

It usually goes up for a few days after the large earnings drop, but then breaks through the low. \n\nBut I had a set of criteria and I try to remove emotion.

It might be look out below if it breaks 35 as I am not sure where the next support is, probably around book value of 25-28. I really have a hard time thinking it will get that low, but I also didn't think it would get to 35.\n\nIn the week I have been out of INTC, I made a nice profit day trading Citigroup options, mostly luck as the price stayed the same for the week, but I was able to buy in the mornings when C crashed about 30 minutes after open and sell in the afternoon almost every day. I still like C and am keeping a position in them with other funds.\n\nRegarding INTC, I did a little more research and dived into their 10Q and once the emotion impulse wore off from the terrible earnings, I decided that I should continue to stay invested. I'm partially thinking Intel sandbagged their earnings due to them at the same time asking for billions in tax payer money. I think they might have pushed some profits into next quarter while recording expenses early. Make no mistake, the quarter still sucked. But Pat said this was the bottom, so I have decided to stick it out a little longer to see if it is, or if he makes another excuse. If next quarter doesn't improve and he lied about this being the bottom for his earnings, then I am out. But I will give him credit of pushing through the CHIPS act. Very impressive in this Congress and lots of money to mostly INTC. So that is definitely a win and I will excuse him if he neglected the company while he was getting congress to give us some tax payer billions. One thing that gives me confidence is that even with the macro stuff, the balance sheet of INTC is really phenomenal. Almost irrelevant debt, decent cash position, and decent cash flow (ignoring some one time charge offs). They have doubled book value per shared in the past 7 years. Even this past 12 months, they have significantly increased it. This has caused an all time low on the book value/share price ratio. I am still really concerned about the decline in revenues, and the really bad rumors of them potentially canceling or delaying a lot of chips (eg Arc). But I will still take Pat at his word where he said that all the other nodes are on schedule or ahead of schedule.

You are cherry-picking random measurements of consumer costs, which may be interesting on their own but they don't tell you much about the macroeconomic environment.\n\nHigh inflation is bad because it leads to wage-price spirals, and devaluation of the currency, and the only way to slay that dragon is to make it significantly more expensive for corporations and individuals to borrow money by raising the federal funds rate. That rate generally sets the borrowing rates across the economy. When it rises you will see bond yields increase, mortgage rates increase, but also credit cards and car loans, even student loans. The Fed can also *destroy* money in addition to creating it out of thin air, which is what they are set to start doing on June 15th. All of this combined has the effect of sucking money out of the economy. It will feel like people have less money in their pockets, and this is by design. It is the only way known by economists to force inflation back down to their 2% target.\n\nThe problem is that doing so will also make the government pay higher yields to service the debt -- and we have a lot more debt since the politicians started printing trillions of dollars in 2020. It's like the government's credit card rate is about to jump from 10% to 20%. To make the minimum monthly payment you need more cash. The recent administrations have gotten used to the idea of just adding to the debt and screwing with monetary policy to make it cheap. Basically we have been charging everything to the credit card without any plan for how we are going to pay it off. Tax revenues are up significantly this year due to inflation but if they have to keep rates ultra-high for years -- entirely possible -- this would but pressure to raise taxes to increase revenue to service the debt.\n\nThe Fed has gotten lazy and complacent, by responding to every crisis by dropping the federal funds rate to zero -- negative in real terms. That has the effect of injecting a ton of cash into the economy. It also made the housing market insane because there was already a ton of pent up demand and we didn't need the stimulus. Now they realize they messed up and are trying to undo this enormous mistake. You can blame Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen, who will probably go down in history as the two worst that the Fed ever had.

The US unemployment rate, which has recently improved the most in its history by falling to 3.6% ‚Äî almost the lowest level in five decades ‚Äî from a 2020 high of 14.7% is poised to reach 3.5% in the third quarter and remain low for several years. That would make the US the second-lowest in joblessness among the G-7 nations after Japan, according 50 economist forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n> Additionally, the economists put the probability of a recession at 30%, up from 15% at the end of January but not historically remarkable.\n\n> To be sure, no one knows how and when two of the biggest contributors to inflation ‚Äî supply chain disruptions and commodities shortages aggravated by China‚Äôs economy-pinching Covid Zero strategy and Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine ‚Äî will end.\n> \n> Other assumptions obscure why economists are sticking with their forecasts. When the difference in yield between 10-year and 2-year Treasury securities turned negative in March, commentators immediately predicted recession because all six downturns since 1980 came after a negative or inverted yield curve. The same commentators were largely silent when the yield curve turned positive earlier this month by more than 0.2 percentage point.\n> \n> At the same time, inflation-mongering took a respite when the Consumer Price Index dropped to 8.3% last month from 8.5% in March while the Fed‚Äôs preferred PCE inflation gauge fell to 5.18% from 5.31%. The median forecast of 69 economists puts the CPI at an average of 7% this year before it declines to 3% in 2023 and 2.4% in 2024.\n> \n> The risk of recession is surely real, but so is the absence of several historical red flags. The US deficit-to-GDP ratio had declined to 4.9% in April from 18.6% in March 2021, only 0.1 percentage point wider than the pre-pandemic level and 1.6 percentage points wider than the average over five decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the performance of 10 major currencies versus the U.S. dollar, appreciated to a level that is 14% higher than the average since 2015 when the index began.\n> \n> For all the anxiety about financial markets, US borrowing costs ‚Äî including federal, state and local governments as well as American companies ‚Äî are the lowest since 1975, when such data became available, according to the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index. Even after yields climbed 2 percentage points from the low, debt financing still is 2.8 percentage points lower than the 47-year average of 6.3%.\n> \n> Bloomberg Chief Economist Tom Orlik and his colleague Anna Wong, Bloomberg's US economist, share their peers‚Äô equanimity about inflation and growth. They attribute the optimism-pessimism gap to a lack of experience with anything comparable in recent memory.\n> \n> ‚ÄúYou really have to go back to the Spanish Flu in 1918 or Bubonic Plague in the Middle Ages,‚Äù for a perspective that informs the current situation, Wong said.\n> \n> Orlik put it this way: ‚ÄúThere's no kind of historical relationship of anything in the historical data which tells you how Russia invading Ukraine is going to impact. You can't really look to history for lessons on how China's lockdowns in response to omicron are going to impact.‚Äù\n> \n> As a result, he said, ‚ÄúIt's always more interesting to talk about the risk scenario, especially when the risk scenario is kind of sexy like a recession, rather than a base case of everything being OK.‚Äù\n\nFrom May 18, though nothing significant for the worse has happened since then: \n\nhttps://www.capitaleconomics.com/clients/publications/us-economics/us-chart-book\n\n> **The strength of the hard activity data for April refutes the recent message from financial markets that the economy is at risk of imminent recession**. The solid gain in control group retail sales, together with upward revisions to past months leaves the underlying trend in consumer spending looking much stronger. Meanwhile the continued rebound in manufacturing output, in particular the recovery in vehicle output to the pre-pandemic level, illustrates how the gradual easing of supply shortages is supporting a rebound in production. With signs that core inflation is still running far too hot, the continued strength of economic activity supports the Fed‚Äôs decision to press ahead with 50bp rate hikes at the next couple of FOMC meetings. Nevertheless, we still expect a drop back in inflation later this year, alongside signs of a slowdown in economic activity will prompt the FOMC to shift back to 25bp hikes by the fall.\n\nRecession definition: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession\n\n> In the United States, it is defined as \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the market, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales\".\n\nQuick comparison of previous recessions: \n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/past-recessions.asp", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Nice!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol Bloomberg \n\nDude, hose aren‚Äôt added jobs.

Bc uhh‚Ä¶.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Basically, shares are ownership in a company. If there are 100 total shares in existence, then owning 1 share means you own 1% of the company. This is essentially like if you started a business with 99 friends and each gave yourselves 1% ownership. The stock market, is just where you buy and sell ownership of companies. Buying a stock on the stock market is you buying ownership of a company the same way you can buy ownership of a small business in your town. That is just on a much larger scale where instead of owning 1% of the company, you own ~0.0001% of the company by buying 1 share. \n\nJust like when you buy a stake in your local corner store, buying a stock entitles you to a portion of the company's profits. So if there are 100 shares and the company made 1 million dollars last year, every share is entitled to $10,000 in profit (this is a dividends). This is assuming that the owners want to take the money and not reinvest it to make more money, or buy back the shares of people who want to leave the business to give everyone a larger stake (this is a share buyback) and entitle them to more profits in the future. \n\nNow, when you are buying a share of a company on the stock exchange, you are buying ownership and those future profits. If you divide the total profits of the company by the number of shares in circulation, this will give you a number for how much money each share makes. In our previous example, that would be $10,000 per share. However, since the shares have a bid and are bought and sold based on the price the market agrees on, that means you need to go further with the math. \n\nSay this same store we were talking about has each of its share trade for $50,000. Divide the price you paid by the profit that your share is entitled to will give you a Price per earning or PE ratio. In this case 50k divided by 10k equals 5. So this company has a PE of 5. So you need to pay $5 for every $1 of yearly profits you are buying. There are a bunch of equations out there, but for simplicity, if you are paying $5 and making $1 every year, you will break even in 5 years. This is assuming 0 growth, which there very much might be. If the company's profits go to 2 million and you suddenly make 20k per share, then you made your money back faster than expected. The same thing happens in reverse if the company does poorly. \n\nYou can also do this for the entire stock market (in this case the S&P 500) to find the average PE ratio of the S&P. Currently it is ~20 meaning you need to spend $20 to buy $1 of yearly profit. This is about where it was pre pandemic after peaking at like $35 and falling back to $20 in the last 6 months. \n\nWhat OP was showing was the Shiller PE ratio which is a way to calculate what PE should be given inflation and time. The idea is that long term, the Shiller PE ratio should always trend back to $15. However, this statistic hasn't worked in 30 years. It used to work, but somehow it stopped making sense. Maybe it is because we had historically low inflation for the past 30 years, or maybe the dot com and 2009 crashes caused it to break, we don't know. It just puts out numbers that aren't helpful. Like, right now the Shiller PE ratio has said we were due for a 1929 crash continually since 1995.

The value of a commodity, therefore, varies directly as the quantity, and inversely as the productiveness, of the labour incorporated in it. [A]\n\nA thing can be a use value, without having value. This is the case whenever its utility to man is not due to labour. Such are air, virgin soil, natural meadows, &c. A thing can be useful, and the product of human labour, without being a commodity. Whoever directly satisfies his wants with the produce of his own labour, creates, indeed, use values, but not commodities. In order to produce the latter, he must not only produce use values, but use values for others, social use values. (And not only for others, without more. The mediaeval peasant produced quit-rent-corn for his feudal lord and tithe-corn for his parson. But neither the quit-rent-corn nor the tithe-corn became commodities by reason of the fact that they had been produced for others. To become a commodity a product must be transferred to another, whom it will serve as a use value, by means of an exchange.)[12] Lastly nothing can have value, without being an object of utility. If the thing is useless, so is the labour contained in it; the labour does not count as labour, and therefore creates no value.\"", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[This skit actually did a good job explaining things for me](https://youtu.be/U_SVexaSMwk)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Im spending mine at the strip club", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Stuffing a 20 dollar bill into a g-string keeps money local and is better for the economy than a 401k.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "As long as it ain't sitting in your bank account for years or going overseas to invest in property or some static shit, I ain't got a problem how you spend it", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I think the issue with that is that all this cheap money created a ton of companies that shouldn't exist, so the people that work at those places are going to be out of work regardless when that money dries up.

At first glance this means little to consumers but to businesses it means budget cuts, hiring freezes, and layoffs to stay afloat. This leads to pressuring average consumers to think outside of the box to stay afloat too. This is when many folks and even some funds feel forced to withdraw their market holdings -purely to survive. This is how recessions make their mark on the markets. The closer we fall to the bottom the more the wealthy strengthen their positions but since the average folks are already struggling by then the markets continue to decline. It‚Äôs when good news (stabilized gdp, leveled interest rates, solid earnings reports, etc.) begins to break more frequently that we‚Äôll begin rising steadily again. The likelihood of that all happening this year is very slim though. My guess is we‚Äôll gradually begin climbing back up in a year or two and then get back to our previous highs a few years after that.
